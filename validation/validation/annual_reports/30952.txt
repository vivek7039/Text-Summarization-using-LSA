At a Glance
Background
EKF Diagnostics is a global medical diagnostics business with a long history in point-of-care testing 
and manufacturing reagents for use in central laboratories.
Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in Germany, 
have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working 
in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine.
The POC business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a 
regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. In 2017 we sold an estimated 
70 million tests. This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a 
percentage of organic growth each year.
The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured 
at premises near San Antonio, Texas. Clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel 
systems or on EKF’s own brand of analysers. 
EKF Life Sciences, based in Elkhart, Indiana, manufactures diagnostic enzymes and contracted 
custom products for use in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and industry.

Point-of-Care: Hemoglobin Analysers
Product Portfolio
The hemoglobin analysers product range within EKF Diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues 
and the size of the installed base. 
The acquisition of DiaSpect and Separation T echnology in 2014 allowed EKF to offer an unparalleled 
range of hemoglobin and hematocrit Point of Care blood analysers manufactured in Germany and 
the USA.
Strategy
The EKF Diagnostics portfolio of hemoglobin and hematocrit analysers is unique within the Point 
of Care diagnostics sector. 
Sales are primarily focused around two markets – public health initiatives such as anaemia screening 
programmes, and private practices where the cost of testing is paid for by an insurance company 
or the patient.
To approach these markets EKF has two distinct strategies: firstly, OEM partnerships with 
international distributor/manufacturers such as Fresenius Kabi; and secondly agreements with 
smaller distributors who are focused on the public health opportunities within their own countries.
Sports medicine and veterinary medicine provide two additional niche sources of customer for 
EKF distributors. 
EKF believes that this portfolio can provide it with a competitive advantage to grow its market 
share.
In  2017 EKF sold more than 22 million tests for the DiaSpect Tm range, and 19 million tests for 
Hemo Control and HemoPoint® H2

1.0 Strategic Review
Point-of-Care: Diabetes Care
Product Portfolio
EKF’s Diabetes Care range aims to provide affordable, easy-to-use technology that reduces the 
costs of long-term healthcare of the diabetic and pre-diabetic population.
Diabetes has been at the core of EKF’s strategy for well over 10 years starting with the early models 
of the Biosen C-Line and Biosen S-Line glucose analysers. More recently HbA1c analysers have 
been launched that address the diabetes screening market.
Although they do not strictly belong within a point-of-care framework, clinical chemistry reagents 
such as Glycated Serum Protein and Beta- Hydroxybutyrate add further provenance to EKF’s claim 
to be a significant contributor to diabetes care worldwide.
Strategy
Although glucose testing is the most commonly used method of determining glycaemic control 
within diabetics, HbA1c is the accepted long term barometer of patient wellbeing and their 
compliance with the treatment regimes.
The growth in popularity of HbA1c measurement has seen an increasing number of entrants to the 
point-of-care HbA1c market focused on GP surgeries and diabetes clinics.
Since transferring manufacturing from the UK to Germany EKF has engaged in programmes 
to automate the production of cartridges to increase capacity and improve quality. In addition, 
these changes have allowed EKF Diagnostics to make significant operational savings through the 
centralisation of manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, and customer service.
Biosen

Point-of-Care: Maternal & Women’s Health
Product Portfolio
Maternal and Women’s Health focuses primarily on diagnostics used to address conditions and 
complications associated with pregnancy and child birth.
Sales include revenues from Creamatocrit centrifuges and hemoglobin meters used in Women and 
Infant Clinics, pregnancy test kits and HbA1c analysers used to diagnose gestational diabetes in 
pregnant women.
Strategy
EKF’s Maternal and Women’s Health business unit has seen steady growth since it was created.
SensPoint is awaiting CE marking whilst the product team continue to work with key opinion 
leaders to educate the future target market on the need for a protocol in the use of lactate in 
obstetric medicine.
In parallel there is a slowly building commercial interest in this market in Europe. Some medical 
professionals are using the Lactate Scout+ to provide accurate lactate readings within ten seconds.
Lactate Scout+ uses the same strip system as SensPoint but does not include SensPoint’s data 
management functionality.
Lactate Scout+ has historically been sold into sports medicine, specifically endurance activities 
such as cross-country skiing, cycling and rowing. This market also contributes significantly to 
Biosen revenues in which the lactate testing function is used in the preparation of elite squads of 
athletes such as Premier League and Budesliga football teams and Olympians.

1.0 Strategic Review
Central Laboratory
Product Portfolio
EKF, through its wholly owned subsidiary Stanbio Laboratory, has had a presence within central 
laboratory dating back over 50 years. During this time it has built a global customer base for its 
clinical chemistry reagents that can be used on most open-channel analyser platforms.
The Central Laboratory business also includes the manufacture of enzymes, produced at EKF Life 
Sciences in Elkhart, Indiana. 
From this facility EKF Life Sciences sells enzymes used in Stanbio’s clinical chemistry portfolio 
as well as providing contract manufacturing services for enzymes and proteins used in industrial 
applications. These are then sold in bulk or used in the production of in-vitro diagnostic devices 
(IVDs).
The acquisition of Separation Technology Inc. provided EKF with a third element to its central 
laboratory offering. As well as being a manufacturer of hematology products STI has a heritage in 
manufacturing high quality, US-built, mini-centrifuges.
Strategy
The central laboratory market continues to experience relatively low levels of growth. This is in part 
because sales of chemistry reagents are often linked to the provision of the analysers on which the 
tests are performed. EKF Diagnostics’ approach to the clinical chemistry market changed in late 
2015 with the launch of the Altair 240, a benchtop analyser calibrated to run the Stanbio Chemistry 
range of reagents.
Further opportunities continue to exist in niche markets. Sales of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Liquicolor 
reagent continue to be healthy with a strong performance from US distributors who have developed 
a market capitalising on the withdrawal of a previous method of testing for ketosis.
More than 1,000 US hospitals now use EKF’s Beta-Hydroxybutyrate reagent. A similar approach is 
being used for Procalcitonin (PCT) in Europe where EKF has undertaken awareness activity using 
key opinion leaders in target markets.

Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to present results which show 
continued good progress with revenues, 
earnings, and net cash all significantly improved 
compared with the previous year. 
Strategy
The Group has continued to follow the path 
which led to the successful turnaround of 
the business in 2016, namely concentrating 
its activities on point-of-care diagnostics 
and the related central laboratory reagents 
business, while reducing costs and simplifying 
the business. In the first half, we closed our 
manufacturing site in Poland and transferred 
activities to our main European hub in Barleben, 
Germany. This led to a small number of 
redundancies, and we thank those affected and 
wish them well for the future. As a result, the 
number of sites used by the Group has reduced 
from a peak of twelve to seven, of which four 
are in Europe, two in the USA and one in China. 
While we are not currently planning further 
closures, our efforts to improve efficiency and 
therefore reduce costs continue.
After considerable deliberation and discussion 
with our professional advisors, we were unable 
to proceed with our plan to split out the central 
laboratory business in a tax efficient manner.
sTNFR venture
Subsequent to the year end, on 11 January 
2018 the Group announced its intention to 
spin-out its sTNFR biomarker technology into 
a separate entity, Renalytix AI, Inc., which has 
been registered in the USA. sTNFR1/2 (Soluble 
Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and 
2) are novel biomarkers used in combination 
with artificial intelligence to identify which 
diabetes patients are at the highest risk of 
progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) 
potentially leading to End Stage Renal Disease 
(ESRD). Plans for the entity are at an early stage 
and discussions with partners are continuing. 
Capital changes
The Directors have taken a number of actions 
during the year to create distributable reserves 
and to reduce the number of actual and potential 
shares in issue. In June 2017, 21.6m share 
options which had been granted to employees 
and others were cancelled at the election of the 
holders, in return for payments totalling £1.5m. 
In September 2017, court and shareholder 
approval were received for a capital reduction, 
allowing us to create distributable reserves 
through the write-off of the Company’s share 
premium account, and to buy back up to 15% of 
the Company’s ordinary shares. Subsequently, 
a total of 6.7m shares have been cancelled. As 
a result of these actions, the total number of 
potential shares has reduced by nearly 6%. 
Results overview
The Chief Executive’s and Finance Director’s 
statements contain a review of the year and an 
overview of the financial performance of the 
Group.
Board
All of the Board members have served 
throughout the year. Non-executive Directors 
have continued to waive their standard 
director’s fees, however as each has performed 
considerable amounts of work for the Group in 
addition to their duties as directors, they have 
been paid an appropriate bonus.
Outlook
Trading in 2017 has been positive and this has 
continued into the early part of 2018. Trading is 
in line with management expectations.

1.0 Strategic Review
Chief Executive’s Review
It is pleasing to be able to report a strong set 
of results for 2017. In particular, cash generation 
has once again been very strong, with net cash 
growing from £2.2m to £7.0m during the year, 
despite spending £1.4m on capital expenditure 
and £1.5m on the cancellation of share options.
Operations
We have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of 
driving the existing business and continuing 
to reduce cost. Gross margins have improved 
at a greater rate than the increase in sales.  
We have sold around 15,000 analysers and 70 
million tests during the year and cemented 
our place as number one supplier of Beta 
Hydroxybutyrate ( β-HB) reagent in the USA, 
and number two worldwide in Hemoglobin 
point-of-care products.
During the year we completed the restructuring 
of our manufacturing operations by closing our 
manufacturing facility in Poland. Production 
volume was shifted to our factory in Barleben, 
Germany and customers successfully 
transitioned away from the older style cuvette 
previously made in Poland. In Barleben we have 
invested in modern production equipment 
including new automated equipment for 
the manufacture and packaging of the Quo-
Test cartridge. At our Elkhart facility, where 
we manufacture a number of wet chemistry 
products, we have a medium term programme 
to update the facilities to improve quality and 
volumes.
Point-of-Care
EKF’s point-of-care business model continues 
to be to sell analysers into the market and 
then benefit from the ongoing revenue 
stream generated by sales of the dedicated 
consumables. Over the last five years we have 
sold over 65,000 analysers for use worldwide, 
and each year we supply a growing number of 
tests for use on these. 
Hematology
Sales of Hematology products have increased 
by 10% to £12.9m (2016: £11.7m). Sales of Hemo 
Control (sold in the USA as HemoPoint H2) 
have built on the strong growth in 2016, rising a 
further 7%, while DiaSpect revenues have risen 
by a further 23%.
Diabetes
Diabetes revenues are up by 13% at £11.5m 
(2016: £10.2m). The Saudi tender won in 2015 
was completed during the year, and this has led 
to an increase in Quo-T est and Quo-Lab sales of 
14%. There has been further success for Biosen 
sales which have risen by 10%.
Central Laboratory
Central laboratory sales have grown by 5% 
to £12.6m, from £12.1m last year, again driven 
by sales of β-HB Liquicolor reagent which 
are higher by a further 17%, having risen by 
a very significant percentage in 2016. We 
have continued to promote our Altair 240 
analyser through an increasing portfolio of 
specialist distributors. Sales of other Central 
Laboratory products have been stable. We have 
discontinued a number of the marginal former 
STI products.
New and updated products
We have concentrated in 2017 on widening 
the range of regulatory approvals for our 
existing product ranges. In particular we have 
conducted a number of clinical trials in the USA 
in anticipation of submitting applications for 
FDA approval in the USA for our DiaSpect Tm 
and Quo-Test products. Quo-Test is also in the 
lab testing phase of its China FDA registration 
and we have secured registration for it in 
Brazil alongside Hemo Control, DiaSpect Tm 
and Quo-Lab. POC Connect, our connectivity 
solution for our DiaSpect Tm handheld analyser 
was launched in November 2017. We will soon 
be showcasing our new and updated Lactate 
Scout 4.0 product. As noted above, we are 
working to secure commercial launch of our 
sTNFR biomarker (for early detection of 
end stage renal disease in diabetic patients), 
alongside a number of partners.
Outlook
We are looking forward to finalising our two 
FDA applications in the first half of 2018, and 
to update on progress with our sTNFR project. 
At the same time, we anticipate receiving 
completed registrations for Beta 
Hydroxybutyrate ( β-HB) in Mexico, Brazil and 
Colombia as well as the Indian registration of 
DiaSpect Tm all in the first half of 2018. 
We are continuing to work hard to increase 
efficiency and reduce costs by investing in 
automation and streamlining processes. We are 
confident that we will continue to see growth in 
the business on a steady and sustainable basis.

1.0 Strategic Review
Finance Director’s Review
Revenue
Revenue for the year was £41.6m (2016: £38.6m), 
an increase of 8%. 6.6% of the increase was 
the result of improvements in foreign currency 
exchange rates, largely because of a further fall 
in the average value of sterling against the US 
dollar and Euro especially in the first half of the 
year. The remainder of the increase comes from 
organic growth.
Revenue by disease state, which is presented 
for illustration purposes only, is as follows: 
FY 2017
£’000
FY 2016
£’000 +/-%
Hematology 12,911 11,704 +10%
Diabetes Care 11,547 10,203 +13%
Central Laboratory 12,597 12,051 +5%
Other 4,529 4,631 (2)%
Total revenue 41,584 38,589 +8%
Gross profit
Gross profit increased to £22.9m (2016: 
£18.3m). The gross margin percentage on sales 
was 55.0% (2016: 47.5%). The increase was 
attributable in part to cost reductions arising 
from the actions taken in previous years, partly 
through mix and volume effects, and partly as a 
result of the release of inventory provisions set 
in prior years.
Administration costs and research and 
development costs
Administration expenses have again fallen, to 
£18.2m (2016: £18.7m). R&D costs included in 
administration expenses were £2.2m, with a 
further £0.7m being capitalised as an intangible 
cost. Gross R&D expenses have therefore 
increased to £2.9m from £2.7m in 2016.
The charge for depreciation of fixed assets and 
amortisation of intangible assets is £4.6m (2016: 
£5.0m). The charge includes an impairment in 
the year related to the carrying value of our 
Polish operations which were closed during the 
year, as well as the reassessment of the carrying 
value of certain non-core development projects.
Exceptional items relate to provisions made 
and costs incurred in the closure of the Polish 
manufacturing site, the increase in the fair 
value of the warranty claim associated with the 
acquisition of EKF-diagnostic GmbH, which is 
attributable to the increase in the Company’s 
share price during the year, and to the benefit at 
fair value of the shares released to EKF from an 
escrow account associated with the acquisition 
of Selah Genomics, Inc.
Operating profit and adjusted earnings 
before interest tax and depreciation
The Group made an operating profit of £4.7m, 
having made a small loss of £0.3m in 2016. This 
reflects the considerable efforts made in the 
last two years to reduce costs and improve 
efficiency. We continue to consider that adjusted 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, share-based payments 
and exceptional items (adjusted EBITDA) is 
a better measure of progress because the 
Board believes it gives clearer comparability 
of operating performance between periods. In 
2017 we achieved adjusted EBITDA of £9.3m 
(2016: £6.1m). The calculation of this non-GAAP 
measure is shown on the face of the income 
statement. It excludes the effect of share-based 
payment charges of £1.5m (2016: £1.0m), which 
increased largely because of the acceleration of 
charges as a result of the programme of share 
option cancellations, and exceptional profits of 
£1.6m (2016: losses of £0.5m). Of the increase in 
adjusted EBITDA of £3.2m, £0.6m is attributable 
to the effect of more favourable exchange 
rates, with the remainder being attributable to 
improved underlying performance.
Finance costs
Finance costs have continued to fall, to £0.5m 
in 2017 (2016: £0.7m). This is largely as a result 
of lower interest costs associated with the 
reduction of debt during the year, offset by 
higher charges relating to the discounting of 
deferred consideration. 
Tax
There is an income tax charge of £1.4m 
(2016: credit of £1.2m). This is because of a 
tax adjustment in the USA caused by timing 
differences on the carry back of losses in 
previous years, while in 2016 there was a large 
credit relating to 2015. In future years the Group 
anticipates a positive impact on its tax charge 
as a result of the tax policy changes recently 
made by the US Government.
Balance sheet
Property, plant and equipment
Additions to fixed assets were £1.4m (2016: 
£1.3m). This reflected investment in production 
equipment in both Germany and in the USA, 
including automated pouching equipment in 
Barleben and the replacement of obsolete plant 
in Elkhart. 
Intangible assets
The value of intangible assets has fallen from 
£46.5m to £43.6m year-on-year. This is partially 
attributable to the annual amortisation charge, 
plus the offsetting effect of additions and 
impairments.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  11
1.0 Strategic Review
Deferred consideration
The remaining deferred consideration relates 
to the share-based payment to the former 
owner of EKF-diagnostic GmbH. Finalisation of 
the contracts to conclude the position is now 
expected to take place in 2018. 
Cash and working capital
Net cash has increased from £2.2m to £7.0m 
during the year. Gross cash has increased to 
£8.2m (2016: £7.9m), and borrowings have 
reduced from £5.7m to £1.2m. All borrowings in 
the UK and the USA have have been paid off. 
The remaining borrowings is are being reduced 
over the loan period to 2023, and were used to 
fund the new building in Barleben. £1.5m was 
used to buy employees out of share option 
agreements and £0.2m was used to acquire 
ordinary shares for cancellation.
Inventory has reduced from £6.0m to £5.6m 
in 2017 as our programme to reduce inventory 
levels continued. While results so far have been 
encouraging, and we have seen inventory levels 
reduce by over 30% since December 2015, 
despite higher revenue, our ambition remains 
to reduce our holdings further, while ensuring 
production and sales run efficiently.
Trade receivables have reduced, partly because 
of the completion of payments relating to 
business in Saudi Arabia which required 
extended payment terms. The increase in 
payables, reflects increased activity during the 
year and the liability recognised in respect of 
cash settled share-based payments.

Strategic Report
The Directors present their Strategic Report 
for the year to 31 December 2017.
Review of the business
A review of the business is contained in the 
Chairman’s Statement on page 8, and in the 
Chief Executive’s Review on page 9 and the 
Finance Director’s Review on pages 10 and 11.
Risk Management
We recognise that effective risk management 
is essential to the successful delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. As we continue to grow our 
business we believe it is important to develop 
and enhance our risk management processes 
and control environment on an ongoing basis 
and ensure it remains fit for purpose. We 
continue to mature our approach to identifying 
and managing risks across the Group in a 
consistent and robust manner.
Below we describe our risk management 
approach, the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group and the controls in place to 
manage them. 
Overview of risk management approach 
Each business area is responsible for 
identifying, assessing and managing the risks 
in their respective area. Risks are identified and 
assessed by all business areas on a periodic 
basis, and are measured against a defined set 
of criteria, considering likelihood of occurrence, 
and potential impact. The Executive Board 
members also conduct a strategic risk 
identification and assessment exercise to 
identify risks, including those that could impact 
the business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. This risk information is 
combined with a consolidated view of the 
business area risks. The most significant risks 
identified are included in our Group Risk 
Profile, which is reported to the Executive 
Board for review and challenge, ahead of it 
being submitted to the Group Board for final 
review, challenge and approval. The Board has 
the overall accountability for ensuring that risk 
is effectively managed across the Group and 
therefore ensuring that it is comfortable with 
the nature and extent of the principal risks 
faced in achieving its strategic objectives.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Set out below are the principal risks which 
we believe could materially affect the Group’s 
ability to achieve its financial and operating 
objectives and control or mitigating activities 
adopted to manage them. The risks are not 
listed in order of significance.
Key employees
Lack of retention of key employees affects 
the continuity and effectiveness of on-going 
relationships with key customers and suppliers.
This risk is minimised by ensuring that a 
minimum of two individuals manage every 
relationship with key customers and suppliers. 
In addition, in retaining the key employees, 
incentivisation packages are offered through a 
mixture of sales commission, and profit related 
bonuses. Main Board Directors are incentivised 
as detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.
Political risk
A significant proportion of the Group’s revenues 
are accounted for by agreements in developing 
countries. Any instability in these countries 
could significantly affect the operations and 
the revenue of the Group. In particular the 
Group has significant revenue from customers 
in Russia which are ultimately largely funded by 
the government.
The Group spreads the risk through seeking 
a portfolio of diversified revenue streams 
geographically with a mixture of distribution 
partners in developing and developed countries.
Following the European Union (EU) membership 
referendum in 2016, the UK Government has 
commenced the process of withdrawal from 
the EU. Although at present the Group does 
not anticipate significant issues, the Group has 
employees, facilities, customers, and suppliers 
in both the United Kingdom and the EU, and 
therefore withdrawal may affect the Group’s 
operational abilities and costs. The Group seeks 
to manage this risk by monitoring events and 
taking mitigating actions if necessary.
Supply chain continuity
The Group relies on third party manufacturers 
for the supply of the majority of raw materials. 
Problems with obsolescence and manufacturer 
facilities may lead to delay and disruptions in 
the supply chain which could have a significant 
negative impact on the Group.
The Group maintains a close dialogue with key 
suppliers and closely monitors its inventory 
status and customer demand to ensure that 
any problems with the supply chain can be 
managed, and back up sources of supply are 
maintained where possible.
Regulatory risk
There can be no guarantee that any of the 
Group’s products will be able to obtain or 
maintain the necessary regulatory approvals 
in any or all of the territories in respect 
of which applications for such approvals 
are made. Where regulatory approvals are 
obtained, there can be no guarantee that the 
conditions attached to such approvals will not 
be considered too onerous by the Group or 
its distribution partners in order to be able to 
market its products effectively.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by 
manufacturing the products to recognised 
standards, by keeping appraised with changes 
in the standards geographically, by seeking 
advice from regulatory advisers, consultations 
with regulatory approval bodies and by working 
with experienced distribution partners.
for the year ended 31 December 2017  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  15
2.0 Corporate Governance
Competition risk
Due to the Group’s current and future potential 
competitors, such as major multinational 
pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, 
having substantially greater resources than 
those of the Group, the competitors may  
develop systems and products that are more 
effective or economic than any of those 
developed by the Group, rendering the 
Group’s products obsolete or otherwise non-
competitive.
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by 
securing patent registration protection for 
its products, maintaining confidentiality 
agreements regarding the Group’s know-how 
and technology, monitoring technological 
developments and by selecting leading 
businesses in their respective fields as 
distribution partners capable of addressing 
significant competition, should it arise.
Intellectual property risk
The commercial success of the Group and 
its ability to compete effectively with other 
companies depends, amongst other things, 
on its ability to obtain and maintain patents 
sufficiently broad in scope to provide protection 
for the Group’s intellectual property rights 
against third parties and to exploit its products. 
The absence of any such patents may have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to 
develop its business.
The Group mitigates this risk by developing 
products where legal advice indicates patent 
protection would be available, seeking 
patent protection for the Group’s products, 
maintaining confidentiality agreements 
regarding Group know-how and technology 
and monitoring technological developments 
and the registration of patents by other parties. 
The commercial success of the Group also 
depends upon not infringing patents granted, 
now or in the future, to third parties who may 
have filed applications or who have obtained, 
or may obtain, patents relating to business 
processes which might inhibit the Group’s 
ability to develop and exploit its own products.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures 
as the majority of revenues and expenditure 
and certain borrowings are denominated in 
foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange 
rates between the Group’s functional currency 
of Sterling and the currency of the overseas 
operations could adversely impact the financial 
results. In most cases the Group matches 
the currency receipts and expenditure of 
the overseas operations. The Group also 
endeavours to match the foreign currency 
assets of the foreign operations by funding 
through borrowings and loans denominated 
in the currency of the overseas operations, 
and to negotiate currency protection in major 
contracts. 
Reimbursement levels
There is no guarantee that the Group may be 
able to sell its products or services profitably 
if the reimbursement level from third party 
payers, including government and private 
health insurers, is unavailable or limited. Third 
party payers are increasingly attempting to 
contain health care costs through measures that 
could impact the Group including challenging 
the prices charged for health care products 
and services, limiting both coverage and the 
amount of reimbursement for new diagnostics 
products and services, and denying or limiting 
coverage for products that are approved by 
the regulatory agencies but are considered 
experimental by third party payers.
The Group understands that due to third party 
dependency it is extremely difficult to eradicate 
this risk. However, the Group manages this risk 
with constant dialogue and educating the third 
party payers on the Group’s products and also 
developing new technologies in order to seek 
additional reimbursements.
Financial reporting and disclosure
Due to the nature of the Group there is a 
requirement to report accurate financial 
information in compliance with accounting 
standards and applicable legislation.
This risk is mitigated through the Group’s 
internal controls over the financial information 
and reporting, overseen by the local financial 
heads and then reviewed by the central finance 
team, including the Finance Director. The annual 
financial statements are also subject to audit by 
the Group’s external auditors.
Cyber security risk
The Group uses computers extensively in its 
operations and has an online presence but does 
not trade online. It is at risk of attack through 
hacking or other methods. This risk is mitigated 
by the use of robust security measures, staff 
training, and back-up systems. The Group also 
has specific insurance cover.
Review of strategy and business model
The Board of Directors judge the Company’s 
financial performance by reference to the 
internal budget which it establishes at the 
beginning of each financial year.
EKF’s strategy is to create a world class IVD 
business through organic growth. IVD has a 
wide spectrum, and within this spectrum we 
have chosen to concentrate on point-of-care, 
and our existing central laboratory business. 
We have identified and acquired businesses 
in these areas with strong product lines and 
distribution networks which can benefit from 
better, more professional management, greater 
resources, and from the synergistic benefits of 
being part of a larger group.
We sell worldwide to over 100 countries. In many 
territories we sell through local distributors,  16 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
2.0 Corporate Governance
however where appropriate we sell direct to 
end users which include hospitals, laboratories, 
and government agencies. Our distributors 
are supported by a network of regional sales 
managers and by product managers who 
are specialists in our product range. We 
manufacture the majority of the products we 
sell ourselves, but also distribute a number of 
carefully chosen products on behalf of others. 
We have product support centres in the USA 
and Germany.
The Group works mainly on the principle of 
selling value priced instrumentation which 
generates long-term revenue streams from the 
subsequent sale of consumables. The Group 
has an existing portfolio of technologies which 
produce revenues and will add technologies 
which are strategically appropriate to this 
portfolio should they become available and 
providing the additions make economic sense.
Future outlook
The Chairman’s Statement on page 8 and 
the Chief Executive’s Review on page 9 give 
information on the future outlook of the Group, 
including the main trends and factors likely to 
affect its future development.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The key performance indicators currently 
used by the Group are revenue, gross margin, 
adjusted EBITDA and cash resources. The Group 
is working to establish other key performance 
indicators including non-financial measures. 
KPIs are discussed in more detail in the Finance 
Director’s review on pages 10 and 11.
Environment
The Directors consider that the nature of the 
Group’s activities is not inherently detrimental 
to the environment. The Group is committed 
to minimising any effect on the environment 
caused by its operations.
Employees
The Group places value on the involvement of its 
employees and they are regularly briefed on the 
Group’s activities. The Group closely monitors 
staff attrition rates which it seeks to keep at low 
levels and aims to structure staff compensation 
levels at competitive rates in order to attract 
and retain high calibre personnel.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered, bearing 
in mind the specific aptitudes of the applicant 
involved. It is the policy of the Group that the 
training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
Social, community, and human rights
The Board recognises that the Group has a 
duty to be a good corporate citizen and to 
respect the laws, and where appropriate the 
customs and culture of the territories in which 
it operates. The Group has donated product to 
selected appropriate charities which operate 
within its area, and encourages staff to take 
part in charitable activities which are related to 
our business areas or customers. It contributes 
as far as is practicable to the local communities 
in which it operates and takes a responsible and 
positive approach to employment practices. 
The Group’s Modern Slavery Act statement is 
published on our website.

Report of the Directors 
The Directors have pleasure in presenting this report together with the audited consolidated 
financial statements of EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Corporate details
EKF Diagnostics Holdings public limited company is domiciled, incorporated, and registered in 
England and Wales with registration number 4347937. The registered office is Avon House, 19 
Stanwell Road, Penarth, Cardiff CF64 2EZ.
Directors
The Directors who held office during the year and as at the date of signing the financial statements 
were as follows:
• Christopher Mills 
• Julian Baines
• Richard Evans
• Adam Reynolds
• Carl Contadini
The Company Secretary is Salim Hamir.
Principal activities
During the year the principal activities of the Group and Company were the development, 
manufacture and supply of products into the in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) market place. Future 
developments and research and development activities are discussed in the Chairman’s Statement 
on page 8, the Chief Executive’s Review on page 9 and the Finance Director’s Review on pages 10 
and 11.
Dividends and share buy back
There were no dividends paid or proposed by the Company in either year. During the year the 
Company obtained authorisation to acquire up to 15% of its Ordinary Shares in order to reduce the 
number of shares in issue. On 3 October 2017 the Company acquired  1,000,000 ordinary shares at 
a price of 24 pence per share from Harwood Capital LLP (“Harwood”) as investment manager 
to Oryx International Growth Fund Limited. Christopher Mills, the Company’s Non-Executive 
Chairman, is a partner and Chief Investment Officer of Harwood and a director and shareholder in 
Oryx.
Going concern
The Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of 
these financial statements. This included the review of internal budgets and financial results which 
show, taking into account reasonably probable changes in financial performance, that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current funding arrangements.
The restructuring and cost saving actions taken in late 2015 and early 2016 have allowed the Group 
to become cash generative in the second half of 2016 and in 2017.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore 
continues to adopt the going concern basis of preparation for its consolidated financial statements.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is discussed in Note 3 of the financial statements.
Employee policies
Employee policies are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 14 to 16.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have prepared the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the group and parent company for that 
period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the 
group financial statements and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed 
for the company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the group and parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the group and parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy   EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  19
2.0 Corporate Governance
at any time the financial position of the group and parent company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and parent company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the parent company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group and 
parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Report of the Directors confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the parent company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and loss of the company;
• the group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the group; and
• the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Finance Director’s Review include a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group 
and parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces. 
Directors’ liability insurance
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity for the benefit of each Director of the Company 
in respect of liabilities to which they may become liable in their capacity as Director of the Company 
and of any Company in the Group. Those indemnities are qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the purposes of Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 and have been in force during the 
whole of the financial year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and 
a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Disclosure of information to the Auditors
The Directors who hold office at the date of approval of this report confirm that so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, 
and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Corporate governance
The Company’s statement of corporate governance can be found in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 20 to 22 of these financial statements. The Corporate Governance Statement 
forms part of this Report of the Directors and is incorporated into it by cross-reference.
Annual General Meeting
The resolutions to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting are set out in the 
formal notice of the meeting, as set out on page 72.
Recommendation
The Board considers that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in 
the best interests of the Company and it is unanimously recommended that shareholders support 
these proposals as the Board intends to do in respect of their own holdings. 
The Report of the Directors was approved by the Board on 14th March 2018 and signed on its 
behalf by:

Corporate Governance Statement
Compliance
The Directors recognise the value of the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code). Although, as an AIM Company, compliance with the Code is not required, the Group seeks 
to apply the Code where practicable and appropriate for a business of its size.
The following statement describes how the Group as at 31 December 2017 sought to address the 
principles underlying the Code.
Board composition and responsibility
The Board currently comprises two Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors. The 
Board notes that the Combined Code guidance recommends that at least half the Board should 
comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board has determined that Adam Reynolds 
is independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances 
which could materially affect or interfere with the exercise of his independent judgement. The 
Board considers that Christopher Mills and Carl Contadini do not meet the criteria to be considered 
independent because of their relationships with Harwood, NAIT, and Oryx. The Board is satisfied 
with the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors which allows it to exercise 
objectivity in decision making and proper control of the Company’s business. The Board considers 
its composition is appropriate in view of the size and requirements of the Group’s business and the 
need to maintain a practical balance between executives and non-executives. Due to the structure 
of the Company it is considered that it is not appropriate to make any changes to the Board 
composition at present.
There is a division of responsibilities between the Non-Executive Chairman, who is responsible 
for the overall strategy of the Group and running the Board, and the CEO, who is responsible for 
implementing the strategy and day to day running of the Group. He is assisted by the Finance 
Director and Chief Operating Officer.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their 
appointment, and are subject to re-election at least every three years. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for a specific term of office which provides for their removal in certain circumstances, 
including under section 168 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board does not automatically re-
nominate Non-Executive Directors for election by shareholders. The terms of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors can be obtained by request to the Company Secretary.
The Board’s primary objective is to focus on adding value to the assets of the Group by identifying 
and assessing business opportunities and ensuring that potential risks are identified, monitored 
and controlled. Matters reserved for Board decisions include strategic long-term objectives and 
capital structure of major transactions. The implementation of Board decisions and day to day 
operations of the Group are delegated to Management.
Board meetings
10 Board meetings were held during the year. The Directors’ attendance record during the year is 
as follows:
Christopher Mills (Non-Executive Chairman) 9
Julian Baines (Chief Executive Officer) 10
Richard Evans (Chief Operating Officer and Finance Director) 10
Adam Reynolds (Non-Executive Director) 10
Carl Contadini (Non-Executive Director) 3
Audit Committee
This comprises two Non-Executive Directors, Christopher Mills and Adam Reynolds (Chairman). 
Adam Reynolds is the Senior Independent Director and has recent and relevant finance experience. 
The principal duties of the committee are to review the half-yearly and annual financial statements 
before their submission to the Board and to consider any matters raised by the auditors. The 
Committee also reviews the independence and objectivity of the auditors. The terms of reference 
of the Committee reflect current best practice, including authority to:
• Recommend the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors;
• Ensure the objectivity and independence of the auditors including occasions when non-audit 
services are provided; and
• Ensure appropriate ‘whistle-blowing’ arrangements are in place.
for the year ended 31 December 2017  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  21
2.0 Corporate Governance
The Non-Executive Directors may seek information from any employee of the Group and obtain 
external professional advice at the expense of the Company if considered necessary. Due to the 
relatively low number of personnel employed within the Group, the nature of the business and the 
current control and review systems in place, the Board has decided not to establish a separate 
internal audit department. The committee met once formally during 2017. There were no significant 
matters communicated to the Committee by the Auditors and no interaction with the Financial 
Reporting Council. 
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on 
executive remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors. No 
Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The remuneration committee is made up of Christopher Mills (Chairman), and Adam Reynolds. 
The committee considers the employment and performance of individual Executive Directors and 
determines their terms of service and remuneration. It also has authority to grant options under the 
Company’s Executive Share Option Scheme.
The Committee met twice during 2017.
Board appointments
There is no formal Nominations Committee, the appointment of new Directors being considered 
by the full Board.
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control 
to provide them with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used 
within the business and for publication and that the assets are safeguarded. There are inherent 
limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the most effective system can 
provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation of financial 
reporting and the safeguarding of assets.
The Group, in administering its business, has put in place strict authorisation, approval and control 
levels within which senior management operates. These controls reflect the Group’s organisational 
structure and business objectives. The control system includes clear lines of accountability and 
covers all areas of the organisation. The Board operates procedures which include an appropriate 
control environment through the definition of the above organisation structure and authority levels 
and the identification of the major business risks.
The Group has continued its project to enhance and formalise its internal controls including the 
establishment of a Risk Steering Committee.
Internal financial reporting
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal

Relations with shareholders
The Company reports to shareholders twice a year. The Company dispatches the notice of its 
Annual General Meeting, together with a description of the items of special business, at least 21 clear 
days before the meeting. Each substantially separate issue is the subject of a separate resolution 
and all shareholders have the opportunity to put questions to the Board at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Chair(s) of the Audit and Remuneration Committees normally attend the Annual 
General Meeting and will answer questions which may be relevant to their work. The Chairman 
advises the meeting of the details of proxy votes cast on each of the individual resolutions after 
they have been voted on in the meeting.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors intend to maintain a good and continuing 
understanding of the objectives and views of the shareholders.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board recognises that the Group has a duty to be a good corporate citizen and is conscious 
that its business processes minimise harm to the environment, that it contributes as far as is

Directors’ share options and Long-Term Incentive Plan
As at 31 December 2016 the following options to Directors of the Company existed under the 
Company’s unapproved share-option scheme and Long-Term Incentive Plan:
Option Holder
Option price per 
Ordinary Share
Number of Ordinary 
Shares under option Exercise period
Julian Baines 15p 5,127,383 1 January 2014 – 31 December 2020
Richard Evans 20p 4,260,000 1 January 2014 – 31 December 2020
On 26 June 2017 these options were surrendered at the election of the holders in return for the 
payment of one-off cash sums of £354,000 to Mr Baines and £295,000 to Mr Evans.
On 2 June 2016 two Directors were granted a cash settled share-based incentive award. During 
2017 both the maximum and minimum amounts payable to each Director were reduced by £0.2m. 
The awards vest if a controlling interest in the Company is acquired by a third party prior to 30 
June 2019. In these circumstances a minimum amount of £0.3m is payable to each Director, which 
increases by reference to the sale price achieved. The fair value of this award has been calculated 
at £3,351,000 using a modified form of a Black Scholes model. The fair value has been spread over 
the assumed vesting period, with a charge of £969,000 recognised in 2017. The key assumptions 
used in the model are disclosed in Note 30.
Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are disclosed in the Directors’ Report on 
page 17.

Independent auditors’ report to the  
members of EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc’s group financial statements and parent company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit and the group’s and the parent company’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company’s financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report (the “Annual 
Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated and Company’s Statements of Financial Position 
as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company’s Statements of Cash Flows, and the 
Consolidated and Company’s Statements of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the 
notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
• Overall group materiality: £415,000, based on 1% of revenue.
•  Overall parent company materiality: £394,000, based on a 
component allocation of group materiality.
•  We performed full-scope audit procedures in respect of 
the group’s largest trading subsidiaries in the USA and in 
Germany, as well as EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc in the UK.
•  Our audit scope also included specified audit procedures in 
respect of Separation Technologies Inc. in the USA.
•  Our audit procedures covered entities contributing 92% of the 
group’s revenues for the year ended 31 December 2017.  
•  Goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments 
(Group and parent).
• Share-based payment transactions (Group and parent). 26 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
2.0 Corporate Governance
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and 
any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit. 
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed  
the key audit matter
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment  
assessments (Group and parent). 
At 31 December 2017, the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position includes £43.6m of intangible 
assets (2016: £46.5m). 
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, 
management has performed impairment reviews 
in relation to the goodwill held in the group’s cash 
generating units (CGUs). The book values of the 
intangible assets and goodwill are supported by 
multiple-year profitability projections based on the 
budget for 2018.
An impairment of £0.6m (2016: £nil) has been 
recognised in the year in respect of the closure of 
the group’s operations in Poland during 2017 and 
as a result of the reassessment of the carrying 
value of development costs.
Significant headroom exists in respect of the 
majority of the impairment reviews carried out, 
other than in respect of DiaSpect, where £2.4m of 
headroom exists (14% of the CGU carrying value). 
The impairment reviews include significant 
estimates and judgements in respect of future 
growth rates and cash flows, the discount rate 
employed and profitability.
We obtained the group’s cash flow forecasts 
supporting its assessments and evaluated the 
appropriateness of key assumptions, with a focus 
on DiaSpect as there is limited headroom in the 
impairment review for this CGU. We assessed the 
methodology used by management in performing 
the assessments and challenged and evaluated key 
inputs including:
• the projected growth rates used, both over the 
short-term to 2021 and over the longer-term;
• the discount rate used;
• other key inputs, including the applicable tax 
rate, forecast capital expenditure and forecast 
margins.
We also considered 2017 financial performance vs. 
budget and the performance in the first part of 
2018. We performed a range of sensitivity analyses 
to assess the impact of alternative assumptions to 
those used by management. 
We concur with management’s assertion that no 
further impairment charge is required in respect of 
goodwill and intangible assets but identified that 
if management is unable achieve planned results, 
this could reasonably be expected to give rise to 
an impairment in the future. Management have 
disclosed the results of sensitivity analyses in Note 
17 to the accounts. 
Share-based payment transactions  
(Group and parent).
During 2016, two directors were awarded a cash-
settled share-based incentive award, which will see 
a payment made if the Company is acquired by a 
third party before 30 June 2019. 
The amount payable under the award varies 
depending on the acquisition price per share and is 
subject to a minimum amount payable. The awards 
have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 
2 as cash-settled share based payments and the 
value of the liability recognised as at 31 December 
2017 is £1.72m (2016: £0.75m).
Management engaged an independent expert to 
value the share-based awards and the movement 
in the fair value of the year-end liability has been 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
within the charge for share-based payments. 
A number of assumptions have been made in 
valuing the awards, including the expected date 
of an acquisition, share-price volatility and the 
premium expected to be paid for acquiring the 
Company’s shares. Disclosure in respect of these 
awards is included in Note 30 to the Financial 
Statements.
We obtained the valuation of the share-based 
incentive awards and evaluated the independence 
and objectivity of management’s expert. We 
gained an understanding of and evaluated the 
assumptions and methods that are significant to 
the management’s expert’s work for their relevance 
and reasonableness.
We challenged management in respect of the 
assumptions made, including the expected exit date 
and expected share-price volatility, and concluded 
that the assumptions made by management are 
reasonable.
We concluded that the work of management’s 
expert is appropriate and concur with 
management’s accounting for the awards. We have 
also evaluated the explanatory disclosures made in 
Note 30 to the Financial Statements.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  27
2.0 Corporate Governance
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group 
and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they 
operate.
 The group has two main manufacturing centres in Germany and the USA, in addition to the Head 
Office function based in the United Kingdom (UK). The central finance and accounting team is 
located in the UK and is responsible for the financial reporting of EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc. 
Stanbio Laboratory (“Stanbio”) and EKF Diagnostics Holdings GmbH (“EKF Germany”) are 
assessed as financially significant components of the group, given the significant revenue earned 
by the group in these entities. An audit of these entities’ financial information has been carried 
out. The audit of Stanbio was conducted by the group engagement team and component auditors 
were engaged to audit EKF Germany. Full-scope audit procedures were also performed in respect 
of DiaSpect Medical GmbH in Germany (again conducted by the component audit team) and the 
parent company, EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc in the UK. The parent company audit was scoped 
in accordance with our parent company materiality. 
Our audit scope also included specified audit procedures in respect of Separation Technologies 
Inc. (STI) in the USA, where we designed audit procedures to gain coverage over certain financial 
statement line items (FSLIs). This work was performed by the group engagement team. 
Our audit addressed components making up 92% of the group’s revenues for the year ended 31 
December 2017.  
Where component auditors were engaged, we adopted procedures to ensure we were sufficiently 
involved in their audits. This included discussions with component audit teams during the planning, 
fieldwork and reporting phases, the issuance of comprehensive audit instructions and a review of 
key working papers.
 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative 
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine 
the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £415,000 £394,000
How we  
determined it 
1% of group revenues for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Limited to component allocation of 
group materiality.
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
Given the restructuring and  
refocusing of the business on its core 
point-of-care markets in recent years, 
growth is being delivered through 
organic growth, meaning revenues 
remain a key focus for management 
and the directors. 
Since the materiality we would 
have employed to this entity on a 
standalone basis was in excess of the 
component allocation,  
materiality was capped at the  
component materiality allocation. 28 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
2.0 Corporate Governance
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than 
our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between 
£87,000 and £394,000. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £21,000 (group audit) and £19,000 (parent company audit) as well as 
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require 
us to report to you when: 
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or 
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s and parent company’s ability 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, 
ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given 
in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors.   EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  29
2.0 Corporate Governance
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 18, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on 
the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. General information
EKF Diagnostics Holdings Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock 
Exchange. The address of the registered office is Avon House, 19 Stanwell Road, Penarth, Cardiff 
CF64 2EZ.
The principal activity of the Group is the development, manufacture and supply of products and 
services into the in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) market place. The Group has presence in the UK, USA, 
Germany, Russia, and China, and sells throughout the world including Europe, the Middle East, the 
Americas, Asia, and Africa.
The financial statements are presented in British Pounds Sterling, the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Company’s headquarters is operated. The Group comprises 
EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc and its subsidiary Companies as set out in note 18.
The registered number of the Company is 04347937.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial 
statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied throughout all years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs), IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. Practice is continuing to evolve on the application and interpretations of IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are disclosed in note 4.
(a) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group. 
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017. They do not materially impact on the Group results:
• Annual improvements 2010 – 2012
• Annual improvements 2012 – 2014
• Annual Improvements 2014 - 2016
• Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• Amendment to IAS 7, ‘Disclosure Initiative’
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2017 and not early adopted.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing 
these financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial 
statements of the group or parent company, except the following, set out below:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition 
of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to 
the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies 
the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for 
financial assets: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income; and fair 
value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business 
model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in 
equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with 
the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income, not recycling. An expected credit losses model replaces the incurred loss impairment 
for the year ended 31 December 2017  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  37
3.0 Financial Statements
model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there are no changes to classification 
and measurement, except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other 
comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is 
permitted. The group is working towards the implementation of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. It 
anticipates that the classification and measurement basis for its financial assets and liabilities 
will be largely unchanged by adoption of IFRS 9, and expects to take the accounting policy 
choice to continue to account for all hedges under IAS 39. The main impact of adopting IFRS 
9 is likely to arise from the implementation of the expected loss model. No material impact on 
profit for future periods is expected.
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with revenue recognition and 
establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about 
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s 
contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good 
or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good 
or service. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable 
that there will be no significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognised when the 
uncertainty is resolved. The standard replaces IAS 18, ‘Revenue’, and IAS 11, ‘Construction 
contracts’, and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018, and earlier application is permitted. The group is working towards 
the implementation of IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 and has carried out a review of existing 
contractual arrangements as part of this process. The directors anticipate there will be no 
material impact. The profile of cash receipts is not affected by this standard. 
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases, 
and it establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements 
about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is 
that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The standard 
replaces IAS 17, ‘Leases’, and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and earlier application is permitted, subject to 
EU endorsement and the entity adopting IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, 
at the same time. Based on existing operating leases under IAS 17, the directors estimate that, 
if IFRS 16 were implemented on 1 January 2018, additional land and buildings of £480,000, 
and vehicles and machinery of £128,000 would be recognised, together with an additional 
lease liability of £608,000. In future periods, the operating lease charge would be replaced by 
a depreciation charge that, whilst lower over the life of the lease than the current operating 
lease charge, is not expected to be materially different. The directors are in the process of 
reviewing contracts to identify any additional lease arrangements that would need to be 
recognised under IFRS 16.
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the use of cash reserves and 
existing bank facilities.
The Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of 
these financial statements. This included the review of internal budgets and financial results which 
show, taking into account reasonably probable changes in financial performance, that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current funding arrangements.
The restructuring and cost saving actions taken in late 2015 and early 2016 allowed the Group to 
become cash generative in the second half of 2016, and this has continued through 2017. As a result 
the Group has been able to significantly reduce its borrowings during the year.
The Directors believe that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason they have adopted the going concern basis in 
the preparation of the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern 
their financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than fifty 
per cent of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another 
entity.  38 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
3.0 Financial Statements
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They 
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
agreement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If 
this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain 
purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Inter-Company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional 
currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in British Pounds Sterling, which is 
the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the income statement within ‘administrative expenses’.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a 
hyper- inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentational 
currency are translated into the presentational currency as  follows:
• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the 
date of that balance sheet;
• income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; 
and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in 
foreign operations are taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as 
the Executive Directors who make strategic decisions.
Government grants
Government grants receivable in connection with expenditure on property, plant and equipment 
are accounted for as deferred income, which is credited to the income statement over the expected 
useful economic life of the related assets, on a basis consistent with the depreciation policy. 
Revenue grants for the reimbursement of costs charged to the income statement are credited to 
the Income Statement in the year in which the costs are incurred.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  39
3.0 Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provision for impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset and bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only where it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of 
the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income 
statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Any borrowing costs associated 
with qualifying property plant and equipment are capitalised and depreciated at the rate applicable 
to that asset category.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method 
or reducing balances method to allocate their cost to its residual values over their estimated useful 
lives, as follows
Buildings  2%–2.5% 
Fixtures and fittings 20%–25% 
Plant and machinery 20%–33.3% 
Motor vehicles  25%
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed regularly, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying value is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on the disposal of assets are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amount and are recognised in administration expenses in the income statement.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of the acquisition. Goodwill 
on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. Goodwill has an infinite useful life 
and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation 
is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected 
to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to 
operating segment.
(b) Trademarks, trade names and licences
Separately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and licences 
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks 
and licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and 
licences over their estimated useful lives of between 8 and 12 years and is charged to administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
(c) Customer relationships
Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value 
at the acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method over the expected life of the customer relationship of between 6 and 15 years and is 
charged to administrative expenses in the income statement.
(d) Trade secrets
Trade secrets, including technical know-how, operating procedures, methods and processes, 
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trade 
secrets have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation 
is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trade secrets over their estimated 
useful lives of between 6 and 15 years and is charged to administrative expenses in the income 
statement. 40 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
3.0 Financial Statements
(e) Development costs
Development costs acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Development costs have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful 
lives of 15 years and is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement.
Expenditure incurred on the development of new or substantially improved products or processes 
is capitalised, provided that the related project satisfies the criteria for capitalisation, including the 
project’s technical feasibility and likely commercial benefit. All other research and development 
costs are expensed as incurred.
Development costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the products with which they are 
associated, currently 4 to 5 years. Amortisation commences when a new product is in commercial 
production. The amortisation is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement. The 
estimated remaining useful lives of development costs are reviewed at least on an annual basis.
The carrying value of capitalised development costs is reviewed for potential impairment at 
least annually and if a product becomes unviable and an impairment is identified the deferred 
development costs are immediately charged to the income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite life such as goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash flows. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to 
which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any 
remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating 
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in the prior period. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately. If goodwill is impaired 
however, no reversal of the impairment is recognised in the financial statements.
Investments
Investments where the Group does not have a controlling interest are initially recognised at cost. 
The carrying value is tested annually for impairment and an impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Financial assets
Classification
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables and 
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired and management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. 
The Company’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and cash and cash 
equivalents in the balance sheet.
(b) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not   EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  41
3.0 Financial Statements
classified as loans and receivables. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment 
matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting 
period.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on 
which the Company commits to purchase the asset. Assets are initially recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognised when the risk and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income until the asset is 
disposed at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in 
the consolidated income statement for the period. If an available-for-sale investment is determined 
to be impaired, the cumulative loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income 
statement for the period.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
calculated on a first in and first out basis and includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct 
costs and attributable production overheads, where appropriate. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and applicable selling costs. Where 
necessary, provision is made for slow-moving and obsolete inventory. Inventory on consignment 
and their related obligations are recognised in current assets and payables respectively.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, being the original invoice amount, and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Trade receivables that are less 
than three months past due are not considered impaired unless there are specific financial or 
commercial reasons that lead management to conclude that the customer will default. Older debts 
are considered to be impaired unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary that they will be 
settled. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income 
statement within administrative expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written 
off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against administrative expenses in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months, reduced by overdrafts to the 
extent that there is a right of offset against other cash balances.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and short-term deposits as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts where there is 
a right of offset.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Proceeds in excess of the nominal value of shares issued 
are allocated to the share premium account and are also classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary Shares or options are deducted from the share 
premium account.
Financial liabilities
Debt is measured at fair value, being net proceeds after deduction of directly attributable issue 
costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost with the exception of deferred equity 
consideration which is categorised as a financial liability at fair value through profit and loss. Debt 
issue costs are recognised in the income statement over the expected term of such instruments at 
a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary  42 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
3.0 Financial Statements
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment 
is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, 
they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as 
current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated Group income statement under the heading 
‘finance costs’. Arrangement and facility fees together with bank charges are charged to the 
income statement under the heading ‘administrative expenses’.
Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income where the 
associated tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate 
and generate taxable income. Management evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance 
sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all temporary differences 
except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in business 
combinations.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of 
unused tax assets and tax losses, to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. They are 
regarded as recoverable where, on the basis of available evidence, there will be sufficient taxable 
profits against which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The carrying value of the amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all, or part, of the tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the 
year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Provisions
Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured.
Leases
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as 
a finance lease. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value at the inception 
of the lease and depreciated over the estimated useful economic life of the asset or lease term if 
shorter. The finance charges are allocated to the income statement in proportion to the capital 
amount outstanding.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income 
statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration is recognised at fair value. Where the value of deferred consideration is   EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  43
3.0 Financial Statements
based on a future event, management estimate the likelihood of the consideration becoming 
payable. Deferred consideration is discounted to take account of the time value of money at rates 
based on those used for the valuation of related intangible assets. 
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes all of which are defined contribution plans. A 
defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity with the pension cost charged to the income statement as incurred. The Group has 
no further obligations once the contributions have been paid.
(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the 
Group receives services from employees and others as consideration for equity instruments of the 
Group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are 
expensed over the vesting period based on the number of instruments that are expected to vest. 
For plans where vesting conditions are based on share price targets, the fair value at the date of 
grant reflects these conditions. Where applicable the Group recognises the impact of revisions to 
original estimates in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity for equity-
settled schemes. Fair values are measured using appropriate valuation models, taking into account 
the terms and conditions of the awards.
When the share-based payment awards are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The 
proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.
The Group operates a cash-settled compensation plan for certain senior employees. Cash-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at each reporting date and are expensed over the 
expected vesting period. The fair value amount is recognised in liabilities.
National insurance on share options
To the extent that the share price at the balance sheet date is greater than the exercise price on 
options granted under unapproved share-based payment compensation schemes, provision for 
any National Insurance Contributions has been based on the prevailing rate of National Insurance. 
The provision is accrued over the performance period attaching to the award.
Revenue recognition
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue for the sale of medical diagnostic instruments and reagents is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable and represents the invoiced value for the sale of the goods 
net of sales taxes, rebates and discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when a 
Group Company has delivered products to the customer, the customer has accepted delivery of 
the products and collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.
(b) Sale of services
Revenue for the sale of services is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents the invoiced value for the sale of the services net of sales taxes, rebates 
and discounts. Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when a Group Company has 
completed the services and collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.
(c) Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
(d) Royalty and licence income
Royalty and licence income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of 
the relevant agreements.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Other income
Other income includes grant income and R & D tax credits passed through income where this is  44 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc

permitted by the relevant jurisdiction.
Exceptional items
These are items of an unusual or non-recurring nature incurred by the Group and include transactional 
costs and one off items relating to business combinations, such as acquisition expenses.
3. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (foreign exchange risk 
and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and fair value risk. The Group’s 
overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of the financial markets and 
seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group 
does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the head office finance team. It evaluates and mitigates financial 
risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides principles for 
overall risk management whilst the head office finance team provides specific policy guidance for 
the operating units in terms of managing foreign exchange risk, credit risk and cash and liquidity 
management.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange – cash flow risk
The Group’s presentational currency is sterling although it operates internationally and is exposed 
to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily between GBP, USD, 
the Euro, and Rouble, such that the Group’s cash flows are affected by fluctuations in the rate of 
exchange between GBP and the aforementioned foreign currencies.
This exposure is managed by a natural currency hedge as the Group’s operating subsidiaries cost 
base is also denominated in USDs, Euros, and Roubles, as the Group has subsidiary businesses 
located in the USA, Germany, and Russia.
Management do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of any residual 
foreign currency exposure not mitigated by the natural hedge within the business model. The 
Group does not speculate in foreign currencies and no operating Company is permitted to take 
unmatched positions in any foreign currency.
(ii) Foreign exchange – Fair value risk
Translation exposures that arise on converting the results of overseas subsidiaries are not hedged. 
Net assets held in foreign currencies are hedged wherever practical by matching borrowings in the 
same currency. The principal exchange rates used by the Group in translating overseas profits and 
net assets into GBP are set out in the table below.
Rate compared to GBP
Average

Russian Rouble 75.689 90.826 77.963 75.550
US Dollar 1.295 1.356 1.350 1.233
As a guide to the sensitivity of the Group’s results to movements in foreign currency exchange 
rates, a one cent movement in the Euro and US Dollars to Sterling rate would impact annual 
earnings by approximately £45,000 and £73,000 respectively.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group has interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and interest-
bearing liabilities which relate to borrowings and finance lease obligations in the Group’s UK, US 
and German subsidiaries. Interest rates on cash and cash equivalents are floating whilst interest 
rates on certain borrowings have been fixed and therefore expose the Group to fair value interest 
rate risk. The Group does not speculate on future changes in interest rates.
Where overseas acquisitions are made, it is the Group’s policy to arrange any borrowings required 
in local currency.
It is the Group’s policy not to trade in financial instruments. The Group does not use interest rate swaps.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  45
3.0 Financial Statements
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable 
balances. Each local subsidiary and operating business unit is responsible for managing and 
analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard payment and delivery terms 
and conditions are offered. It is the Group policy to obtain deposits or require payment in advance 
from customers where possible, particularly overseas customers. In addition if possible the Group 
will seek confirmed letters of credit for the balances due. Credit risk is managed at the operating 
business unit level and monitored at the Group level to ensure adherence to Group policies. If there 
is no independent rating, local management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking 
into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set 
based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board. The utilisation of 
credit limits is regularly monitored. Where extended credit is granted, this is agreed by the Finance 
Director. Credit insurance is taken out where appropriate and cost effective.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits 
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
(c) Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed in the individual operating entities of the Group and is 
aggregated by Group finance. Group finance monitors cash and cash flow forecasts and it is the 
Group’s liquidity risk management policy to maintain sufficient cash and available funding through 
an adequate amount of cash and cash equivalents and committed credit facilities from its bankers. 
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the head office finance team aims to 
maintain flexibility in funding by keeping sufficient cash and cash equivalents available to fund the 
requirements of the Group.
The Group’s policy in relation to the finance of its overseas operations requires that sufficient 
liquid funds be maintained in each of its territory subsidiaries to support short and medium-term 
operational plans. Where necessary, short-term funding is provided by the holding company. In 
the UK, the management of liquid funds in excess of operational needs are controlled centrally. 
Typically excess funds are placed as short-term deposits, to provide a balance between interest 
earnings and flexibility, where the benefit outweighs the administrative cost.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

(d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including “current and non-
current borrowings” as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. 
Total capital is the sum of net debt plus equity.
(e) Fair value estimation
The Group has no Level 1, 2 or 3 classified financial assets as at 31 December 2017 (2016: none). 46 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made accounting 
judgements in the determination of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ 
from those assumptions and estimates. The following judgements have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
(a) Legal disputes
A dispute has arisen between EKF-diagnostic GmbH and a distributor involving disputed invoices 
from the distributor, relating mainly to the period prior to the acquisition of the company by the 
Group. The dispute is not covered by any outstanding warranty from the former owner. Earlier 
litigation in the UK has been settled in EKF’s favour, however litigation in Germany is continuing. 
Having taken legal advice the Directors believe that no settlement  provision is required in relation 
to this dispute, however an accrual for legal costs has been set.
A dispute which had arisen with a second distributor in relation to issues with the registration of a 
product was settled during the year.
(b) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have suffered any 
impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. The recoverable amounts of 
cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations 
require the use of estimates as set out in note 17.
(c) Share-based payments
A number of accounting estimates and judgements are incorporated within the calculation of the 
charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments. These are described in more 
detail in note 30.
5. Segmental reporting
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the monthly management 
reports presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM is the Executive 
Directors and the monthly management reports are used by the Group to make strategic decisions 
and allocate resources.
The principal activity of the Group is the design, development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic 
instruments, reagents and certain ancillary products, as well as central laboratory reagents. This 
activity takes place across various countries, such as the USA, Germany, Russia, and the United 
Kingdom, and as such the Board considers the business primarily from a geographic perspective. 
Although not all the segments meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, management 
has concluded that all segments should be maintained and reported. 
The reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of medical 
diagnostic equipment. Other services include the servicing and distribution of third party company 
products under separate distribution agreements.
Currently the key operating performance measures used by the CODM are Revenue and adjusted 
EBITDA.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  47

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash–generating units (CGU’s) identified according to 
geographic operating segment. An operating segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is 
presented below.

Germany includes EKF-Diagnostic, Senslab, and DiaSpect, while the USA includes Stanbio and STI.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date. The recoverable amount of goodwill 
at 31 December 2017 was assessed on the basis of value in use. The assessed value exceeded the 
carrying value and no impairment loss was recognised. 
The key assumptions in the calculation to assess value in use are future revenues and the ability 
to generate future cash flows. The most recent financial results and initial budgets approved 
by the Board for the next year were used and forecasts for a further four years, followed by an 
extrapolation of expected cash flows at a constant growth rate for each unit and the calculation of 
a terminal value based upon the longer term growth rates set out below. The projected results were 
discounted at a rate which is a prudent evaluation of the pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. The 
discount rates applied reflect a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The key assumptions used in 2017 for the value in use calculations of cash generating units with 
significant goodwill are as follows:
 
EKF  
Germany
%
DiaSpect
%
Stanbio
%
STI
%
Longer-term growth rate 3 2 3 3
Discount rate 10 10 10 10
The discount rate used is based on a common risk profile across the Group.
The impairment assessments for EKF Germany, Russia, Stanbio, and STI showed assessed values 
that exceeded the carrying values with significant headroom.
For DiaSpect, the impairment assessment has been carried out over a 5 year period with a terminal 
value based on the long-term growth rate. The Directors estimate that growth rates in the 5 year 
period from the DiaSpect products will be high because they are relatively new products that will 
bring market benefits.
In Year 1 a growth rate of 7% has been used, reflecting the current sales run-rate, followed by 
20% for years 2-4, reflecting a combination of continuing instrumentation sales and increasing 
consumable volumes as the established instrument base increases in the market. The forecast 
growth rates then fall to 2% thereafter. The Directors believe that market benefits will allow the 
product to be sold at a margin in excess of other products sold by the Group. A one percentage 
point increase in the discount rate or a reduction in forecast revenue growth rates in year 2-4 to 
14% would result in an impairment.
The remaining average useful lives of the intangibles are as follows:
Trade name 2–6 years
Customer relations 1–11 years
Trade secrets 4–11 years
Development costs 4-11 years
The Company holds capitalised development costs with a cost and net value of £1,876,000 (2016: 
£1,253,000) and £538,000 (2016: £538,000) respectively. These are amortised over their useful 
life and an amortisation charge of £65,000 (2016: 317,000) has been recognised in the income 
statement in 2017. 58 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc

(c) Credit quality of financial assets
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables 
and other receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, due to the failure of counterparties to perform their 
obligations as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, in relation to each class of recognised 
financial assets, is the carrying amount of those assets as indicated in the accompanying balance 
sheets. 60 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc

Trade receivables 
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired have been assessed 
based on historical information about the counterparty default rate. The Group does not hold any 
other receivable balances with customers, whose past default has resulted in the recovery of the 
receivables balances.
Cash at bank
The credit quality of cash has been assessed by reference to external credit ratings, based on 
reputable credit agencies’ long-term issuer ratings:

(a) Bank borrowings
Bank borrowings mature in 2023 and bear an average fixed coupon of 2.5% annually (2016: 2.81%).
Bank borrowings are secured against certain assets of the Group. The Parent Company has also 
provided guarantees against those bank borrowings which are denominated in foreign currencies.
The Euro denominated borrowings have covenants attached to them. The Group has been 
compliant with these covenants throughout the year.
The bank borrowings are repayable by quarterly instalments.
The Group is not exposed to interest rate changes or contractual re-pricing dates at the end of the 
reporting period, as the borrowings are fixed in nature.
The fair value of both current and non-current borrowings equals their carrying amount, as the 
impact of discounting is not significant.  64 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc

(b) Convertible loan
In 2013 Andrew Webb loaned £200,000 to EKF Molecular Diagnostics Limited in return for a 
convertible loan note. The note was redeemable on 31 December 2017 or convertible under certain 
circumstances on or before 30 November 2017 into shares representing 20% of the share capital 
of EKF Molecular Diagnostics Limited. The principal was split into a debt element and an equity 
element. The equity element is disclosed in Other Reserves. The note is denominated in sterling. In 
July 2017 it was agreed to make repayments of the principal of the debt up to a total of £102,000. 
Mr Webb has waived any rights to interest or to conversion and been granted certain rights to 
participate in any future commercialisation of EKF Molecular’s technology. Following the completion 
of payment of the £102,000, payment of the remaining £98,000 will either be waived, or if agreed 
by both parties, paid to Mr Webb as compensation for waiving his future commercialisation rights.
(c) Finance lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the 
event of default.

27. Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity 
or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. The 
amounts concerned are as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax 
benefit through future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred income tax 
assets of £1,173,000 (2016: £6,374,000) mainly in respect of tax losses amounting to £6,092,000 
(2016: £33,109,000), primarily arising in the UK entities, that can be carried forward against future 
taxable income, as the likely timing of recovery is considered too remote.

The remaining unapproved share options include the following:
• 650,000 options were issued on 7 July 2013 to senior employees at an exercise price of 
27.25p per share. These options are exercisable from the third anniversary of grant with a

maximum term of 10 years. These options vested during the year.
• 500,000 options were issued to a third party on 17 May 2015 at an exercise price of 20p.

On 2 June 2016 two Directors were granted a cash settled share-based incentive award. The awards 
vest if a controlling interest in the Company is acquired by a third party prior to 30 June 2019. In 
these circumstances a minimum amount of £0.3m is payable to each Director, which increases by 
reference to any sale price achieved. The fair value of this award has been calculated at £3,351,000 
(2016: £2,100,000) using a modified form of a Black Scholes model. The key assumptions in the 
model included expected volatility of 39% (2016: 60.2%), a risk free rate of 0.39% (2016: (0.03%)) 
and an assumed acquisition premium and option life. The increase in the liability is largely due to 
the increase in share price over the period. £969,000 (2016: £753,000) has been recognised as 
an expense in administrative expenses in the current year, and £1,722,000 (31 December 2016: 
£753,000) is shown as a liability on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 within trade and other 
payables. The remainder of the charge to the income statement is made up of charges relating to 
equity settled share-based payments relating to share options.

Notes:
1. The Company specifies that only those members registered on the Company’s register of 
members at close of business on 4 May 2018 or if this general meeting is adjourned, at close 
of business on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting shall be entitled to attend 
and vote at the General Meeting.
2. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above, you are entitled to 
appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the General 
Meeting and you should have received a Proxy Form with this notice. You can only appoint a 
proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the Proxy Form.
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the General Meeting 
to represent you. Details of how to appoint the chairman of the General Meeting or another 
person as your proxy using the Proxy Form are set out in the notes to the Proxy Form. If you 
wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the General Meeting you will need to appoint your 
own choice of proxy (not the chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights 
attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights 
attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please contact the Company’s 
registrars at the address set out in note 5.
5. The notes to the Proxy Form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution 
or withhold their vote.
To appoint a proxy using the Proxy Form, the Proxy Form must be:
 (a) completed and signed;
 (b) sent or delivered to Link Asset Services, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Kent BR3 4TU; and
 (c)  received by Link Asset Services, at the address provided in paragraph 5(b) above no 
later than 11.00 a.m. on 4 May 2018.
In the case of a member which is a company, the Proxy Form must be executed under its 
common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the 
company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the Proxy Form is signed (or a duly 
certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the Proxy Form.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a 
proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority 
is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
7. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the 
methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see 
above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment 
received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.  
 Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change 
the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please contact Link Asset Services at 
the address noted in note 5 above. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, 
the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take 
precedence.
8. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a 
signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to 
Link Asset Services at PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Kent, BR3 4TU. In the case of a member 
which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or 
signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power 
of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly 
certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice. The 
revocation notice must be received by Link Asset Services no later than 11.00 a.m. on 4 May 
2018. If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after 
the time specified then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy appointment will 
remain valid.
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the general meeting and 
voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the general meeting in person, 
your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
9. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who 
may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member provided that no more than one 
corporate representative exercises power over the same share.
10. Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands.
11. As at 5.00 p.m. on the day immediately prior to the date of posting of this notice, the 
Company’s issued share capital comprised 457,554,636 Ordinary Shares of 1p each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 5.00 p.m. on the day 
immediately prior to the date of posting of this notice is 457,554,636.  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  75
