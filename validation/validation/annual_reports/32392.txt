*  The Group defines adjusted profit before taxation as statutory profit before tax and amortisation of intangible assets, share-based payment charges and 
IFRS-related discount charges. We believe that this measure of performance eliminates factors which distort period-on-period comparisons in order to provide a 
more comparable position year on year. We believe this information is useful to shareholders and analysts in providing a basis for measuring our financial performance.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Strategy
Point-of-care (POC) testing
VISITECT
®
 CD4
We achieved a significant milestone in attaining formal design 
freeze with our VISITECT
®
 CD4 test for monitoring the immune 
status of people living with HIV following the successful manufacture 
of three pilot batches. Devices from these batches were tested at 
three UK hospital sites, on sufficient numbers of patient samples 
to demonstrate that we now have a method for manufacturing 
devices which consistently meets our design goal specifications 
regarding sensitivity and specificity. 
We have now moved into the validation and verification 
phase of the programme which can be summarised across 
the following activities:
 – manufacturing of validation batches to confirm manufacturing 
robustness/reproducibility;
 – utilising validation batches to verify performance;
 – external performance evaluation trials; and
 – CE mark.
We have selected two sites in the UK and one site in India to undertake 
evaluation studies. This is an important phase in the project and 
we will give ourselves sufficient time to demonstrate that we can 
transfer the product from development to routine manufacturing.
We continually assess the market landscape for this product and it 
seems clear that there is an increasing emphasis on the continued 
need for monitoring CD4 levels in people living with HIV, particularly 
those patients with low CD4 counts who are at significant risk of 
contracting opportunistic infections. The Company has built up 
relationships with a number of key opinion leaders over the years 
and so we have a voice that enables us to input into key stakeholder 
meetings. We have been invited to attend the ninth International 
AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2017) to be held in 
Paris in late July where VISITECT
®
 CD4 will be showcased.
Pune manufacturing facility
We made a significant amount of progress during the year with our 
manufacturing facility in Pune, India. 
In January, we announced that we received certificates of 
accreditation from BSI confirming our Quality Management 
System is compliant with ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003. 
In March, we confirmed the facility underwent an annual inspection 
from the Indian FDA, confirming that the facility is compliant with 
GMP processes for manufacturing, testing, storage and QA, and 
that we were issued with a manufacturing licence which is valid 
until January 2021.
We also announced that we were successful in CE-marking 
and launching our VISITECT
®
 range of malaria tests comprising: 
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf (detection of HRP2 antigen in P. falciparum);
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pan (detection of P. falciparum,  
non-P. falciparum or mixed infections); and
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pv (detection and differentiation 
of P. falciparum and P. vivax).
These products are currently available for general sale through 
business-to-business channels in those countries which do not 
require individual product registration and we are in the process 
of being evaluated for additional regulatory approvals to enable 
the Company to participate in higher volume tender business. 
We are also in the process of evaluating additional rapid tests 
for dengue, syphilis, leptospirosis, brucella and S. typhi.
Allergy automation
In October last year, we reported that we CE-marked our initial 
Allersys
®
 launch panel comprising 41 allergens. Since October, 
we have optimised a further eleven allergens and these are currently 
undergoing their claim support work, which should enable us to 
add them to the menu of tests available for sale. Two initiatives will 
help support the ongoing work to extend the menu beyond the 
initial launch panel, ensuring we enhance our product offering 
on a continuous basis. Firstly, in August last year, we secured a 
Scottish Enterprise research and development grant of £1.8 million 
and this has enabled us to accelerate recruitment of skilled project 
managers and leaders into the scientific team. Secondly, we have 
invested in creating our own in-house protein purification capability 
which will help in the optimisation programme of certain allergens 
that require a higher degree of characterisation to match the 
performance of the market leader.
David Evans 
Non-executive Chairman
I am pleased to be able to 
report progress on a number of 
activities within our operations, 
which I have outlined below www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 05
Strategic Report
Our commercialisation objectives are closely aligned with our 
partner company IDS, which is the manufacturer of the automated 
instrument over which we have exclusive rights to develop and sell 
our allergy tests. We have explored a number of routes in the last 
year on how best to take the partnership forward. Whilst IDS 
previously expressed an interest in acquiring the allergy business, 
we both subsequently concluded that our mutual objectives were 
better served with an enlarged distribution model. I believe we 
have now agreed the main outline terms which should enable 
the formal contract negotiations to proceed and we thank 
shareholders for their patience during this process.
Core business
Our core business is divided into our three main areas 
of operation comprising:
 – Food intolerance;
 – Allergy and autoimmune; and
 – Infectious disease.
Our strategic aims are to ensure that we can drive good growth 
across all three sectors in a way that achieves a balance such that 
we are not over-reliant on any single sector. I have already outlined 
initiatives that support growth in Allergy and autoimmune and 
Infectious disease.
We believe there are further significant opportunities for growth in 
Food intolerance and have made progress in North America, where 
customers are evaluating our products. In China, we are in advanced 
discussions with a partner company which could provide access 
to a large market which is increasingly aware of Food intolerance 
testing products and services.
In relation to our Food Detective
®
 product, the Company has been 
in discussions this year with our notified body, Lloyds Register 
Quality Assurance (LRQA), regarding use of the self-test version of 
the kit. The Company has agreed a timescale to complete some 
corrective actions to LRQA’s satisfaction. In the event that we are 
unable to achieve this, the CE mark for the self-test kit will be 
suspended for a period of time which would have a modest 
impact on revenues and profits.
Financial performance
Group revenue grew by 12% to £14.2 million (2016: £12.7 million) 
with growth in revenue across all three business sectors. As a 
predominantly export business, we benefited from a weaker sterling 
throughout the year, which added £1.1 million to reported revenues 
(2016: £0.2 million). On a constant currency basis, revenue would 
have been ahead of last year by 3%. Gross profit increased to 
£9.2 million (2016: £8.1 million), with an increase in gross profit 
margin to 64.7% (2016: 63.8%). Adjusted profit before tax (statutory 
profit before tax of £0.7 million with add backs for amortisation of 
intangible assets, share-based payment charges and IFRS-related 
discount charges) was £1.1 million (2016: £1.3 million) and adjusted 
earnings per share were 1.1 pence (2016: 1.2 pence), the small 
reduction reflecting an increase in overhead expenditure compared 
to the previous year. Statutory earnings per share were 0.7 pence 
(2016: 0.5 pence).
The Group’s cash position at the year end was £0.7 million 
(2016: £1.3 million), which represented a neutral cash flow in 
the second half of the financial year. We continue to monitor 
our working capital management in the conversion of adjusted 
operating profit (operating profit excluding share-based payments 
and amortisation of intangible assets) into operating cash and the 
conversion factor for the year was 171% (2016: 108%).
Corporate governance
The size and structure of the Board and its Committees are kept 
under review to ensure an appropriate level of governance operates 
throughout the year. The Board is comprised of two Non-executive 
Directors and four Executive Directors who meet frequently during the 
year to discuss strategy and to review progress and outcomes against 
objectives. Board reports containing KPIs, which report on business 
issues by exception, are circulated in advance of each Board meeting, 
which contribute to a more efficient Board process allowing sufficient 
time to consider business-critical issues. The Group is not required to 
comply with the full requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (as an AIM-quoted company) but we believe the Board has 
the skills and the necessary experience to deliver on its plans and 
objectives in a way that enables Non-executive members of the Board 
to challenge and advise the Executive team as appropriate.
The Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee are 
comprised of the two Non-executive Directors and the Board 
believes the current make-up and the number of Committees 
remain appropriate for a group of our size.
Board and employees
There has been no change to the composition of the Board 
throughout the year. Employees remain a key part of our Group’s 
success and we have introduced new training programmes for our 
managers and supervisors to enable them to develop themselves 
to the best of their ability. Wherever possible, we seek to fill new 
roles in the organisation with internal candidates and we have 
been able to promote a number of people in the year.
The Group now has 180 employees around the world and I thank 
them for their hard work and efforts which have achieved much 
progress on a number of fronts this year. 
Outlook
We are encouraged that trading in the first quarter of the new 
financial year is in line with our expectations.
We have made a significant amount of progress with a number 
of key assets that will underpin future growth:
 – Allersys
®
 reagents are now CE-marked with the menu 
continuing to grow;
 – VISITECT
®
 CD4 has achieved design freeze;
 – manufacturing facility in Pune, India, is now fully validated; and
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria has now been CE-marked.
Since December last year, the Company has been seeking to agree 
global distribution terms with its Allersys
®
 licensor (Immunodiagnostic 
Systems Holdings plc (IDS)). The Company believes that it has 
made good progress and the Directors believe that once we get 
beyond the contractual process, the sales and marketing teams 
of both organisations will be capable of making a success of the 
Company’s allergy products. 
CD4 testing remains a practical and necessary marker for assessment 
of the baseline status of HIV infection. We are confident that we will 
meet the remaining challenges within the validation programme 
that will determine our ability to manufacture a product at scale 
which meets the market’s need.
We have also identified a number of organic growth opportunities 
for all our business segments which augurs well for the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Dear fellow shareholder
During the year we have made great progress on our three-year vision 
and are now well positioned to deliver the key aim of accelerated 
growth in all three business divisions.
Food intolerance
 – Expansion of Foodprint
®
 in key market segments is going to 
plan with new accounts expected to start delivering significant 
revenue streams over the next few years. Our R&D team in Ely 
are also making great strides in terms of implementing process 
improvements to allow us to handle the increasing demand 
and deliver key improvements to our customers.
 – Partners in China have been identified and work on the lengthy 
registration process will commence in this financial year.
Allergy and autoimmune
 – Allersys
®
 – 41 allergens CE-marked and we are making substantial 
progress with the next phase of development with a further eleven 
allergens optimised. We believe we have now agreed the main 
outline terms which should enable the formal contract 
negotiations with IDS to proceed.
 – Allergodip
®
 – 80 allergens have now been optimised and 
ongoing work continues with the development of a mobile 
phone app ahead of the initial launch of panels later this year. 
Infectious disease
 – VISITECT
®
 CD4 – Achieved our key milestone of design freeze 
by the end of March 2017 and it has now entered the validation and 
verification phase which is currently progressing to plan. 
 – Pune facility has CE-marked three malaria rapid tests and first 
commercial sales in both India and export have been achieved. This 
is a great example of everyone involved in the project – from India, 
South Africa and the UK – all working together to achieve the 
project goals.
Core business
Segmental revenue performance
Food intolerance
The Food intolerance division has again performed well, producing 
double-digit growth. For this year, total Food intolerance sales 
increased by 13% to £8.00 million (2016: £7.06 million).
Sales of Food Detective
®
 reduced by 10% in the year to £2.06 million 
(2016: £2.29 million). As noted in the half-year results, we took 
a conscious decision to reduce pipeline stocking in two of our 
key markets.
Andrew Shepherd
Chief Executive
IN SUMMARY
•  Group revenue increased by 12% to £14.2 million
•  Adjusted profit before tax of £1.1 million
• Significant progress on three-year growth plan
• Design freeze achieved on VISITECT
®
 CD4
•  CE mark achieved for 41 allergens to run on 
IDS-iSYS platform
We are pleased to announce the 
launch of the VISITECT
®
 Malaria 
range of rapid diagnostic tests.”
Andrew Shepherd Chief Executive
With the Company moving into an 
accelerated growth phase we have 
very exciting times ahead of us www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 09
Strategic Report
Sales of Genarrayt
®
/Foodprint
®
 reagents grew by 34% to £4.67 million 
(2016: £3.47 million), with strong performances in Europe, North 
America and the Middle East. The Group sold a further eight 
instruments in the year, taking the cumulative number of installations 
to 176 instruments in 40 countries, and revenue per instrument 
(excluding Spain) increased by 29% to £23,442 (2016: £18,175). 
The higher percentage growth rate of reagent sales (as compared 
to the overall growth in revenue per instrument) reflects the investment 
that was made into newer North American and Southeast Asian 
markets in the previous year and these markets are seen as an 
increasingly important area for long-term growth. 
Our CNS laboratory service showed an increase of 7% in sales to 
£0.62 million (2016: £0.58 million). Sales were still dominated by 
the markets in the UK and Ireland and we produced and sold 
7,167 patient reports in the year (2016: 7,008), maintaining an 
average price of £86.44 per report (2016: £82.73).
Food intolerance will continue to be a key growth driver and 
contributor to the bottom line. This has been reflected in the 
increase in operational and marketing resource to provide high 
level scientific and technical support for the CNS product range. 
The growth trajectory is expected to continue, with this core business 
supported by increasing the range of products and services in the 
health and well-being market, which now extends to 80 countries.
Allergy and autoimmune
Sales for the Allergy and autoimmune division are comprised 
of Allergy sales of £3.03 million (2016: £2.57 million) and sales 
of Autoimmune products of £0.56 million (2016: £0.59 million), an 
overall increase of 14%. The Allergy sales continue to be derived 
almost exclusively from our Omega Diagnostics GmbH business 
in Germany, where our domestic sales increase of 3% in euro 
terms is a positive contrast to a recent history of decline due to 
reimbursement pressures. In reported sterling terms, the increase 
was 15% due to the weakening of sterling against the euro 
throughout the period. 
Allergy development
Following the CE-marking of 41 allergens in October 2016 we have 
continued to develop further tests to increase the available menu. 
A further eleven allergens have been optimised, so we are on target 
to deliver another 20 allergens this year.
In addition to the Allersys
®
 programme, four new Allergodip
®
 
panels have now been optimised. The introduction of a mobile 
phone app that allows quantification of the test result will assist 
in the marketing of the test to resource-poor countries with limited 
laboratory facilities. 
Infectious disease 
Infectious disease sales increased by 5% to £2.65 million 
(2016: £2.52 million) with the increase due to the weakening 
of sterling against the euro and dollar throughout the period.
We were pleased to announce the launch of the VISITECT

30 years 
of Omega  
Diagnostics 
This year marks the 30-year anniversary since I formed the 
Company. It has been a real mix of excitement and challenges 
and some disappointments, of course, but over the 30 years 
it has been an absolute pleasure to experience Omega 
corporate life and the science that we use on a daily basis, and 
to create and investigate new opportunities and interactions 
with so many people around the world. We are now moving 
into an accelerated growth phase and we have some very 
exciting times ahead of us.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
Core business continued
Segmental revenue performance continued
Infectious disease continued
In the development of the VISITECT
®
 Malaria range we have a 
defined strategy to provide affordable but high quality tests that 
are designed with the user in mind. The devices are easy to use 
and come equipped with all the necessary components to run the 
tests effectively at the point of care. The range is generating good 
interest via business-to-business channels and at the same time we 
continue to work on in-country product registrations and successfully 
achieving global regulatory standards that will enable us to include 
the range in high volume public sector tender exercises.
In addition to the malaria rapid tests we are also evaluating additional 
rapid tests for dengue, syphilis, leptospira, brucella and S. typhi.
Global health update
The past year has seen significant progress in the development of 
VISITECT
®
 CD4, the world’s first semi-quantitative, instrument-free 
rapid test for assessing CD4 baseline status in people living with HIV. 
Having achieved design freeze we have moved the test into validation 
and verification to ensure we can manufacture the device in a robust 
and satisfactory manner. This work will be supported by external 
evaluation testing at HIV laboratories in Glasgow and London that, 
if successful, will allow us to commercialise the product.
The landscape for CD4 testing has changed over the past 
six months; amongst key opinion leaders and policy makers 
there has been a shift in the strategy for utilising CD4 testing 
in the care of people living with HIV. This has resulted in a series 
of regional workshops being held across the African continent 
that Omega Diagnostics has been invited to attend and participate 
in. The resulting output from these activities will see an increasing 
emphasis being placed on CD4 testing to help those people who 
present for care in the advanced stages of the disease with very 
low CD4 cell counts. This group of patients represents more 
than 30% of the overall HIV epidemic. In the advanced stages 
of HIV, patients are increasingly at risk of developing opportunistic 
infections that can dramatically reduce life expectancy. We are 
evaluating opportunities to bring other rapid tests to the market 
that will complement VISITECT
®
 CD4 in helping public health 
practitioners combat HIV in low and middle-income countries.
In our efforts to make Omega Diagnostics a key supplier in the 
global health arena, we have worked hard over the past year 
to redefine our marketing materials with this audience in mind. 
In addition, we continue to develop simple but effective training 
tools that will benefit our customers who use our products in 
remote settings.
Outlook
Food intolerance continues to keep up its good performance 
and we expect to see this continuing in the year ahead with the 
strategic marketing initiatives being planned and executed as 
part of our accelerated growth strategy.
With renewed effort with regards to our ongoing relationship 
with IDS we are looking forward to the eventual launch of the 
initial range of CE-marked Allersys
®
 tests. Expanding the test 
menu as currently envisaged will only help to increase sales 
of these products in the new financial year and beyond. 
We are looking forward to reporting good sales progress over 
the coming year, together with our continuing goal of delivering 
VISITECT
®
 CD4 to the market by the end of this calendar year.
I would like to thank all the Group employees who have made 
great efforts throughout the year in delivering progress in our core 
areas of activity. We are all looking forward to a year of growth 
and further progress.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS OVERVIEW
Providing a range of tests 
for allergy diagnostics
We have successfully optimised 50 Allersys
®
 allergens for use 
on the IDS-iSYS system that are ready for commercial launch.
Our foundations 
In 2010, Omega Diagnostics Group PLC acquired the IVD division 
of allergy and specific immunotherapy specialist Allergopharma 
Joachim Ganzer KG, giving access to a range of allergy tests for 
over 600 allergens. 
This gave the Group a position in allergy testing that could be 
exploited in two ways. First, by driving international sales of current 
products through its existing global distribution network; and second, 
by delivering automated allergy tests in conjunction with 
Immunodiagnostic Systems’ IDS-iSYS system. 
Our markets 
Allergy is defined as a hypersensitivity response by the immune 
system. In the majority of cases, allergic reactions are caused by 
IgE antibodies. IgE mediated allergies are defined by their rapid 
onset and can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild 
(rhinitis) to severe (anaphylaxis). The World Allergy Organisation 
(WAO) estimates that between 30% and 40% of the global population 
is affected by one or more allergic diseases (e.g. asthma, eczema, 
rhinitis, urticaria, food allergy or drug allergy). The allergy diagnostic 
market is forecast to grow steadily at a compound annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of 12.67% for the period 2015–2019.
1
Our products 
The current product range is well established and addresses the 
enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and strip/panel test segments 
of the markets. 
Allergozyme
®
 is a paper disc-based ELISA that quantifies the 
amount of circulating Specific IgE in a patient sample for over 600 
different allergens. This product is largely sold into the German 
domestic market. 
Allergodip
®
 is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) dipstick test for the 
semi-quantitative determination of Specific IgE in serum/plasma. 
Eight panels are available that address regional allergen 
sensitisation patterns.
Allersys
®
 is a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the 
quantitative determination of Total IgE and Specific IgE in serum. 
These reagent kits will operate on Immunodiagnostic Systems’ 
IDS-iSYS automated instrument in the laboratory segment 
of the market. 
Our strategy 
The goal is to build a portfolio of products that enables Omega to 
compete across the automated, strip testing and POC segments 
of the allergy market. 
To address the automated segment, Allersys
®
 will launch in 2017. 
To date, 50 of the most commonly tested allergens have been 
optimised with a plan to increase this to over 100 allergens over 
the next four years. 
To further penetrate the strip/panel test segment, the Group has 
been developing Allergodip
®
 in order to increase the number of 
allergens and allow quantification via a mobile phone app. The 
Group has built up extensive experience in allergy assay development 
and mobile technology quantification that will allow Omega to 
differentiate its products from other offerings in the market.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS OVERVIEW continued
Providing a range of 
tests for food intolerance
Another year of significant growth with success in North America and focus 
on adding complementary health and well-being tests to our portfolio.
Our foundations 
Located in Cambridgeshire, England, Genesis Diagnostics Limited 
and its sister company Cambridge Nutritional Sciences Limited 
are subsidiaries of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC. 
The Company specialises in the development and manufacture of 
kits to aid the detection of immune reactions to food, often described 
as food intolerance or food sensitivity. With a core competency 
in array-based technologies for laboratory and POC markets, 
Genesis/CNS has built a reputation for quality, innovation and 
delivery in its 20+ years of experience in the in-vitro diagnostics 
(IVD) industry. 
Our markets 
Food intolerance/sensitivity testing is a growing market, with the 
public being much more aware of the role their diet plays in their 
health and well-being. The overall market is expected to grow 
steadily at a CAGR of 6% for the period 2015–2019.
1
 
From a medical perspective, the role of gut health and its impact 
on general health and well-being is increasingly understood. Gut 
health is a complex area and a multitude of factors, including gut 
permeability (giving rise to immune reactions to food), microbiome 
and oxidative stress, often give rise to health conditions that need 
to be treated through diet and supplementation. 
Our products 
Food intolerance/sensitivity is defined as a slow or gradual response 
to a food with milder symptoms than an allergy, including bloating, 
stomach and digestive issues, skin reactions, etc. It is believed 
that food sensitivity reactions are related to the antibody IgG. 
Foodprint
®
/Genarrayt
®
 is a laboratory-based system for the testing 
of IgG immune response related food sensitivity. Developed and 
manufactured by the Company it is an innovative, colorimetric 
microarray-based ELISA technology which utilises state-of-the-art 
microarrays that can detect the presence of IgG food-specific 
antibodies to over 220 commonly eaten foods.
Food Detective
®
 is a quick and easy POC test for immune food 
sensitivity that can be used in the privacy of a home at the user’s 
convenience. The test assesses reactions to 59 commonly 
eaten foods.
Our strategy 
The Company has a unique position in the market, offering a 
distinctive range of food intolerance/sensitivity tests that cover a 
selection of applications. On the back of these products the brand 
has developed an excellent reputation with patients and laboratories 
around the world. In addition, the Company has built an impressive 
and stable network of distribution serving over 75 countries with 
a specific skill set within the health and well-being market. 
This positions the Group well for further growth opportunities 
within this testing segment.

Providing a range of tests 
for infectious disease
We have achieved a significant milestone of attaining formal design freeze 
with our VISITECT
®
 CD4 test. We also now have a fully ISO-accredited and Indian 
FDA GMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Pune that has manufactured and 
sold its first CE-marked malaria rapid tests. 
Our foundations 
Located in Alva, Scotland, Omega Diagnostics Limited is a 
subsidiary of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and manufactures 
and sells a range of immunoassay tests, predominantly for 
infectious diseases. Its main product line includes a range of 
screening and confirmatory tests for syphilis. In recent times the 
subsidiary has built up a capability and capacity for the development 
and manufacturing of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for use in 
resource-poor settings in developing countries. 
Our markets 
Global health is defined as the health of populations in a global 
context or “the area of study, research and practice that places a 
priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all 
people worldwide”. Its core focus is to save lives, reduce or eliminate 
disease and have an impact on public health. 
Essentially, the route to market is through a mix of policy makers, 
aid agencies and financial stakeholders with interactive development 
strategies that aim to achieve aggressive targets set by the United 
Nations. Known as the Sustainable Development Goals, the targets 
for improvements in health and well-being are to: 
a) diagnose those people at risk; 
b) provide treatment to people living with disease; and 
c)  end the epidemics of those diseases that place the heaviest 
burden on people in the poorest regions of the world. 
Our products 
The current portfolio of products includes, amongst others, a 
range of serological tests for both the screening and confirmation 
of syphilis, a range of latex serology tests and a range of stained 
bacterial suspensions to detect, identify and quantify suspected 
salmonella, brucella or rickettsial infections. 
In addition, there is an existing range of rapid diagnostic tests 
under the VISITECT
®
 brand designed to detect malaria, syphilis, 
leptospirosis and dengue fever. 
The VISITECT
®
 range will be extended by the successful 
commercialisation of VISITECT
®
 CD4 as well as transferring the 
manufacture of the existing range to our facility in Pune. 
Our strategy 
Since its inception Omega Diagnostics Limited has manufactured 
in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) which have been successfully exported 
for nearly 30 years. However, these products are coming under 
threat from advances in technology and competitive activity. 
The formation of Omega’s Global health division has allowed us to 
formulate a strategy aimed at delivering innovative diagnostic solutions 
that address significant unmet diagnostic needs and establish a 
profitable and growing business with mid to long-term outlook. 
Omega’s partnership with the Burnet Institute has focused efforts 
in expanding rapid test manufacturing capabilities and providing 
a means to diversify routes to market via the non-governmental 
organisation (NGO) arena and associated funding. 
To achieve our objectives, we utilise strong alliances with leading 
research institutions and mutually beneficial third-party commercial 
partnerships enabling access to the most relevant technologies 
for POC testing. We will focus on lateral flow as the preferred 
platform which will allow us to exploit Omega’s high quality 
manufacturing facilities in Alva (UK) and Pune (India).

Strategic Report
A day in the life of global health
During the summer months in South Africa, Omega Diagnostics 
donates seedlings and compost to a small HIV clinic in a local 
Cape Town township. It has been an ongoing activity over the 
past few years and a collaborative effort of us giving the funds 
and lending a hand to a passionate and committed community 
health worker who has the desire to feed patients visiting the 
clinic. Her name is Vutomi and she has been our inspiration 
to support getting the vegetable garden started. Vutomi has a 
background in HIV counselling and works tirelessly on a daily 
basis to educate communities on HIV transmission and infection 
risks, counselling on antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis 
medication and offering support to those in need.
This year has been difficult for the vegetable garden. The Western Cape 
was hit by an extreme summer drought and watering of gardens 
was prohibited. This meant that the usually busy summer season 
in the vegetable garden was halted. Just as the drought ended, 
Cape Town was hit by a storm resulting in major flooding and damage 
to infrastructure. We hope to be able to share more about our 
community involvement and the vegetable garden soon.
In the run up to the International AIDS Conference in Paris in 
July 2017, and following a very successful AIDS Conference in 
Durban in 2016, we have decided to continue to support a wonderful 
women’s empowerment programme in the Valley of a Thousand 
Hills, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, called Woza Moya, Hillcrest 
AIDS Centre Trust. Zulu women are renowned bead workers and 
this project focuses on providing opportunities for women, often 
gogos (grannies), to earn an income to support their families. 
The HIV epidemic continues to heavily affect young people in 
KwaZulu-Natal and gogos are often left to raise their grandchildren 
when their own children die due to HIV-related complications. 
We have just ordered another box of beautiful AIDS ribbons that 
we will be handing out at the International AIDS Conference in Paris 
in July 2017 and look forward to spreading the word of the work to 
support local communities being done by this great organisation.
We continue to provide malaria and syphilis kits to our friends at 
Comfort Rwanda and Comfort Congo who support Rusayo Clinic 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The area that Rusayo 
is based in is home to a diverse range of people including the internally 
displaced, refugees, rape survivors, ex-child soldiers and communities 
of ethnic Baka Pygmies. Comfort Congo has made it its mission to 
offer support wherever it can and we are proud to support this 
initiative supporting healthcare strengthening where it is most 
needed, at the point of care.
We have also been busy developing a range of training tools to 
be utilised in training community health workers to use VISITECT
®
 
CD4 and our VISITECT
®
 Malaria range. Much time has been spent 
on illustrating and designing training booklets using adult learning 
and education principles. This has encouraged different team 
members’ involvement with lots of discussion, planning and 
feedback. We are committed to providing training and support 
materials to all who will be using our tests.

RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The long-term success of the Group depends on the continual review, 
assessment and control of the key business risks it faces. The Group’s 
current principal risks and uncertainties are briefly outlined below.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk and description Mitigating actions Change
General economic and political 
conditions
The Group may be faced with changes in the general economic 
climate in each territory in which it operates that may adversely 
affect the financial performance of the Group. Factors which 
may contribute include the level of direct and indirect 
competition against the Group, industrial disruption, rate of 
growth of the Group’s product segments and interest rates.
The Group seeks to 
mitigate this risk by conducting 
operations on a broad 
geographic basis and by 
introducing new technologies 
to remain innovative.
The current general economic 
climate has been dominated by 
a number of political changes over 
the last twelve months.
Brexit
The vote by the UK to leave the EU has created increased 
uncertainty for the future. The Group anticipates that the 
process of withdrawing from the EU will be complex and 
take time. There can be no certainty regarding the terms 
of withdrawal at this stage.
The Group earns a significant 
proportion of its revenues in 
currencies other than sterling, 
which can help to mitigate the 
impact of withdrawal.
The climate of uncertainty has 
increased following the recent 
UK general election.
Regulatory risk
The manufacturing, marketing and use of the Group’s products 
are subject to regulation by government and regulatory agencies 
in many countries. Of particular importance is the requirement to 
obtain and maintain approval for a product from the applicable 
regulatory agencies to enable the Group’s products to be 
marketed. Approvals can require clinical evaluation of data 
relating to safety, quality and efficacy of a product. Failure to 
comply with the various regulatory laws can have adverse 
consequences including increased costs, restrictions, recalls 
or product suspensions.
The Group has increased 
its resource in this area during 
the year and conducts its 
operations within recognised 
quality assurance systems 
and undergoes external 
assessment to ensure 
compliance with these 
systems.
The risk is unchanged in the 
year in that known changes to 
the IVD regulations are already 
being planned for by the Group. 
The Group also uses external 
consultancies to assess 
and strengthen its quality 
management system.

Strategic Report
Risk and description Mitigating actions Change
Funding risk
The success of growing the business can sometimes 
depend on the ability of the Directors to access external 
funding, of which there can be no guarantee, beyond the 
level of existing internal cash generation.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
this risk by maintaining good 
relationships with a number 
of funding sources, including 
shareholders and banks 
that could provide additional 
debt facilities.
The Group has just renewed its 
overdraft at an increased level of 
£2.0 million (2016: £1.7 million) 
which is expected to revert to 
£1.7 million at the end of the 
first half of the new financial 
year. Equity funding markets 
may experience volatility with 
the latest UK general election 
delivering a hung parliament. 
Eurozone risk
The euro area combines 19 countries with multiple domestic 
policies all having to operate under common monetary 
conditions. The legacy of the financial crisis and differing 
policy choices will continue to lead to uncertainty and may 
lead to disruption in investment choices.
The Group monitors those 
countries under pressure 
and mitigates the risk in those 
countries where it has trading 
relationships with tighter credit 
control procedures and credit 
limits where necessary.
Political uncertainty and the rise 
of populism in France, Italy and the 
Netherlands could maintain higher 
uncertainty for longer, in turn 
continuing to hamper investment.
Development risk
The Group has undertaken a similar level of development 
compared to the prior year with the aim of launching new 
products in the future. 
There is no guarantee that development activity will lead to 
the future launch of products. Such development activity can 
meet technical hurdles that are unable to be overcome and 
market and competition activity can render the output from 
development activities obsolete. Poor product evaluations 
could lead to delays in approvals and product launches.
The Group seeks to mitigate 
the risk around development 
activities by ensuring that new 
product candidates undergo a 
rigorous screening programme. 
Development programmes are 
planned in accordance with 
recognised industry quality 
standards, managed by people 
with the requisite skills. 
The Group has now completed 
the optimisation of 52 Allersys
®
 
allergens which meet design goal 
parameters and we believe we have 
made good progress in agreeing 
global distribution terms with IDS.
VISITECT
®
 CD4 has achieved 
design freeze and three product 
variants of VISITECT
®
 Malaria have 
now been CE-marked and launched.
Technology risk
Competition introduces new technology that competes with 
the Group’s current portfolio which is disruptive in nature.
The Group closely monitors the 
market on a continual basis.
The Group continues to invest 
in development and innovation 
to maintain market share.
Pricing environment
Competition offering lower prices for similar products to those 
of the Group.
The Group has implemented 
strategic sourcing to drive down 
the cost of goods. The Group 
regularly reviews manufacturing 
processes and production 
batch sizes.
The Group is aware of increased 
price competition for some of 
its products and has recruited 
a strategic sourcing manager 
to implement its strategy.
Key employees
The Group operates in an industry where the recruitment, 
training and retention of talented people is critical to the Group 
being able to deliver successfully on its strategies and objectives.
The Group aims to offer 
competitive salary and benefits 
packages which align the 
interests of employees with 
shareholders. The Group 
also recognises and places 
importance on training and 
personal development.
The Group monitors trends in the 
industry and undertook a UK-wide 
salary benchmarking exercise in 
the year which led to a number 
of people receiving a higher level 
of remuneration. Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 18
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Financial performance
Our core business recorded headline growth in revenue across all 
three divisions. Total revenue increased by 11.8% to £14.2 million 
(2016: £12.7 million), with both the Food intolerance division and 
the Allergy and autoimmune division recording double-digit revenue 
growth of 13.3% and 13.6% respectively. Food intolerance was 
supported by a strong growth in Foodprint
®
 sales to £4.7 million 
(2016: £3.5 million), more than offsetting a reduction in sales of 
Food Detective
®
 to £2.1 million (2016: £2.3 million) as some customers 
reduced stock levels. The Allergy and autoimmune division benefited 
from a growth in allergy sales in Germany to €3.6 million (2016: 
€3.4 million), offsetting a small reduction in autoimmune sales to 
£0.56 million (2016: £0.59 million). The Infectious disease division also 
recorded growth of 5.6% in revenue to £2.7 million (2016: £2.5 million). 
Revenue across all three divisions benefited by a combined 
£1.1 million (2016: £0.2 million) due to weaker sterling exchange 
rates following the country’s decision in the EU referendum.
Gross profit increased by 13.3% to £9.2 million (2016: £8.1 million), 
helped by an increase in gross margin percentage to 64.7% 
(2016: 63.8%). Overheads increased by £0.8 million to £8.5 million 
(2016: £7 .7 million). Administration costs have increased by £0.5 million, 
principally due to higher costs in the UK relating to undertaking a 
salary benchmarking exercise and implementing a more formal 
management training programme. Selling and marketing costs have 
increased by £0.3 million with a modest increase in costs in India and 
with the higher proportion occurring in Germany, where there has 
been a need to upskill in sales management. Other operating income 
reduced by £0.3 million on the prior year because that year included 
the final amortisation of a grant received from Unitaid in 2014.
Adjusted profit before tax (statutory profit before tax of £0.7 million 
with add backs for amortisation of intangibles, share-based payment 
charges and IFRS-related discount charges) was £1.1 million 
compared to £1.3 million the year before as the size of the add 
backs referred to above were lower by £0.2 million than in the 
previous year. Segmental performance as presented in the notes 
to the financial statements still shows that the Food intolerance 
division is the only profitable segment right now, but our plans to 
address the shortfall remain the same, with opportunities for Allersys
®
 
and VISITECT
®
 CD4 as outlined throughout this Strategic Report.
Taxation
Our UK companies continue to benefit from government policies 
on tax that encourage investment in research and development 
activities. In the year, adjusted tax losses of £0.6 million for the year 
to 31 March 2016 were surrendered for cash at a rate of 14.5%, 
generating a cash rebate of £0.1 million. We still have cumulative 
tax losses of £2.9 million for years ended up to 31 March 2014 that 
are carried forward for future offset. The current-year tax credit 
of £0.1 million (2016: £0.1 million tax charge) reflects a lower level 
of losses surrendered in the year versus the prior year.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share were 1.1 pence versus 1.2 pence in 
the prior year. The difference is due mainly to the small reduction 
in adjusted profit before tax, as described above, leading to adjusted 
profit after tax of £1.19 million versus £1.26 million in the prior year, 
calculated on a fully diluted 109.8 million (2016: 109.5 million) 
shares in issue. 
Research and development
As key development programmes continued to make progress, 
we increased investment in research and development to a total 
of £2.37 million (2016: £1.74 million), representing 16.6% of Group 
turnover. Expenditure on our Allersys
®
 project increased to just under 
£1.1 million (2016: £0.95 million) as we completed the claim support 
work and compiled the technical file leading to CE-marking 41 allergens 
in October. Expenditure on VISITECT
®
 CD4 also increased to 
£0.62 million (2016: £0.49 million) as we achieved design freeze of the 
product following the successful manufacture of three pilot batches.

Strategic Report
We also incurred £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) on further 
developing our POC allergy dipstick test, Allergodip
®
, for use in 
doctors’ offices. Other minor areas of expenditure included smaller 
projects covering food extract optimisation and completion of the 
malaria technology transfer into Pune, India. Of the total expenditure, 
£2.2 million (2016: £1.5 million) has been capitalised on the balance 
sheet in accordance with IAS 38 – Development Costs whilst earlier 
stage R&D expenditure of £0.2 million (2016: £0.26 million) has 
been expensed through the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets have increased to a total of £15.6 million 
(2016: £13.5 million), comprising goodwill of £4.7 million, separately 
identifiable intangible assets from previous acquisitions totalling 
£3.0 million and capitalised development costs of £7.9 million. 
Goodwill
There has been no impairment of goodwill on any of the acquisitions 
to date. Goodwill of £4.7 million (2016: £4.6 million) has increased 
by £0.1 million relating to the retranslation of goodwill to £1.3 million 
(2016: £1.2 million) in acquiring the Allergy IVD business in Germany 
in 2010. £0.4 million arose on acquiring Co-Tek in 2009 and 
£3.0 million arose on acquiring Genesis/CNS in 2007.
Intangible assets
Separately identifiable intangible assets have been recognised in 
connection with past acquisitions: £2.0 million on Genesis/CNS, 
of which £1.0 million has been amortised to date; £0.1 million 
on Co-Tek, which has been fully amortised; and £1.7 million on 
Omega Diagnostics GmbH, of which £1.3 million has been amortised 
to date. A purchased licence of £1.5 million relates to the exclusive 
global access rights to the IDS-iSYS platform for allergy testing, 
which, to date, has not been amortised. Minor capitalised 
software costs amount to £0.1 million.
Capitalised development costs
Capitalised development costs of £2.2 million have been incurred 
in the year and, as described above, bring the cumulative spend 
to date on all projects to £7.9 million. A breakdown of the project 
expenditure is as follows:
2017 2016

Total 7,872,251 5,667,296
There has been no amortisation of these capitalised development 
costs in the years up to 31 March 2017 but the amortisation of 
these costs, along with the purchased licence referred to above, 
will only start after commercialisation of these assets. As stated on 
previous occasions, this particular subset of amortisation charges 
will not be added back in the computation of the Group’s routinely 
reported adjusted profit before tax.
Property, plant and equipment
The Group maintained its expenditure on fixed assets at a similar 
level to last year at £0.6 million (2016: £0.6 million). The largest element 
included £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) invested in Alva to ensure 
continued compliance with overseas country regulatory audits and to 
equip the laboratory with the means to undertake protein purification 
and separation techniques in support of the Allersys
®
 development 
programme. £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million) was spent on 
Genesis/CNS to alleviate certain space constraints with the facility 
and £0.1 million (2016: £Nil) was spent in Germany on laboratory 
equipment and instruments supplied on loan to the customer base.
Financing
The Group has a long-standing relationship with Bank of Scotland 
as principal bankers to the Group and, in May of this year, we agreed 
an overdraft renewal for an increased facility of £2.0 million 
(2016: £1.7 million) which is expected to revert to £1.7 million at the 
end of the first half of the new financial year. In addition to the overdraft, 
the bank provided an asset finance facility in the year of up to 
£1.0 million to fund the purchase of new plant and machinery. 
£0.2 million of this facility was drawn down in the year, repayable 
over five years, and the Company expects to roll over the balance 
for another year from the end of July 2017. 
Operating cash flow
The Group monitors its cash requirement carefully and it is a key 
priority to manage working capital efficiently and to be effective in 
converting operating income into cash. Cash inflow from operating 
activities during the year was £2.01 million (2016: £1.45 million). 
The Group has achieved a conversion rate of adjusted operating 
profit (operating profit plus amortisation of intangible assets plus 
share-based payments) to operating cash of 171% (2016: 108%). 
We ended the year with cash reserves of £0.7 million (2016: 
£1.30 million) which means we were cash neutral in the second 
half of the financial year.
Foreign exchange
The Group has investments in overseas operations and conducts 
trading transactions in currencies other than sterling. The principal 
currencies used and the average foreign exchange rates in the 
year were as follows:
 2017 2016
£ £
Sterling/US dollar 1.30 1.50
Sterling/euro 1.189 1.368
Sterling/Indian rupee 87.18 98.22
Profit and loss account
The Group has foreign-denominated bank accounts to allow for 
the receipt and settlement of amounts in connection with its normal 
trading operations. These transactions are subject to timing differences 
between when they are transacted and when they are settled, which 
can give rise to foreign exchange differences. Foreign-denominated 
receivables, payables and bank balances are restated into sterling 
at closing balance sheet dates, which also gives rise to foreign 
exchange differences. During the year, the Group benefited from 
an exchange gain of £64,000 (2016: £6,000) on these transactions 
which has been credited through the income statement. The increase 
in the gain reflects the weakening of sterling generally following the 
EU referendum result as noted above.
Other comprehensive income
The Group has net assets in Germany and India, held in fully 
owned subsidiaries. The original investments in these subsidiaries 
are held at historic exchange rates. The difference between these 
historic balances and their restated amounts at the most recent 
closing balance sheet rates gives rise to movements which are 
recorded through other comprehensive income and carried as a 
balance sheet reserve. During the year, there has been a gain of 
£423,000 (2016: £261,000) on the retranslation of foreign 
operations of £315,000 in Germany and £108,000 in India.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
As an AIM-quoted company, the Group is not required to produce 
a Corporate Governance Report and does not comply fully with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. However, 
the Directors are committed to providing information on an open 
basis and present their Corporate Governance Report as follows:
The Board of Directors

The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has met on two occasions during the year 
and once since the year end. The Committee is comprised of 
David Evans, as Chairman, and William Rhodes and has primary 
responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring 
that the financial performance of the Group is properly measured 
and reported on, and reviewing reports from the Group’s auditors 
relating to the Group’s accounting and financial reporting, in all cases 
having due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Committee 
shall also review preliminary results announcements, summary 
financial statements, significant financial returns to regulators and 
any financial information contained in certain other documents, 
such as announcements of a price-sensitive nature.
The Committee considers and makes recommendations to the 
Board, to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal 
of the Group’s external auditors. The Committee also oversees 
the relationship with the external auditors, including approval of 
remuneration levels, approval of terms of engagement and assessment 
of their independence and objectivity. In so doing, they take into 
account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and 
the relationship with the auditors as a whole, including the provision 
of any non-audit services. Ernst & Young LLP have been auditors 
to Omega Diagnostics Limited (ODL) since 2000 and were appointed 
as auditors to the Group following completion of the reverse 
takeover of ODL in September 2006.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls and has considered the need for an 
internal audit function. At this stage of the Group’s size and 
development, the Committee has decided that an internal audit 
function is not required as the Group’s internal control system 
in place is appropriate for its size. The Committee will review 
this position on an annual basis.
The Committee also reviews the Group’s arrangements for its 
employees to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. The Committee 
ensures that such arrangements allow for independent 
investigation and follow-up action.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has met on three occasions during 
the year. The Committee is comprised of David Evans, as Chairman, 
and William Rhodes and has primary responsibility for determining 
and agreeing with the Board the remuneration of the Company’s 
Chief Executive, Chairman, Executive Directors, Company Secretary 
and such other members of the Executive management as it is 
designated to consider. The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors of the Board. No Director or manager shall be involved 
in any decisions regarding their own remuneration.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. 
Such a system can only provide reasonable assurance against 
misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors financial controls through the setting and 
approval of an annual budget and the regular review of monthly 
management accounts. Management accounts contain a number 
of indicators that are designed to reduce the possibility of 
misstatement in financial statements. www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 23

Where the management of operational risk requires outside advice, 
this is sought from expert consultants, and the Group receives this 
in the areas of employment law and health and safety management.
The Group is compliant with industry standard quality assurance 
measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communication with 
its shareholders. The Group maintains informative websites for 
Omega Diagnostics Limited, Cambridge Nutritional Sciences 
Limited and Omega Diagnostics GmbH containing information 
likely to be of interest to existing and new investors. In addition, the 
Group retains the services of financial PR consultants, providing 
an additional contact point for investors. The Board encourages 
shareholder participation at its Annual General Meeting, where 
shareholders can be updated on the Group’s activities and plans.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Strategic Report, which runs from pages 2 to 19. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 18 and 19. In addition, Note 21 to the financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for its 
financial risk management objectives and details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Group has recently secured a £2.0 million 
overdraft facility for the period through to 30 September 2017 and 
firm indication of support from the bank that they will renew the 
facility at 30 September 2017 for the period through to the end 
of June 2018 at a level of £1.7 million. This, together with a 
cash-generative core business and the application of working 
capital discipline, means that the Group maintains cash levels 
within its business to meet its short and longer-term objectives.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully and fully capitalise 
on the new product opportunities despite continued uncertainties 
with the macroeconomic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.

aware of that information.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year end. Under company law, 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial position of the 
Group and Company, financial performance of the Group and cash flows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing 
the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance;
 – state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the Group and Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 28
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the members of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 which comprise 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
consolidated cash flow statement, Company balance sheet, Company statement of changes in equity, Company cash flow statement 
and the related Notes 1 to 21. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 27, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Group Financial 
Statements to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 – the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have identified 
no material misstatements in the Strategic Report or Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the year ended 31 March 2017 Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 36
1 Authorisation of financial statements
The financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of Directors on 29 June 2017, and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. 
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on AIM.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements. These financial statements are presented in sterling and have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In relation to IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, the Group has identified the Executive Board as the chief operating decision maker with 
responsibility for decisions over the allocation of resources to operating segments and for the monitoring of their performance. The Group 
reports performance of the following three segments:
 – Allergy and autoimmune;
 – Food intolerance; and
 – Infectious disease and Other.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and the entities it controls 
(its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, 
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting 
policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.
Going concern 
The Group has a committed overdraft facility of £2 million provided by Bank of Scotland on 30 May 2017 for the period through to 
30 September 2017 and firm indication of support from the bank that they will renew the facility at 30 September 2017 for the period 
through to the end of June 2018 at a level of £1.7 million. It is this firm indication of support from the bank that supports the Director’s 
conclusion to present the accounts on a going concern basis.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill 
is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired a charge is made to the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at 
business segment level or statutory Company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition at fair value at the acquisition date, 
the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives, 
with charges included in administration costs, as follows:
Technology assets  – 5–20 years
Customer relationships – 5–10 years
Supply agreements  – 5 years
Licences/software  – 5–20 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research and initial feasibility work is written off through the income statement as incurred. Thereafter, expenditure on 
product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. The stage at which it is probable that 
the product will generate future economic benefits is when the following criteria have been met: technical feasibility; intention and ability 
to sell the product; availability of resources to complete the development of the product; and the ability to measure the expenditure 
attributable to the product. The useful life of the intangible asset is determined on a product-by-product basis, taking into consideration 
a number of factors. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis as follows:
Land and property  – 33 years, straight line with no residual value
Leasehold improvements – ten years, straight line with no residual value
Plant and machinery – three to ten years, straight line with no residual value
Motor vehicles  – five years, straight line with no residual value
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives are reviewed annually 
and, where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
Impairment of assets
The Group and Company assess at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group and Company make an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset 
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their net present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. Impairment losses on continuing 
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is defined as standard cost or purchase price and includes all 
direct costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling 
price less any further costs expected to be incurred prior to completion and disposal.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at the lower of original invoice amount and recoverable 
amount. A provision for doubtful amounts is made when there is objective evidence that collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Significant financial difficulty or significantly extended settlement periods are considered to be indicators of impairment. Normal average 
payment terms vary from payment in advance to 90 days. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as remote.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less.
Financial instruments
Under IAS 39, financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial assets held by the Company are trade and other receivables and cash. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities held by the Company are trade and other payables and bank borrowings.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
For long-term bank borrowings stated at amortised cost, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the borrowing instrument are 
recognised as an interest expense over the life of the instrument.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition 
of the new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised.
Company’s investments in subsidiaries
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 38

Presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the prevailing 
rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the year. The trading results of the overseas 
subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate ruling during the year, with the exchange difference between the average rates 
and the rates ruling at the balance sheet date being taken to reserves. Any differences arising on the translation of the opening net investment 
in the overseas subsidiaries and of applicable foreign currency loans are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes. Sales of 
goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This will be when goods have 
been dispatched and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue relates to the sale of medical diagnostic kits.
Grants
Grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be met, usually 
on submission of a valid claim for payment. Grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are 
released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments. Revenue grants are 
credited to the income statement as and when the relevant expenditure is incurred.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter 
of their lease period and useful life. The corresponding lease or hire purchase obligation is capitalised in the balance sheet as a liability. 
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks remain with the lessor, are charged against profits 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
For equity-settled transactions, the Group measures the award by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and 
it is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service and performance (vesting conditions), other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be 
non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining grant date fair 
value. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of vesting conditions and of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised 
over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair 
value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in 
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement. www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 39

Pensions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year 
in which they are payable.
The Group also operates two defined benefit plans in Germany, which are closed to new members. Obligations under defined benefit 
plans are measured at discounted present values by actuaries, while plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing 
costs of pensions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise and are recognised separately. The difference 
between actual and expected returns on assets during the year, including changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 – where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
 – deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax and deferred tax are charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity if they relate to items that 
are credited or charged in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax and deferred tax are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are as follows:
Carrying value of intangible assets
Management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets, having reference to future economic benefits 
expected to be derived from use of the asset. Economic benefits are based on the fair values of estimated future cash flows. Further 
analysis of the estimates and judgements is disclosed in Note 8.
Carrying value of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash flow projections of cash-generating units that give rise to the 
goodwill. Where the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference. 
Further analysis of the estimates and judgements is disclosed in Note 8.
Deferred tax assets
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies and having regard to their 
strategic planning processes when making these judgements. Prospective products undergo an internal screening process before 
significant resources are committed to development, increasing the chances of successful commercialisation and the ability to generate 
future profits. The balance at 31 March 2017, which will be offset against future profits expected to be generated from the prospects for 
Allersys

 and anticipated output from the Pune facility in India, leads management to conclude to carry the 
deferred tax asset in full. The carrying value of the deferred tax asset at 31 March 2017 is £1,651,945 (2016: £1,426,205). Further details 
are contained in Note 14. Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 40

The standard rate of UK corporation tax reduced from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015. During the year to 31 March 2016 the Finance Act (No.2) 2015 
was substantively enacted. The Finance Act (No.2) 2015 includes legislation which will further reduce the corporation tax rate to 19% from 
1 April 2017, and to 18% from 1 April 2020. The Chancellor then announced in his budget on 16 March 2016 that there would be a further 
1% reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 17% on 1 April 2020. This further rate reduction was included in the Finance Bill 2016, which 
received Royal Assent on 15 September 2016. As all reductions in tax rates were enacted at the balance sheet date, the deferred tax 
balances as at 31 March 2017 have been recognised at a rate of 17% as this is the rate at which the majority of the timing differences 
are expected to reverse.  Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 44

The share-based payment plans are described below.
EMI Option Scheme and Unapproved Option Scheme
The plans are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plans, share options are granted to 
Directors and employees of the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. 
The options vest one year after the date of grant and do not require to be the subject of any performance criteria. The scheme rules allow 
for performance criteria to be applied in appropriate cases.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative. www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 45

Second Unapproved Option Scheme (SUOS)
The plan is an equity-settled plan and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plan, share options may be granted 
to third parties for provision of services to the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the 
date of grant. The options vest three years after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Third Unapproved Option Scheme (TUOS)
The plan is an equity-settled plan and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plan, share options may be granted 
to Directors of the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. The options 
vest three years after the date of grant and are subject to performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Under the EMI Option Scheme no options lapsed during the year and a further 40,000 were granted. Under the TUOS during the year 
no options were granted.

The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of the options’ life due to the lack of any historical data on the 
exercise period of these options. The assumption takes into account the experience of employees and Directors and is not necessarily 
indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the option is indicative of future 
trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill 
is indicated in the table above. The net book value of goodwill above for Genesis/CNS amounts to £3,016,892 (2016: £3,016,892), 
for Co-Tek amounts to £332,986 (2016: £332,986) and for Omega Diagnostics GmbH amounts to £1,353,287 (2016: £1,250,282).
The recoverable amount of Genesis/CNS and Co-Tek has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow 
projections based on the actual results for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the financial budget approved by the Board covering 
the period to 31 March 2020, with projected cash flows for the year ending 31 March 2021 based on a growth rate of 3% per annum.
The key assumptions used in the budget for Genesis/CNS are the sales projections which are predicated on the continued success of 
Genarrayt
®
 and Food Detective
®
. The key assumption used in the budget for Co-Tek is the growth in sales of the Company’s Micropath™ 
range of products.
The recoverable amount of Omega Diagnostics GmbH has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections 
based on the actual results for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the financial budget approved by the Board covering the period to 
31 March 2020, with projected cash flows for the year ending 31 March 2021 based on a growth rate of 3% per annum.
The budget for Omega Diagnostics GmbH assumes continued sales in the German market and increasing export sales from an extension 
to the allergens on the Allergodip
®
 test.
Given the level of the development spend detailed in Note 8 a value in use calculation has been prepared to support both the VISITECT
®
 
CD4 and Allersys
®
 project costs. The recoverable amount for VISITECT
®
 CD4 has been determined based on projections through to 
March 2021 assuming an increased number of unit sales each year as the product achieves market acceptance. The projections used 
assume that management will overcome the final challenges and bring the product to market. The VISITECT
®
 CD4 test represents a unique 
opportunity to meet a large unmet global health need. The outcome to the development project is likely to lead to a recoverable amount 
which is either significantly higher or significantly lower than the current carrying amount of the asset, depending on the respective 
success or otherwise of the development programme. www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 47
Financial Statements
8 Intangibles continued
Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles continued
The recoverable amount for the Allersys
®
 project has been determined based on projections through to March 2021 as well as the 
inclusion of a terminal value, again assuming an increasing number of tests sold each year as the product increases market acceptance 
and penetration. We note that the carrying value of development costs relating to Allersys
®
 are underpinned by our ability to agree global 
distribution terms with our Allersys
®
 licensor, IDS. The Directors believe that they have made good progress to secure this deal and are 
confident that once the contractual process is completed, this will give more certainty to the future cash flows underpinning the carrying 
value of £7,907,450 relating to the Allersys
®
 project, being capitalised development costs of £5,069,500, licence fee of £1,484,663 
and goodwill of £1,353,287.
In all cases, the Company also makes assumptions in regard to having sufficient production personnel to cope with increased volumes. 
The discount rate applied to cash flows is 12.94% (2016: 12.94%) for the Group, which takes account of other risks specific to each 
segment such as currency risk, geography and price risk. The discount rate is the weighted average cost of the pre-tax cost of debt 
financing and the pre-tax cost of equity financing. As a result of our impairment review, there has been no impairment to the carrying 
value of goodwill or intangibles.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on each of the impairment tests. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible 
further change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause any of the carrying amounts to exceed 
the relevant recoverable amount.

18 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates pension schemes for the benefit of its UK and overseas employees.
Details of the defined contribution schemes for the Group’s employees are given below in Note (a). Details of the defined benefit schemes 
for the Group’s German employees and details relating to these schemes are given below in Note (b). During the year the Group accounted 
for these pension schemes under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits.
(a) Defined contribution schemes
The Group makes contributions to personal plans of employees on a defined contribution basis. The Group does not have ownership 
of the schemes, with individual plans being arrangements between the employee and pension provider. For new hires in Germany, 
after 1 January 2011, the support fund (LV 1871 Unterstützungskasse e.V.) is the defined contribution scheme used. The total Group 
contributions for the year amounted to £151,214 (2016: £114,827).
(b) Defined benefit schemes
The Deutscher Pensionsfonds AG and the LV 1871 Unterstützungskasse e.V. schemes give the rights to defined future benefits. 
Of these benefits the past service component is based on years of service and salary as of 1 January 2011 and is provided by the 
Deutscher Pensionsfonds AG. The remaining benefits based on years of service after 1 January 2011 as well as salary increases are 
provided by the LV 1871 Unterstützungskasse e.V. scheme. These are mainly dependent on the number of earning years and salary level 
at pension age. The commitments are covered through an insurance company and are compliant with the requirements of German 
insurance laws. Pension costs relating to each scheme operating in Germany are charged in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. 
Formal valuations of each scheme have been carried out by Towers Watson (Reutlingen) GmbH, who are independent, professionally 
qualified actuaries, on 5 May 2017 using the following assumptions:
2017 2016
Discount rate 2.00% 2.00%
Future salary increases 2.50% 2.50%

20 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Diluting events are excluded from the calculation when 
the average market price of ordinary shares is lower than the exercise price.

Financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, credit, liquidity and interest rate. 
These risks are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in more than one currency jurisdiction and is therefore exposed to currency risk on the retranslation of the income 
statement and the balance sheet of its overseas subsidiaries from euros and rupees into its functional currency of pounds sterling. 
The Company funds its subsidiaries by a mixture of equity and intercompany loan financing and these balances are subject to exchange 
rate movements that can give rise to movements in equity. The Group also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than 
the functional currency, principally in euros and US dollars. The Group has US dollar and euro-denominated bank accounts and, where 
possible, the Group will offset currency exposure where purchases and sales of goods and services can be made in these currencies. 
The Group’s non-sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates. It is currently 
Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind but this will be monitored by the Board to determine whether it is 
appropriate to use additional currency management procedures to manage risk. At 31 March 2017 (and 31 March 2016) the Group had 
not entered into any hedge transactions.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in currency rates on the Group’s profit before tax and equity through 
the impact of sterling weakening against the US dollar, the euro, the rupee and the Canadian dollar.

Cash and cash equivalents 5% 19,465 —
Net investment in overseas subsidiary 5% — 379
An increase in currency rate of 5% would have a similar but opposite effect. 
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group conducts its operations in many countries, so there is 
no concentration of risk in any one area. In most cases, the Group grants credit without security to its customers. Creditworthiness checks 
are undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers, and credit limits are set as appropriate. The Group conducts most of 
its operations through distributors and is therefore able to maintain a fairly close relationship with its immediate customers. As such, the 
Group monitors payment profiles of customers on a regular basis and is able to spot deteriorations in payment times. An allowance for 
impairment is made that represents the potential loss in respect of individual receivables where there is an identifiable loss event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The amounts presented in the balance sheet 
are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An analysis of trade receivables from various regions is analysed in the following table:

Financial risk management continued
Capital management
The Group funds its operations with a mixture of short and long-term borrowings or equity as appropriate with a view to maximising 
returns for shareholders and maintaining investor, creditor and market confidence. The Board reviews and approves an annual budget 
to help ensure it has adequate facilities to meet all its operational needs and to support future growth in the business.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain sufficient headroom in cash generation and banking facilities to meet its foreseeable financing and 
working capital requirements. The Group maintains a surplus balance of cash and cash equivalents to ensure flexible liquidity to meet 
financial liabilities as they fall due.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 March 2017 based on the undiscounted cash 
flows of liabilities which include both future interest and principal amounts outstanding based on the earliest date on which the Group 
can be required to pay. The amounts of future interest are not included in the carrying value of financial liabilities on the balance sheet.

The carrying amount for all categories of financial assets and liabilities disclosed on the balance sheet and in the related notes to the 
accounts is equal to the fair value of such assets and liabilities as at both 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016. The monetary value 
attributable to these financial assets and liabilities is the same value that has been disclosed in the related notes to the accounts.
The valuation methods used to fair value the financial assets and liabilities have been disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements 
under the heading of Financial instruments.
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each financial asset as at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 represents

(or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.
6.  The notes to the proxy form explain how to: (a) direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote; (b) appoint proxies; 
(c) change proxy instructions; and (d) terminate proxy appointments.
Corporate representing
7.  Corporate members are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies 
and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure.
Issued shares and total voting rights
8.  As at the date of this Annual Report the Company’s issued voting share capital comprised 108,745,669 ordinary shares of 4 pence each. 
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights 
in the Company is as at the date of this Annual Report 108,745,669. The Company anticipates issuing up to a further 20,007,003 
ordinary shares of 4 pence each pursuant to the Fundraising announced on 30 June 2017.
Communications with the Company
9.  Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the Meeting should telephone Kieron Harbinson on 
+44 (0)1259 763 030 (no other methods of communication will be accepted). You may not use any electronic address provided either 
in this notice of Annual General Meeting, or any related documents (including the proxy form), to communicate with the Company for 
any purposes other than those expressly stated.
Voting through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual.
CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed (a) voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST 
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo Limited’s specifications and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual.
The message, regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (7RA36) by the latest time(s) for receipt 
of proxy appointments specified above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST 
in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated 
to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo Limited does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member 
is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed (a) voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor 
or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of CREST by any 
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
