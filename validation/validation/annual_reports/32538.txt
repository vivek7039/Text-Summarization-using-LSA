WHO WE ARE
Mediclinic is an international private healthcare group 
founded in 1983, with operations in Southern Africa 
(South Africa and Namibia), Switzerland and the 
United Arab Emirates. The Company’s primary listing 
is on the LSE in the United Kingdom, with secondary 
listings on the JSE in South Africa and the NSX in 
Namibia. The Group’s registered office is in London, 
United Kingdom. Mediclinic also holds a 29.9% interest 
in Spire Healthcare Group plc, a LSE-listed private 
healthcare group based in the United Kingdom.
Mediclinic is focused on providing acute care, specialist-
orientated, multi-disciplinary healthcare services. Our 
core purpose is to enhance the quality of life of our 
patients by providing comprehensive, high-quality 
healthcare services in such a way that the Group will be 
regarded as the most respected and trusted provider 
of healthcare services by patients, doctors and funders 
of healthcare in each of its markets. 
During February 2016, the Combination of the Company 
(previously named Al Noor Hospitals Group plc), with 
operations mainly in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab 
Emirates, and Mediclinic International Limited was 
completed. Mediclinic International Limited was a 
South African-based international private healthcare 
group founded in 1983 and listed on the JSE, the South 
African stock exchange, since 1986, with operations 
in South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland and the United 
Arab Emirates (mainly in Dubai). The combination 
resulted in the renaming of the Company to Mediclinic 
International plc.
At year end, the Mediclinic Group comprised  
74 hospitals and 37 clinics. Mediclinic Southern Africa 
operates 49 hospitals and two day clinics throughout 
South Africa and three hospitals in Namibia with 
more than 8 000 inpatient beds in total; Hirslanden 
operates 16 private acute care facilities and four clinics 
in Switzerland with more than 1 600 inpatient beds; 
and Mediclinic Middle East operates six hospitals and  
31 clinics with more than 700 inpatient beds in the 
United Arab Emirates.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 6 AT A GLANCE

SWITZERLAND MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 8 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Last year I reported on the consistent growth of 
Mediclinic over the past 30 years, for which we are 
thankful. However, for the past fi nancial period, the fi rst 
full year following the Company’s listing on the London 
Stock Exchange, the Group was unable to deliver its 
consistent growth in underlying earnings per share 
achieved in the past, largely due to challenges in our 
Middle East platform.
Our expansion into Abu Dhabi, eff ectively doubling the 
size of the Middle East business following the Al Noor 
Combination, has not met our original expectations. 
Our growth forecasts for the Abu Dhabi operations 
were signifi cantly impacted in the short term due to 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment and 
a greater need to align Al Noor with the sustainable 
business and operational practices of the Mediclinic 
Group. As a result, revenue and underlying EBITDA 
margins during the year were lower than expected in 
the Middle East. Despite the challenges in Abu Dhabi, 
our established Dubai operations continued to perform 
well. The new Mediclinic City Hospital North Wing 
opened in the third quarter of the year and patient 
volumes have been encouraging. I remain confi dent in 
our approach to expansion in the region, and that it will 
deliver the required longer-term growth and returns 
for the Group.
In Switzerland and Southern Africa, our largest two 
operating platforms, we have seen good trading 
performances this year. The key metrics of patient 
admissions, theatre hours sold and revenue per bed 
day have all been positive. As I have stated before, this 
indicates positive trends in patient choice and shows 
that we are attracting and retaining suffi  cient doctors 
to support the business. This enables us to continue 
to focus on enhancing operational effi  ciencies. In the 
UK, our 29.9% investment in Spire Healthcare remained 
stable and continues to give us exposure to the UK 
private healthcare market. 
Overall, the Group remains in a solid fi nancial position. 
Group revenue for the year was up 30% at £2 749m 
(2016: £2 107m) and underlying EBITDA was up 17% 
at £501m (2016: £428m), both benefi ting from the 
translation eff ect of weaker Sterling and the addition 
of the Al Noor business to the Group. However, 
underlying earnings were fl at at £220m (2016: £219m) 
while underlying earnings per share were down 19% at 
29.8 pence (2016: 36.7 pence), both aff ected by the 
increase in fi nance costs and poor performance of 
Dr Edwin Hertzog 
Non-executive Chairman MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 9 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
a transitional solution until the healthcare providers 
and funders agree on a revised tariff structure. The 
Federal Government is also preparing a framework 
for the outmigration of services (shift of basic medical 
treatments from the inpatient to the outpatient sector) 
across Switzerland.
In Southern Africa, we continue to engage with the 
South African Competition Commission in relation 
to the Health Market Inquiry which is undertaking a 
review of the private healthcare sector to understand 
whether there are features of the sector that prevent, 
distort or restrict competition, and how competition in 
the sector can be promoted. Over the longer term, the 
government in South Africa is hoping to address the 
shortcomings of the public healthcare system through 
the phased introduction of a National Health Insurance 
system over a 14-year period. 
Finally, in the Middle East, we saw the introduction 
in July 2016 of a 20% co-payment for Thiqa patients 
(those covered by health insurance for UAE 
Nationals or others of similar status in Abu Dhabi) 
using private facilities. This had a material impact on 
patient volumes and the financial performance of the 
business in Abu Dhabi. In April 2017, the co-payment 
in Abu Dhabi was waived with immediate effect.
BOARD ACTIVITY AND CHANGES 
Following the Mediclinic and Al Noor Combination and 
the Group’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in 
2016, I last year reported a number of Board changes. 
I am pleased to say that the new Board structure 
operated efficiently throughout the year. We continue 
to look at how to improve the composition and 
functioning of the Board.
In April 2016, Jannie Durand, a Non-executive Director 
of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer of 
Remgro Limited, our major shareholder, appointed 
Pieter Uys as his alternate. Since 2013, Pieter has 
held the position of Head of Strategic Investment at  
Remgro Limited. 
Jurgens Myburgh was appointed as the CFO of the 
Group on 1 August 2016, replacing Craig Tingle, who 
retired as announced in 2016. Prior to joining Mediclinic, 
Jurgens served as CFO at Datatec from June 2014, and 
before that at The Standard Bank of South Africa as 
Executive Vice President of Investment Banking, where 
“I firmly believe that we have the  
right strategy and people in place  
to enable us to consistently grow  
in the future as we have done over  
so many years.”
the Abu Dhabi business. Earnings per share were 
further impacted by the effect of additional shares 
issued for the Spire and Al Noor transactions.
In view of the financial results and following the review 
last year of the Group’s dividend policy to target a  
pay-out ratio of 25% to 30% of underlying earnings, 
the Board recommended a final dividend of 4.70 pence  
per share, bringing the total payment for the year to 
7.90 pence per share.
During the year under review, the clinical performance 
of the business was satisfactory across all operating 
platforms, and most patient safety and clinical 
effectiveness indicators showed improvement. 
In addition, many initiatives in support of clinical 
performance and quality improvement were launched 
and completed during the year. Highlights include:
• 
the strengthening of clinical services leadership  
at hospital and corporate level in Mediclinic 
Southern Africa; 
• 
close collaboration between Mediclinic Southern 
Africa and supporting doctors in certain disciplines; 
• 
the launch of patient reported outcomes after large 
joint surgery in Hirslanden; 
• 
progress on the implementation of an integrated 
care model in Hirslanden; 
• 
the establishment of a comprehensive cancer 
centre in Mediclinic Middle East; and 
• 
the selection of a new electronic health record 
system in Mediclinic Middle East. 
Much of the progress can be attributed to a strong 
collaborative effort between the clinical services teams 
of the respective platforms. 
REGULATORY LANDSCAPE 
The healthcare industry has always been highly 
regulated with continuous changes. We have always 
managed this successfully, thanks to the well-informed 
and responsible leadership of our management teams. 
However, this year has been particularly tough in all 
three of our operating platforms. 
In Switzerland, there was the proposed levy in the 
Canton of Zurich, which the Cantonal Parliament voted 
not to approve in March 2017. National outpatient 
tariffs (TARMED) remain under revision and the 
Federal Government has proposed adjustments as  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 10 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
he was involved in several major Mediclinic corporate 
transactions. Since joining the Board, Jurgens has 
made a number of signifi cant contributions to the 
business.
On 21 February 2017, Ian Tyler, the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director, resigned as a Director of the 
Company. Ian was previously Chairman of Al Noor, and 
we were delighted that he agreed to continue on the 
Board following the Combination in February 2016. 
However, Ian is a Board member of several LSE-listed 
companies and believed that it would be in the best 
interest of all parties to reduce his responsibilities. 
I would like to thank Ian for his important contribution 
to the Board during a very busy year for him. 
Desmond Smith was appointed as the new Senior 
Independent Director. He was appointed an 
Independent Non-executive Director of Mediclinic 
International Limited in 2008 and was the Lead 
Independent Director from 2010 until the Al Noor 
Combination took place.
PROSPECTS 
This year has highlighted, once again, the continued 
challenges and changing regulatory landscape in which 
we operate. Competition from the public and private 
sector means we must focus on continually improving 
the quality of our services while demonstrating value 
in the healthcare services we provide to patients, funders 
and governments alike. Despite these challenges, we 
operate in an industry where demand continues to grow 
for our services. The Board remains focused on creating 
long-term value for stakeholders and maintaining 
Mediclinic’s leading position in the international 
healthcare market. 
Having the services available of high-quality clinical, 
operational and support staff  is crucial to the 
long-term success of the business. Furthermore, by 
closely monitoring key indicators and gathering 
information, we continue to position the Group for 
sensible future growth. 
Mediclinic has been providing private healthcare 
services since 1983, and we have always taken a 
long-term view when we make investment decisions. 
The fundamentals of the healthcare industry remain 
positive, and I fi rmly believe that we have the right 
people and strategy in place to enable us to consistently 
grow in the future as we have done over so many years. 
APPRECIATING YOUR CONTINUED 
SUPPORT 
As ever, I want to express my sincere thanks to 
everyone who contributed to Mediclinic’s continued 
success, including our Directors, management, doctors, 
nurses and support staff . In particular, the support of 
patients and medical professionals is absolutely vital 
to the sustainability of our business, and we deeply 
appreciate that they have chosen Mediclinic as their 
preferred healthcare partner.
Finally, I would like to extend a special thank you to all 
our shareholders for their confi dence in us.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
DURING A CHALLENGING YEAR, 
WHAT HAVE BEEN THE KEY 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU?
Having been with the Group for some 30 years, it is 
fair to say that this past year was one of the most 
challenging. Despite the diffi  cult trading environment, 
a key highlight was the Swiss, Southern African and 
Dubai businesses all performing relatively well. We 
continue to see growing demand for quality healthcare 
services, which is why we place such an emphasis on 
our Patients First strategy and continue to invest in our 
facilities and people. This will assist us to maintain our 
leading position in all our international markets. The 
key challenge globally is to keep healthcare aff ordable 
and to demonstrate cost-effi  cient service delivery. 
Whilst the Middle East platform performed below 
expectations during the year, largely resulting from 
issues with the Al Noor business in Abu Dhabi, 
there were several highlights in the region. In 
September 2016, we opened the new comprehensive 
cancer unit, based in the North Wing of the Mediclinic 
City Hospital, which has performed very well. When 
I look at the new services not previously off ered by 
Mediclinic Middle East, the number of lives we are 
changing through our new radiotherapy and PET scan 
services each month is encouraging. In April 2017 , the unit 
treated the fi rst cancer patient with a revolutionary form 
of radiotherapy called stereotactic body radiotherapy. 
This was delivered using Mediclinic’s True Beam Varian 
linear accelerator, the only one of its kind in the UAE. 
In Al Ain, the Mediclinic Al Jowhara Hospital had its 
fi rst full month of trading in January 2017 and is 
ramping up. It is well positioned to serve the higher 
end of the market in the region. I believe the rebranding 
of the Al Noor business to Mediclinic is an important 
milestone and underlines our commitment to deliver 
exceptional levels of private healthcare service in the 
region. Rebranding and marketing work commenced 
and will continue through the year ahead. I am pleased 
that the co-payment that was introduced in Abu Dhabi 
in July 2016 was waived with immediate eff ect on 
26 April 2017 following our ongoing dialogue with the 
relevant stakeholders in the region.
Danie Meintjes 
Chief Executive O  cer MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 12 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
“We are determined to meet  
and exceed the expectations  
of our patients in every market  
we operate.”
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE 
REGULATORY MATTERS  
PLAYED SUCH A PROMINENT 
ROLE THIS YEAR?
Access to healthcare is a basic human right.  
It is therefore understandable that governments 
will have an interest in their particular healthcare 
system to ensure that it is efficient, accessible and 
fair to its citizens. Healthcare delivery models vary 
widely between countries with different degrees 
of participation by the private healthcare sector.  
However, the cost of delivering healthcare around the 
world is increasing. The reality is that this is largely 
driven by increased consumption from an ageing 
and growing disease-burdened population, and  
new technology.
We have a joint responsibility, working with 
governments, funders and patients, to offer affordable 
and cost-efficient services to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of healthcare provision in the countries 
in which we operate. The private sector can make 
a meaningful, cost-efficient contribution towards 
healthcare delivery. We believe that governments and 
the private healthcare sector should constructively co-
operate to find a dual system of care delivery which is 
in the best interest of the broader community.
In Switzerland, as the Federal Government and 
cantons reviewed their budgets and expenditure on 
healthcare, we saw several regulatory announcements 
during the year. Firstly, the Canton of Zurich in mid-
2016 proposed a levy based on the proportion of 
privately insured patients treated in listed hospitals. 
The Hirslanden management team committed 
significant time and resources to engaging with the 
relevant public authorities to raise concerns regarding 
the process, fairness and the impact of the proposed 
levy specifically on Klinik Hirslanden. I am pleased to 
report that in March 2017 the Cantonal Parliament 
voted not to approve the proposed levy. Secondly, 
there have been ongoing national outpatient tariff 
(TARMED) negotiations between healthcare providers 
and funders. The Swiss Federal Government released 
proposed adjustments to TARMED, as a transitional 
solution while negotiations continue to find agreement 
on a revised tariff structure. And finally, the Zurich 
Cantonal Parliament approved an amendment to the 
cantonal hospital law, providing a legal basis to create 
a list of interventions that in future should generally 
be treated as outpatient rather than inpatient services. 
Continued dialogue and engagement with the relevant 
public authorities remains key to ensuring that private 
healthcare plays a meaningful role in the broader 
healthcare delivery system. 
In South Africa, the cost of private healthcare is being 
examined by the Competition Commission through the 
Health Market Inquiry (“HMI”). T owards the end of 2016, 
the HMI published a timetable reflecting the proposed 
events for 2017. We will continue to engage with the 
HMI as we progress towards the publication of the final 
reports which they have indicated will be by the end 
of 2017. 
As I mentioned previously, from 1 July 2016, the Abu 
Dhabi authorities introduced a 20% co-payment for 
Emiratis who are members of the Thiqa insurance 
option, when they make use of private healthcare 
providers. This had a material impact on our Abu Dhabi 
business, affecting the volume of Thiqa patients visiting 
our facilities. We are focused on growing our patient 
numbers from the Thiqa and enhanced insurance 
market. This strategy is supported by the new business 
and operational practices, the ongoing upgrade and 
investment programmes across our facilities, and the 
rebranding of the business to Mediclinic. The waiving of 
the co-payment in Abu Dhabi from late April 2017 will 
help to support our anticipated gradual improvement 
in Middle East performance as we move through the 
coming financial year.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF 
MEDICLINIC BEING A GLOBAL 
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER?
We have built a diversified portfolio of operating 
platforms in Switzerland, Southern Africa, and the 
Middle East and in the UK we have our 29.9% investment 
in Spire Healthcare. Combined with our strong 
market position in our operating regions, Mediclinic  
benefits from a pool of skilled, knowledgeable and 
experienced employees.
Group initiatives to simplify, standardise and centralise 
key business support processes are ongoing. Using 
our international scale, we are beginning to deliver 
meaningful synergies and cost savings. During the year, 
our central procurement function and ICT department 
made excellent progress in some key contract 
negotiations that will benefit the future profitability of 
the Group.
Although clinical models differ from country to 
country, the basic principles are similar, and it is 
useful to compare and share clinical experience 
and learnings among our operating platforms. The 
breadth of intellectual property across the Group is 
vast. We strive to nurture the combined knowledge, 
skills and experience from our diverse group of 
people to improve the Group’s clinical performance 
and growth opportunities.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 13 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
It is vital that we share best practice at an international 
level, as this will ensure we continue to deliver  
high-quality, cost-efficient services to our patients. The 
comprehensive cancer centre in Dubai is an example 
of how we tapped into the clinical experience and 
knowledge of the Hirslanden team in Switzerland to 
assist with the design, building and opening of our 
first comprehensive cancer centre in the Middle East. 
Having access to such valuable sources of knowledge 
and skills lowers the risk of venturing into new complex 
clinical service lines. 
WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES 
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE 
YEAR AHEAD AND BEYOND?
Our Group focus on Patients First will continue to 
be our top priority. We are determined to meet 
and exceed the expectations of our patients in 
every market in which we operate. To assist us  
in identifying areas for improvement, we implemented 
a standardised international Patient Experience Index 
(“PEI”) measurement system, provided by Press Ganey. 
The PEI system is well embedded in our Southern 
Africa and Dubai businesses, and is being rolled out 
in the Hirslanden and Abu Dhabi businesses, the 
results of which are referenced to in the Sustainable 
Development Highlights on page 57. We continue 
to focus on providing superior clinical performance 
in a safe clinical environment while moving towards  
a better integrated healthcare delivery model.
As I have mentioned, the acquisition of the Al Noor 
business in Abu Dhabi has proved to be challenging. 
While significant progress has been made, we continue 
to focus on resolving these matters and stabilising 
performance; this will remain a priority. Our confidence 
in the long-term growth opportunities of the Middle 
East region remains strong, and we expect performance 
AR
to improve gradually as we progress through the year 
ahead. A key focus is to establish the Mediclinic brand 
as a trusted and preferred provider of clinical services 
to the Abu Dhabi community.
Another priority is the continued improvement 
in operational efficiencies, using our combined 
international intellectual property. We will continue 
to focus on finding ways to simplify our business and 
to standardise processes and structures. This will 
allow us to use our scale to unlock further synergies 
in areas such as procurement, information and 
communications technology, clinical services, human 
resources and marketing.
Finally, we will look to grow the Group at existing 
platform levels by attracting more patients, adding 
further capacity to existing facilities, adding new 
service lines, and identifying bolt-on acquisition 
opportunities. In addition, we will evaluate potential 
new opportunities for further valued added growth. 
In the Middle East, the building of the Mediclinic 
Parkview Hospital in Dubai with some 170 beds has 
commenced. We approved the development of a 
comprehensive cancer unit at the Mediclinic Airport 
Road Hospital in Abu Dhabi, where work is expected 
to start soon. 
I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, support 
staff and management for their dedication and 
commitment to the Group and what we stand for.  
I am confident that the year ahead will be successful.

MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW
FINANCIAL REVIEW
UNDERLYING NON-IFRS 
FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Group uses underlying income statement reporting 
as non-IFRS measures in evaluating performance and 
as a method to provide shareholders with clear and 
consistent reporting. The underlying measures are 
intended to remove volatility associated with certain 
types of one-off  income and charges from reported 
earnings. Historically EBITDA and underlying EBITDA 
were disclosed as supplemental non-IFRS fi nancial 
performance measures because they are regarded 
as useful metrics to analyse the performance of 
the business from period to period. Measures like 
underlying EBITDA are used by analysts and investors 
in assessing performance. 
The rationale for using non-IFRS measures:
• 
it tracks the underlying operational performance 
of the Group and its operating segments by 
separating out one-off  and exceptional items;
• 
non-IFRS measures are used by management 
for budgeting, planning and monthly fi nancial 
reporting; and
• 
non-IFRS measures are used by management in 
presentations and discussions with investment 
analysts.
The Group’s policy is to adjust, inter alia, the following 
types of income and charges from the reported IFRS 
measures to present underlying results:
• 
restructuring costs;
• 
profi t/loss on sale of signifi cant assets;
• 
past service cost charges/credits in relation 
to pension fund conversion rate changes;
• 
signifi cant prior year tax and deferred 
tax adjustments;
• 
accelerated IFRS 2 charges;
• 
accelerated amortisation charges;
• 
mark-to-market fair value gains/losses, relating 
to ineff ective interest rate swaps;
• 
signifi cant impairment charges; 
• 
signifi cant insurance proceeds; and
• 
signifi cant transaction costs incurred during 
acquisitions.
EBITDA is defi ned as operating profi t before 
depreciation and amortisation, excluding other gains 
and losses.
Non-IFRS fi nancial measures should not be considered 
in isolation from, or as a substitute for, fi nancial 
information presented in compliance with IFRS. The 
underlying measures used by the Group are not 
necessarily comparable with those used by other 
entities.
The Group has consistently applied this defi nition 
of underlying measures as it has reported on its 
fi nancial performance in the past as the Directors 
believe this additional information is important to 
allow shareholders to better understand the Group’s 
trading performance for the reporting period. It is the 
Group’s intention to continue to consistently apply this 
defi nition in the future. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 15 FINANCIAL REVIEW
GROUP FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
Group revenue increased by 30% to £2 749m  
(2016: £2 107m) for the reporting period. 
Underlying operating profit before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“underlying EBITDA”) 
was 17% higher at £501m (2016: £428m), underlying 
margins declined from 20.4% to 18.2%, and basic 
underlying earnings per share were 19% lower at  
29.8 pence (2016: 36.7 pence). 
During the reporting period, the following exceptional 
and one-off items were adjusted for in determining 
underlying earnings:
• 
£13m (£10m after tax) mark-to-market fair value 
gain, relating to the ineffective Swiss interest 
rate swaps. The Group uses floating-to-fixed 
interest rate swaps on certain loan agreements 
to hedge against interest movements which have 
the economic effect of converting floating rate 
borrowings to fixed rate borrowings. The Group 
applies hedge accounting and therefore fair value 
adjustments are booked to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
  With the removal of the Swiss franc/euro peg 
during January 2015 and the advent of negative 
interest rates in Switzerland, the Swiss interest 
rate hedges became ineffective once Libor 
moved below zero as bank funding at Libor plus 
relevant margins is subject to a zero rate Libor 
floor. Effective from 1 October 2014, the mark-to-
market movements are charged to the income 
statement. As these are non-cash flow items and 
to provide balanced operational reporting, the 
Group excluded the charge in the measurement of 
underlying performance in the 2015 financial year 
and consistently excludes the gain arising this year. 
The swaps expire in 2017 and 2018.
• 
A past-service cost credit of £13m (£10m after tax) 
arising in the main Hirslanden pension fund. This 
relates to a change in the pension fund conversion 
rate advised by an independent professional. The 
underlying income statement has been adjusted 
as the credit is not related to the current year 
underlying performance of the Swiss hospital 
operations. 
• 
Accelerated amortisation of £7m relating to the  
Al Noor trade name.
• 
Restructuring costs of £5m relating to the 
integration of the Al Noor operations. Consistent 
with last year’s treatment, the underlying income 
statement has been adjusted for these costs 
following the combination in 2016. Currently, no 
further restructuring costs associated with this 
transaction are expected to be adjusted beyond  
31 March 2017.
• 
£1m gain on the mark-to-market of a put option. 
SPIRE HEALTHCARE GROUP
Mediclinic has a 29.9% investment in Spire. The 
investment in Spire is accounted for on an equity 
basis recognising the reported profit of £53.6m for the  
12 months to 31 December 2016 (“Spire’s FY16”). 
The equity accounted share of profit from Spire 
recognised by Mediclinic during the period under 
review was £12m (2016: £6m) after adjusting for 
the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in  
the notional purchase price allocation for the Group’s 
acquisition of its equity investment.
Spire’s FY16 saw solid growth with adjusted revenue 
up 5.8%, adjusted EBITDA up 5.4% and comparable 
EPS (excluding exceptionals and tax one-offs) up 
4.9%. Total patient admissions grew 2.3% driven by 
self-pay and NHS volume growth. After adjusting for 
St Anthony’s and prior year disposals, Spire’s adjusted 
EBITDA margin remained stable at 18.2%, while EBITDA 
conversion to operating cash flow increased to 115% 
before exceptional items and tax.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES
Although the Group reports its results in British pound, 
the operating segments profits are generated in 
Swiss franc, UAE dirham and the South African rand. 
Consequently, movement in exchange rates affected 
the reported earnings and reported balances in the 
statement of financial position. 
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity:
• 
The impact of a 10% change in the GBP/CHF 
exchange rate for a sustained period of one year 
is that profit for the year would increase/decrease 
by £14m (2016: increase/decrease by £11m) due to 
exposure to the GBP/CHF exchange rate.
• 
The impact of a 10% change in the GBP/ZAR 
exchange rate for a sustained period of one year 
is that profit for the year would increase/decrease 
by £8m (2016: increase/decrease by £7m) due to 
exposure to the GBP/ZAR exchange rate.
• 
The impact of a 10% change in the GBP/AED 
exchange rate for a sustained period of one year 
is that profit for the year would increase/decrease 
by £2m (2016: increase/decrease by £6m) due to 
exposure to the GBP/AED exchange rate.
During the period under review, the average and 
closing exchange rates were the following:
2017 2016

Average rates:
GBP/CHF 1.29 1.47 (12%)
GBP/AED 4.80 5.54 (13%)

Period end rates:
GBP/CHF 1.25 1.38 (9%)
GBP/AED 4.59 5.28 (13%)
GBP/ZAR 16.74 21.21 (21%)
CASH FLOW
The Group continued to deliver strong cash flow 
converting 101% (2016: 96%) of underlying EBITDA 
into cash generated from operations. Cash and cash 
equivalents increased from £305m to £361m.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 16 FINANCIAL REVIEW

INCOME TAX
The Group’s effective tax rate decreased from 22.4% 
in the prior year to 20.8% for period under review 
predominantly due to the following:
• 
the tax rate decreased by 4.2% in respect of prior 
year one-off non-deductible expenses which were 
not incurred in the period under review. This was 
related to Al Noor transaction costs as well as an 
accelerated IFRS 2 charge; and
• 
the tax rate increased by 3.0% due to a reduced 
contribution by Middle East to earnings. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 17 FINANCIAL REVIEW

TAX STRATEGY
The Group is committed to conduct its tax affairs 
consistent with the following objectives:
• 
comply with relevant laws, rules, regulations, and 
reporting and disclosure requirements in whichever 
jurisdiction it operates; and
• 
maintain mutual trust and respect in dealings with 
all tax authorities in the jurisdictions the Group  
does business.
Whilst the Group aims to maximise the tax efficiency 
of its business transactions, it does not use structures 
in its tax planning that are contrary to the intentions 
of the relevant legislature. The Group interprets 
relevant tax laws in a reasonable way and ensures that 
transactions are structured in a way that is consistent 
with a relationship of co-operative compliance with  
tax authorities. It also actively considers the 
implications of any planning for the Group’s wider 
corporate reputation.
In order to meet these objectives, various procedures 
are implemented. The Audit and Risk Committee 
has reviewed the Group’s tax strategy and related 
corporate tax matters.
OUTLOOK
The Group’s main strategic focus remains to ensure 
high-quality care and optimal patient experience. T o this 
end, Mediclinic continues to invest in its people, patient 
facilities and the technology within the facilities. The 
Group’s growing international scale also enables it to 
unlock further value through promoting collaboration 
and best practice between its operating platforms and 
to extract further synergies and cost-efficiencies. The 
Group is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to 
its shareholders with a well-balanced portfolio of global 
operations, a leading position across all four attractive 
healthcare markets and a platform for future growth.
Demand for Mediclinic’s services across its platforms 
remains robust, underpinned by an ageing population, 
growing disease burden and technological innovation. 
However, the increase in demand across the platforms 
is impacted by lower economic growth and greater 
competition. In addition, there is an increased focus on  
the affordability of delivering healthcare which is 
resulting in changing care delivery models and greater  
regulatory oversight.
The Group provides the following guidance for the 
financial year ending 31 March 2018 (“FY18”):
• 
Hirslanden: Given the already high occupancy rates 
and stable bed numbers the Group anticipates 
modest revenue growth. The underlying EBITDA 
margin is expected to be lower. This is due to 
the tariff and regulatory environment including 
the impact from the proposed national TARMED 
adjustment and outmigration framework coming in 
the fourth quarter FY18, increasing costs relating to 
several major projects including Hirslanden 2020 
and assumes no further tariff provision releases 
that benefited FY17. The impacts of these will 
partially be offset by ongoing efficiency gains.
• 
Mediclinic Southern Africa: The Group expects 
revenue growth in line with inflation despite the 
challenging macro-economic environment, greater 
competition and funder constraints. Despite 
cost inflation running above tariff increases, the 
underlying EBITDA margin is expected to remain 
broadly stable through increased efficiencies.
• 
Mediclinic Southern Africa and Hirslanden business 
days will be impacted by two Easter holiday 
periods in the current year.
• 
Mediclinic Middle East: The Dubai operating 
performance is expected to remain stable despite 
the competitive landscape. A gradual improvement 
is expected in the Abu Dhabi business over the 
next couple of years. As a result, the Group 
expects only a marginal improvement in Middle 
East revenues for the full year and a more gradual 
improvement in underlying EBITDA margins over 
time, including the impact associated with the 
opening of new facilities. First half FY18 Middle 
East performance versus the prior year comparator 
is expected to be lower largely due to the higher 
patient volumes and revenues in Abu Dhabi prior 
to the regulatory changes, asset sales and business 
and operational alignment initiatives during FY17. 
• 
The Group’s budgeted capital expenditure is  
£281m in constant currency. This comprises  
£118m in Hirslanden, £71m in Mediclinic Southern 
Africa and £92m in Mediclinic Middle East.
DIVIDEND POLICY AND 
PROPOSED DIVIDEND 
The Group’s dividend policy is to target a pay-out 
ratio of between 25% and 30% of underlying earnings.  
The Board may revise the policy at its discretion.
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.70 pence per 
ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2017 for 
approval by the Company’s shareholders at the annual 
general meeting on Tuesday, 25 July 2017. Together 
with the interim dividend of 3.20 pence per ordinary 
share for the six months ended 30 September 2016 
(paid on 12 December 2016), the total final proposed 
dividend reflects a 27% distribution of underlying 
Group earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders. 
Shareholders on the South African register will be 
paid the ZAR cash equivalent of 80.60500 cents  
(64.48400 cents net of dividend withholding tax) 
per share. A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be 
applicable to all shareholders on the South African 
register who are not exempt therefrom. The ZAR cash 
equivalent has been calculated using the following 
exchange rate: £1:ZAR17.15, being the five-day average 
ZAR/GBP exchange rate on Friday, 19 May 2017 at 
3:00pm GMT Bloomberg. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 19 FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY

OUR VISION
BUSINESS
OUTCOMES
Mediclinic’s business model has resulted in quality service delivery, 
manageable risks, and generally a business that sustains growth 
and creates value for its stakeholders. The business model varies 
slightly in the three operating platforms. In Mediclinic Southern 
Africa, operations are supported by specialists who are not 
employed by the Group, but operate independently. This is a 
regulatory limitation in terms of the Health Professions Council 
of South Africa, which prohibits the employment of doctors by 
private hospitals, although permission has been obtained to 
appoint doctors in emergency units. In Hirslanden and Mediclinic 
Middle East, some doctors are employed, while other doctors  
are independent. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 25 MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 24 OUR STRATEGY, PROGRESS AND AIMS OUR STRATEGY, PROGRESS AND AIMS

Risk exposure increased due to change in business environment, increased investments, 
increased dependency of operations on information technology, information sensitivity 
and cost involved.
Proactive and continuous monitoring, favourable results of negotiations, effective 
treasury and risk management processes have resulted in lowering of risk exposure.
Risk exposure has not changed much as the operating and regulatory environment has 
more or less remained the same and enhanced risk mitigation measures have kept the 
risk at same level.
The Board is ultimately accountable for the Group’s risk 
management process and system of internal control.  
In terms of a mandate by the Board, the Audit and Risk 
Committee monitors the risk management process and 
systems of internal control of the Group. The Board 
oversees the activities of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the Group’s internal and external auditors, and the 
Group’s risk management function as delegated to  
the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s Enterprise-wide Risk Management 
(“ERM”) policy follows the international Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”) framework and defines the risk 
management objectives, methodology, risk appetite, 
risk identification, assessment and treatment processes 
and the responsibilities of the various risk management 
role-players in the Group. The ERM policy is subject to 
annual review, and any amendments are submitted  
to the Audit and Risk Committee for approval. 
The objective of risk management in the Group is to 
establish an integrated and effective risk management 
framework where important and emerging risks are 
identified, quantified and managed. An ERM software 
application supports the Group’s risk management 
process in all three operating platforms. The Group’s 
principal risk items (grouped by COSO category, 
business process and strategic priorities), the 
movement in risk during the financial year, together 
with key measures taken to mitigate these risks, are

INTERNAL CONTROL AND 
ASSURANCE
The Group upholds an effective control environment, 
including a comprehensive system of internal controls 
which is designed to ensure that risks are mitigated 
and that the Group’s objectives are attained. The 
system includes monitoring mechanisms and 
ensures that appropriate actions are taken to correct 
deficiencies when they are identified. During the year, 
each operating platform executed its assurance plans. 
These plans comprise various assurance processes, 
including internal and external audit processes in place 
to evaluate the effectiveness of key controls designed 
to mitigate the significant risks identified in each 
operating platform. 
The Group makes use of an outsourced internal audit 
function which is closely aligned with the Group risk 
management function and reports independently to 
the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board. At each 
operating platform, the effectiveness of the system of 
internal financial control is independently evaluated 
through the internal and external audit programmes. In 
addition to these audits, the effectiveness of operational 
procedures is examined internally through various peer 
review and control self-assessment processes. The 
results of these assurance processes are monitored by 
the Group’s risk management function and reported to 
each operating platform’s management teams. 
Each of the operating platforms has, in addition to the 
above-mentioned assurance processes, implemented 
further independent assurance processes with 
professional organisations which are summarised in 
the table below.
The company secretaries at Group and operating 
platform level and the internal legal advisors are 
responsible for providing guidance in respect of 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
The assessment of viability is an extension of the 
risk management, budget and forecast process 
which translates into each of the Group’s operating 
platforms’ business plans. The business plans reflect 
the current Group strategies and their associated risks 
and the Directors’ best estimations of their prospects. 
Fundamental to the assessment of the Group’s 
prospects, is the long-term business model which has 
resulted in quality service delivery and revenue growth 
under manageable risk tolerance. 
The budget and forecast process includes a detailed 
bottom-up approach per platform for the budget 
year (performed by each clinic and hospital) and 
the extension of the key assumptions to the forecast 
period. The budgets are subject to review and,  
if necessary, re-budgeting. The five-year plans, including 
the strategic Group goals and objectives, are reviewed 
and approved by the platform Executive Committees, 
Mediclinic International Executive Committee and 
Mediclinic International Board.
The Board has adopted a five-year time frame for the 
assessment, in line with the Group’s business planning 
period which reflects the impact of investments made 
in the present period. The five-year period extends 
beyond the maturities of a material portion of the 
Group’s borrowings in each platform. Under current 
operating and market circumstances, as well as the 
existing levels of debt and the forecast headroom in 
respect of debt covenants, the assumption is that these 
borrowings would be refinanced broadly in line with 
the terms and conditions of the existing facilities. The 
Group successfully refinanced CHF1.9bn and ZAR4.2bn 
in 2012; CHF1.7bn in 2015; and in 2016 refinanced the 
UK bridge facility of £266m with facilities amounting  
to ZAR2.7bn in South Africa and US$155m in the  
Middle East.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Group’s 
robust risk management process and system of internal 
control via a mandate from the Board (see pages 118 to 
119). The principal risks as detailed on pages 31 to 33 
were identified by these systems and, for the purposes 
of the viability assessment, severe but plausible 
scenarios reflecting the risks that could impair the 
viability of the Group were identified for each of the 
operating platforms to form the basis for stress testing.
On a platform level the potential impact of each 
scenario and certain scenarios in combination were 
modelled and assessed on EBITDA or profit after tax 
(as appropriate), net debt and debt covenants over the 
five-year forecast period. 
The principal risks and related key assumptions 
underlying each of the operating platforms’ business 
plans that were flexed in the stress testing are set  
out in the table below.

This analysis showed that the business, in its 
geographically diverse portfolio, would be able to 
withstand any individual and certain combinations 
of the severe but plausible scenarios by taking 
management action, ceteris paribus, with the key 
mitigating step being a reduction in discretionary 
investment. The Directors therefore have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the fi ve-year period of their detailed assessment, 
ending in 31 March 2022. In making their assessment, 
the Directors have assumed that there will be no 
material change in the business environment as such 
assumptions are subject to a level of uncertainty and 
judgment for which outcomes cannot be projected 
and foreseen.
Having considered the principal risks and the viability 
assessment, the Board also considers it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the fi nancial statements.
EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK 
MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND 
SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board, via the Audit and Risk Committee, regularly 
receives reports on and considers the activities of the 
internal and external auditors of Mediclinic Southern 
Africa, Hirslanden and Mediclinic Middle East, and the 
Group’s risk management function. The Board, via the 
Audit and Risk Committee, is satisfi ed that there is an 
eff ective risk management process in place and that 
there is an adequate and eff ective system of internal 
control in place to appropriately mitigate the signifi cant 
risks faced by the Group.  INTRODUCTION
Mediclinic provides a wide range of clinical services 
throughout its operating platforms. The services 
include acute care inpatient services, and highly 
specialised services, day case surgery, hospital-based 
emergency centres, pre-hospital emergency services 
and outpatient consultation services. Support services 
include laboratory, radiology and nuclear medicine. 
Mediclinic strives to ensure that the clinical services 
provided throughout the Group are effi  cient, 
eff ective, appropriate, evidence-based and in line with 
modern technological advances. To this end we have 
developed a strong focus on measuring and improving 
clinical performance throughout our organisation. 
A comprehensive set of clinical performance indicators 
are collected, measured, analysed and reported on 
monthly. These clinical performance reports outline 
and track the performance of healthcare facilities, 
inform operational decisions, identify opportunities 
for clinical quality improvement initiatives and inform 
strategic direction. 
During the year under review the clinical performance 
of the business was satisfactory across all operating 
platforms. In addition, considerable progress had 
been made in the further development of underlying 
structures and processes to enable improvements in 
clinical performance. Much of the progress can be 
attributed to a strong collaborative eff ort between the 
clinical services teams of the platforms. 
All indicators included in this Clinical Services Overview 
are reported per calendar year to ensure completeness 
and consistency, as a signifi cant time lag needs to be 
provided for in the collection of clinical data. 
This report gives a brief overview of the Group’s clinical 
performance for the year under review. For a more 
in-depth description we recommend that the detailed 
Clinical Services Report, available on the Company’s 
website at www.mediclinic.com, should also be read.

Antimicrobial stewardship 
Antimicrobial stewardship is an important activity in 
the management of HAI and antimicrobial resistance. 
Good progress has been made and all indicators 
showed a downward trend.
CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS
Clinical performance measurement of critical care 
units (“CCUs”) has been refined by implementing 
the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (“SAPS”) 3 
physiological mortality prediction model instead of 
APACHE®IV previously used. SAPS3 is statistically 
better suited to the Mediclinic population and gives a 
more accurate prediction of mortality. During 2016, the 
average mortality rate for patients admitted to CCUs 
was 16.74% compared to the expected mortality rate of 
17.18%. The resultant SAPS3 mortality index was 0.974.
The 30-day all-cause re-admission rate increased 
by 1.9% in 2016. Re-admissions within seven days of 
discharge accounts for half of these re-admissions and 
remains a focus area for improvement. The extended 
stay rate is now expressed as an index, and although 
this has remained stable over the last 12 months (1.13 in 
2015 and 2016), it has shown a decreasing trend over 
the second half of 2016.

CLINICAL PERFORMANCE 
PATIENT SAFETY
Mediclinic Southern Africa has a reasonably high case 
mix and a high case load of infectious diseases and 
trauma. The continuous improvement of patient safety 
remains a priority for Mediclinic Southern Africa and 
adverse events, as illustrated in Figure 1, are reported 
and tracked as a barometer of safe patient care.
A significant increase of 37.2% in the medication error 
rate was reported in 2016, which is mainly attributed 
to an initiative undertaken by pharmacy to improve 
the identification and reporting of medication errors. 
An initiative is underway by pharmacy services to 
identify, report and reduce the number of medication 
dispensing errors. 
The fall rate decreased by 6.1% in 2016, while the  
in-hospital pressure ulcer rate increased by 3.8%. The 
fall rate and in-hospital pressure ulcer rate are regarded 
as nursing sensitive indicators and correlate with the 
number and skills of available nursing staff. Nursing 
skills levels in Southern Africa have been a challenge 
for a few years, and the Mediclinic Southern Africa 
nursing department is strongly focused on improving 
the situation. 
INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 
Healthcare-associated infections 
Healthcare-associated infections (“HAI”) remain one 
of the highest risks to hospitalised patients. The HAI 
rate reduced by 15.5% during 2016 due to numerous 
interventions over the last few years. Hand hygiene 
compliance is an important measure in the prevention 
of HAI and remains stable at 75.3% and a focus area for 
improvement. Refer to Figure 2. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 39 CLINICAL SERVICES OVERVIEW

MEDICLINIC SOUTHERN AFRICA MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 40 CLINICAL SERVICES OVERVIEW
HIRSLANDEN
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE 
PATIENT SAFETY
Hirslanden has the highest case mix in the Group 
reflecting the complexity of cases treated. However, 
clinical outcomes remain excellent as is demonstrated 
by low infection rates and other outcome measures. 
The fall rate increased by 10.5% in 2016. The increase in 
the rate is believed to be due to an increased awareness 
and better reporting, however, the prevention of falls 
and a reduction in the reported rate remain focus areas. 
The in-hospital pressure ulcer rate decreased by 5%. 
INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Healthcare-associated infections 
During 2016, all device-associated and surgical site 
infection rates declined with significant reduction in 
the rates of all three reported indicators. The reduction 
is partly related to definition changes, however, 
a sustained focus on the prevention of infections 
supports the lower rates. Figure 3 illustrates the 
device-associated infections.
The catheter-associated urinary tract infections 
(“CAUTI”) rate decreased by 63.6% while the central 
line-associated bloodstream infections (“CLABSI”) 
rate decreased by 76.5%. Over the last three years 
the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate (“VAP”) 
decreased by 55.8%.
CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS
The SAPS II is used to measure clinical outcomes of 
CCUs. The SAPS II mortality index remains well below 
the Swiss benchmark of 0.33 at 0.20. 
The unscheduled re-admission rate decreased by  
3.9%, which is in line with improvement noticed in  
other measures.
PROGRESS AGAINST OBJECTIVES
Patients First at Mediclinic
• 
Reviewed the compliance of the hospitals with the 
patient safety policy – the majority of the hospitals 
implemented every item of the policy or was busy 
with the implementation of the remaining items.
• 
Checked the adherence to safe surgery checklist 
during unannounced inspections – compared to 
the previous inspection, further improvement  
was noted.
• 
Initiated a pilot project on patient-related outcome 
measurement – patients were surveyed on quality 
of life before and after joint replacement. The 
results show a significant improvement of pain  
and movement after the procedure.
Integrated care
• 
Compiled a policy on indication quality and  
introduction of indication boards –  
the implementation is planned for 2017.
• 
Successfully started the project on the introduction 
of fast track orthopaedics in one of the 
orthopaedic hospitals of the group.
• 
Introduced a common structure for highly 
specialised medicine services.

• 
Compiled the definition of the future 
documentation in catheterisation laboratories 
and emergency departments – the manufacturer 
is busy with the implementation thereof in our 
electronic patient record.
• 
Completed the re-evaluation of the radiology 
information system and selected a new system – 
the pilot project has started.

MEDICLINIC MIDDLE EAST
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
Both Mediclinic Middle East and the Al Noor group of 
hospitals collected clinical performance indicators for 
the period under review and the combined figures are 
reflected in the graphs below.
The collection of certain key clinical performance 
indicators in the Al Noor facilities are mandatory as 
defined by the Health Authority in Abu Dhabi (“HAAD”). 
The reported indicators have been standardised across 
all the facilities and is not limited to the regulatory 
requirements. The clinical performance indicators for 
all the facilities are reported on a monthly basis, and 
include patient safety, infection prevention and control 
as well as clinical effectiveness indicators.
PATIENT SAFETY
Mediclinic Middle East has the lowest case mix index in 
the Group and serves a younger, healthier community. 
Providing safe care remains a priority across the 
platform.
Figure 4 reflects the rate of adverse events per  
1 000 patient days.
Medication errors increased markedly by 116.7% during 
2016. The increase is due to a reporting drive, with 
the main contributor being prescribing errors. The 
majority of the medication errors are identified, and 
reported, by pharmacy and prevented from reaching 
the patients. The early identification of prescription 
errors was enabled by a pharmacy initiative, focussing 
on identification and reporting of prescription errors. 
Medication management remains a big focus area for 
the group.
There was an increase in the fall rate from 0.3 to 0.4 per 
1 000 patient days recorded for inpatients during 2016. 
Fall assessments and the required interventions were 
reinforced across the group. 
The rate of inpatient pressure ulcers reduced by 60% 
and can mainly be attributed to the implementation of 
the appropriate clinical risk prevention strategies and 
protocols in all clinical areas.

INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
Healthcare-associated infections
A reduction was seen in most of the measures and 
this is influenced by changes in the definition in line 
with the 2016 Centre for Disease Control guidelines. 
In addition, the platform has a sustained focus on 
infection prevention and control and reducing infection 
rates further.
The HAI rate decreased by 18.8% in 2016. The rate of 
CAUTI increased by 33.3% over the last 12 months, 
however, the actual numbers remain low (seven cases). 
The rate of CLABSI decreased by 37.5% in 2016. 
CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS
Actual mortality decreased by 7.7% during the 
period under review and remained lower than the 
actual mortality for both Mediclinic Southern Africa 
and Hirslanden. This can be attributed to the young 
population (average age of 32 years) in the UAE, and 
generally less invasive and complex surgical procedures 
performed than in the other two operating platforms.
Mediclinic Middle East used the APACHE® IV scoring 
system in the CCUs in the two hospitals in Dubai until 
September 2016. SAPS3 was subsequently rolled 
out in all the hospitals in Mediclinic Middle East in  
October 2016 and reports will be available in the next 
annual report. The APACHE®IV mortality index is 0.62 
and well below 1. 
The re-admission rate decreased by 47.4% from 1.9% to 
1% in 2016. All admission types, except oncology, are 
included in the calculation. Comparable benchmarks 
are not readily available.

CEO’S STATEMENT
“During the year , Hirslanden once again successfully 
increased both its turnover and the underlying 
EBITDA. In the saturated Swiss healthcare market, 
strong growth is only possible with a forward-
looking investment strategy. At Hirslanden, this 
strategy includes investments in our core business 
at the hospitals, as well as rounding out our range 
of services in the outpatient sector. Hirslanden 
will therefore continue its transformation from 
being purely a hospital operator to becoming 
an integrated healthcare provider that oﬀ ers 
medical services across various levels of care. 
The improved EBITDA is the result of increased 
productivity and effi  ciency achieved by the 
ongoing implementation of standardised 
structures and processes throughout the entire 
Group. In addition to our relentless focus on 
medical quality and patient satisfaction, improving 
effi  ciency is a key part of Hirslanden’s approach: 
the ongoing improvement of patient value.
Looking forward, the public policy environment 
creates a number of uncertainties and risks. 
For instance, another tariﬀ  reduction is expected 
in the outpatient sector. Meanwhile the shift 
towards outpatient treatment continues and 
regulations are currently being drafted to ensure 
that in future certain procedures are only carried 
out in an outpatient setting. In the canton of 
Zurich, a special tax on services for privately 
insured inpatients was fortunately rejected.
Despite these challenges and uncertainties, as the 
largest private medical network in Switzerland, 
Hirslanden is well positioned to take advantage of 
future opportunities for growth, and will remain 
a source of clinical excellence for the wider 
Mediclinic Group.”

KEY FINANCIAL AND 
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
Hirslanden accounted for 48% of the Group’s revenues 
(2016: 54%) and 53% of its underlying EBITDA  
(2016: 52%).
As at the end of the reporting period, Hirslanden 
operated 16 hospitals and 4 clinics with a total of 1 677 
inpatient beds and 9 402 employees (6 722 full-time 
equivalents). It is the largest private acute care hospital 
group in Switzerland servicing approximately one third 
of inpatients treated in Swiss private hospitals. 
During the period under review, revenues increased 
by 3% to CHF1 704m (2016: CHF1 657m). This was 
driven by a 1.7% growth in inpatient admissions. 
The reduction in both bed days sold (-0.7%) and 
the average length of stay (-2.3%) was offset by an 
increase of 3.0% in the average revenue per bed 
day sold. This is largely due to an increase in the 
average severity of cases, with an increasing number 
of doctors performing complex procedures at  
Hirslanden hospitals. Outpatient revenues increased 
by 9% and now contributes nearly 20% to overall 
Hirslanden revenues. 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 5% to CHF340m 
(2016: CHF325m) with the underlying EBITDA 
margin increasing from 19.7% to 20.0% due to several 
productivity measures and cost savings initiatives 
implemented during the year and an underlying 
tariff provision release of CHF8m. These were offset 
by continued investment in Hirslanden 2020 and the 
ongoing shift in patient mix from semi and private 
to basic insured. Operating profit increased by 7% to 
CHF259m (2016: CHF243m). Hirslanden contributed 
£121m to the Group’s underlying earnings compared to 
£101m in the prior year.
Hirslanden invested CHF74m in expansion capital 
projects and new equipment and CHF89m on the 
replacement of existing equipment and upgrade 
projects as well as investments in Hirslanden 2020 and 
relocation of the corporate head office. In April 2016, 
Hirslanden Clinique Cecil in Lausanne opened a new 
hybrid operating theatre and an outpatient surgery 
unit. In August 2016, Hirslanden Klinik Aarau opened its 
third cardiac catheterisation laboratory. At Hirslanden 
Klinik St. Anna and Hirslanden Klinik Stephanshorn, 
two new modular operating theatres were completed 
in October and December 2016, respectively. Further 
important development projects completed included 
new doctors’ consulting rooms for Hirslanden 
Clinique La Colline, restructuring of radiology for 
Hirslanden Klinik Stephanshorn and restructuring of 
the sterilisation unit for Hirslanden Klinik Permanence. 
Hirslanden Klinik Im Park in Zurich opened its new 
outpatient surgery centre in April 2017, which includes 
a ward for procedures requiring short inpatient stays. 
Building work commenced on an expanded emergency 
department for Klinik Hirslanden in Zürich and there 
are plans for a range of other expansion projects to 
increase the business’ capacity.
During the year, Hirslanden increased efficiency 
in various areas of the business. Supply costs and 
labour costs were successfully reduced, while more 
focused management led to increased utilisation of 
our infrastructure. Hirslanden is focused on achieving 
further efficiency gains and optimisation, leveraging 
off the broader Group’s economies of scale to manage 
cost pressures.

Hirslanden’s main competitors are the public hospitals. 
Many of these will improve their infrastructure in the 
coming years. According to publicly available sources, 
CHF16bn is earmarked for the construction and 
renovation of hospital buildings.
Additional challenges include working within an 
environment regulated by 26 cantons that supervise 
and manage hospitals and ensure their funding in 
collaboration with the mandatory health insurance. 
Besides the regulation of the inpatient sector the 
cantons increasingly intervene in the outpatient 
market by defi ning lists of medical interventions to be 
performed ambulatory or by establishing a moratorium 
for foreign doctors. 
OUTLOOK
There continues to be a signifi cant focus on 
the shift of basic medical treatments from the 
inpatient to the outpatient sector (“outmigration”). 
The Federal Government is preparing a framework 
for the outmigration of services, likely to be ready for 
implementation from 1 January 2018, across Switzerland. 
The Zurich Cantonal Parliament, in April 2017, approved 
an amendment to the cantonal hospital law, providing 
a legal basis for the cantonal government to create a 
list of interventions that in future should generally be 
treated as outpatient rather than inpatient services. 
The fi nal list of interventions will be agreed following 
a working group review. In the Canton of Lucerne 
similar measures are expected to be implemented from 
1 July 2017. 
Hirslanden is responding to the trend of outmigration 
with the opening of new outpatient facilities and 
the creation of an integrated medical network that 
facilitates the access to healthcare for patients. This 
is also important because outpatient clinics are a 
well-established route for the subsequent allocation of 
patients to hospitals and specialists. The establishment 
of outpatient facilities is part of the Hirslanden 2020 
strategic programme. This programme has two 
main goals: to increase the effi  ciency of the existing 
business by implementing standardised systems and 
processes; and to develop new areas of business, 
such as outpatient facilities. Having opened the 
new outpatient surgery centre at Klinik Im Park, 
Hirslanden will also open two new medical centres in 
Zurich (Seefeldstrasse) and Cham (canton of Zug) in 
spring 2018 and a further one at Schuppis (canton of 
St. Gallen) in 2019.
Given the external environment, the investment 
programme within Hirslanden and the potential for 
increased synergies, the platform is well-positioned 
to maintain its status as the largest medical network 
in Switzerland while continuing to improve patient 
satisfaction and clinical outcomes.
There were a number of regulatory developments in 
Switzerland during the year. In April 2017, the Zurich 
Cantonal Parliament voted not to approve the proposed 
VVG levy. As part of a Cantonal budget review and 
cost savings initiative, the Canton had proposed a 
levy to be introduced based on the proportion of 
privately insured patients treated in listed hospitals. 
This complex matter went through an extended 
legislative process and Hirslanden engaged with the 
relevant public authorities to raise concerns regarding 
the process, equality and the impact the proposed 
levy would have had on the business. Hirslanden will 
continue to monitor developments in the canton whilst 
maintaining its dialogue and engagement with the 
relevant public authorities to ensure that it can, on a 
sustainable basis, deliver high-quality, cost-effi  cient, 
healthcare to patients.
The national outpatient tariff  (“TARMED”) is still in 
revision and the current tariff  structure is valid until 
the end of the 2017 calendar year. The Swiss Federal 
Government has released proposed adjustments to 
TARMED as a transitional solution whilst healthcare 
providers and funders continue to negotiate and agree 
a revised tariff  structure. The government proposal 
is targeting annual savings of around CHF700m 
across the public and private outpatient sectors. 
Outpatient services contribute approximately 20% 
of Hirslanden revenues, at around CHF300m in the 
period under review. Based on initial analyses of the 
complex proposal, the expected annualised impact 
on Hirslanden outpatient revenues is around CHF30m 
before any mitigating actions are considered. These 
mitigations could include improved utilisation and 
increased effi  ciencies that would help to reduce the 
impact of the transitional solutions proposed by 
the Federal Government on the underlying EBITDA 
and margins of the business. Due to its implementation 
date on 1 January 2018, the impact on Hirslanden is 
expected to be limited in the next fi nancial year.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The Swiss healthcare market is one of the best funded 
in the developed world and continues to grow steadily. 
Hirslanden is the largest medical network and the 
largest private hospital group in Switzerland, and 
works eff ectively within a high-quality healthcare 
system where the population enjoys freedom of choice 
and high-quality services in both the public and private 
sector. A survey, fi nanced by the Commonwealth Fund 
and conducted in eleven countries, found that 60% of 
respondents in Switzerland rated the Swiss functioning 
of the healthcare system as “good” or “very good”. 
66% considered the medical care provided as either 
“excellent” or “very good”. Of the 11 countries surveyed, 
Switzerland had the best response. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 47 DIVISIONAL REVIEW – SOUTHERN AFRICA

KEY FINANCIAL AND 
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
Mediclinic Southern Africa accounted for 28% of the 
Group’s revenue (2016: 31%) and 33% of its underlying 
EBITDA (2016: 32%).
In Southern Africa (including South Africa and 
Namibia), as at the end of the reporting period, 
Mediclinic operated 52 hospitals and two day clinics 
with a total of 8 095 beds and 16 848 employees. The 
platform is the third largest private hospital provider in 
Southern Africa.
During the period under review, revenue increased by 
7% to ZAR14 367m (2016: ZAR13 450m). Bed days 
sold and average revenue per bed day increased by 
0.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Admissions increased  
by 0.6% with growth in medical cases partially offset 
by a decrease in surgical day cases as the outmigration 
trend continues. The average length of stay increased 
by 0.2%. 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 6% to ZAR3 049m 
(2016: ZAR2 877m) resulting in the underlying EBITDA 
margin decreasing from 21.4% to 21.2% due to the 
ongoing shift in mix towards medical versus surgical 
cases, wage and cost inflation, including higher price 
increases on pharmaceuticals (sold at zero margin) 
and investment in additional clinical personnel. 
Operating profit increased by 15% to ZAR2 584m  
(2016: ZAR2 252m). Mediclinic Southern Africa 
contributed £67m to the Group’s underlying earnings 
compared to £63m in the prior year, impacted by 
an additional ZAR182m (£10m) interest charge on 
additional debt following the refinance of the Group’s 
bridge loan. 
Mediclinic Southern Africa invested ZAR790m on 
expansion capital projects and new equipment and 
ZAR515m on the replacement of existing equipment 
and upgrade projects. The number of beds increased 
by 78 taking the total number of beds to 8 095. Key 
projects completed during the year were at Mediclinic 
Upington, Mediclinic Worcester, Mediclinic Emfuleni 
and Mediclinic Windhoek. The building projects in 
progress are expected to add some 54 additional beds 
by the end of FY18, taking the total number of licensed 
beds across the operating platform to 8 149. Several 
additional building projects are due for completion 
in FY19 and FY20, which are expected to add some  
350 additional beds in both existing facilities and new 
day clinics.
During FY16, Mediclinic Southern Africa announced the 
proposed acquisition of a controlling share in Matlosana 
Medical Health Services Proprietary Limited (“MMHS”), 
based in Klerksdorp in the North-West Province of 
South Africa. MMHS owns two multi-disciplinary 
hospitals, Wilmed Park Hospital (144 licensed beds) 
and Sunningdale Hospital (62 licensed beds), as well 
as a 51% share in Parkmed Neuro Clinic, a psychiatric 
hospital (50 licensed beds). This proposed acquisition 
supports Mediclinic’s core focus of providing acute 
care, multi-disciplinary specialist hospital services.

EFFICIENCY AND OTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS
Mediclinic Southern Africa progressed with several 
improvements to its core processes during the period 
under review. The new SAP solution for financial and 
central procurement processes was successfully rolled 
out to 32 Mediclinic Southern Africa hospitals. 
In addition, the platform introduced action plans 
to improve employee engagement and conducted  
the second survey through its Employee  
Engagement Index. Detailed plans to improve 
employee engagement were successful in improving 
employee engagement to 3.73 (2016: 3.67) during 
the year (the grand mean score based on a 1 to  
5 rating scale).
MARKET OVERVIEW
Growth in the South African private healthcare market 
has stagnated due to elevated political uncertainty, low 
economic growth and a lack of job creation. The market 
offers isolated incremental growth opportunities to 
expand existing hospitals, and to build new hospitals 
and day clinics. Challenges include lowering healthcare 
costs across the value chain in a fragmented market, 
whilst at the same time improving outcomes for 
patients, attracting and retaining qualified staff and 
investing in infrastructure and medical technology.
The Competition Commission is currently undertaking 
a market inquiry into the private healthcare sector in 
South Africa to understand both whether there are 
features of the sector that prevent, distort or restrict 
competition and how competition in the sector can 
be promoted. The inquiry was due to publish its 
recommendations in December 2016, but has advised 
of further delays with the HMI now guiding that the 
final publication is expected at the end of the 2017 
calendar year. Mediclinic has submitted documentation 
to the inquiry and will continue to engage with all 
stakeholders as draft documents are published through 
the year to achieve an agreeable outcome.
The South African Government is seeking to address 
the shortcomings of the public health system through 
the phased introduction of a National Health Insurance 
system over a 14-year period. A draft White Paper 
outlining the financing and design of the envisaged 
system has been released for consultation and 
Mediclinic has submitted comprehensive comments. 
However, there remain a large number of obstacles that 
still need to be addressed before greater clarity about 
the outcomes can be communicated.
OUTLOOK
Mediclinic Southern Africa remains well positioned 
to face the significant challenges that exist in the 
business environment, such as increasing regulatory 
oversight, slow economic growth, a fragmented private 
healthcare delivery model and a shortage of healthcare 
professionals. Mediclinic Southern Africa remains 
cautiously optimistic about its prospects in the region. 
The private healthcare industry has reached maturity 
with limited opportunities for growth of the current 
business. Future growth will focus on related business 
opportunities, for example mental health and primary 
care.
The focus in the coming year will be on further 
developing the operating platform’s strategy to position 
itself for future value-based contracting opportunities. 
The platform will continue to focus strategically on 
the value that it delivers to patients, by continuing to 
improve the safety and quality of its clinical care, the 
quality of the patient experience, and opportunities 
to improve operational efficiency. The platform will 
also continue to focus on opportunities to develop an 
integrated Southern African private healthcare delivery 
model for the future.

CEO’S STATEMENT
“The Middle East platform faced signifi cant 
challenges during the period under review due 
to unexpected regulatory changes in Abu Dhabi, 
increased competition, and the process of 
aligning the Al Noor business with the operational 
and commercial practices of the overall 
Mediclinic Group following the Combination in 
February 2016. This has impacted our fi nancial 
performance and, together with the forecast 
continued lower economic growth in the UAE, 
our short-term growth expectations in the region. 
During the year, however, we implemented various 
initiatives to eﬀ ectively deal with these challenges 
which, combined with the decision of the 
Abu Dhabi Government to reverse co-payments 
by Thiqa members, the introduction of new 
facilities and services and the ongoing upgrade of 
existing units, places Mediclinic Middle East on a 
more sustainable and long-term growth path.”

KEY FINANCIAL AND 
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
Mediclinic Middle East accounted for 24% of the 
Group’s revenues (2016: 16%) and 15% of its underlying 
EBITDA (2016: 16%).
In the Middle East, as at the end of the reporting period, 
the combined business operated 6 hospitals and  
31 clinics with a total of 714 beds and 6 375 employees. 
The platform is one of the largest private healthcare 
providers in the UAE with the majority of its operations 
in Dubai and Abu Dhabi (including Al Ain).
The Mediclinic Middle East financial results represent 
the combined business for FY17. In FY16, Al Noor’s 
results were only consolidated from 15 February 2016. 
During the period under review, revenue increased by 
72% to AED3 109m (2016: AED1 802m). The existing 
Dubai business increased revenue by 5% including 
the related ramp up benefit from the new Mediclinic 
City Hospital North Wing. However, the Abu Dhabi 
business underperformed, down 19% compared to the 
prior year pro forma revenue. On a pro forma basis, 
inpatient admissions and day cases declined by 4.8% 
and outpatient attendance decreased by 9.7%. Bed 
days sold decreased by 6.2%. Abu Dhabi inpatient and 
outpatient volumes were down 12% and 14% respectively 
versus the prior year due to the unforeseen changes 
in the regulatory environment with the introduction of 
a co-payment on local Thiqa insurance card holders,  
a need to align Al Noor with the sustainable business and 
operational practices of the Group, doctor vacancies, 
increased competition and the sale of several non-core 
assets. Thiqa patient volume declines were greater than 
other insurance categories in Abu Dhabi with inpatients 
down 33% and outpatients down 31%.
Underlying EBITDA decreased by 5% to AED364m 
(2016: AED384m) and the underlying EBITDA margin 
decreased to 11.7% from 21.3%. Despite good progress 
made in respect of the integration benefits from 
the combination, this was more than offset by the 
revenue shortfall. Operating profit decreased by 58% 
to AED134m (2016: AED321m). Mediclinic Middle East 
contributed £33m to the Group’s underlying earnings 
compared to £57m in the comparative period.
In early June 2016, the platform amended and 
increased the existing debt facilities to AED1 012bn (of 
which AED220m remains undrawn) from AED282m 
in the prior year, to refinance the bridge loan facility,  
as well as to continue to fund existing expansion 
projects across the UAE. 
The provision for impairment of receivables increased by 
AED113m (AED89m relating to Abu Dhabi receivables) 
and was charged to the income statement. In FY16, 
AED25m (AED9m relating to Abu Dhabi receivables) 
was charged to the income statement. Furthermore, 
an opening balance sheet adjustment of AED73m was 
made to the Al Noor receivables to finalise the Al Noor 
purchase price allocation.

Mediclinic Middle East invested AED188m on expansion 
capital projects and new equipment and AED57m on 
the replacement of existing equipment and upgrade 
projects. The major components of the expansion 
capital expenditure were the Mediclinic City Hospital 
North Wing and Mediclinic Parkview Hospital projects 
in Dubai. The former was successfully opened in  
September 2016 and houses, amongst other 
disciplines, the Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Dubai’s 
most advanced facility for the diagnosis and treatment 
of cancer, built in association with Hirslanden in 
Switzerland. Patient volumes since opening the North 
Wing have been encouraging. Construction of the 
Parkview Hospital, the seventh hospital of the platform, 
is progressing well and is on track to be completed 
in the fourth quarter of the financial year ending  
31 March 2019.
As part of the ongoing investment in the region, a 
partner was selected for an Electronic Health Record 
system which will be implemented over the coming 
years. By creating unified records for patients, 
regardless of which facility they receive treatment at, 
the system will enable the business to deliver improved 
service quality and seamless care for patients.
The regulatory environment in the Middle East had 
a significant impact on the platform’s performance 
this year. On 30 June 2016, the Health Authority Abu 
Dhabi (“HAAD”) announced a number of amendments 
to Abu Dhabi’s health insurance programmes with 
immediate effect as of 1 July 2016. Changes to the 
Thiqa plan (health insurance for UAE Nationals or 
others of similar status in Abu Dhabi) stipulated 
that patients receive 80% coverage of the fees for 
outpatient and inpatient services provided by private 
healthcare facilities in Abu Dhabi (previously 100% for 
most services). It was mandatory for private healthcare 
providers to collect the full co-payment from patients, 
which Mediclinic adhered to with immediate effect. 
A further change saw the Thiqa plan cover only 
50% of the cost if patients sought medical services 
outside Abu Dhabi (including Dubai and the Northern 
Emirates). In Dubai, UAE nationals are covered under 
the ENAYA and SAADA health insurance programme, 
under the supervision of the Dubai Health Authority, 
with a 10% co-payment for inpatient and outpatient 
services in public and private sector. As mentioned, 
these changes had a significant impact on the Thiqa 
patient volumes in the Abu Dhabi business. However, 
on 26 April 2017, following a period of engagement 
with various authorities and stakeholders, His Highness 
Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince 
of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the 
UAE Armed Forces, ordered the waiving of the 20% 
Thiqa co-payment when receiving treatment at private 
healthcare facilities in Abu Dhabi, with immediate effect. 
It was also confirmed that the co-payment for services 
provided to Thiqa patients outside of Abu Dhabi would 
be reduced from 50% to 10%. Preparations are ongoing 
for the introduction of diagnosis-related groups in 
Dubai expected to be implemented in April 2018. The 
platform continues to maintain an active dialogue with 
government authorities on regulatory changes within 
the UAE healthcare sector.
A key focus during the year has been integrating the 
Abu Dhabi-based Al Noor Hospitals Group with the 
established Mediclinic Middle East business in Dubai.

The regional management team successfully addressed 
a number of key issues including the establishment 
of a clear operational and clinical strategy in Abu 
Dhabi, doctor vacancies, integrating the functional 
departments of the two businesses, conforming 
revenue cycle management with the Middle East 
business, identifying synergies in procurement and 
headcount and consolidating the two corporate offices 
and executive management teams. The Group remains 
on track to generate annualised synergies of AED75m 
from the combined Middle East business. Some  
136 new doctor appointments were made in the Middle 
East during FY17 and a further 52 doctors are currently 
in the process of recruitment helping to fill the vacant 
positions that resulted from the departure of doctors in 
the 12 months leading up to the Al Noor combination 
and at the start of FY17.
As part of an extensive review of the Abu Dhabi 
business, certain units, non-core to the central strategy 
of the platform, were identified for divestment. The 
Group has classified AED42m assets and AED9m 
liabilities as held for sale in relation to these units. The 
platform completed the sale of Rochester Wellness, 
consisting of two clinics in Dubai and Oman, to Emirates 
Health during the year. In November 2016, the platform 
completed the sale of Gulf International Cancer Centre 
to Proton Partners International. The construction of  
a new hospital in the Western Region was postponed.
Several new facilities were opened in Abu Dhabi during 
the year. These included the Mediclinic Al Jowhara 
Hospital (formerly Al Noor Hospital – Al Jowhara),  
a 51-bed multi-disciplinary hospital in Al Ain that 
was delayed by several months, clinics in Ghayathi 
(Western Region) and Al Yahar (Al Ain), as well as 
the Aspetar Clinic (Al Ain). The Khalifa City A Clinic 
was opened in April 2017. Areas of opportunity were 
identified in Abu Dhabi, including the expansion 
and redevelopment of Mediclinic Al Noor Hospital 
(formerly Al Noor Hospital – Khalifa Street) and the 
creation of a new Comprehensive Cancer Centre at 
Mediclinic Airport Road Hospital (formerly Al Noor 
Hospital – Airport Road). In September 2016, the 
platform completed the purchase of the remaining 25% 
interest in the Al Madar group of clinics, based in Abu 
Dhabi. The important strategic decision to rebrand  
Al Noor facilities to Mediclinic was taken in  
February 2017 reflecting the ongoing and future 
investment in the Abu Dhabi business. The project 
commenced in April 2017 and due to regulatory 
requirements, is expected to take approximately one 
year to complete. As a result of the rebranding decision, 
an accelerated amortisation charge of AED36m in 
connection with the acquired Al Noor trade name asset 
has been recognised during the period under review. 
The remaining balance of the trade name will be fully 
amortised in FY18. The accelerated amortisation charge 
has been excluded in determining underlying earnings.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The region continues to witness economic uncertainty 
owing to influences such as the strength of the 
United States dollar which is affecting the tourism 
and property market in particular, rising interest rates, 
weakened consumer sentiment, and the continuing low 
oil price which, although stabilising in recent months 
at around USD55 per barrel, still remains well below 
the levels seen in the UAE’s more prosperous periods. 
Despite this, population growth is expected to drive 
domestic demand in the next year, albeit at a reduced 
rate. Growth rates are expected to accelerate slightly in 
Dubai as Expo 2020 draws closer but not to the levels 
experienced in 2012 to 2014.
Within the region’s healthcare market, the increased 
involvement of government authorities in the private 
sector and its introduction of stricter regulatory 
controls, continue to affect the market. This remains 
a significant challenge to Mediclinic Middle East, 
along with persisting economic uncertainty, rising 
costs and increased competition. The true impact 
of the proposed introduction of value-added tax in  
January 2018 also needs to be assessed, as well as the 
effects of a possible introduction of corporate tax in the  
medium term.
Opportunities for the business lie within Mediclinic 
Middle East’s own areas of development, including 
bringing newly-opened facilities to capacity, ensuring 
timely delivery of its projects under construction and 
identifying areas that will add further value to its 
patients and stakeholders.
OUTLOOK 
The economic outlook for the UAE is mixed, with 
its fortunes linked fundamentally to issues such as 
oil price and US economic policy which affects the 
strength of the US dollar, to which the UAE dirham is 
pegged as well as inflation. We are, however, confident 
that our strategy to reduce reliance on the low-priced 
insurance sector, and to further increase the levels of 
services available to our patients, will enable us to build 
on our newly defined base. Other key focus areas are 
to continue to implement an effective business and 
clinical strategy for the combined business including 
further divestments where appropriate, continual 
improvement of the patient experience, bringing all 
new facilities to capacity, the identification of further 
growth opportunities and the delivery of new projects 
already underway.
Preparations for the introduction of diagnosis-related 
groups in Dubai are ongoing. The platform continues 
to maintain an active dialogue with government 
authorities on regulatory changes within the UAE 
healthcare sector. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 54 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS

INTRODUCTION
Mediclinic takes a sustainable, long-term approach to 
business, putting patients at the heart of its operations 
and delivering consistently high-quality healthcare 
services. In order to deliver on these priorities, the Group 
upholds the highest standards of clinical governance 
and ethical behaviour across its platforms, invests 
significant time and resources in recruiting and retaining 
skilled staff, makes considerable investment into its

Effective communication with stakeholders is 
fundamental in maintaining Mediclinic’s corporate 
reputation as a trusted and respected provider of 
healthcare services and positioning itself as a leading 
international private healthcare group. Mediclinic’s 
commitment to its stakeholders to conduct its business 
in a responsible and sustainable way, and to respond 
to stakeholder needs, is entrenched in the Group’s 
values and supported by the Group Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics. A wide variety of communication 
vehicles are used to engage with stakeholders, which 
serve as an impact assessment to assess stakeholders’ 
needs and to effectively respond thereto. Stakeholders’ 
legitimate expectations have been taken into account 
in setting the Group’s key sustainability priorities, 
as reported on throughout this report. The Group 
continually looks for ways to improve its use of online 
channels to communicate with its stakeholders through 
the corporate website and webcasting.

MATERIAL ISSUES
As a result of its operations, Mediclinic has many 
economic, social and environmental impacts, including 
creating employment opportunities, training and 
developing employees, black economic empowerment 
in South Africa, investing in local communities and 
responsible use of natural resources. 
In order to focus its reporting on material issues, the 
Group undertook a materiality assessment, which 
is reviewed annually, to identify those sustainable 
development issues which are most significant for 
the business, and directly affect the Group’s ability to 
create value for our key stakeholders. The guidance 
on determining materiality contained in the GRI 
Sustainability Reporting Standards and the International 
Integrated Reporting Framework was used during the 
materiality assessment. The process was also informed 
by the views, concerns and expectations of the Group’s 
key stakeholders. 
The Group categorised these issues and the associated 
performance indicators according to the six capitals 
(financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and 
relationship, and natural) included in the International 
Integrated Reporting Framework, as illustrated in 
Figure 1.
The materiality assessment identified the following 
five material issues, which remain unchanged from last 
year’s report and constitute the focus of the Group’s 
sustainable development reporting:
• 
Provide quality healthcare services
• 
Address shortage of healthcare practitioners
• 
Create and sustain shareholder value
• 
Responsible use of natural resources
• 
Governance and corporate social responsibility

BUSINESS
Mediclinic’s business is guided by its Patients First 
ethos, which aims to enhance the quality of life of its 
patients by providing comprehensive, high-quality 
healthcare services, and position the Group as the 
healthcare provider of choice for patients. Mediclinic’s 
reputation as a respected and trusted provider of 
quality healthcare services helps it to attract and retain 
high-quality healthcare practitioners, including doctors 
and nurses. 
To ensure that it is consistently delivering the maximum 
value to its patients, Mediclinic has a strong focus on 
improving and maintaining excellent clinical performance 
across its platforms. Clinical performance is measured 
and benchmarked to guarantee a standardised quality 
of care for all its patients, ensure patient safety and

   There are some minor differences in the reported rates 
due to definition changes in Mediclinic Southern Africa

  There was a change in the methodology for measuring the

resulting in a higher rate than previously reported. Whereas 
Mediclinic Southern Africa previously excluded a number of  
planned admissions from the calculation, it currently measures 
all-cause re-admissions. 
  The addition of data from Al Noor led to an increase in the  
30-day related re-admission rate for Mediclinic Middle East.

Key patient safety indicators are monitored across 
Mediclinic’s operations. Patient safety surveys are 
regularly undertaken to measure and identify areas 
for improvement. Management is trained in the basic 
principles of patient safety and quality improvement. 
Multi-disciplinary clinical committees at hospital level 
have been established throughout the Group to drive 
quality and safety and promote cooperation between 
doctors, nursing staff and management. 
Checklists (including the Safe Surgery checklist) were 
implemented across the organisation in accordance 
with the recommendations from the World Health 
Organisation and the Joint Commission International 
(“JCI”), and are believed to significantly contribute to 
patient safety.
Additionally, structured clinical audits are 
undertaken across all platforms and aid in identifying 
opportunities for quality improvement going  
forward. Clinical outcomes are benchmarked internally 
as well as through participation in several external 
initiatives, including:
• 
the Vermont Oxford Network aimed at measuring 
and improving the quality of care in neonatal 
intensive care units (Southern Africa and the  
UAE); and
• 
the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (“SAPS”),  
a hospital mortality prediction methodology for 
adult intensive care patients, used to evaluate the 
quality of care in this complex setting. SAPS II is 
currently being used in Hirslanden, and Mediclinic 
Southern Africa and Mediclinic Middle East recently 
migrated to SAPS3.

Hirslanden to their family and friends. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 58 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Across all platforms staff are expected to maintain 
the confidentiality of all medical, financial and 
administrative patient information of which they may 
become aware during the course of their duties, and 
are required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon 
joining. Access to patient medical records is strictly 
controlled, and medical records are not released 
outside the relevant platform unless authorised by  
the patient.

PATIENT SATISFACTION AND 
EXPERIENCE
In line with its Patients First ethos and to ensure 
operational excellence across all platforms, Mediclinic 
monitors its patients’ experience across the Group. 
In 2014, the Group created a single, standardised 
Patient Experience Index (“PEI”) with the objective of 
achieving incremental and sustainable improvement 
of the patient experience over time. The entire survey 
process is managed by Press Ganey, an internationally 
recognised leader in patient experience research, 
providing an in-depth analysis of the data and advising 
on global best practices.
The PEI was implemented for inpatients at all 
Mediclinic Southern Africa hospitals and for both  
in- and outpatients at all Mediclinic Middle East 
facilities, where it will be introduced during 2017. The 
survey was implemented at Hirslanden from April 2017.
Refer to the table on page 57 for the patient 
satisfaction level of Hirslanden based on the 
ANQ (Swiss National Association for Quality 
Development); and the PEI of Mediclinic Southern 
Africa and Mediclinic Middle East.
PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN HIGH-
QUALITY HOSPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
(FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT)
To ensure a safe and user-friendly environment for 
both our patients and employees, we strive to provide 
high-quality healthcare facilities and technology, 
focusing on capital investments, maintenance of 
facilities and optimal use of facilities. As a result, the 
Group continuously invests in capital projects and new 
equipment to expand and refurbish our facilities and 
the replacement of existing equipment, as well as on 
the repair and maintenance of existing property and 
equipment. Refer to Material Issue 3: Create and 
Sustain Shareholder Value on pages 62 to 63 for 
further detail regarding the Group’s investments in 
capital projects and new equipment; replacement of 
equipment; and repairs and maintenance.
PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT
In order to deliver its services, Mediclinic is dependent 
on a large and diverse range of suppliers, who form 
an integral part of the Group’s ability to provide 
AR
CSR
AR
quality hospital care. Mediclinic believes in building 
long-term relationships with suitable suppliers and 
establishing a relationship of mutual trust and respect.  
Regular meetings are held with suppliers to ensure 
continuity of service. The Group relies on its suppliers 
to deliver products and services of the highest quality 
in line with Mediclinic’s standards. Various other criteria 
play an important role in selecting suppliers, such as: 
compliance with applicable international and local 
quality standards, price, compliance with appropriate 
specifications suited for the Group’s markets, stability 
of the organisation and the relevant equipment brand, 
good-quality and cost-effective solutions, support 
network, technical advice and training philosophy.  
In South Africa, the BBBEE status of a supplier is also 
a factor in the selection process. An enterprise and 
supplier development strategy specific to procurement 
is being developed in South Africa to enhance  
BBBEE reporting.
The availability of products and services is imperative 
in enabling the Group to deliver quality care to its 
patients, and therefore an important criterion in its 
supplier selection process. Though not always the 
case, this often leads to local suppliers being preferred, 
which adds to better and faster service delivery and 
knowledge of local laws and regulations, particularly 
with regard to pharmaceutical products.
COST OF HEALTHCARE
The Group contributes in various ways to a sustainable 
healthcare system by, inter alia, focussing on efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness, conducting tariff negotiations 
in a fair and transparent manner, expanding facilities 
based on need, and actively participating in healthcare 
reform.
The Group is focused on streamlining and centralising 
its procurement processes to improve efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness. During the reporting period, 
good progress was made on a range of international 
procurement initiatives including:
• 
the classification and matching of products used 
across all its operating platforms to compare prices 
and drive procurement strategies; 
• 
better prices through pooling of capital equipment 
purchases across the three platforms; 
• 
volume bonus agreements with key capital 
equipment suppliers; and
• 
direct importing and distribution of more  
cost-effective surgical and consumable products.
Refer to the Chief Executive Officer’s Review, Our 
Strategy, Progress and Aims, as well as the Divisional 
Reviews included in this report, for various examples of 
initiatives to improve cost-effectiveness.
ACCREDITATION
Hospitals are high-risk environments in which complex 
treatment processes are executed using sophisticated 
equipment and techniques. The process of external 
accreditation ensures that international standards 
are adhered to in all aspects of hospital operations. 
For more details on accreditation, please refer to the 
Clinical Services Report, available on the Company’s 
website at www.mediclinic.com.

MATERIAL ISSUE 2: ADDRESS SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE 
PRACTITIONERS
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
The attraction of suitably qualified healthcare 
professionals is essential in delivering the Group’s 
Patients First strategy. For this reason, priority focus 
is given to a proactive sourcing approach aligned to 
workforce planning for the medium term. Nurses, 
pharmacists and doctors are categorised as critical 
skills and an integrated talent management strategy 
is tailored to each of these categories to ensure the 
support of the entire employee life cycle in these 
roles. A definite strength is the available talent 
analytics which indicate patterns in candidate and 
employee behaviour over time. These provide a strong  
predictive advantage and these insights are 
incorporated into the talent management strategy for 
each of these categories.
The focus of attracting and utilising talent in a 
challenging healthcare market continues to be nurses, 
emergency room doctors and pharmacists. Proactive 
initiatives are implemented in the specific categories 
and geographical areas of concern.

SUMMARISED APPROACH AND 
PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR
EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND 
RETENTION
The human resources policies and supporting good 
practice protocols at each platform provide governance 
guidelines to ensure consistent practices in support 
of the entire employee life cycle. Good progress was 
made during the period under review in terms of the 
internationalisation of the human resources strategy. 
The focus remains to address local challenges through 
tailored human resources strategies at platform level, 
but to also share global expertise and best practices to 
the benefit of all. 
International and local processes have been defined 
and priority is given to longer-term system enablement 
through the implementation of an integrated human 
resources management system. The value of comparable 
and quality data, which is made accessible to all 
stakeholders will become evident in the medium to longer 
term. Talent analytics have always been an important 
focus and the value of comparable quality Group data 
will provide a competitive edge in terms of trend and risk 
identification and the input to proactive strategy.
LABOUR RELATIONS AND 
REMUNERATION
Employee remuneration
The Group remunerates employees in a manner that 
supports the achievement of the Group’s vision and 
strategic objectives, while attracting and retaining 
scarce skills and rewarding high levels of performance. 
This is achieved through establishing remuneration 
practices that are fair, reasonable and market-related 
while at the same time maintaining an appropriate 
balance between employee and shareholder interest. 
To encourage a performance-driven organisation, 
the Group rewards employees for achieving strategic 
objectives as well as individual personal performance 
targets. Benefits for all employees include a retirement 
fund, medical aid scheme, performance-related 
incentives and bonuses and liability insurance for 
medical staff. Those managers who receive variable 
remuneration have a combination of short- and  
long-term incentives. During 2015, the Group 
introduced a Reward Centre of Expertise, specialising 
in the design and delivery of global reward initiatives. 
Labour relations
The Group believes in building sound long-term relations 
with its employees and employee representatives, 
which supports its goal of being the employer of choice 
in the healthcare industry. This is measured by the Your 
Voice employee engagement survey and continuous 
assessment of the Group’s employment conditions. 
The Group respects and complies with the labour 
legislation in the countries in which it operates, and 
ensures that the internal policies and procedures 
are evaluated regularly to accommodate continual 
amendments to relevant legislation. The Group 
continuously strives to ensure that all its employees 
are informed of their benefits, and this information 
is communicated to staff via the intranet, staff 
newsletters, staff consultation meetings and various 
other forms of communication media. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 61 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to invest significantly in training 
and skills development to maintain and improve quality 
service delivery. The percentage of payroll invested in 
training and skills development by each of the Group’s 
operating platforms is provided on page 59.
The Group’s commitment to provide quality care 
for its patients can only be ensured if its staff has 
appropriate, evolving skill sets, which is reflected in the 
number of learning initiatives undertaken each year.  
A consistent performance management system is 
applied throughout the Group, which allows us to 
identify and manage training needs of individual 
employees, and to discuss career development. 
Succession planning is standardised on an 
organisational level in all three operating platforms 
and a Group talent review is performed annually. 
Critical talent (such as nurses and pharmacists) 
as well as high-performing individuals with 
potential are identified and supported through 
tailored development initiatives. An inter-platform 
development programme which offers a series of 
secondments across platforms has been designed 
to help these individuals excel at Mediclinic. The 
programme is currently implemented at organisational 
level for talent with the potential to be successors 
to a key position in their own platform or across 
platforms within the larger Mediclinic Group. The aim 
of the programme is to provide priority talent (either 
critical talent or high performers with potential), the 
opportunity to gain cross-platform exposure. All 
platforms have received the programme with great 
enthusiasm and the Group is proud to continue to 
grow this amazing development opportunity to the 
benefit of all.
SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL TRAINING 
INSTITUTIONS
The Group is committed to educational development in 
all three of its operating platforms and provides financial 
and other support towards healthcare education.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY
Health and safety policies and procedures are in place 
across the Group to ensure a safe working environment 
for the Group’s employees, patients and its visitors. 
The health and safety of the Group’s employees are 
essential and contribute to the sustainability of quality 
care to patients. The programmes and procedures 
implemented by the various business units to mitigate 
health and safety risks are outlined in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
AR
SDR
During the year, there were no incidents of material 
non-compliance with any laws, regulations, accepted 
standards or codes applicable to the Group, with no 
significant fines being imposed, concerning the health 
and safety impact of the Group’s services.
EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AND 
ENGAGEMENT
In 2015, Mediclinic, in partnership with Gallup, 
introduced the Your Voice employee engagement 
programme across all operating platforms to measure 
levels of engagement, identify gaps at a departmental 
level and support line managers in developing action 
plans to address concerns. 
Overall, the Group achieved a 71% (2016: 65%) participation 
rate in the Your Voice survey and 36% (2016: 32%) of 
employees showed high levels of engagement.
Strengths which the survey highlighted include 
employees knowing what is expected of them and 
having the appropriate materials and equipment to 
perform at work. Areas for improvement highlighted 
by the survey include recognition and praise for good 
work and valuing the opinions of employees.
During 2017, Mediclinic aims to follow a more focused 
approach by driving central engagement themes and 
ensuring adequate feedback and action planning takes 
place at all localities and departments. Champions have 
been trained to support line managers in facilitating 
workshops to address concerns at the departmental 
level. Champions and line managers will work towards 
developing a better understanding of the engagement 
needs of the Mediclinic workforce and addressing 
concerns according to the engagement hierarchy.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 62 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
MATERIAL ISSUE 3: CREATE AND SUSTAIN SHAREHOLDER VALUE
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
As can be seen from its business model on pages 22 
to 23, the Group is only able to offer the best possible 
care to its patients with support and investment from 
its shareholders. The Group believes that identifying 
and realising suitable growth opportunities is key to 
create and sustain shareholder value over the longer 
term, as these opportunities enable it to realise tangible 
benefits. Such benefits include: reduced costs through 
procurement on a greater scale; the creation of 
shared operations teams; the combination of existing 
corporate functions; and the transfer of knowledge 
and best practices across the Group.

MATERIAL ISSUE 4: RESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
BUSINESS
The Group’s main environmental impacts are the 
utilisation of resources, predominantly energy, through 
electricity consumption and water, and the disposal of 
healthcare risk waste. The Group is fully aware of the 
need to use resources responsibly and is committed 
to minimising its environmental impacts to the extent 
possible. 
The Group recognises the risks that regulatory changes, 
environmental constraints and climate change present 
to its operations. Potential impacts include rising 
costs, reduced access to facilities, interruptions in 
service, and incidents of extreme weather events as a 
result of climate change placing additional stress on 
operations. Additionally, climate change can lead to 
water shortages (especially in the UAE and in Southern 
Africa) and weather-induced pandemics and disease 
outbreaks which can cause high mortality rates. 
However, the Group also believes that using resources 
responsibly can be a source of strategic advantage 
for the Group, allowing it to manage and contain its 
operating costs and to ensure ongoing access to water 
and energy supplies.
Mediclinic’s patients are always its first priority, but 
without natural resources, especially water, Mediclinic 
would not be able to provide a service to its patients. 
The Group takes its policies to reduce its impact 
on the environment very seriously and its Natural 
Resources Committee is constantly investigating new 
opportunities to reduce its impact on the environment.

The Group’s main environmental impacts are the 
utilisation of resources and waste which have a direct 
effect on carbon emissions. Items listed in the aspect 
register relating to regulatory compliance, healthcare 
risk waste, water, electricity, paper, hazardous waste 
and gases not only could have a significant impact on 
the environment, but also informs strategy on climate 
change related risks and opportunities.
The carbon emissions per platform, for the periods 
as specified therein, are reported in the Sustainable

ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Electricity is the main contributor to our carbon 
footprint and all our platforms are taking steps to 
reduce their electricity consumption intensity through 
the adoption of ISO 14001 management standards, 
leading to improved operational efficiency of technical 
installations, introduction of various new energy-
efficient and renewable technologies and changes in 
staff behaviour regarding energy use. 
The direct and indirect energy consumption per 
platform, for the periods as specified therein, is 
reported in the Sustainable Development Report.
WATER USAGE
The Group’s platforms in Southern Africa and in the 
UAE can suffer from significant water shortages so it 
is critical for the Group to monitor water consumption 
closely. There are various measures in place to minimise 
water consumption; including reclaiming water, 
monitoring hot water consumption and installing water 
meters and control sensors. 
The total water usage has decreased throughout the 
Group. The total volume of water withdrawn from 
water utilities throughout the Group, for the periods 
as specified therein, is reported in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
WASTE MANAGEMENT
Stringent protocols are followed to ensure that refuse 
removal within the Group complies with all legislation, 
regulations and by-laws. The Group regards the 
handling of waste in an environmentally sound, legal 
and safe manner as its ethical, moral and professional 
duty. During the reporting period, there were no 
incidents at the Group’s facilities or offices leading to

CARBON EMISSIONS
The CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project) is a global initiative measuring companies 
around the world and their reporting on greenhouse gas 
emissions and climate change strategies. It is regarded 
as a global leader in capturing and analysing data 
that record the business response to climate change, 
including management of risks and opportunities, 
absolute emissions levels, performance over time and 
governance. Participation and disclosure of the results 
are voluntary. The project was launched in South Africa 
in 2007 in partnership with the National Business 
Initiative in which JSE-listed companies are measured. 
Mediclinic has participated in the project since 2008, 
initially only in respect of Mediclinic Southern Africa. 
Limited information in respect of Mediclinic Middle 
East has also been included since 2010, although it 
still remains an initiative focusing mainly on Mediclinic 
Southern Africa’s data. Mediclinic’s CDP reports can be 
accessed on the CDP website at www.cdp.net, with the 
most recent reports also available on the Company’s

SUMMARISED APPROACH AND 
PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR
ETHICS AND GOVERNANCE
The Group’s commitment to ethical standards is set out 
in the Group’s values, and is supported by the Group 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), 
available on the Company’s website. The Code provides 
a framework for the standards of business conduct 
and ethics that are required of all business divisions, 
directors and employees. The Code is available to all 
staff and is included in new employee inductions.
Further details regarding the Group’s ethics 
management, risk management process and corporate 
governance practices are discussed in detail in 
the report on Risk Management, Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties and the Corporate Governance 
Statement.
EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s Enterprise-wide Risk Management 
(“ERM”) policy follows the international Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”) framework and defines the risk 
management objectives, methodology, risk appetite, 
risk identification, assessment and treatment processes 
and the responsibilities of the various risk management 
role-players in the Group. The ERM policy is subject to 
annual review and any amendments are submitted  
to the Audit and Risk Committee for approval. 
The objective of risk management in the Group is to 
establish an integrated and effective risk management 
framework where important and emerging risks are 
identified, quantified and managed. An ERM software 
application supports the Group’s risk management 
process in all three operating platforms.
Further details on the Group’s risk management 
approach, as well as principal risks and uncertainties 
are included in the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties.

MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 67 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 68 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS
Compliance risk was identified as an integral risk 
management focus area for the year across the 
Group. In light of the large volume of legislative and 
regulatory requirements applicable to the Group in 
each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, as well as 
various industry standards that the platforms should 
comply with, compliance risk requires specific focus. 
A three-year compliance monitoring programme was 
developed to enhance the existing compliance culture 
and approach to compliance risk in the Group. Good 
progress was made to define and integrate relevant 
laws and potential risks in the risk registers of the 
various platforms and departments during the year.
Further details on the Group’s compliance management 
are included in the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties, and in the Audit 
and Risk Committee Report.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF 
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
During the year, no material incidents of discrimination, 
violations involving rights of indigenous people  
and/or human rights reviews or impact assessments 
were observed or reported throughout the Group.
BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC 
EMPOWERMENT (“BBBEE”) (SOUTH 
AFRICA ONLY)
Mediclinic Southern Africa forms an integral part of 
the political, social and economic community in South 
Africa and is committed to sustainable transformation 
as part of its business strategy. Mediclinic Southern 
Africa’s Executive Committee is responsible to ensure 
that the appropriate focus is placed on the group’s 
commitment to the development and implementation 
of sustainable BBBEE initiatives. 
Mediclinic Southern Africa is assessed annually by 
an accredited verification agency against the generic 
scorecard criteria set by the Department of Trade 
and Industry (“dti”). During the period under review, 
Mediclinic Southern Africa was assessed in terms of 
the new BBBEE Codes of Good Practice, gazetted in 
2013, for the first time. As anticipated, this resulted 
in Mediclinic Southern Africa’s total BBBEE score, as 
measured with regards to ownership, management 
and control, skills development, enterprise and supplier 
development and socio-economic development, 
declining from 73.06 to 51.73 during the year, which 
score is currently being reviewed. Mediclinic Southern 
Africa is further reviewing its BBBEE strategy with  
a view to increase its BBBEE score in future.
AR
The number of black employees increased  
year-on-year from 70.5% to 71.22% of total employees.  
Black management representation increased from 11% 
in 2006 to 27.7% (2016: 25.7%) at year end.
During the year, Mediclinic Southern Africa’s 
transformation department continued with the diversity 
management interventions through workshops and 
presentations for employees throughout the group. 
The workshops are designed to help employees have 
a better understanding of diversity to embrace and 
celebrate diversity and be able to recruit, manage and 
retain talented employees from diverse backgrounds.
Mediclinic Southern Africa’s current employment 
equity plan expires in October 2017. The company is 
currently in the process of compiling a new plan which 
will expire in 2022. A summarised employment equity 
report (EEA2), as submitted to the Department of 
Labour in November 2016, is included in the Sustainable 
Development Report.
CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (“CSI”)
The Group contributes to the well-being of the 
communities within which it operates by investing 
in ongoing initiatives that address socio-economic 
problems or risks, and it has established Mediclinic as 
an integral member of these communities, enriching 
the lives of many communities throughout Southern 
Africa, Switzerland and the UAE.
The Group’s CSI activities are structured around the 
improvement of healthcare through training and 
education, sponsorships, donations, staff volunteerism, 
public private initiatives and joint ventures. Many of the 
Group’s initiatives relate to providing training and to 
financial support of training. Due to the socio-economic 
conditions in Southern Africa, the majority of our CSI 
contributions are by Mediclinic Southern Africa.
The CSI spend per platform is provided on page 66.

AR MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 69 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
Dear Shareholder,
The Board and I are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity and 
ethics, which is embedded in our corporate culture and values. Our corporate governance structures support the 
effective delivery of Mediclinic’s strategy and are focused on maintaining and building a sustainable business and 
supporting our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen in every country and community in which the 
Group does business. The key elements of our governance structures include:
• 
ensuring good clinical outcomes and quality healthcare (refer to the Clinical Services Overview from  
page 37, as well as the Clinical Services Report available on the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com);
• 
upholding strict principles of corporate governance, integrity and ethics (refer to the Corporate 
Governance Statement from page 73); 
• 
maintaining effective risk management and internal controls (refer to the report on Risk Management, 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties from page 30);
• 
engaging with our stakeholders and responding to their reasonable expectations (refer to the stakeholder 
engagement section in the Sustainable Development Report available on the Company’s website at  
www.mediclinic.com); 
• 
managing our business in a sustainable manner (refer to the Sustainable Development Highlights from 
page 54, as well as the Sustainable Development Report available on the Company’s website at  
www.mediclinic.com); and
• 
offering our employees competitive remuneration packages based on the principles of fairness and 
affordability (refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 85, as well as the Sustainable 
Development Report available on the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com).
In the Corporate Governance Statement that follows, feedback is given on the governance framework, Board 
meetings and the principal activities of the Board, the composition and diversity of the Board and measures 
to ensure the Board’s accountability to our stakeholders. Every Director demonstrated their commitment to 
Mediclinic throughout the year, through their meeting attendance and the high quality of their contributions 
at those meetings. I am pleased that the Board structure put in place following the Al Noor Combination in  
February 2016 has operated effectively. The internal self-evaluation of the Board conducted during the year did 
not raise any major areas requiring improvement. With the retirement of Craig Tingle, Chief Financial Officer, and 
Ian Tyler, Senior Independent Director, during the year, the Nomination Committee and the Board continued to 
focus on succession planning and targeting diverse pools of talent from which to recruit the right individuals. 
I remain confident that the Board, supported by an effective management team and an effective governance 
structure, is well placed to continue creating long-term value for stakeholders and maintaining Mediclinic’s 
leading position in the international healthcare market.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Board of Directors is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for ensuring the sound management 
and long-term success of the Group. This can only 
be achieved if the Board is supported by appropriate 
governance processes to ensure that the Group is 
managed responsibly and with integrity, fairness, 
transparency and accountability. This Corporate 
Governance Statement describes the key elements of 
Mediclinic’s corporate governance framework. 
A Group Corporate Governance Manual, dealing with 
Board practices and Group policies, provides guidance 
to the company secretaries, boards and management 
of the Company and its three operating platforms 
in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the United Arab 
Emirates to ensure that similar corporate governance 
practices are followed throughout the Group.
COMPLIANCE WITH UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
AND LISTING RULES
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and the highest 
standards of integrity and ethics. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “UK Corporate Governance 
Code” or the “Code”), most recently updated 
in April 2016 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(the “FRC”) and available on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk, contains a series of broad principles 
and specific provisions which embody good practice 
in relation to five key areas: leadership, effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders. This report, together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the various Board 
committee reports included in this Annual Report, 
describes how the Board applied the main principles 
of the Code and complied with its provisions. 
During the year under review and up to the date of this 
report, the Company complied with all the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, other than the 
exceptions noted below:
• 
Provision B.2.1 (regarding the Nomination 
Committee leading the process for Board 
appointments and making recommendations  
to the Board)
Appointments to the Board are recommended by 
the Nomination Committee and further details on 
the Committee and the appointment process can 
be found on pages 108 to 110. In accordance with 
the Company’s relationship agreement with its 
principal shareholder, Remgro Limited (“Remgro”), 
further details of which are provided on page 125, 
Remgro is entitled to appoint up to a maximum 
of three Directors to the Board. Jannie Durand 
represents Remgro on the Board of Directors and 
was appointed by Remgro in the previous reporting 
period on 15 February 2016. His appointment was 
therefore not led by the Nomination Committee. 
AR
AR
With the exception of this appointment, made 
in accordance with the terms of the relationship 
agreement, the Nomination Committee leads 
the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board in accordance with 
the Code. No new Board appointments were made 
in terms of the Relationship Agreement during the 
year under review.
• 
Provision D.2.1 (regarding having at least three 
independent non-executive directors serving on the 
Remuneration Committee)
Ian Tyler, who served as an independent non-
executive member of the Remuneration Committee, 
resigned as a Director on 21 February 2017. From 
the date of his resignation up to the appointment of 
Seamus Keating as an independent non-executive 
member of the Remuneration Committee on  
17 March 2017, the Remuneration Committee had 
only two independent non-executive members 
and did not meet the requirement to have at least  
three independent non-executive members. The 
Company fully complied with this requirement apart 
from this short period between 21 February 2017 and 
17 March 2017, during which period no committee 
meetings were held.
• 
Provision E.1.1 (regarding the attendance by the 
Senior Independent Director (“SID”) of sufficient 
meetings with a range of major shareholders)
The Company has not met the requirement that the 
“SID should attend sufficient meetings with a range 
of major shareholders to listen to their views in 
order to help develop a balanced understanding of 
the issues and concerns of major shareholders”. This 
provision of the Code, supports the main principle 
of the Code requiring dialogue with shareholders 
based on a mutual understanding of objectives and 
that the Chairman should ensure that all Directors 
are made aware of their major shareholders’ issues 
and concerns, with which the Company complies. 
The Board believes that appropriate mechanisms 
are in place to engage with shareholders, without 
the need for the SID to attend meetings with major 
shareholders. The SID is, however, available to 
attend such meetings if requested by shareholders. 
Although the SID and any other Non-executive 
Directors have the opportunity to attend analyst 
presentations hosted by the Company, the principal 
engagement with the capital markets lies mainly 
with CEO, CFO and the Head of Investor Relations, 
who provide regular feedback to the Board on 
investor relations matters, including, inter alia, an 
overview of meetings held with investors. Refer 
to pages 83 to 84 for more information on the 
Company’s shareholder engagement. 
In addition to complying with applicable corporate 
governance requirements in the UK in accordance with 
its primary listing on the LSE, the Board is also satisfied 
that the Company meets all relevant requirements of 
the JSE Listings Requirements and the NSX Listings 
Requirements as a result of its secondary listings on 
the JSE, the South African securities exchange, and the 
NSX, the Namibian securities exchange.

BOARD STRUCTURE

The Board has full and effective control of 
the Company and all material resolutions 
are approved by the Board. The Board has 
adopted a robust corporate governance 
framework, as summarised in Figure 1, 
which assists the Board in the exercise of its 
responsibilities, providing strategic direction 
to the Company in order to create long-term 
shareholder value. A Board Charter sets out 
the key responsibilities of the Chairman, SID, 
Non-executive Directors, Executive Directors, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Company 
Secretary. It further demonstrates the roles of 
the various Board committees.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated authority to the Board 
committees to carry out certain tasks on its 
behalf, in order to operate efficiently and give

between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer, as summarised in

LEADERSHIP
The Board approved the appointment of Pieter Uys as an alternate to Jannie Durand in April 2016, and of 
Jurgens Myburgh as CFO in August 2016, upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee.
The Board reviewed outcomes and agreed actions after internal self-evaluation of the Board, Board

Ian Tyler.
The Board considered feedback on engagement with investors, together with an analysis of the Company’s 
share register.
The Board approved the arrangements with the Company’s strategic black partners in terms of a black 
ownership initiative to formalise their shareholding in the Company, as announced in September 2016.
BOARD COMPOSITION AND 
DIVERSITY
The delivery of the Company’s long-term strategy 
depends on attracting and retaining the right skills 
across the Group, starting with the Board of Mediclinic. 
A list of the Company’s current Directors, including 
their biographies, who were in office during the year 
and up to the date of signing the financial statements, 
can be found on pages 70 to 71 and page 76.
As at 31 March 2017 and as at the date of this 
report, the Board comprised the non-executive 
Chairman, a Non-executive Director, six Independent  
Non-executive Directors, and two Executive Directors 
from wide-ranging backgrounds and with varying 
industry and professional experience. The Company 
complies with the Code’s recommendation that at least 
half the Board should be independent.
The Company’s Chairman, Dr Edwin Hertzog, is not 
considered to be an independent Director given 
his involvement as Chief Executive of Mediclinic 
International Limited until his appointment as 
Chairman in 1992 and his position as non-executive 
Deputy Chairman of Remgro Limited, the principal 
shareholder of the Company. Nonetheless, given his  
in-depth industry knowledge and experience, the 
Board considers it in the best interests of the Company 
that he serves as Chairman.
Mediclinic recognises the importance and benefits 
of having a diverse Board and believes that diversity 
at Board level is an essential element in maintaining 
a competitive advantage. The Board considers that 
diversity is not limited to gender and that a diverse 
Board will include and make good use of differences 
in the skills, geographic and industry experience, 
background, race, gender and other characteristics  
of Directors. 
AR
AR
The Board seeks to construct an effective, robust, well 
balanced and complementary Board, whose capability 
is appropriate for the nature, complexity and strategic 
demands of the business. The Nomination Committee 
leads the process for Board appointments as further 
detailed in the Nomination Committee Report.  
The Board and the Nomination Committee actively 
consider the structure, size and composition of the 
Board and its committees when contemplating new 
appointments and succession planning for the year 
ahead. A range of diversity factors will be taken into 
account in determining the optimum composition 
of the Board and its committees, together with the 
need to balance their composition and refresh this 
progressively over time.
The Company’s Non-executive Directors come 
from a wide range of industries, backgrounds 
and geographic locations and have appropriate 
experience of organisations with international reach. 
While the Board recognises that the existing skills 
and expertise of the current Directors are extensive, 
the Nomination Committee continues to consider 
the appointment of additional Independent Non-
executive Directors to further strengthen the Board 
and its committees’ with diverse expertise and to 
increase the female representation on the Board.  
No quota regarding gender balance has been imposed; 
however, the Nomination Committee and Board remain 
committed to ensuring that the business benefits 
from a diverse Board. Accordingly, when considering 
Board appointments and internal promotions at senior 
level, the Company will continue to take account of 
relevant voluntary guidelines and the performance of 
peer companies in fulfilling their role with regards to 
diversity, whilst seeking to ensure that each post is 
offered strictly on merit to the best available candidate. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 80 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed and updated its Board Diversity Policy. The Board’s 
diversity policy statement is set out on page 79. For details on the diversity of the Group, including a breakdown 
by gender, age and race (only for South Africa) on the Board and senior management roles see the Directors’ 
Report on page 127. Figure 6 provides an overview of the Board’s composition and diversity in terms of gender 
and experience.

INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL 
ADVICE
All Directors may seek independent professional 
advice in connection with their roles as Directors. All 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary at the expense of the Company. 
The Company has provided for both indemnities and 
directors’ and officers’ insurance to the Directors in 
connection with their duties and responsibilities.
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE
All Non-executive Directors serve on the basis of letters 
of appointment which are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office. The letters of 
appointment set out the time commitment expected 
of Non-executive Directors who, on appointment, 
undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet 
their requirements.
The Non-executive Directors are appointed for a term 
of three years, subject to earlier termination, including 
provision for early termination by either the Company 
or the Non-executive Director on three months’ notice. 
DIRECTORS’ INDUCTION AND 
TRAINING
The Chairman, with the support of the Company 
Secretary, is responsible for the induction of new 
Directors and ongoing development of all Directors. 
Upon appointment, all Directors were provided 
with training in respect of their legal, regulatory 
and governance responsibilities and obligations 
in accordance with the UK regulatory regime.  
Jurgens Myburgh, as CFO, and Pieter Uys, as alternate 
to Jannie Durand, were appointed during the year 
and have each undertaken a comprehensive Board 
induction programme tailored to their individual needs 
and requirements. The induction includes face-to-face 
meetings with executive management and operational 
site visits to orientate and familiarise them with our 
industry, organisation, business, strategy, commercial 
objectives and key risks.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically 
discussed at Board meetings and briefings are 
arranged on issues relating to corporate governance 
and other areas of importance.
The Board is kept up to date on legal, regulatory and 
governance matters at Board meetings. Additional 
training is available on request, where appropriate, so 
that Directors can update their skills and knowledge 
as applicable. 
FIGURE 6: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 81 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
DIRECTOR ELECTION/ 
RE-ELECTION
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, a Director appointed during the year, 
should stand for election at the first annual general 
meeting subsequent to such appoint, and other 
Directors must retire by rotation and seek re-election 
by shareholders every three years. However, the Code 
requires that all directors of FTSE350 companies 
should stand for re-election annually. Accordingly,  
Jurgens Myburgh, who was appointed as a Director 
from 1 August 2016, will stand for election at the 
Company’s annual general meeting to be held on  
25 July 2017; and all other Directors will stand for annual 
re-election at the meeting. Taking into account the 
result of an internal Board evaluation which was carried 
out during the year and following recommendations 
from the Nomination Committee, the Board considers 
that all Directors continue to be effective, committed to 
their roles and have sufficient time available to perform 
their duties and therefore recommends the election 
and re-election of these Directors to the Board. 
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF 
INTEREST
In accordance with the UK Companies Act and the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the Board may 
authorise any matter that otherwise may involve any 
of the Directors breaching his or her duty to avoid 
conflicts of interest. The Board adopted a procedure 
to address these requirements, which includes the 
Directors completing detailed conflict of interest 
questionnaires on appointment. The matters disclosed 
in the questionnaires are reviewed by the Board 
following the Directors’ appointment and annually 
thereafter and, if considered appropriate, authorised 
in accordance with the Act and the Articles. Any new 
conflicts of interest are disclosed to the Board as soon 
as they arise, for consideration. 
EVALUATION OF THE BOARD, 
COMMITTEES, CHAIRMAN, 
INDIVIDUAL DIRECTORS AND THE 
COMPANY SECRETARY
During the year under review, the Board conducted an 
evaluation to review performance and effectiveness 
of the Board, as a whole, the Board Committees,  
the Chairman, individual Directors and the 
independence of the Independent Non-executive 
Directors. The evaluation process was conducted 
internally by way of interviews and self-evaluation 
questionnaires. The results of the evaluation of the 
Board committees were considered by the relevant 
committee prior to their presentation, together with all 
other evaluations, for discussion at the Board meeting 
held in March 2017. 
An externally facilitated performance evaluation will be 
conducted next year and every three years thereafter.
BOARD
The Board self-evaluation questionnaire was based 
around the five main principles of the Code, namely: 
leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration 
and relations with shareholders. The Board identified 
no material areas for improvement, but confirmed 
the need to address the composition of the Board 
through the appointment of two further Non-executive 
Directors, which is currently receiving attention as 
indicated in the Nomination Committee Report on 
page 109. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The results of the self-evaluation of the Board 
committees, together with the Committees’ proposed 
recommendations, were discussed by the Board. Details 
of the results of the performance evaluation of the 
Board’s committees and actions planned for the next 
year are set out in the individual committee reports.
CHAIRMAN
Mr Desmond Smith, as the SID, met privately with the 
Non-executive Directors to appraise the performance 
of the Chairman, taking account of the views of the 
Executive Directors and subsequently discussed the 
results with the Chairman. A high-level summary of the 
evaluation of the Chairman was presented at the Board 
meeting held in March 2017. 
INDIVIDUAL DIRECTORS
The Chairman met with each Non-executive Director 
to discuss their contributions and performance, 
together with their training and development needs 
and presented his feedback to the Board. The Board 
concluded that the individual Directors have fulfilled 
their duties and provide a valuable contribution to the 
effective functioning of the Board.
INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
The Board considered the independence of the 
Independent Non-executive Directors, upon 
recommendation of the SID, taking into consideration 
all relevant relationships and circumstances. As 
disclosed earlier in this report, Dr Edwin Hertzog 
and Jannie Durand are not regarded as independent, 
owing, respectively, to their previous relationship 
with the Company and its principal shareholder. The 
Board considers all the other Non-executive Directors 
to be independent in character and judgement 
and free from any business or other relationship 
or circumstances that could potentially materially 
interfere with the exercise of their respective and 
collective independent judgement. 
COMPANY SECRETARY
As part of the annual evaluation of the Board, the 
Company Secretary was also evaluated. The Board is of 
the opinion that the Company Secretary is competent 
and has the requisite qualifications and experience to 
effectively execute its duties.

Conducting business in an honest, fair and legal manner 
is a fundamental guiding principle in Mediclinic, which 
is actively endorsed by the Board and management, 
ensuring that the highest ethical standards are 
maintained in all our dealings with stakeholders. 
The Group’s commitment to ethical standards is set 
out in the Group’s values, and is supported by the 
Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  
(the “Ethics Code”) which is available on the website at  
www.mediclinic.com. The Ethics Code provides a 
framework of the standards of business conduct 
and ethics that are required of all business divisions, 
directors and employees within the Group in order to 
promote and enforce ethical business practices and 
standards throughout the Group. The Ethics Code 
is available to all staff and communicated to new 
employees as part of the on-boarding process.
Compliance with relevant laws, regulations, accepted 
standards or codes is integral to the Group’s  
risk management process and is monitored in 
accordance with the terms of the Group’s Regulatory 
Compliance Policy.
SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The Board has considered the Company’s slavery and 
human trafficking statement for the year under review,

which is addressed in the Group’s Ethics Code and 
the Anti-bribery Policy. Refer to the Audit and Risk 
Committee Report on page 122 for an overview of the 
Group’s approach to fraud and corruption. 
COMPETITION LAWS
The Group supports and adheres to the relevant 
competition and anti-trust laws applicable in the 
various countries in which the Group operates. These 
laws are complex and the Group has issued guidelines 
to its employees on competition law compliance within 
their relevant jurisdiction, which are reviewed and 
updated at least annually.
The South African Competition Commission is 
undertaking a market inquiry into the private healthcare 
sector in South Africa. Mediclinic is participating in 
the inquiry, with the assistance of expert competition 
attorneys and advocates who guide Mediclinic through 
the process, as referred to in the Divisional Review of

INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY 
GOVERNANCE 
Mediclinic has an extensive information and 
communications technology (“ICT”) environment 
that acts as an enabler of its business strategies and 
operations. The core business information systems 
cover clinical processes, revenue cycle management 
and patient administration. The SAP ERP back-office 
systems support, inter alia, the finance, accounting, 
human resources management and procurement 
functions. An enterprise data warehouse enables 
advanced analytics activities as well as providing 
data for decision support. Lastly an extensive office 
automation environment exists which enables both  
on-premise and mobile working, as well as collaboration 
and communication within and across the Mediclinic 
business platforms. A global network enables data 
flows and communication between the Group’s 
operating platforms. Major ICT-related projects in 
the pipeline, which include various SAP projects, an 
electronic health record system and the introduction 
of a global HR system. 
ICT governance is done in context of the Group’s overall 
corporate governance and specifically the Group’s risk 
management structures and processes. Central to ICT 
governance is the Group’s ICT Steering Committee, 
various ICT architecture management committees at 
the operating platforms. The ICT Steering Committee is 
a sub-committee of Company’s Executive Committee 
and membership consists of the Group’s CIOs, various 
Group ICT architects and key functions such as Risk 
Management, Finance and the Enterprise Project 
Management Office. This committee focuses on 
collaboration, standardisation and synergies across the 
various ICT entities in the Group by way of:
• 
setting information security related policies and 
standards; 
• 
developing and reviewing ICT risk profiles; and 
• 
providing assurance regarding information and 
cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, as 
well as access control, change management and 
disaster recovery. 
The ICT Steering Committee is supported by the 
Group’s Information Security Architecture Committee, 
consisting of the Information Security Officers of the 
Group and the operating platforms. The proceedings 
of this committee are informed by information security 
best practices sourced from Gartner, ISACA, CoBIT 5, 
ITIL, ISO27001 and the South African King IV™ Report 
on Corporate Governance.
The Group’s risk management system is used to 
capture and track all ICT risks, audit findings, actions 
and responsibilities.
Mediclinic employs a wide range of technology 
capabilities to safeguard its ICT installation, its ICT 
users and connections to other external ICT systems to 
ensure business continuity. 
Information security policies and controls are in 
place throughout the Group regulating, inter alia, 
the processing, use and protection of own and  
third-party information. This is further entrenched 
through ongoing user training, security awareness 
programmes and certification courses in information 
security. Flows of personal data across country borders 
are dealt through formal arrangements in line with  
country-specific legislation. There were no material 
information security or data privacy incidents during 
the year under review.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
LETTER FROM THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
Dear Shareholder, 
Mediclinic became a FTSE-listed company as a result of the Combination with Al Noor Hospitals in February 2016. 
Leading up to the Combination, a new Directors’ Remuneration Policy was put to shareholders and approved in 
December 2015. The policy, based largely on the previous Al Noor policy, was designed to provide flexibility to 
meet the needs of the new entity. Having completed a full year working with this policy, we are now in a better 
position to draft a policy that is more specifically shaped to our needs. No substantial changes are required, since 
there is no proposed change to either the structures with which we remunerate our executives or their levels 
of pay. However, there are a number of more detailed provisions which we wish to amend, where the existing 
drafting does not reflect how we wish to implement the policy. The revised Remuneration Policy, contained within 
this report, will be subject to a binding vote by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 25 July 2017. Following 
approval, it would become formally effective from the date of the AGM.
I am also pleased to present the annual Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2017, which 
will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM. This sets out the remuneration decisions taken in the year and, in 
the remainder of this letter, I aim to set these decisions in the context of the Company’s performance this year. 
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD OVER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
Performance for the Executive Directors’ short-term incentive (“STI”) was calculated on a weighted average of 
the Company’s three operating platforms in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the Middle East. For each platform, 
underlying EBITDA is the primary measure, underpinned by clinical and patient quality conditions which can 
reduce the bonus earned. Hirslanden, our largest platform, performed strongly, exceeding the maximum target 
for financial performance combined with strong outcomes on patient satisfaction. Our business in Southern 
Africa also performed well, delivering EBITDA in line with expectations and fair performance on other measures. 
In the Middle East, performance was impacted significantly by a major regulatory change affecting the Abu Dhabi 
business as well as operational challenges in this business. The Company has been focused on resolving these 
issues and stabilising performance in the Middle East, and our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities 
of the region remains strong. Taking performance across all three platforms into account, the STI outcome  
for the reporting period for the Executive Directors was 55.93% of maximum, as described in more detail on 
pages 99 to 100.
During 2016, long-term incentive awards (“LTIP”) were granted to the Executive Directors, subject to total 
shareholder return and earnings per share performance conditions over three years. No long-term incentive 
awards vested during the year, since outstanding awards vested at the time of the Combination.
PROPOSED REMUNERATION POLICY 2017
As mentioned above, following a review of the existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration 
Committee have proposed a revised policy to better reflect the way in which the Company operates post-
Combination.
Changes have been made to the operation of the annual STI and the LTIP awards to specify how the share-based 
elements of these awards will operate where we cannot use shares. In order to continue to build long-term 
alignment of the Directors’ interests with shareholders, when we cash settle awards, there is a requirement to 
purchase shares with the net proceeds of the award and hold those shares until the individual has reached the 
share ownership guideline. In this way, we ensure the continued alignment even where we cash settle awards for 
technical reasons. Other changes include more specifically on clawback, malus and post-vesting holding periods.
We believe that the proposed approach for 2017 underpins our strategy and values as a Company, and will enable 
us to continue to operate effectively throughout our markets.
We trust that you will support both resolutions at the AGM on 25 July 2017.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

AR MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 86 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
INTRODUCTION 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company and has 
been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended). The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and takes account of the views of our major shareholders and proxy agencies, as 
expressed during previous engagement on remuneration matters. 
The Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 25 July 2017 and, subject 
to approval, the new policy will take formal effect from that date (replacing the previous policy approved by 
shareholders on 15 December 2015, which can be found on the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com 
contained in the 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements on pages 75 to 81). It is intended that the 
policy will be in force for a period of three years from the date of approval. 
PROPOSED CHANGES TO POLICY
ELEMENT OF PAY SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSED CHANGES
Annual short-term incentive 
(“STI”)
To reflect more clearly the current operation of the bonus deferral, its 
treatment has been formalised as follows:
• 
 Half of the bonus paid will be deferred in shares for two years, with  
vesting subject to continued employment.
• 
Deferred shares may be settled in cash.
To strengthen alignment with shareholder interests where an award is settled 
in cash and a Director has not yet met the share ownership guidelines, this 
cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company.
We have also included reference to the malus condition we have in operation.
Long-term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
We have not made any fundamental changes to the LTIP, but we have 
updated the policy to reflect more clearly the current operation. Similar to  
the deferred portion of the annual STI, awards will be made in shares, but may 
be cash settled. Executive Directors’ awards will be subject to a post-vesting 
holding period of two years.
To strengthen alignment with shareholder interests where an award is settled 
in cash and a Director has not yet met the share ownership guidelines, this 
cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company.
Increased flexibility is included in the selection of performance measures for 
the LTIP.
We have also included reference to the malus condition we have in operation.
Share ownership guidelines We have made no changes to the practice around share ownership guidelines, 
but these were previously not included in the policy table.
The rationale for change is to align the policy more specifically to the current operation of the STI and the LTIP. 
Further, the requirement to hold shares facilitates Executive Directors building a shareholding in the business and 
therefore aligns management with shareholders’ interests and the Group’s performance, without encouraging 
excessive risk taking.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 87 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
POLICY OVERVIEW
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the 
Board, for establishing appropriate remuneration 
arrangements for the Executive Directors and other 
senior management in the Group.
In setting the Remuneration Policy for the Executive 
Directors, the Committee will ensure that the structures 
are in the best interest of both the Group and its 
shareholders, by taking into account the following 
general principles: 
• 
To lead our chosen markets in medical quality by 
attracting, retaining and motivating the best person 
for each position, without paying more than is 
necessary.
• 
To ensure total remuneration packages are  
simple and fair in design so that they are valued  
by participants. 
• 
To ensure that the fixed element of remuneration is 
determined with reference to the location in which 
the executive operates and the broader international 
market, taking account of individual performance, 
responsibilities and experience; and that a significant 
proportion of the total remuneration package is 
linked to financial performance. 
• 
To balance performance pay between the 
achievement of financial performance objectives 
and delivering sustainable stock market  
out-performance; creating a clear line of  
sight between performance and reward and 
providing a focus on sustained improvements  
in profitability and returns. 
• 
To provide performance-related pay linked to share 
price and with a requirement to hold shares to 
facilitate senior management to build a shareholding 
in the business and therefore, aligning management 
with shareholders’ interests and the Group’s 
performance, without encouraging excessive risk 
taking. 
CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Company is committed to maintaining open 
and transparent dialogue with its shareholders.  
The Committee engages regularly in a process of 
investor consultation. 
The Committee considered shareholder feedback in 
relation to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the prior year at its first meeting following the annual 
general meeting. This feedback, as well as any additional 
feedback received during any other meetings with 
shareholders, was considered as part of the Company’s 
annual review of remuneration arrangements for the 
following year. Where appropriate, the Committee will 
actively engage with shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies, seeking views which may be 
considered when making any decisions about changes 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers the annual general meeting 
to be an opportunity to meet and communicate with 
shareholders, giving investors the opportunity to raise 
any issues or concerns they may have. In addition, the 
Committee will seek to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should 
any material changes be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 88 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

Notes
1
  The annual STI is focused predominantly on key financial performance indicators, to reflect how successful the Group is in managing 
its operations. The balance is determined based on Executive Directors’ performance against annual Group operational targets, 
including measures of clinical excellence.
  The Executive Directors’ STI is calculated on Group EBITDA performance and/or the combined financial EBITDA performance and 
other financial and strategic business targets of the three platforms, weighted relative to their respective EBITDA contribution. 
  The structure of the Executive Directors’ Pay Policy on annual STIs is generally in line with the policy for remuneration of management 
within the Group, although the levels of award will be different. The performance measures that apply to management are based on 
the respective platform EBITDA performance and platform-specific operational targets, including measures of clinical excellence. 
The annual STI awards for management are paid in cash with no deferral. 
2
 The LTIP rewards significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth. 
  Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Company. 
Modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance 
of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year or on the date of award, as the case may be. 
  The Committee operates long-term incentive (“LTI”) arrangements for the Executive Directors and key senior management in 
accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the rules of relevant tax authorities where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans. 
These include (but are not limited to) the following: 
• 
number of participants;
• 
timing of the grant and/or payment of award; 
• 
the size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or payment; MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 91 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
• 
discretion to reduce the number of awards vesting if certain performance underpins are not met;
• 
discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
• 
determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
• 
adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends);
• 
the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events to fulfil their original purpose; and
• 
 the relative weighting between TSR and EPS are determined annually by the Remuneration Committee – for the current 
reporting period EPS weight is 60% and TSR is 40%. This will remain the weighting for 2017/18.
  The structure of the Executive Directors Pay Policy on LTIPs is generally in line with the policy for remuneration of key senior 
management within the Group, although the levels of award will be different. The LTIP awards for key senior management are 
denominated in shares with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period. Awards 
may be settled in cash, with the cash payment taking account of the share price movement during the vesting period. There is no 
award deferral for key senior management. 
3
  At the discretion of the Committee, awards may be adjusted before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if 
an adjustment event occurs. Such circumstances may include: a serious misstatement of the Group’s audited financial results, a 
serious miscalculation of any relevant performance measure, a serious failure of risk management or regulatory compliance by  
a relevant entity, serious reputational damage to the Group, or the participant’s material misconduct.
  Management within the Group are also subject to malus and clawback provisions based on the adjustment events defined above. 
PREVIOUS AWARDS
The Company has authority to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors before 
they became a Director (such as the vesting or exercise of past share awards) or before this policy came into 
effect, including those granted by companies in the Group prior to that company becoming part of the Group. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 92 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS PAY 
AND EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
OF EMPLOYEES IN THE GROUP 
WHEN DETERMINING EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
POLICY
When considering Executive Directors’ base 
compensation, the Committee considers market 
related salary levels including bonuses of appropriate 
comparable companies. Further, the Committee 
reviews base compensation and STI arrangements 
for the management team, to ensure that there 
is a coherent approach across the Group. The STI 
arrangements operate on a similar basis across the 
management team. The key difference in the policy 
for Executive Directors is that remuneration is more 
heavily weighted towards long-term variable pay than 
other employees. This ensures that there is a clear link 
between the value created for shareholders and the 
remuneration received by the Executive Directors. 
The Committee does not formally consult with 
employees in respect of the design of the Executive 
Director Remuneration Policy, although the Committee 
will keep this under review. 
REMUNERATION SCENARIOS FOR 
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The total remuneration for each of the Executive 
Directors that could result from the Remuneration 
Policy in 2017/18 is shown below under three different 
performance levels – below threshold (when only fixed 
pay is receivable), on target and maximum. The chart 
highlights that the performance-related elements of 
the package comprise a significant portion of total 
remuneration at on-target and maximum performance. 
Remuneration is earned in pound sterling (GBP) and 
South African rand (ZAR). The ZAR portion of the 
remuneration package is translated into GBP at a rate 
of £1:ZAR18.41.
DIRECTORS’ RECRUITMENT AND 
PROMOTIONS
The policy on the recruitment or promotion of an 
Executive Director takes into account the need to 
attract, retain and motivate the best person for each 
position, while ensuring close alignment between the 
interests of shareholders and management:

2.  The value of taxable benefits is based on actual amounts as at 31 March 2017 of benefits and cash allowances. The figure is an 
annualised estimate for the CFO. 
3. The value of pension contribution is based on a company contribution of 9% of base salary.
4.  Minimum performance assumes no award is earned under the STI plan and no vesting is achieved under the LTIP; at on-target, 
60% of a maximum bonus is earned under the STI plan and 63% of the maximum award opportunity is achieved under the LTIP; 
and at maximum, full vesting under both plans.
5. Share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded from the above analysis.

package with the Remuneration Policy approved 
by shareholders.
• 
New Executive Directors will participate in the STI 
and LTIP subject to the same limits as set out in  
the policy.
• 
Depending on the timing of the appointment, 
the Committee may deem it appropriate to set 
different annual bonus performance conditions to 
that of the current Executive Directors for the first 
performance year of appointment.
• 
An LTIP award can be made following an 
appointment (assuming the Company is not in  
a closed period).
• 
Flexibility will be retained to set base 
compensation at the level necessary to facilitate 
the hiring of candidates of appropriate calibre in 
external markets and make awards or payments 
in respect of deferred remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In terms 
of remuneration to compensate for forfeited 
awards, the Committee would look to replicate 
the arrangements being forfeited as closely as 
possible and in doing so, would take account 
of relevant factors including the nature of the 
deferred remuneration, performance conditions 
and the time over which they would have vested 
or been paid. The face and / or expected values of 
the award(s) offered will not materially exceed the 
value ascribed to the award(s) foregone.
• 
For an internal appointment, any incentive amount 
awarded in respect of a prior role may be allowed 
to vest on its original terms, or be adjusted as 
relevant to take into account the appointment.  
Any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue.
• 
The Committee may agree that the Company will 
meet certain relocation and incidental expenses  
as appropriate. 
• 
For an overseas appointment, the Committee will 
have discretion to offer cost-effective benefits 
and pension provisions which reflect local market 
practice and relevant legislation.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or  
Non-executive Director, the fee arrangement will be set 
in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy 
at that time.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE 
AGREEMENTS AND PAYMENTS 
FOR LOSS OF OFFICE 
The Committee seeks to ensure that contractual 
terms of the Executive Directors’ service agreements 
reflect best practice. It is the Company’s policy that 
all Executive Directors have rolling contracts that can 
be terminated by the employee in line with his service 
agreement. Executive Directors service agreements are 
terminable on six months’ notice. Consistent with UK 
Corporate Governance Code all Directors are subject 
to re-election by shareholders at each AGM. 
In circumstances of termination on notice, the 
Committee will determine an equitable compensation 
package, having regard to the particular circumstances 
of the case. The Committee may require notice to be 
worked or to make payment in lieu of notice or to place 
the Director on garden leave for the notice period. 
Such a decision is made to protect the Company’s and 
shareholders’ interests.
In case of payment in lieu of notice or garden leave, 
the salary, benefits and pension will be paid for the 
period of notice served on garden leave or paid in 
lieu of notice. If the Committee believes it would be 
in shareholders’ interests, payments will be made in 
phased instalments. In the case of payment in lieu of 
notice, payments will be subject to be offset against 
earnings elsewhere.
An STI payment may be made in respect of the period 
of the incentive year worked by the Director. There 
is no provision for an amount in lieu of bonus to be 
payable for any part of the notice period not worked. 
The bonus payment will be scaled back pro rata for 
the period of the incentive year worked by the Director 
and would remain payable at the normal payment date. 
Awards held under the deferred STI and LTI 
arrangements are subject to the rules containing 
discretionary provisions setting out the treatment of 
awards where a participant leaves and is designated 
a “good leaver”. In these circumstances a participant’s 
awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment 
and instead will continue to vest on the normal vesting 
date or earlier at the discretion of the Committee, 
subject to the performance conditions attached to 
the relevant awards. The awards may be scaled back  
pro rata for the period of the vesting period worked by 
the Director.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 94 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
In addition to the above payments, the Committee may make any other payments determined by a court of 
law in respect of the termination of a Director’s contract or may pay any statutory entitlements or any sums 
to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the Committee, 
reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services) as necessary.
In the event of a change of control, all unvested awards under the deferred STI and LTI arrangements would vest, 
to the extent that any performance conditions attached to the relevant awards have been achieved. The awards 
will, where the Committee dictates, be scaled back pro rata for the period of the performance period worked by 
the Director. 
Executive Directors may, on nomination from Mediclinic International plc, take on outside appointments, however, 
all fees will be retained by the Company.
The dates of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are:
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DATE OF SERVICE CONTRACT
Danie Meintjes 1 April 2016 – joined Group 1 August 1981
Craig Tingle 1 April 2016 – joined Group 1 February 2006 and retired 15 June 2016
Jurgens Myburgh 1 August 2016
The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s registered 
office, and at the annual general meeting. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT
Non-executive Directors are appointed by letter of appointment for an initial period of three years, which are 
terminable by three months’ notice on either side. However, the Company complies with and will continue to 
comply with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and accordingly all Directors will stand for 
annual re-election by shareholders at future annual general meetings until the Board determines otherwise. 
In 2017 all Non-executive Directors, except for Dr Edwin Hertzog and Jannie Durand were considered to be 
independent of the Company. 
The terms of engagement are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s registered 
office, and at the annual general meeting.

PERFORMANCE AND PAY 
PERFORMANCE GRAPH AND CEO PAY
The graph below shows the value at 31 March 2017 of £100 invested in the Company on inception on 21 June 2013, 
compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index on the same date. The intervening points are the 
financial year ends prior to the date of the Combination on 15 February 2016, and the financial year ends since.
The FTSE 100 was used as a comparator as this is the Company’s primary comparator group. 
The table below shows the total remuneration for the CEO over the period since incorporation. Consistent with 
the calculation methodology for the single figure for total remuneration, the total remuneration figure includes 
the total annual bonus award based on that year’s performance and the LTIP award based on the three-year 
performance period ending in the relevant year.

1  The 2015/16 remuneration is for the period from the Combination on 15 February 2016 to 31 March 2016, as disclosed in the 
2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report (page 84).
2  Craig Tingle retired as a Director of the Company on 15 June 2016 and his remuneration for 2016/2017 covers the period from 
the start of the reporting period to his date of retirement.
3  Jurgens Myburgh was appointed as a Director on 1 August 2016 and his remuneration covers the period from employment 
date to the end of the reporting period.
4  Ian Tyler’s and Seamus Keating’s 2015/16 remuneration consists of payments for the period 1 January 2015 to  
31 March 2016, as disclosed in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report (page 84). The 2015/16 remuneration of  
Dr Edwin Hertzog, Desmond Smith, Trevor Petersen, Nandi Mandela, Prof Dr Robert Leu, Alan Grieve and Jannie Durand  
is for the period from the Combination on 15 February 2016 to 31 March 2016. They are paid in GBP. Ian Tyler resigned from 
the Board on 21 February 2017. Jannie Durand’s fees are paid to Remgro and include services rendered by Jannie Durand or 
his alternate Pieter Uys.
5  In June 2013, the Company (then Al Noor Hospitals Group plc) granted Ian Tyler 8 695 ordinary shares, which shares 
had an aggregate value of £50 000 calculated at a share price of £5.75 per share. To preserve his position after the 
Combination of Al Noor and Mediclinic, and the subsequent expected drop in share price, the Company increased the 
number of shares allocated to 12 090 in February 2016. On 5 June 2016, being the third anniversary of his appointment,  
the above award was settled through a payment of £106 029.30 in cash and settlement of the resulting tax liability of  
£94 026, both calculated using a share price of £8.77 per share. As a result of this payment, his interest under the share award 
has been satisfied. As the performance achievement of the shares was tested on the grant date only the related tax liability 
settled is disclosed as a benefit in this financial year. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 99 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE TOTAL 
FIGURE TABLE (AUDITED)
The sections below provide further detail of the remuneration shown in the table on page 98. 
SALARIES FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (AUDITED)
Base salaries are reviewed in April each year. The Committee considers the remuneration packages in the context 
of other London-listed companies of similar size and international footprint. Remuneration levels were set with 
reference to local South African pay levels and a broader international comparison, however, given the widening 
geographic footprint of the Group, the Committee placed greater weight on the international comparators. 
Danie Meintjes’ salary for the reporting period was £541 213, Craig Tingle’s salary of £78 725 covers the period 
from the start of the reporting period to his date of retirement on 15 June 2016. Jurgens Myburgh’s salary of  
£234 107 covers the period from 1 August 2016 to the end of the reporting period. All figures were converted to 
pound sterling at a rate of £1:ZAR18.41 at 31 March 2017. 
BENEFITS AND PENSION FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (AUDITED) 
The benefits of Danie Meintjes, Craig Tingle and Jurgens Myburgh include private medical insurance and 
reimbursements for reasonable business related expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation and subsistence) and in 
some instances the associated tax was borne by the Company.
The Executive Directors participated in the Mediclinic Southern Africa defined contribution fund and received 
a 9% company pension contribution, in line with the Remuneration Policy. The normal retirement age is 63 and 
there are no additional benefits payable if an Executive Director retires early. 
None of the Executive Directors have prospective rights to a defined benefit pension. 
Non-executive Directors were reimbursed for reasonable business-related expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation 
and subsistence) and in some instances the associated tax was borne by the Company. They receive no other 
benefits and do not participate in short-term or long-term reward schemes. 
ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (AUDITED) 
The bonuses of Mediclinic International plc management were determined by a weighted average of the platform 
bonuses achieved. 
Achieved bonuses are a combination of the main performance indicator (platform underlying EBITDA) and subset 
performance indicators. The Executive Directors’ STI is calculated on the combined financial EBITDA performance 
and other financial and strategic business targets of the three platforms, weighted relative to their respective EBITDA 
contribution. The threshold and maximum targets are based on a percentage of the respective platforms approved 
budgeted EBITDA. The financial EBITDA measures, targets and performance against them are set out below.

At grant, vesting of 60% of the award was based on EPS growth and the remaining 40% was determined by TSR, 
ranked relative to constituents of the FTSE 100 Index. 
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, in that 
they ensure the Executive Directors are incentivised and rewarded for the underlying financial performance of 
the Company as well as creating value for shareholders. The award is subject to clawback and malus provisions.
EPS growth is measured by taking the compound annual percentage growth in EPS over the performance period. 
TSR ranked relative to constituents of the FTSE 100 Index is measured by ranking and comparing the Company’s 
TSR to the relevant TSR targets. 
Awards are denominated in shares with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over 
a three-year period. Executive Directors will be required to hold vested awards for two years. After this time, the 
value will be calculated by alignment to share price movement, but settled in cash. Where a Director has not yet 
met the share ownership guidelines, this cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 102 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
PAYMENTS TO FORMER DIRECTORS (AUDITED)
No payments were made to former Directors during the reporting period.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (AUDITED)
Craig Tingle retired as CFO on 15 June 2016. He received normal pay and benefits up to this date and six months’ 
salary in lieu of notice. An amount of £179 357 in lieu of unworked contractual notice period was paid in phased 
instalments and was subject to mitigation until the expiry of the notice period. Payment of £40 513 in lieu of 
accrued but not taken holiday entitlement was also paid at termination.
In respect of the Awards made in 2014 and 2015, under the Mediclinic International Limited Forfeitable Share Plan 
(“FSP”), where performance has been tested, 47 516 vested awards will be released to Craig Tingle on the original 
vesting dates.
A payment of £54 281 in respect of the 2017 annual STI was made on the normal payment date. This payment 
was calculated on the same basis as for the other Executive Directors and pro rated for the employment period. 
Full payment details are on page 100. All figures translated into GBP are at an exchange rate of £1:ZAR18.41 at  
31 March 2017.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION LEVELS 
The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 
2017 compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for employees 
in South Africa in local currency. The Committee selected employees in South Africa, as these provide the most 
appropriate comparator as they are subject to the same inflationary conditions.

1  The CEO’s percentage change is calculated on the annualised 2016 salary, benefits and bonus as disclosed in last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. For the purpose of the CEO’s salary, the local salary was translated into GBP at a rate of 
£1:ZAR20.73 at 1 April 2016 and £1:ZAR17.82 at 1 April 2015.
2
  Annualised benefits as disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report compared with the current reporting  
period benefits. The current reporting period benefits include UK business expense reimbursements due to the Company’s 
LSE listing following the Combination, which was not provided in the prior year. The change in benefits amounts to an increase 
amount of £6 357.
3
  As disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, the annual bonus opportunity for the CEO increased from 133% to 
150%. The total South African employees’ percentage change is calculated based on the prior year achievement of 58% of the  
maximum bonus as disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report compared against an achievement of 38% of  
the maximum bonus in the current period.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON STAFF COSTS 
To place the Directors’ remuneration in context with the Group’s finance, the Committee used the below 
comparison. The table below shows the spend on staff costs for the reporting period compared to the spend on 
staff costs in the 12-month period to 31 December 2015, as disclosed in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report

size and international footprint. Remuneration levels were set with reference to local South African pay levels 
and a broader international comparison. Given the widening geographic footprint of the Group, the Committee 
placed greater weight on the international comparators.

3 Salary as at 1 August 2016. 
Between 70% and 80% of the total potential remuneration offered to Executive Directors is subject to meeting  
performance conditions. 
STI 2018
The Executive Directors have a maximum STI opportunity of 150% (CEO) and 133% (CFO) of annual salary. Of 
the achieved award 50% will be deferred in shares for two years. Deferred shares may be settled in cash, subject 
to continued employment. Where awards are cash-settled and a Director has not yet met the share ownership 
guidelines, this cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company. Dividends that accrue on the deferred 
shares during the vesting period may be paid in cash at the time of vesting.
The performance measure for the Executive Directors’ STI in 2017/18 will be calculated on the combined Group 
EBITDA performance. 
We do not publish details of the financial targets in advance since these are commercially confidential. We will 
publish achievement against these targets when we disclose bonus payments in the Annual Report, so that 
shareholders can evaluate performance against those targets. 
The award will be subject to malus and clawback provisions. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 105 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
LTIP AWARDS TO BE GRANTED IN 2017
The Committee intends to grant an LTIP conditional award to the Executive Directors in 2017 over shares with a 
value of 200% (CEO) and 150% (CFO) of salary. 
Vesting of 60% of the award will be based on EPS growth and the remaining 40% will be determined by TSR 
measured relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index over three years. Executive Directors will be required 
to hold vested awards for two years. After this time, the value will be calculated by alignment to share price 
movement, but settled in cash. Where a Director has not yet met the share ownership guidelines, this cash must 
be used to purchase shares in the Company. Dividends that accrue during the vesting and holding periods will be 
paid in cash to the extent that awards have vested.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, in that they 
ensure the Directors are incentivised and rewarded for the underlying financial performance of the Group and 
creating value for shareholders.

An “underpin” applies which allows the Committee to reduce or withhold vesting if the Committee is not satisfied 
with the underlying operational and economic performance of the Company. The “underpin” evaluation includes 
consideration of environmental, social and governance factors and financial performance.
The Committee will keep the performance measures under review and may change the performance condition 
for future awards if they are not considered to be aligned with the Company’s interests and strategic objectives. 
However, the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance about any proposed material change in 
performance measures.
The award will be subject to clawback and malus provisions.

KEY AREAS OF ACTIVITY
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
The Committee reviewed and is developing the 
succession planning for both the Executive Directors 
together with the talent pipeline reporting to the 
executive team. 
A detailed review of each platform’s talent pipeline 
strategy was undertaken. This was supported by a 
review of the talent pools towards Group and platform 
key positions. A leadership development strategy was 
discussed and a mandate given to proceed with inter-
group development initiatives. 
Each platform CEO is accountable for developing and 
recruiting a diverse workforce. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE 
COMPOSITION
The Committee considered the structure, size and 
composition of the Board. The outcome of the Board 
evaluation, which evaluated the performance of the 
Board in relation to the five main principles set out in  
the Code, helped to inform the Committee’s 
considerations. In particular, when the composition 
of the Board and its committees are deliberated, the 
Committee is also mindful of each Director’s knowledge, 
skills and experience, the independent judgement they 
bring to discussions and their other commitments. 
Following Ian Tyler’s resignation, the Committee 
considered the appointment of a Senior Independent 
Director (“SID”) and, as a result, Desmond Smith was 
appointed as the SID with effect from 21 February 2017. 
The Committee also carried out a review of the 
composition of all the Board committees. As a result 
of this review, Dr Edwin Hertzog was appointed as 
Chairman of the Committee; Prof Dr Robert Leu was 
appointed as a member of the Clinical Performance 
and Sustainability Committee; Seamus Keating 
was appointed as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee; and Alan Grieve was appointed as a 
member and Chairman of the Disclosure Committee. 
The Committee continued to consider the appointment 
of additional Independent Non-executive Directors 
to further strengthen the Board and its Committees 
with diverse expertise and to increase the female 
representation on the Board. The Committee is 
considering the appointment of two additional 
Independent Non-executive Directors, with the aim 
to conclude on the appointment of both positions by  
31 March 2018. 
The appointment of new Directors is an extensive and 
rigorous process. The Committee identified the key skills 
and experience required of the additional Non-executive 
Directors. An independent external recruitment 
consultancy firm, with no connection to the Company, 
has been appointed to assist with this process. 
COMMITTEE COMPOSITION COMMITTEE EXPERIENCE  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 110 NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
DIVERSITY
During the year , the Committee reviewed and updated its 
Board Diversity Policy. The Board believes that diversity 
is not limited to gender and that a diverse Board will 
include and make good use of differences in the skills, 
geographic location, industry experience, background, 
race, gender and other characteristics of the Directors. 
These factors will be considered in determining the 
optimum composition of the Board and when possible 
will be balanced appropriately. However, when recruiting 
new Directors, consideration will also be given to 
ensuring that the Board does not become so large as to 
be unwieldy and that all Board appointments are made 
on justifiable merit. The Committee will continue to take 
cognisance of relevant prescribed guidelines as well as 
the performance of peer companies in fulfilling their role 
with regards to diversity. 
The Board not only supports the principles of 
boardroom diversity in general, it also takes boardroom 
skills diversity seriously and actively considers this 
matter regularly at Board and Committee meetings.  
The Board believes that maintaining an appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge, e xperience and backgrounds 
is imperative and is related to it being able to perform  
its role effectively. 
The Board’s Diversity Policy contains four objectives 
to support the Board’s commitment to achieving 
diversity, as set out below:
• 
the Board will not impose quotas regarding 
diversity, although it will remain committed to 
achieving diversity in the composition of the Board 
and executive management; 
• 
the Committee will annually consider and make 
recommendations, if applicable, to the Board on 
its diversity objectives in respect of the Board and 
executive management;
• 
in reviewing the composition of the Board and 
executive management, the Committee will, in 
addition to considering the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Board, also consider the diversity of the Board; and
• 
in identifying suitable candidates for appointment 
to the Board, the Committee will assess candidates 
on merit against objective criteria and with due 
regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board.
The Board (on recommendation of the Committee) will 
report annually on any issues and challenges the Board 
is facing when considering the diverse composition 
of the Board and executive management. In addition, 
going forward, the Committee will report on progress 
made on achieving these objectives. 
COMMITTEE EVALUATION 
The Committee’s performance was internally evaluated 
by the members of the Committee by way of a  
self-evaluation questionnaire, which results were 
considered by the Committee and the Board. No 
significant issues that require improvement were 
identified and the Committee and the Board concluded 
that it operated effectively during the year. 
EVALUATION OF THE 
COMPOSITION, STRUCTURE AND 
FUNCTIONING OF THE BOARD
The evaluation of the Board was also carried out 
internally by way of a self-evaluation questionnaire. 
The questionnaire includes a focus on Board 
composition and expertise, the Board’s role in setting 
strategy, its understanding of risks facing the Group, 
succession planning, and the effectiveness of the 
Board committees. The Board regards the evaluation 
process as an important way to monitor the progress 
made over the years. Further detail on the Board 
effectiveness evaluation is included on page 81.
When considering the election or re-election of 
Directors, the Committee pays due regard to the 
outcome of the Board evaluation process and considers 
many factors including the individual Director’s 
knowledge, skill and experience, the independent 
judgement they bring to Board deliberations and their 
other commitments. 
At the Company’s annual general meeting to be held 
on 25 July 2017, Jurgens Myburgh, who was appointed 
as a Director from 1 August 2016, will stand for 
election as it is the first annual general meeting of the 
Company since his appointment. In accordance with 
the recommendation for FTSE 350 companies set out 
in the Code, all other Directors will stand for annual 
re-election at the meeting. The biographical details of 
the current Directors can be found on pages 70 to 71. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of the  
Non-executive Directors, which include their expected 
time commitment, are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. 
PRIORITIES FOR THE COMMITTEE 
IN 2017/18
For the coming financial year, the Committee will, 
among other matters, focus on the following:
• 
the continued development of succession plans 
and the talent pipeline; 
• 
the recruitment of additional Independent  
Non-executive Directors to the Board; and
• 
the development of the Company’s diversity 
strategy.

KEY AREAS OF ACTIVITY
The responsibilities and functions of the Committee 
are governed by a formal terms of reference, approved 
by the Board, which is subject to regular review, 
at least annually. As previously reported, the role 
of the Committee was expanded during the year 
to also include, apart from its clinical performance 
monitoring role, the monitoring of the Group’s 
sustainable development and to fulfil the statutory 
duties of a social and ethics committee in terms of the 
SA Companies Act in respect of certain of its South 
African subsidiaries. 
The Committee met twice during the year under review, 
where the main focus was on:
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
In relation to the Committee’s clinical performance 
functions, the Committee is responsible for promoting 
a culture of excellence in patient safety, quality of care 
and patient experience. During the year, the Committee 
focused, inter alia, on the following: 
• 
monitoring the clinical performance of the Group; 
• 
evaluating patient safety, infection prevention and 
control, and quality improvement performance; 
• 
evaluating compliance with the Company’s patient 
safety and quality clinical care standards, policies 
and procedure, and regulation and accreditation 
standards at the operating platforms; and
• 
reviewing and approving the annual Clinical 
Services Overview in the Annual Report and 
the Clinical Services Report available on the 
Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com.
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
In relation to the Committee’s sustainability functions, 
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the 
Group remains a good and responsible corporate 
citizen. During the year, the Committee focused, inter 
alia, on the following: 
• 
reviewing the Group’s policies with regard to the 
commitment, governance and reporting of the 
Group’s sustainable development performance, 
including the Group Sustainable Development 
Policy, Group Environmental Policy and Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics. These are available on 
the Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com; 
• 
monitoring the sustainable development 
performance of the Group, with specific regard to 
stakeholder engagement (which include the results

engagement survey), health and public safety, 
broad-based black economic empowerment 
in South Africa, labour relations and working

As referred to above, certain South African subsidiaries 
of the Company are required to appoint a social and 
ethics committee in terms of the SA Companies Act, 
unless such companies are subsidiaries of another 
company that has a social and ethics committee, and 
the social and ethics committee of that company will 
perform the functions required by this regulation on 
behalf of that subsidiary company. The Committee 
also performs the statutory functions required 
of a social and ethics committee in terms of the  
SA Companies Act.
ASSURANCE
The Committee considered the need for external 
assurance of the Group’s public reporting, particularly 
in relation to the Company’s sustainable development 
performance. The Committee is satisfied that the 
current level of combined assurance provides the 
necessary independent assurance over the quality 
and reliability of the information presented in relation 
to the Group’s clinical performance and sustainable 
development. The Committee will continue to  
monitor whether additional forms of assurance are 
required in future.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION 
The Committee’s performance was internally evaluated 
by the members of the Committee by way of a  
self-evaluation questionnaire, which results were 
considered by the Committee and the Board. Following 
feedback received from the self-evaluation, the Board 
agreed to increase the number of Committee meetings 
to at least three per annum, to allow for greater 
discussion on clinical performance matters. No other 
significant issues that require improvement were 
identified and the Committee and the Board concluded 
that it operated effectively during the year.

KEY AREAS OF ACTIVITY
INTEGRATION OF AL NOOR 
BUSINESS 
The combination of the Al Noor business with 
the Group’s Middle East platform, effective from  
February 2016, continued to be a key area of focus 
for the Committee during the year. This included 
reviewing the progress on the integration of Al Noor 
“The Committee continues to focus 
on the standardisation of the internal 
controls and risk management 
framework across the Group and  
the integration of Al Noor into the 
Group’s structures, registers,  
reporting and processes.” 
into the Group’s Middle Eastern platform’s financial 
reporting; governance, risk and compliance processes; 
aligning business practices and embedding policies 
and procedures across the platform. In addition, the 
Committee considered and reviewed the purchase 
price allocation related to the reverse acquisition, 
reviewed the financial performance of the platform 
relative to budget, and monitored the realisation of 
efficiencies and synergies from the combination of the 
two businesses.
At the time of the combination ANHG held a 75% 
interest in Al Madar Medical Centre Group (“MMC”) 
with the remaining 25% held by the founding CEO. 
Prior to the combination, the MMC network was 
being run as a stand-alone business. With effect from 
30 September 2016, MCME exercised the option to 
acquire the remaining 25% of the MMC Group and the 
MMC network came under the management and full 
control of MCME, which included aligning the RCM 
function of MMC with the rest of the business and, inter 
alia, centralising activities relating to insurance, coding, 
billing, submission and resubmission and engaging 
with Daman to identify corresponding billing details 
to facilitate the payment of claims and allocation  
of receipts. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 116 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
The Committee maintained a strong focus on the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting and its financial 
performance. 
The financial results for the Group and individual operating platforms were reviewed regularly, taking into 
consideration tax matters and the Company’s debt covenants. The Committee considered the Company’s tax 
disclosure obligations, including the country-by-country tax reporting, and recommended the adoption of  
a Group tax strategy for approval by the Board. 
Following the Al Noor Combination, the Committee reviewed and recommended an amendment to the dividend 
policy to target a pay-out ratio of between 25% and 30% of underlying earnings. The amendment was included 
in the annual financial results published in May 2016. The Company also implemented a dividend access scheme 
for its South African shareholders as approved by the shareholders. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND POLICIES 
As part of the process for monitoring the integrity of the financial information contained in the annual and interim 
reports, the Committee reviewed the significant judgements and significant accounting policies adopted by 
management and confirmed these were appropriate. The significant judgements identified by the management 
team, Committee and the external auditors are set out in the table below.
The Committee considered the following significant issues in relation to the Annual Report:

Key topics relating to financial reporting considered by the Committee during the year: MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 117 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
SIGNIFICANT  
ISSUES 
CONSIDERED STEPS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE 
Impairment 
assessments
The Committee reviewed the annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill 
recognised in the Middle East and Swiss units, the carrying amount of the indefinite 
useful life Swiss trade name and management’s assessment of provision for impairment 
of trade receivables. 
The decision to rebrand the Al Noor operations resulted in accelerated amortisation 
of the Al Noor trade name. The Committee reviewed and assessed the impairment 
calculations of the Al Noor cash generating unit. 
The Committee considered the reasonableness of the cash flow projections which were 
based on the most recent budgets reviewed by the Board and assessed management’s 
expectations of revenue growth, operating costs and margins based on past experience 
and knowledge of the industry. The Committee also reviewed and challenged the key 
assumptions made in deriving these projections: growth rates, and expected changes  
in tariffs, admissions, patient mix and insurance mix. Long-term growth rates for periods 
not covered by the annual budgets were challenged to ensure they were appropriate  
in the countries relevant to the relevant operating platforms. 
The Committee was satisfied that the discount rate assumptions appropriately reflected 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with 
the particular assets. The other key assumptions were all considered to be reasonable.
The Committee also considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the key 
assumptions and sensitivities described above. Refer to note 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements for more details of these assumptions.
The Committee was satisfied that management’s assessment of the impairment 
provision for trade receivables were thorough, adequate and reasonable. The 
Committee also reviewed and was satisfied with the year-end provision for and 
disclosure of impairment of receivables.
The external auditors explained the results of their own review of the estimate of value 
in use, including their challenge of management’s underlying cash flow projections,  
the long-term growth assumptions and discount rates.
Based on their challenge of the key assumptions and associated sensitivities, the 
Committee concurred with management’s conclusion that no impairments  
were required.
Notional 
purchase price 
allocation and 
impairment 
test of a 29.9% 
associate interest 
in Spire
The Committee reviewed and was satisfied with a notional purchase price allocation 
performed by an independent firm.
The Committee was presented with management’s considerations, reports from 
the independent firm, as well as feedback from the external auditors on procedures 
performed. 
The Committee was satisfied that a rigorous process was followed in identifying 
the significant intangible asset and that this asset was reasonably valued and the 
appropriate judgment was used.
The Committee considered the carrying value of the Group’s investment in associate 
at 31 March 2017 to be appropriate and supportable by considering the results of 
impairment tests.
Viability 
assessment
The Committee reviewed the stress testing of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties undertaken by management to support the viability statement. It agreed 
with management’s recommendation to the lengthening of the initial three-year period 
to a five-year period. A five-year period is considered more appropriate for assessing 
the Group’s long-term viability, as it is consistent with the time frame adopted for the 
Group’s strategy and the assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties. Based on 
careful analysis of all relevant matters, the Committee concluded that the Board could 
reasonably expect the Group to continue to be in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due, over the course of the five-year assessment period. The Committee 
recommended to the Board the viability statement set out on pages 35 to 36. 
AR
AR MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 118 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE REPORTING
The Committee considered whether the assessments 
of the Company’s position and prospects, as published 
in the annual, interim and other price-sensitive reports, 
were fair, balanced and understandable and provided 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee reviewed the interim and annual 
financial statements in conjunction with the narrative 
sections of the reports to ensure that reported 
information was consistent, and that appropriate 
weight had been given to both positive and negative 
aspects of business performance.
The Committee is satisfied that one of the key 
requirements of the Group’s financial statements, 
for the Annual Report to be fair, balanced and 
understandable has been met, having reviewed a 
summary of the approach taken by management in the 
preparation of the report. Accordingly, the Committee 
recommended that the Board confirm that the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
FRC CONDUCT COMMITTEE
The FRC Conduct Committee is authorised and 
appointed under the UK Companies Act to be 
responsible for reviewing and investigating the annual 
accounts, directors’ reports and strategic reports of 
public listed companies in the UK. The FRC Conduct 
Committee undertook a review of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2016. The outcome of their review was 
that there were no questions or queries to be raised 
with the Company. The FRC’s review was based on 
the report itself and not detailed knowledge of the 
Company or transactions it had entered into.

The Board is ultimately responsible for overseeing the 
establishment of effective internal control systems 
and risk management processes, which facilitate the 
delivery of and sustain the Group’s financial, operational 
and strategic objectives. The Committee maintained a 
strong focus on monitoring, evaluating and enhancing 
the internal control, risk management and internal audit 
processes for the Group and the integration of Al Noor 
into these processes. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 119 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
The Board believes that effective risk management 
underpins a successful business and is integral to 
the objective of adding value to the Group. It has 
adopted an integrated and effective Enterprise-
wide Risk Management (“ERM”) framework, at 
both an operational and strategic level. An optimal  
risk/reward profile is achieved by identifying, 
quantifying and managing risks. This was incorporated 
into the daily operational management processes, 
allowing management to focus on core activities. The 
Board has a clear process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks, which includes current and 
emerging risks, faced by the Group for the reporting 
period. The Board annually reviews the process, which 
is in accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting and the requirements of the Code.
The Group’s ERM policy is benchmarked against the 
International Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
of the Treadway Commission framework, which 
defines the risk management objectives, methodology, 
process and the responsibilities of the Group’s various 
risk management role-players. This policy provides 
structure within which Directors and management 
can operate to reinforce a strong risk management 
culture throughout the Group. It sets the tone and acts 
as a starting point for all other components of risk 
management and control in providing the necessary 
discipline and structure.
The Committee reviewed the ERM framework, including 
the Group’s risk appetite and assurance model and 
policies. The Committee continued to progress the 
standardisation of the internal controls and risk 
framework across the Group and the integration of Al 
Noor into the Company’s ERM function, processes, risk 
registers and reporting.
Information and Communication Technology (“ICT”) 
risks remain a key area of focus for the Committee. 
The top five risks identified were cybersecurity; project 
delivery, application control and change, architecture 
and scarcity of ICT skills. The Committee receives 
regular presentations from senior management on 
these risks and their management and mitigation. 
The Group’s hedging arrangements in respect of 
currency movements were also examined, resulting in 
the Committee reviewing and updating the Group’s 
treasury policy. 
The Committee considered the applicability and 
implications for the Group regarding the new General 
Data Protection Regulation effective May 2018 and a 
proposed action plan.
Further details on the Company’s internal controls 
system and risk monitoring can be found on pages 30 
to 36. 
Whilst the overall conclusion was that the control 
environment is effective in ensuring the consistent 
achievement of key control objectives, the following 
AR
aspects were specifically highlighted as focus areas by 
management:
• 
the ongoing centralisation and standardisation of 
the internal controls in the Hirslanden platform; 
• 
the Al Noor integration in the Middle East platform 
and conforming the legacy Al Noor control 
processes and operational practices to the  
Group’s standards; 
• 
the implementation of SAP and supporting policies 
and procedures;
• 
The implementation of a standardised financial 
consolidation and reporting tool; and
• 
the enhancement of the assurance  
processes for the Group, including ICT  
governance and compliance.
The Committee’s work on the Company’s financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management 
systems underpins the long-term viability statement 
published by the Company in this Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Key topics relating to internal audit considered by the 
Committee during the year:
April 2016:
• 
Establishment of an in-house internal audit function
May 2016:
• 
Internal audit report for 2015/16 financial year
November 2016:
• 
Establishment of an in-house internal audit function 
• 
Internal audit report and internal audit plan
March 2017:
• 
Review of internal audit report, internal audit mandate 
and internal audit function
The Company’s internal audit function is carried out 
by Remgro Internal Audit, who regularly attended 
Committee meetings and reported on the findings 
of its investigations. It was responsible for measuring 
the effectiveness of the system of internal financial 
control throughout the Group. The establishment of 
an in-house internal audit function to transition away 
from the current outsourcing strategy will commence 
with the planned appointment of a Chief Internal Audit 
Executive during the 2017/18 financial year. 
The Committee reviewed the internal audit reports 
and approved the internal audit plan and fees. The 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the internal 
audit function by having discussions with Remgro 
Internal Audit and key members of management, 
and is satisfied with the effectiveness and efficiency 
of the function, reliability of financial reporting, and 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 120 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
Remgro Internal Audit’s Quality Assurance and 
Improvement Process was reviewed during the current 
year by a Big Four Independent Audit Firm and  
found to be Generally Compliant with the  
International Standards for the Professional Practice  
of Internal Auditing. 
The approved internal audit plan, which comprises 
a three-year review cycle following a risk-based 
approach and, where appropriate, integration with 
other combined assurance providers, focussed on  
the revenue and receivables cycle during the  
reporting period.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
INDEPENDENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee is committed to ensuring that the 
Group receives a high-quality and effective statutory 
audit. It is responsible for monitoring the performance, 
objectivity and independence of the external auditors 
and undertakes a formal evaluation process annually. 
This process involves an examination of four main 
performance criteria, namely: robustness of the audit 
process, quality of delivery, quality of reporting, and 
quality of people and service.
On completion of the audit, all members of the 
Committee, as well as key members of the senior 
management team and those who regularly provide 
input to the Committee or have regular contact with 
the external auditors, were required to complete a 
questionnaire seeking their views. The feedback from 
the questionnaire was collated and discussed by 
the Committee at the meeting held on 22 May 2017, 
together with opportunities for improvement. Overall, 
responses to the questionnaire were very positive, 
indicating an effective external audit process.
The external auditors receive copies of all relevant 
Committee papers and minutes of all Committee 
meetings. As part of the Committee’s assessment of 
the external auditors, separate meetings were held 
between the Non-executive Directors and the external 
auditors, without management present.
The independence of the external auditors is further 
enhanced by the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors, 
requiring PwC to inform the Company about any 
significant facts and matters that may reasonably 
be thought to bear on its independence or on the 
objectivity of the lead partner and the audit team. The 
lead partner must change every five years and the 
quality review partner, who reviews the judgements of 
the audit team, rotates every seven years. The auditor’s 
independence is further safeguarded by the non-audit 
services policy discussed below. 
EXTERNAL AUDIT PLAN
During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved 
the 2016/17 external audit plan, including the proposed 
materiality threshold, the scope of the audit, the 
significant audit risks and fees. 
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Committee believes that it may be appropriate 
in certain circumstances for the Company to engage 
its external auditors to provide non-audit services.  
A policy governing the provision of such services is in 
place to ensure the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors is not compromised. During the 
year, the Committee considered the implementation 
of the European Union Audit Directive and Regulation 
in conjunction with the FRC’s Ethical Standard for 
Auditors, effective for the Company from 1 April 2017, 
in respect of prohibitions, as well as the new provisions 
set out in the 2016 version of the Code in relation to 
non-audit services, and updated the Group’s non-audit 
services policy accordingly.
Key topics relating to the external audit considered by  
the Committee during the year:
April 2016:
• 
External audit plan reviewed and agreed
• 
External auditors’ fees reviewed and agreed
• 
Non-audit services expenditure for the 2016/17

Pre year-end update report from external auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), the external 
auditors of Mediclinic International Limited prior to the 
Al Noor Combination, was appointed as the external 
auditors of the Company in December 2015. The lead 
audit engagement partner from PwC is Giles Hannam 
who was also appointed in 2016. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 121 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
As a consequence, from 1 April 2017, the Company is 
no longer making use of PwC’s tax services. Deloitte 
LLP has been appointed to provide tax advice for the 
Company and its Southern African operations, and 
KPMG has been appointed to provide tax advice for 
the Company’s Swiss and Middle Eastern operations.
The Committee determines the pre-approved 
monetary thresholds for each category of non-audit 
services at the beginning of each financial year. 
The nature of the non-audit services, the individual 
fee levels of each category and the aggregate fee 
amount relative to the external audit fee are taken 
into account in determining these thresholds. From  
1 April 2017, any individual assignment with a fee 
exceeding £50 000 requires the Committee’s prior 
approval.
To help maintain independence and objectivity, 
the policy requires that an independent partner is 
appointed to lead any non-audit services.
FEES
Refer to note 22 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 198 for detail on the remuneration 
of the auditor for both audit and non-audit services 
undertaken during the year.
RE-APPOINTMENT 
The Committee concluded that the services provided 
by the external auditors were high quality and that 
the external audit process in respect of the 2017 
Financial Statements was effective and that the auditor 
remains objective and independent. Accordingly, it 
recommended to the Board that the re-appointment 
of PwC as the Company’s external auditors is proposed 
to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
AUDIT TENDER
As a result of the UK’s implementation of the European 
Union’s mandatory firm rotation requirements, and in 
accordance with the Committee’s terms of reference, 
the Company is required to ensure that the external 
auditors’ contract is put out to tender at least every  
10 years, with the proviso that no single firm may serve as 
the Company’s external auditors for a period exceeding  
20 years. PwC was appointed as the Company’s 
auditors in December 2015. It is intended that the 
external audit will be put out to tender no later than for 
the financial year commencing 1 April 2023, which is  
10 years after the Company’s initial listing.

SERVICES ORDER 2014 (“CMA ORDER”) 
As disclosed on page 121, the Company complied with 
the mandatory audit processes and the Committee 
complied with the responsibility provisions set out 
in terms of the CMA Order relating to (a) putting 
the audit services engagement on tender every  
10 years; and (b) strengthening the accountability of the 
external auditors to the Committee, including requiring 
that only the Committee is permitted to agree to the 
external auditors’ fees and scope of services; influence 
the appointment of the audit engagement partner; 
make recommendations regarding the appointment 
of auditors; and authorise the auditors to carry out  
non-audit services. 
FRC AUDIT QUALITY REVIEW
The Committee considered the findings from the 
review, undertaken by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review 
(“AQR”) team, of PwC‘s audit of the Group’s financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, which 
had been selected by the AQR team as part of their 
2016 annual inspection of audit firms. The focus of 
the review was to identify areas where improvements 
were required, rather than highlighting areas where 
work was performed at or above the expected level. 
The Committee considered the findings and discussed 
these with PwC. The Committee noted that no 
significant areas for improvement were identified by 
the FRC and that it is satisfied that there is nothing in 
the FRC findings which might have a bearing on PwC’s 
re-appointment.

governs the receipt of any invitations, gifts or donations 
from suppliers or any other party . Directors and employees 
throughout the Group are compelled to declare these to 
management for approval. Staff members involved in the 
contracting, negotiating and purchasing of equipment or 
consumables are also bound to strict ethical principles, 
ensuring that an impeccable standard of integrity is 
maintained in the Group’s business relationships. During 
the year, the Committee also adopted a Fraud Risk 
Management Policy, which facilitates the development of 
controls which will assist in the prevention of fraud and 
corruption.
The Committee reviewed reports of all material  
cases reported to the Group’s whistle-blowing line 
resulting investigations. 
The Committee is responsible for ensuring Group-
wide standards are set for achieving compliance 
with relevant laws and regulations. During the year, 
a compliance consultant was appointed to assist the 
Group with implementing a standardised risk-based 
compliance monitoring process across all business 
units in the Group.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION 
The Committee’s performance was internally evaluated 
by the Board, following discussion of the results of 
a self-evaluation questionnaire completed by the 
Committee members. The questionnaire focussed 
on the Committee’s role, composition and expertise 
and the effectiveness of Committee meetings. The 
outcomes of the survey were subsequently considered 
and reviewed by the Committee and certain actions 
were agreed for implementation, aimed at enhancing 
the overall effectiveness of the Committee. The results 
of the Committee’s performance evaluation were 
reported to the Board at the March 2017 meeting. 
Progress on the agreed actions and their outcomes will 
be monitored by the Committee and incorporated into

stakeholder can report any wrongdoing in the Group 
confidentially and anonymously via the ethics lines. All 
complaints are investigated in accordance with the code.
The Group adopts a zero-tolerance policy regarding

Remgro Limited, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, 
(“Remgro” or the “Remgro Group”, as the context 
may indicate) holds 44.56% of the issued ordinary 
shares of the Company and is therefore regarded 
as a controlling shareholder of the Company, for 
the purposes of the Listing Rules. The Listing Rules 
require that Independent Non-executive Directors of 
a company with a controlling shareholder must be 
elected by a majority of votes cast by independent 
shareholders, in addition to a majority of votes cast 
by all shareholders in such company. The resolutions 
proposed at the Company’s AGM to be held on  
25 July 2017 for the election of the Independent  
Non-executive Directors of the Company will therefore 
be taken on a poll and the votes cast by independent 
shareholders and all shareholders will be calculated 
separately. Such resolutions will be passed only if a 
majority of votes cast by independent shareholders are 
in favour thereof, in addition to a majority of votes cast 
by all shareholders being in favour thereof. 
POWERS OF DIRECTORS
The general powers of the Directors are contained 
within relevant UK legislation and the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Directors are entitled to 
exercise all powers of the Company, subject to any 
limitations imposed by the Articles of Association or 
applicable legislation. 
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 
The Directors’ shareholding and share interests in the 
issued shares of the Company are provided in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 103. 
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS 
The Company has entered into a deed of indemnity 
with each Director who served during the year under 
identical terms. The deeds indemnify the Directors 
in accordance with the applicable laws of England 
against liability incurred as a Director or employee of 
the Company or of associated entities in the Group. 
In addition, the Company has put into place directors’ 
and officers’ indemnity insurance.

COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF 
OFFICE 
There are no agreements in place with any Director or 
employee that provide for compensation for loss of 
office or employment resulting from a takeover, except 
that provisions of the Company’s share plans may cause 
options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
on a takeover. Further information on Directors’ service 
contracts and their notice periods can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 94. 
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Company’s Articles of Association may be 
amended by way of a special resolution of the 
members. At the AGM held on 20 July 2016, 
shareholders approved certain amendments to the 
Company’s Articles of Association by way of a special 
resolution, available in the Governance section of the 
Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com. 
The Board proposes further amendments to the 
Company’s Articles of Association, details of which are 
included in the notice of the annual general meeting to 
be held on 25 July 2017, in order to update the dividend 
payment provisions to reflect guidance published 
by the ICSA Registrars’ Group in March 2014. These 
amendments give the Company greater flexibility to 
use the most relevant payment mechanisms for the 
distribution of dividends, including electronic methods.

ACQUISITION OF OWN SHARES 
At the Company’s AGM on 20 July 2016, it was resolved 
that the Company was authorised to purchase the  
10 subscriber shares of 10 pence per share in the 
capital of the Company from Astro II SPV at a price of 
10 pence per share, which repurchase was concluded in  
April 2017.
The Company has no intention to complete a market 
purchase of its ordinary shares and will not seek this 
authority at the Company’s next AGM on 25 July 2017.
RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER 
OF COMPANY SHARES 
In 2005, Mediclinic International (RF) Proprietary  
Limited (previously Mediclinic International Limited) 
(“Mediclinic SA”) implemented a black ownership 
initiative with MP1 Investment Holdings Proprietary 
Limited (previously Circle Capital Ventures Proprietary 
Limited) (“MP1”) and Phodiso Holdings Limited 
(“Phodiso”) (collectively, the “Strategic Black Partners”).
In September 2016, the Company entered into 
arrangements with the Strategic Black Partners to 
formalise the basis on which the Strategic Black 
Partners hold their shares in the Company. These 
are in the same form in all material aspects as the 
arrangements in existence prior to the Combination of 
Mediclinic SA with Al Noor Hospitals Group plc. The 
Company now receives the direct benefit of the lock-in 
arrangements described below.
The arrangements that originally applied to the 
holdings of the Strategic Black Partners in relation to 
their shares in Mediclinic SA before completion of the 
Combination continue to apply to their holdings of 
shares in the Company such that:
• 
in the case of the 24 582 960 shares held by 
Phodiso through its subsidiary Mpilo Investment 
Holdings 2 (RF) Proprietary Limited (“Mpilo 2”), 
representing approximately 3.33% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, disposals of such shares are 
restricted until 31 December 2018; and
• 
in the case of the 10 958 206 shares held by 
MP1 through its subsidiary Mpilo 1 Newco (RF) 
Proprietary Limited (“Mpilo 1”), representing 
approximately 1.49% of the Company’s issued share 
capital, disposals of such shares are restricted until 
31 December 2019.
The arrangements also contain pre-emptive rights in 
favour of the Company which provide that, if any of the 
shares in the Company held by Mpilo 1 or Mpilo 2 are 
to be offered for sale, the Company will be offered the 
opportunity to purchase such shares or to nominate 
another person to purchase such shares, in each 
case, at a discounted price of, in relation to the Mpilo 
1 shares, approximately 5% to the then market value 
and, in relation to the Mpilo 2 shares, approximately 
10%. Any exercise of a right to purchase such shares 
by the Company itself would require the approval of 
its shareholders. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 125 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that, unless the Directors determine otherwise, a shareholder 
shall not be entitled to vote, either personally or by proxy, at any general meeting or to exercise any other right 
conferred by membership if:
• 
any call or other sum payable to the Company in respect of that share remains unpaid; or
• 
such shareholder, having been duly served with a notice to provide the Company with information under 
section 793 of the UK Companies Act, has failed to do so within 14 days of such notice, for so long as the 
default continues.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS
As at year end and as at 23 May 2017, being the Last Practicable Date, the shareholders included in Figure 1 
notified the Company, in accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, of their interest of 3% or 
more in the Company’s issued share capital.

PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER AND 
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT 
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4(14), the 
Company has set out below a statement describing 
the relationship agreement entered into between the 
Company and its principal shareholder, Remgro, on 
14 October 2015 (the “Relationship Agreement”), 
which came into effect on 15 February 2016. As at  
23 May 2017, the Remgro Group held 44.56% of the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Under the Relationship Agreement, Remgro undertakes 
to comply with the following independence provisions, 
as required under the Listing Rules: 
• 
transactions and arrangements between the 
Company and Remgro (and/or its associates) 
are, and will be, at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms; 
• 
neither Remgro nor any of its associates will take 
any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the Company from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules; and
• 
neither Remgro nor any of its associates will  
propose, or procure the proposal of, a shareholder 
resolution that is intended or appears to be  
intended to circumvent the proper application  
of the Listing Rules.
The Company has complied with the above 
independence provisions and, in so far as it is aware, 
Remgro complied with the independence provisions and 
the procurement obligation set out in the Relationship 
Agreement from the effective date of the agreement. 
In accordance with the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, for every 10% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company (or an interest which carries 10% 
or more of the aggregate voting rights in the Company 
from time to time) held, Remgro is entitled to appoint 
one Director to the Board, up to a maximum of three 
Directors, provided that the right to appoint a third 
Director is subject to the requirement that the Board 
will, following such appointment, comprise a majority of 
Independent Non-executive Directors.
If Remgro’s shareholding reduces to below 10% of the 
Company’s share capital (or 10% of the aggregate voting 
rights in the Company), the rights and obligations of 
Remgro in terms of the Relationship Agreement shall 
terminate. The ordinary shares owned by Remgro rank 
pari passu with the other ordinary shares in all respects. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 126 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The following agreements are considered significant in 
terms of their potential impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole, and that could alter or terminate on 
the change of control of the Company: 
• 
The Relationship Agreement entered into between 
the Company and its principal shareholder, 
Remgro, as referred to earlier. This agreement does 
not include a change of control provision, but does 
terminate if (i) the Company’s ordinary shares 
cease to be listed and admitted to trading on the 
LSE’s main market for listed securities; or (ii) the 
Remgro Group, taken together, ceases to hold the 
minimum interest of 10% in the Company. 
• 
The various facilities and finance agreements of 
the Group are regarded as significant and contain 
change of control provisions. On 28 June 2016, 
the Company announced the completion of the 
refinancing. The new facilities are:
 –  South African senior bank loan totalling  
ZAR1.2bn at an interest rate of JIBAR +1.69% with 
a three-year term expiring in June 2019;
 –  South African unsecured preference share 
funding totalling ZAR1.5bn at a rate of 73% of 
the prime overdraft interest rate, with a four-year 
term expiring in June 2020; and
 –  United Arab Emirates bank loans of  
US$54.5m and US$100.0m at an interest rate  
of LIBOR +2.75% with respective four-year  
and five-year amortising terms, expiring in  
June 2020 and May 2021, respectively.
POLITICAL PAYMENTS 
Political donations are prohibited in terms of the 
Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
and Anti-bribery Policy, unless pre-approved by the 
Executive Committee of the operating platform and 
reported to the Company’s Executive Committee.  
It is therefore not the policy of the Company to make 
donations to the European Union or any other political 
organisations, or to incur other political expenditure 
and the Directors have no intention of changing this 
policy. However, as a result of broad definitions used 
in the UK Companies Act, normal business activities 
of the Company, which might not be considered 
political donations or expenditure in the normal sense, 
may possibly be construed as political expenditure 
or as a donation to a political party or other political 
organisation and fall within the restrictions of the UK 
Companies Act. Sponsorship, subscriptions, payment 
of expenses, paid leave for employees fulfilling public 
duties, and support for bodies representing the 
business community in policy review or reform, may 
fall within the scope of these matters. The Board 
has therefore decided to propose a resolution, as in 
the previous year and in line with best practice, to 
authorise the Company to make political payments up 
to an aggregate amount of £100 000 for shareholder 
consideration at the Company’s AGM to be held on  
25 July 2017.
During the year, the Company, including its subsidiaries, 
made no political payments as contemplated in the 
UK Companies Act. Hirslanden has, however, made 
payments to a number of political parties, institutions 
and associations in Switzerland which totalled  
CHF8 000 (2016: CHF36 000). Contributing to political 
campaigns through third-party contributions is an 
official and standard practice in Switzerland.
EMPLOYEES
The Group’s employees are a valuable asset. The 
employees’ trust and respect are vital to Mediclinic’s 
success. Listening and responding to employee needs 
through effective communication and sound relations 
are important components in being regarded as an 
employer of choice among existing and prospective 
employees, and vital to maintain an engaged, loyal 
workforce. Employee engagement is conducted 
through various methods, including leadership video 
conferences, intranet, periodic employee surveys, 
performance reviews, staff magazines, and staff 
wellness and recognition programmes. Further details 
on the Group’s employee engagement is included in 
the Sustainable Development Report, available on the 
Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com. 
Continuous training and development of the Group’s 
employees across all three operating platforms 
ensures retention of staff, particularly in areas 
where the skills shortage is most critical, and proper 
succession planning. Further details on the Group’s 
training initiatives can be found in the Sustainable 
Development Highlights on page 61 and the 
Sustainable Development Report, available on the 
Company’s website at www.mediclinic.com. 
The distribution of the Group’s employees per 
operating platform is included on page 6, with only 
one employee (Head of Investor Relations) based in 
the UK. A breakdown by gender, age and, in respect 
of Southern Africa only, race in Board and senior 
management roles as at year end is illustrated in  
Figure 2. The proportion of female employees in the 
Group at year end is illustrated in Figure 3.
The Group values diversity and provides equal 
opportunities for its workplace and does not tolerate 
any form of unfair discrimination, such as access to 
employment, career development, training or working 
conditions, based on gender, religion, nationality, race, 
language, HIV/AIDS status, sexual orientation or other 
form of differentiation. Adequate procedures are in 
place to enable disabled applicants to receive training 
to perform safely and effectively and to provide 
development opportunities to ensure they reach their 
full potential. Where an individual becomes disabled 
during the course of employment, Mediclinic will seek 
to provide, wherever possible, continued employment 
on normal terms and conditions. Adjustments will 
be made to the environment and duties or suitable 
new roles within the Company will be secured with 
additional training where necessary.

AR MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 129 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, including the financial statements, in 
accordance with applicable law and regulation.
The UK Companies Act requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
The Directors prepared the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted 
by the European Union. The Directors should only 
approve the financial statements if they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group and Company for the reporting period. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
• 
state whether applicable IFRS have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going-
concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to  
presume that the Group and Company will  
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group’s and Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the 
financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the UK Companies Act and, in respect of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
AR
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the financial and associated corporate 
information published on the Company’s website 
at www.mediclinic.com. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 70 to 71 of the Annual Report, confirm 
that to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the Group and Company financial statements, 
which were prepared in accordance with IFRS,  
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group; and
• 
the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and the Company, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements, as set 
out on pages 143 to 217 and approved by the Board 
on 23 May 2017, were prepared on a going-concern 
basis. The Directors believe that the Group and the  
Company will continue to be in operation in the 
foreseeable future.

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT AND OUR AREAS OF FOCUS
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs  
(UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example 
in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events 
that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud. Procedures designed to address these risks included testing of material 
journal entries and post-close adjustments, testing and evaluation of management’s key accounting estimates 
for reasonableness and consistency and undertaking cut-off procedures to verify proper cut-off of revenue and 
expenses. In addition, we incorporate an element of unpredictability into our audit work each year. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our 
resources and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our 
audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole and 
any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 133 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
1.  Finalisation of the purchase price allocation of 
the reverse acquisition of Al Noor
  (refer to Audit and Risk Committee Report  
on page 116 and notes 4 and 29 in the Group  
Financial Statements)
On 15 February 2016, Mediclinic completed 
the reverse acquisition of Al Noor for a total 
consideration of £1 359m.
The purchase price allocation for the  
acquisition was considered to be provisional at  
31 March 2016 and was disclosed as such in 
the 2016 financial statements. At that time, the  
Group was in discussions with UAE medical 
insurance funders and other third parties about 
conforming Al Noor’s commercial practices to 
the rest of the Group and there was therefore 
uncertainty about the adequacy of provisions for the 
collection of accounts receivable and for insurance 
rejections. Management has subsequently finalised 
the purchase price allocation in the current financial 
year as required by IFRS. The net assets of Al Noor 
assumed by the Group have been adjusted by £14m 
through an additional provision for the impairment 
of receivables. A corresponding adjustment has  
been recorded to goodwill. 
The adjustment required to increase the provision 
for the impairment of receivables at the date of 
acquisition resulted in a rigorous assessment by 
management of the provision for impairment of  
Al Noor receivables at 31 March 2017.
We focused on this area because of the extent 
of judgement and estimation involved in the 
assessment to adjust the take-on balance sheet 
of Al Noor as opposed to accounting for the 
adjustments subsequent to the acquisition 
as part of post-acquisition earnings. We 
focused on the provision for the impairment of 
receivables at year-end as this area requires the 
exercise of significant management judgement  
and estimation.
We obtained management’s assessment of 
adjustments required to the take-on balance sheet of 
Al Noor and independently assessed the completeness 
of adjustments identified. We performed an 
independent assessment of the additional provision 
for the impairment of receivables at the date of the 
take-on balance sheet by evaluating the results of 
claim audits by medical insurers, ageing analyses of 
receivable balances and analysis of payments received 
subsequent to the acquisition date. We substantiated 
management’s assessment that the additional provision 
related to revenue transactions which occurred before 
the acquisition date. 
We extended our testing to the assessment of 
recoverability of Al Noor’s receivable balances at  
31 March 2017. We obtained an understanding of the 
process followed by management to identify impaired 
balances and performed an independent assessment of 
the provision calculated by management by evaluating 
the results of claim audits by medical insurers where 
available, historical trends of disallowed claims and 
subsequent settlements and ageing analyses. We also 
tested receipts subsequent to year-end.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not 
identify any material adjustment required to the 
position reported by the Group in the take-on balance 
sheet of Al Noor or at 31 March 2017. In addition, we 
considered whether any additional adjustments were 
required to the initial purchase price allocation that 
might have been required as the Group conforms  
Al Noor’s accounting and operational practices with 
the rest of Mediclinic following the acquisition. We 
did not identify any material additional adjustments. 
We were also satisfied with the adequacy of the 
disclosures in respect of the finalisation of the purchase 
price allocation, comprising a restatement of certain 
comparative balance sheet accounts.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 134 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
2.  Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill
  (refer to Audit and Risk Committee Report 
on page 117 and notes 4 and 7 in the Group  
Financial Statements)
The Group has £2 156m of intangible assets.  
This balance consists mainly of goodwill relating to 
the Mediclinic Middle East operations of £1 401m, 
goodwill on the acquisition of the Swiss operations 
of £307m, Swiss trademarks of £341m and the  
Al Noor brand name of £28m. 
The Group is required to perform annual impairment 
tests on goodwill. The Swiss trademarks were 
classified as indefinite life intangible assets 
at the time of the acquisition and the Group  
carries out annual impairment tests based on value-
in-use calculations. The Group also performed an 
impairment assessment of the cash generating unit 
(“CGU”) to which the Al Noor brand name has been 
allocated as specific impairment indicators were 
identified for this CGU. 
No impairment losses were recorded during the 
current or prior years in respect of these assets. 
However, the carrying values of goodwill and 
intangible assets are contingent on future cash 
flows and there is a risk if these cash flows do not 
meet the Group’s expectations, or if significant 
judgements like the discount rates or growth rates 
change, that the assets will be impaired.
We focused on the impairment assessments of 
these intangible assets as the impairment reviews 
carried out by the Group contain a number of 
significant judgements, including the classification 
of the Swiss trademarks as indefinite life intangible 
assets and the level at which goodwill is monitored 
for impairment, and estimates, including growth 
rates and discount rates. Changes in these 
assumptions might lead to a significant change in 
the carrying values of the related assets.
Deploying our valuation specialists, we obtained 
management’s impairment calculations and tested 
the reasonableness of key assumptions, including 
cash flow forecasts and the selection of growth rates 
and discount rates. We challenged management to 
substantiate its assumptions, including comparing 
relevant assumptions to industry benchmarks and 
economic forecasts.
We substantively tested the integrity of supporting 
calculations and corroborated certain information with 
third party sources. 
We agreed the underlying cash flows to approved 
budgets and assessed growth rates and discount rates 
by comparison to third party information, the Group’s 
cost of capital and relevant risk factors. Future cash flow 
assumptions were evaluated in the context of current 
trading performance against budget and forecasts, 
considering the historical accuracy of budgeting and 
forecasting and understanding the reasons for the 
growth profiles used.
We evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to 
ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes 
to key assumptions on the available headroom. We 
agree with management’s assessment that the Middle 
East and Hirslanden goodwill impairment assessments 
are sensitive to reasonably possible changes to  
key assumptions. 
We evaluated management’s judgement regarding 
the level at which goodwill arising from the Al 
Noor acquisition is monitored for impairment and 
concluded that the decision to combine Al Noor 
with Mediclinic Middle East for goodwill impairment 
review purposes is reasonable based on the initial 
commercial rationale for the acquisition, which 
included expected synergies from integrating the 
legacy Al Noor business with the legacy Mediclinic 
Middle East business that would be realised across  
the Middle East operating segment. 
Based on our work performed, we concurred with 
management that no impairments were required 
for goodwill or for the acquired intangible assets at  
31 March 2017. We found that the judgements were 
supported by reasonable assumptions and that the 
disclosures in respect of the impairment assessments 
are a fair reflection of the judgements made by  
the Group. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 135 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

3.  Valuation of associate interest in Spire 
  (refer to Audit and Risk Committee Report 
on page 117 and notes 8 and 30 in the Group  
Financial Statements)
Mediclinic acquired an interest of 29.9% in Spire 
Healthcare Group plc (“Spire”) for a consideration 
of £437m in the prior financial year. We focused on 
the valuation of the investment in Spire, directing 
our attention in particular at the following areas:
• 
A notional purchase price allocation is required 
to split the total purchase consideration 
between tangible assets acquired, intangible 
assets identified on acquisition and goodwill. 
As the investment is accounted for using the 
equity method, net assets of the investee 
are not recognised in the Group’s statement 
of financial position, but the share of profits 
equity accounted is affected by adjustments 
such as additional depreciation due to fair 
value adjustments to tangible assets at 
acquisition and the amortisation of intangible 
assets identified and recognised separately 
from goodwill. The Group finalised its notional 
purchase price allocation with the assistance 
of an independent expert during the current 
financial year. Separately identifiable intangible 
assets amounting to £68 million were valued as 
a result of this exercise. Judgement is involved 
in notionally allocating the purchase price to the 
tangible and intangible assets identified in the 
acquisition together with the valuation of the 
intangible assets requiring specialist skills and 
knowledge;
• 
The equity accounted earnings of Spire that 
are included in the income statement of the 
Group represent the year ended 31 December 
2016 consistent with Spire’s financial year-end, 
which is not co-terminous with Mediclinic’s  
31 March 2017 year-end. The equity accounting 
for Spire lags the Group’s reporting period by 
three months as allowed by IAS 28. Application 
of this policy means that the Group needs to 
consider whether there were any significant 
developments at Spire between 1 January 2017 
and 31 March 2017, the date to which the Group 
draws its consolidated financial statements; and
We obtained the report issued by the external 
valuation expert engaged by the Group to perform 
the notional purchase price allocation and to assist 
with the identification of identifiable assets acquired. 
Using our own valuation specialists, we assessed the 
process and methodology adopted by management’s 
expert and the underlying assumptions and tested the 
mathematical accuracy of the valuation model.
We substantively tested the equity accounted results 
of Spire recorded by the Group with reference to 
the audited financial statements of Spire for the year 
ended 31 December 2016. We instructed the auditors 
of Spire to perform specified procedures to support 
our assessment of Spire’s results equity accounted by 
the Group. 
We read recent press reports of Spire and discussed 
with the Group’s representative who sits on the board 
of Spire any significant or abnormal transactions 
that occurred in the period from 1 January 2017 to  
31 March 2017, being the period not equity accounted 
by the Group, which could have had an effect on  
the results and carrying value of the associate at  
31 March 2017. 
We evaluated the share performance of Spire over the 
period since acquisition with reference to its reported 
financial performance. We met with the Group’s 
nominated director on the Spire board to understand 
whether any indicators of impairment exist based 
on the underlying performance of the business and 
we inspected the latest available financial reports 
of Spire. We obtained analyst consensus forecasts  
of the Spire share price over the next twelve  
months to understand third party expectations  
of future performance.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 136 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
3.  Valuation of associate interest in Spire (continued)
• 
At 31 March 2017, the carrying value of the 
investment in Spire exceeded the listed market 
value of the investment, which could indicate a 
possible impairment. The Group assessed the 
recoverable amount of the investment based  
on a value in use calculation and concluded that 
no impairment loss was required. We focused 
on this area because judgement and estimation 
are involved in the impairment assessment. The 
carrying value of the investment is contingent 
on future cash flows and there is a risk that the 
investment will be impaired if these cash flows 
do not meet expectations. In addition, significant 
transactions or events that occur between 
Spire’s year-end and the Group’s reporting date 
may have an impact on the carrying value of the 
investment.
Deploying our valuation specialists, we obtained 
management’s impairment assessment and 
tested the reasonableness of key assumptions 
underpinning management’s value in use valuation 
of the Group’s investment of Spire, including cash 
flow forecasts and the selection of growth rates 
and discount rates. We challenged management to 
substantiate its assumptions, including comparing 
relevant assumptions to third party data and  
economic forecasts.
We evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to 
ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes 
to key assumptions on the available headroom. We 
evaluated the disclosure regarding the sensitivity of the 
impairment judgement to reasonably possible changes 
in the key assumptions underlying the impairment 
assessment. 
Based on our work performed, we concurred with 
management that no impairment loss is required 
to the investment at 31 March 2017 and we did not 
identify any significant or abnormal transactions 
that affect the period from 1 January 2017 through  
31 March 2017. We found the judgements and estimates 
made by management to be materially reasonable and 
the related disclosures to be appropriate.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 137 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

4.  Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
  (refer to Audit and Risk Committee Report on 
page 114)
Different business models apply in each of the 
Group’s businesses as a result of different regulatory 
environments and relationship models between 
the hospitals and funders. The Group’s accounting 
policies in respect of revenue recognition are 
not considered to present a significant risk of 
misstatement due to the simple nature of the 
underlying transactions and related processes. 
However, as with any audit an inherent risk exists 
that revenue may be overstated due to fraud as a 
result of incentives to achieve certain performance 
targets driven mainly by revenue. 
We obtained an understanding of the different revenue 
streams and revenue models across the Group. In 
particular, we focused on the newly acquired Al Noor 
business more broadly as it conforms its accounting 
and commercial practices with the rest of the Group 
and on a specific Al Noor business unit that was subject 
to an earn-out. 
 
We evaluated the relevant controls in the revenue cycle. 
We used computer assisted auditing techniques or 
tests of details to test settled transactions from source 
to receipt of payment. We tested unusual journal 
entries impacting revenue and accounts receivable. We 
performed tests of details on adjustments recorded to 
reported revenue. 
We tested unsettled transactions substantively 
through testing of receipts subsequent to  
year-end, confirmation of claims with medical insurers 
or patient file testing to check that the underlying 
service happened prior to year-end.
We obtained an understanding of the process followed 
by management to identify impaired receivable 
balances and performed an independent assessment of 
the provision calculated by management by evaluating 
the results of claim audits by medical insurers, historical 
information and ageing analyses. We performed 
analytical procedures designed to identify unusual 
trends in revenue recognition and pricing of services, 
including an assessment of insurance rejections. 
Based on the procedures performed, we have identified 
no material adjustments. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 138 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
HOW WE TAILORED THE AUDIT SCOPE
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of eight reporting units which comprise sub-consolidations 
of the operations in each of the Group’s key markets. The South Africa, Switzerland and Dubai reporting units 
required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size. Audits were also performed over the 
complete financial information of three other reporting units (Abu Dhabi, being the legacy Al Noor business, 
the Mediclinic International plc parent company and Spire) to give appropriate audit coverage and to focus on 
specific risks associated with the acquisition of Al Noor and Spire in the prior financial year given the need to 
finalise the provisional purchase price accounting in the current financial year. Taken together, reporting units 
where we performed audit work over the complete financial information accounted for 93% of consolidated 
revenue and 92% of consolidated profit before tax. We separately performed specified procedures at two further 
reporting units meaning that our audit covered all reporting units that individually contributed more than 1% to 
the Group’s revenue and 3% to profit before tax. 
In addition, we instructed the component auditor at Spire, the one reporting unit with a non co-terminous year-
end to the rest of the Group, to undertake subsequent event review procedures over the lag period of account.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed at the reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or by component auditors from other 
PwC network firms or, in the case of Spire, other audit firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work 
at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained 
as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. 
Recognising that not every business in each of the eight reporting units which comprise the Group’s consolidated 
results and financial position is included in our Group audit scope, we considered as part of our Group audit 
oversight responsibility what audit coverage has been obtained in aggregate by our component teams by 
reference to business components at which audit work has been undertaken.
We visited our component teams in South Africa, Switzerland and the UAE, which included file reviews, 
attendance at key audit meetings with local management and participation in audit clearance meetings at each 
reporting unit. We also had regular dialogue with our component audit teams at each key reporting unit and with  
Spire’s auditor.
Further specific audit procedures over the Group consolidation (and review procedures over the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements disclosures) were directly led by the Group audit team.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 139 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
MATERIALITY
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures 
and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole  
as follows:
Overall group materiality £14.9 million (2016: £13 million).
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before tax is a primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated 
a materiality that was less than overall group audit 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated to 
each reporting unit was between £1.5 million and 
£12 million. The materiality used for the audit of the 
parent company was £12 million. Certain components 
were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that 
was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit 
above £0.7 million (2016: £0.7 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
GOING CONCERN
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 129, in relation to 
going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw  
attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. 
As part of our audit, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee of the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 140 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE 
GROUP
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you  
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to:
• 
the directors’ confirmation on pages 30 to 36 of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, in accordance 
with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model,

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 129, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, 
we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Mediclinic International plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Mediclinic International plc is a private hospital group with three operating platforms in Southern Africa 
(South Africa and Namibia), Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates and with an equity investment in 
the UK. Its core purpose is to enhance the quality of life of patients by providing cost-effective acute care 
specialised hospital services.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless  
otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International  
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union, including IFRS Interpretations 
Committee (IFRS IC) and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost convention, except for the following items 
which are carried at fair value or valued using another measurement basis:
• 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities and available-for-sale financial assets are measured at  
fair value
• 
Retirement benefit obligations that are measured in terms of the projected unit credit method
• 
Liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical  
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying 
the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are 
disclosed in note 4.
Functional and presentation currency   
The consolidated financial statements and financial information are presented in pound (the presentation 
currency), rounded to the nearest million. The functional currency of the majority of the Group's entities, 
and the currencies of the primary economic environments in which they operate, is the South African 
rand, Swiss franc and United Arab Emirates dirham. The United Arab Emirates dirham is pegged against 
the United States dollar at a rate of 3.6725 per US Dollar. 
Exchange rates
The Group uses the average of exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and 
cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, the joint venture and associated undertakings into pound and period-
end rates to translate the net assets of those undertakings. The following exchange rates were applicable 
during the period:
GROUP
2017 2016
Average rates:
Swiss franc 1.29  1.47 
UAE dirham 4.80  5.54 
South African rand 18.41  20.73 
Period end rates:
Swiss franc 1.25  1.38 
UAE dirham 4.59  5.28 
South African rand 16.74  21.21 
 
Going concern
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed in connection with the viability 
statement, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 150 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.2 Consolidation and equity accounting
a) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of 
acquisition until control is lost.
Adjustments to the financial statements of subsidiaries are made when necessary to bring their accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
All intra-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified and recognised 
separately from the Group’s interest therein, and are recognised within equity. Losses of subsidiaries 
attributable to non-controlling interests are allocated to the non-controlling interest even if this results  
in a debit balance being recognised.
Transactions which result in changes in ownership levels, where the Company has control of the subsidiary 
both before and after the transaction are regarded as equity transactions and are recognised directly in 
the statement of changes in equity.
The difference between the fair value of consideration paid or received and the movement in non-
controlling interest for such transactions is recognised in equity attributable to the owners of the parent.
Where a subsidiary is disposed of and a non-controlling shareholding is retained, the remaining investment 
is measured to fair value with the adjustment to fair value recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain 
or loss on disposal of the controlling interest.
Reverse acquisition accounting
On 14 October 2015, the Board of Directors of Al Noor Hospitals Group plc and the independent Board of 
Directors of Mediclinic International Limited announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms 
of a recommended combination of their respective businesses (the ‘‘Combination’’). Given the relative 
size of Al Noor and Mediclinic, the Combination has been classified as a reverse takeover in terms of  
IFRS 3, based on the analysis of the voting rights after the combination and the composition of the Board 
of Directors. For the purpose of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the Combination was also 
classified as a reverse takeover.
On 15 February 2016, the entire share capital of Mediclinic International Limited was acquired by Al Noor 
Hopitals Group plc pursuant to the Mediclinic Scheme. Al Noor Hospitals Group plc acquired all of the 
Mediclinic Shares that were not repurchased and cancelled by Mediclinic in the Repurchase Option. 
Mediclinic Shareholders were entitled to receive 0.625 new shares for every Mediclinic share held.
Al Noor Hospitals Group plc has remained the holding company of the Enlarged Group and has been 
renamed to ‘‘Mediclinic International plc’’. Mediclinic International plc wholly owns the Al Noor Hospitals 
Group and the Mediclinic Group, as well as the 29.9 per cent interest in Spire Heathcare plc, which was 
acquired by Mediclinic International Limited in August 2015. 
Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are issued in the name of Mediclinic International plc 
(previously Al Noor Hospitals Group plc), but are a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of 
Mediclinic International Limited. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the financial statements 
of Mediclinic International Limited, including comparative information, have been retrospectively adjusted 
to reflect the legal capital position of Mediclinic International plc. For further details, refer to note 29.
A capital redemption reserve and a reverse acquisition reserve were created (refer to note 13). 
Al Noor’s results have been consolidated in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date 
of the acquisition, 15 February 2016. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 151 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.2 Consolidation and equity accounting (continued)
b) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of 
the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed and equity instruments issued. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are 
expensed as incurred, except the costs to issue debt that are amortised as part of the effective interest 
and costs to issue equity, which are included in equity.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an 
asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is 
classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the recognition conditions 
of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date, except for  
non-current assets (or disposal company) that are classified as held-for-sale in accordance with  
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised at fair value 
less costs to sell.
Contingent liabilities are only included in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree where there 
is a present obligation at acquisition date.
On acquisition, the Group assesses the classification of the acquiree's assets and liabilities and reclassifies 
them where the classification is inappropriate for Group purposes. This excludes lease agreements and 
insurance contracts, whose classification remains as per their inception date.
Non-controlling interests arising from a business combination, which are present ownership interests, 
and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation, are 
measured either at the present ownership interests' proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree's identifiable net assets or at fair value. The treatment is not an accounting policy choice but is 
selected for each individual business combination, and disclosed in the note for business combinations. 
All other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair values, unless 
another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.
In cases where the Company held a non-controlling shareholding in the acquiree prior to obtaining control, 
that interest is measured to fair value as at acquisition date. The measurement to fair value is included in 
profit or loss for the year. Where the existing shareholding was classified as an available-for-sale financial 
asset, the cumulative fair value adjustments recognised previously to other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity are recognised in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.
Goodwill is determined as the consideration paid, plus the fair value of any shareholding held prior 
to obtaining control, plus non-controlling interest and less the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the acquiree. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and 
previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in 
the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested on an annual basis for impairment. If goodwill is assessed to be 
impaired, that impairment is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of foreign entities is considered an asset of the foreign entity. In such cases 
the goodwill is translated to the functional currency of the Company at the end of each reporting period 
with the adjustment recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 152 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.2 Consolidation and equity accounting (continued)
c) Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in joint 
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual 
rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and 
determined them to be joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the equity accounted investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in 
other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from equity accounted investments are 
recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group’s investments in associates 
and joint ventures include goodwill identified on acquisition. When the Group’s share of losses in an 
associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the investment (which includes any long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment), the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its equity accounted investments are eliminated 
to the extent of the Group’s interest in these investments. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the equity 
accounted investments have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
If the ownership interest in an equity accounted investment is reduced but significant influence or joint 
control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit 
or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to 
the carrying amount of the investment. 
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the equity 
accounted investment is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as 
the difference between the recoverable amount of the investment and its carrying value and recognises 
the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of the investment in the income statement. 
2.3 Segment reporting
Consistent with internal reporting, the Group's segments are identified as the three geographical 
operating platforms in Mediclinic Southern Africa, Mediclinic Switzerland, Mediclinic Middle East.  
The United Kingdom and Corporate segments are additional non-operating segments. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments, 
has been identified as the Executive Committee that makes strategic decisions. The Executive Committee 
comprises the Executive Directors.
2.4 Property, equipment and vehicles
Land and buildings comprise mainly hospitals and offices. All property, equipment and vehicles are 
shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost 
less impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on the other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to 
allocate the cost less its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:
• 
Buildings: 10 – 100 years
• 
Equipment: 3 – 10 years
• 
Furniture and vehicles: 3 – 8 years MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 153 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.4 Property, equipment and vehicles (continued)
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement  
of financial position date.
Refer to note 2.6 for impairment of property, equipment and vehicles.
An asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from use. Profit 
or loss on disposals is determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included  
in the income statement. 
2.5 Intangible assets
a) Trade names
Trade names have been recognised by the Group as part of a business combination. No value is placed 
on internally developed trade names. Trade names that are deemed to have an indefinite useful life are 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Trade names that are deemed to have a finite useful 
life are capitalised at the cost to the Group and amortised on the straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful lifetime of 1 to 20 years (2016: 5 to 20 years). Expenditure to maintain trade names is accounted for 
against income as incurred.
b) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the  
date of acquisition and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the subsidiary. Goodwill on acquisition 
of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates and joint ventures 
is included in investments in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Goodwill is carried 
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and 
losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation 
is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from business combinations in 
which goodwill arose. Management monitors goodwill for impairment at an operating segment level. Any 
impairment losses that are recognised are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets on a pro rata basis.
c) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and 
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (1 – 5 years) 
using the straight-line method. 
Internally developed computer software that is clearly associated with an identifiable and unique system, 
which will be controlled by the Group and have a probable future economic benefit beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Costs associated with maintaining computer software or development 
expenditure that does not meet the recognition criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
2.6 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. The recoverable amount is calculated by estimating future cash benefits that will result from 
each asset and discounting those cash benefits at an appropriate discount rate. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows – CGUs. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 154 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.7 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-sale 
financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the asset was acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments 
at initial recognition.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all 
financial assets not subsequently carried at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and 
receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for 
impairment.
Investments available-for-sale
Other long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are included within non-current assets 
unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date. These 
investments are carried at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of available-for-sale investments are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise. When available-for-sale investments are either sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value 
adjustments are realised and included in profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
These instruments, consisting of financial instruments held-for-trading and those designated at fair value 
through profit and loss at inception, are carried at fair value. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-
trading unless they are designated as hedges. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they arise.
Impairment
At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a 
group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only 
if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset and that loss has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset that can be reliably estimated. 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, evidence of impairment may include indications that the 
receivables or a group of receivables is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency 
in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated 
future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.  
The amount of the provision for impairment is the difference between the carrying amount of the asset 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The 
movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
In the case of available-for-sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
asset below its cost is considered an indicator that the investments are impaired. If any such evidence 
exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between 
the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously 
recognised in profit or loss – is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income 
statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through 
the income statement. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 155 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.8 Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position 
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, the legal enforceable right is 
not contingent of a future event and is enforceable in the normal course of business even in the event of 
default, bankruptcy and insolvency, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.9 Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost, determined on the weighted average method, or net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
applicable variable selling expenses.
2.10 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original 
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The amount of the provision is recognised 
in the income statement.
2.11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks and cash on hand and are classified as loans 
and receivables. Bank overdrafts are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost and are disclosed as 
part of borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
2.12 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being 
hedged. Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge. The Group uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
The Group documents, at inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, 
of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting cash 
flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 20.  
The hedging reserve in shareholders' equity is shown in note 14. On the statement of financial position 
hedging derivatives are not classified based on whether the amount is expected to be recovered or settled 
within, or after, 12 months. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or 
liability when the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months; it is classified as 
a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that is designated and qualifies as a cash 
flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when the interest expense on hedged 
variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss).
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 156 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.13 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Shares in the Company held by wholly-owned Group companies 
are classified as treasury shares and are held at cost.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. 
2.14 Treasury shares
Treasury shares are deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. No  
gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury 
shares. All consideration paid or received for treasury shares is recognised directly in equity. 
2.15 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Accounts payable is classified as current liabilities if payment 
is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities.
2.16 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) 
and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using 
the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borrowing costs are expensed when incurred, except for borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
construction or acquisition of qualifying assets. Borrowing cost directly attributable to the construction 
or acquisition of qualifying assets is added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use.
2.17 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of 
past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
2.18 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date in the countries where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on 
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; 
deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 157 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.18 Current and deferred income tax (continued)
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.19 Employee benefits
a) Retirement benefit costs
The Group provides defined benefit and defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees, the 
assets of which are held in separate trustee administered funds. These plans are funded by payments from 
the employees and the Group, taking into account recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity. Each member’s fund value is directly linked to the contributions and the related investment 
returns. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to make further contributions if the fund does 
not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and 
prior periods. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Defined benefit plans
This plan defines an amount of pension benefit an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one 
or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognised in the statement 
of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits 
will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past 
service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. A net pension asset is recorded only 
to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of any economic benefit available in the form of 
reductions in future contributions to the plan, and any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service 
costs. The annual pension costs of the Group’s benefit plans are charged to the income statement.
Incurred interest costs/income on the defined benefit obligations are recognised as wages and salaries.
b) Post-retirement medical benefits
Some Group companies provide for post-retirement medical contributions in relation to current and 
retired employees. The expected costs of these benefits are accounted for by using the projected unit 
credit method. Under this method, the expected costs of these benefits are accumulated over the service 
lives of the employees. Valuation of these obligations is carried out by independent qualified actuaries.  
All actuarial gains and losses are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in 
which they arise. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 158 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.19 Employee benefits (continued)
c) Equity-settled share-based compensation
The Group operates a equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the entity receives 
services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Company. The fair value 
of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. 
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• 
including any market performance conditions;
• 
excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
• 
including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
d) Cash-settled share-based compensation
The Group operates cash-settled share-based compensation plans. The Group recognises the value of the 
services received (expense), and the liabilities to pay for those services, as the employees render service. 
The liabilities are measured, initially, and at each reporting date until settled, at the fair value appropriate to 
the scheme, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the rights were granted, and the extent 
to which the employees have rendered service to date, excluding the impact of any non-market-related 
vesting conditions. Non-market-related vesting conditions are included in the assumptions regarding the 
number of units expected to vest. These assumptions are revised at the end of each reporting period.  
All changes to the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement.
e) Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense where a contractual obligation exist for short-term 
incentives. The amounts payable to employees in respect of the short-term incentive schemes are 
determined based on annual business performance targets. 
2.20 Revenue recognition
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration that has been received or is to be received 
and represent the amounts that can be received for services in the regular course of business when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred or services have been rendered. 
Discounts, sales taxes and other taxes associated with the revenues have to be deducted. 
Revenue primarily comprises fees charged for inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Services include 
charges for accommodation, theatre, medical professional services, equipment, radiology, laboratory and 
pharmaceutical goods used. Revenue is recorded and recognised during the period in which the hospital 
service is provided, based upon the amounts due from patients and/or medical funding entities. Fees are 
calculated and billed based on various tariff agreements with funders. 
Discounts comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on attainment of 
certain levels of purchases from the Group. These are accrued over the course of the arrangement based 
on estimates of the level of business expected and are adjusted at the end of the arrangement to reflect 
actual volumes. 
In Switzerland, medical services can on occasion be charged based on provisional tariffs as delays can 
occur in the agreement of tariffs between providers (including the Group) and funders. When tariffs have 
not yet been agreed, tariff provisions are recognised as adjustments in revenue to reflect any uncertainty 
about collectability of amounts invoiced. Revenue continues to be recognised in these circumstances as 
the Group has developed significant historical experience of continuing to collect revenue for delivered 
services where tariff negotiations have not concluded with all relevant authorities. However, a tariff 
provision will be recorded when the Group identifies any uncertainty around collection of amounts invoiced 
for delivered services and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required, which can be reliably 
estimated. The provision is calculated on the basis of historical experience of outcomes to negotiations 
between providers and funders and this historical experience is subject to regular reassessment based on 
the actual outcome to tariff negotiations. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 159 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.20 Revenue recognition (continued)
Other revenues earned are recognised on the following bases:
a) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportioned basis using the effective interest rate method. 
b) Rental income
Rental income, which is insignificant, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
With the exception of interest income, all the items above are presented as revenue.
2.21 Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of the cost of inventories, including obsolete stock, which have been expensed 
during the year, together with personnel costs and related overheads which are directly attributable to 
the provision of services.
2.22 Leased assets
Leases of property, equipment and vehicles where the Group assumes substantially all the benefits and risks 
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement 
at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant 
rate on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are 
included in borrowings. The interest element of the finance charges is charged to the income statement 
over the lease period. The property, equipment and vehicles acquired under finance leasing contracts are 
depreciated over the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease agreement if shorter and transfer 
of ownership at the end of the lease period is uncertain.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
2.23 Dividend distribution
Dividends are recorded in the Group's financial statements in the period in which they are approved by 
the Company's Board of Directors.
2.24 Foreign currency transactions
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective Group entities’ functional currencies at 
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement 
(except when recognised in other comprehensive income as part of qualifying cash flow hedges).
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at historical 
cost are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date, and those measured at fair value are 
translated at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Exchange rate differences 
on non-monetary items are accounted for based on the classification of the underlying items.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets classified as available-for-sale, are included in 
other comprehensive income. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement 
within “Administration and other operating expenses”. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 160 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
2.24 Foreign currency transactions (continued)
Group entities
The results and financial position of all foreign operations that have a functional currency that is different 
from the Group’s presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
• 
Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date. 
• 
Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for  
the year.
• 
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign 
operations are taken directly to other comprehensive income. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated at closing rates at the reporting date.
2.25 Standards, interpretations and amendments
Published standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the 31 March 2017 financial 
period:
The following published standards, amendments and interpretations are mandatory for the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 April 2016 and have been adopted:
• 
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment entities (amendments) – Applying the consolidation exception
• 
IFRS 11 (amendments) – Joint arrangements
• 
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
• 
IAS 1 (amendments) – Disclosure initiative
• 
IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendments) – Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and 
amortisation
• 
IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendments) – Agriculture: bearer plants
• 
IAS 27 (amendment) – Equity method in separate financial statements
• 
Annual improvements 2012 – 2014 cycle – Amendments and clarifications to existing IFRS standards
The implementation of these standards and amendments had no financial impact on the reported results 
or financial position of the Group.
Published standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted:
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations are expected to have an impact on 
the financial statements in the period of initial application. Based on initial assessments, management 
expects the new standards to mainly affect presentation and disclosure of the financial statements, 
with the exception of IFRS 16: Leases which is expected to have a material impact and will be evaluated  
during 2018.
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (1 January 2018)
The new standard improves and simplifies the approach for classification and measurement of financial 
assets compared with the requirements of IAS 39. IFRS 9 applies a consistent approach to classifying 
financial assets and replaces the numerous categories of financial assets in IAS 39, each of which had 
its own classification criteria. IFRS 9 also results in one impairment method, replacing the numerous 
impairment methods in IAS 39 that arise from the different classification categories.
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (1 January 2018)
The new standard requires companies to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to 
customers, that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, and 
provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves 
guidance for multiple-element arrangements.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 161 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.25 Standards, interpretations and amendments (continued)
Published standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted: 
(continued)
IFRS 16: Leases (1 January 2019)
The new standard addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and 
establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing 
activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases 
will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases', and related 
interpretations.
The following new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments will have no material impact 
on the financial statements:
• 
IAS 7 (amendment) – Disclosure initiative (1 January 2017)
• 
IAS 12 (amendment) – Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (1 January 2017)

3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
3.1 Financial risk factors
In respect of the Group's financial instruments, normal business activities expose the Group to a variety 
of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects 
on the Group’s financial performance. 
a) Market risk
i) Currency risk
Investments in foreign operations
The Group has investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency 
translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. Changes in the pound/
Swiss franc, pound/UAE dirham and pound/South African rand exchange rate over a period of time result 
in increased/decreased earnings. Other than the Group's earnings and payment of dividends which are 
presented and declared in pound and thus exposed to currency risk, the Group is not significantly exposed 
to currency risk since the operating platforms predominantly operates in its local currency (including  
its debt).
In the case of corporate offshore transactions and or cross-border business combinations, generally 
forward cover contracts are considered or taken out to minimize foreign currency risk. Currently there are 
no forward cover contracts in place.
The impact of a 10% change in the pound/Swiss franc, pound/South African rand and the pound/UAE 
dirham exchange rates for a sustained period of one year is:
• 
profit for the period would increase/decrease by £14m (31 March 2016: increase/decrease by £11m) 
due to exposure to the GBP/Swiss franc exchange rate;
• 
profit for the period would increase/decrease by £2m (31 March 2016: increase/decrease by £6m)  
due to exposure to the GBP/UAE dirham exchange rate; 
• 
profit for the period would increase/decrease by £8m (31 March 2016: increase/decrease by £7m)  
due to exposure to the GBP/South African Rand exchange rate;  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 162 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a) Market risk (continued)
i) Currency risk (continued)
Investments in foreign operations (continued)
• 
foreign currency translation reserve would increase/decrease by £196m (2016: increase/decrease  
by £112m) due to exposure to the GBP/Swiss franc exchange rate;
• 
foreign currency translation reserve would increase/decrease by £154m (2016: increase/decrease  
by £24m) due to exposure to the GBP/UAE dirham exchange rate; and
• 
foreign currency translation reserve would increase/decrease by £6m (2016: increase/decrease  
by £12m) due to exposure to the GBP/South African rand exchange rate.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings as well as short-term deposits. Borrowings 
and short-term deposits issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Interest 
rate derivatives expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group policy is to maintain an appropriate 
mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and placings.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Such interest rate 
swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Generally, the 
Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates. Under the interest 
rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), 
the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to 
the agreed notional amounts.
In respect of financial assets, interest rate risk is managed by using approved counterparties that offer 
the best rates.
With the interest rate swap agreements the Group entered into to mitigate interest rate risk, the Group did 
not consider there to be a significant concentration of interest rate risk.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both 
derivative and non-derivative instruments at the reporting date and the stipulated change taking place 
at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of 
instruments that have floating rates. If interest rates had been 25 basis points higher/lower and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group’s: 
• 
profit for the period would increase/decrease by £3m (2016: increase/decrease by £3m). This is 
mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its unhedged variable rate  
borrowings and cash.
iii) Other price risk
The Group is not materially exposed to commodity or any other price risk. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 163 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
3.1 Financial risk factors (continued)
b) Credit risk
Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally 
of cash, short-term deposits and trade and other receivables and derivative financial contracts.  
The Group's cash equivalents and short-term deposits, are placed with quality financial institutions with 
a high credit rating. Trade receivables are represented net of the allowance for doubtful receivables. 
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of customers comprising 
the Group's customer base, which consists mainly of medical schemes and insurance companies. The 
financial condition of these clients in relation to their credit standing is evaluated on an ongoing basis. 
Medical schemes and insurance companies are forced to maintain minimum reserve levels. The policy for 
patients that do not have a medical scheme or an insurance company paying for the Group's service, is to 
require a preliminary payment instead. The Group does not have any significant exposure to any individual 
customer or counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to 
hedging instruments. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Group 
monitors its positions and limits the extent to which it enters into contracts with any one party.
The carrying amounts of financial assets included in the statement of financial position represents the 
Group's maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to these assets. At 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017, 
the Group did not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
c) Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash to 
meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all 
times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its 
borrowing facilities. Given that the Group has bank facilities in place which expires during 2019/2020, the 
Group did not consider there to be a significant concentration of liquidity risk.

3.2 Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going 
concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity 
balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed 
in note 17, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued capital, retained earnings and other reserves and non-controlling interest as disclosed in notes 13, 
14 and 16 respectively. The Group’s Audit and Risk Committee reviews the going concern status and capital 
structure of the Group annually. The Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of 
dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption 
of existing debt. The Group’s dividend policy is to target a pay-out ratio of between 25% and 30% of 
underlying earnings. The Board may revise the policy at its discretion. The debt-to-adjusted capital ratios 
at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 were as follows:

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The estimation of the useful lives of property, equipment and vehicles is based on historical performance 
as well as expectations about future use and therefore requires a significant degree of judgement to be 
applied by management. Rates of depreciation represent management’s current best estimate of the 
useful lives and residual values of the assets.
For a private hospital it is fundamentally important that the earnings potential of a building is maintained 
on a permanent basis. The Group therefore follows a structured maintenance programme with regard to 
hospital buildings with the specific goal to prolong the useful lifetime of these buildings. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 170 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  Relates to favourable lease contracts on buildings. The leases are characterised by fixed annual rent with no annual 
rent escalations for most part of the contract.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and the indefinite useful life intangible asset, resulting from 
the Al Noor and Hirslanden acquisitions, have suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the 
use of estimates in respect of growth and discount rates and it assumes a stable regulatory environment. 
Regulatory environments are subject to uncertainties that can have an impact on the recoverability of the 
goodwill and the intangible asset’s recoverable amount. 
IFRS requires the impairment assessment to be performed at the level at which goodwill is monitored 
for impairment by management, provided that this level cannot be bigger than an operating segment. 
Management assesses goodwill at a Hirslanden and Mediclinic Middle East platform level. This means 
that for the Mediclinic Middle East platform, recoverability of goodwill is assessed by reference to the 
aggregated cash flows of the legacy Middle East and Al Noor businesses. The Mediclinic Middle East 
goodwill originated mainly from the Al Noor business combination with a portion originating from other 
UAE business combinations The initial commercial rationale for the acquisition of Al Noor included 
expected synergies from integrating the legacy Al Noor business with the legacy MCME business that 
would be realised across the combined Middle East platform. In accordance with IFRS, goodwill shall be 
allocated to all CGUS, or groups of CGUS, that are expected to benefit from the expected synergies.
The estimation of the indefinite useful life of the Hirslanden trade names is based on the expectation that 
there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash flows for 
the Group. This expectation requires a significant degree of management judgement. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 171 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
Impairment testing of significant goodwill balances and indefinite useful life trade name
The carrying amounts of significant goodwill and indefinite life trade names are considered annually 
for impairment testing. The impairment tests are based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations 
use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a five-year period. The discount rates 
used reflect specific risks related to the hospital industry. These calculations indicate that there was no 
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill balances and the Hirslanden trade name.

Carrying amount of Hirslanden indefinite life trade names 341 309 
Impairment testing of Mediclinic Middle East goodwill
The Mediclinic Middle East goodwill originated mainly from the Al Noor business combination with a 
portion originating from other UAE business combinations. Key assumptions used for the value-in-use 
calculations for the annual impairment testing were as follows:
Future earnings is based on budgets and forecasts that is calculated on a per hospital basis. These budgets 
and forecasts represent management’s best view of future admissions, tariffs and patient mix and include 
savings relating to operational and capital expenditures. 
Discount rates – discount rates reflect management’s estimate of the time value and the risks associated 
with the Middle East business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been determined by 
considering the respective debt and equity costs and ratios. The discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections is 7.8% (2016: 7.8%).
Growth rates – growth rates are based on budgeted figures and management’s estimates. The estimated 
figures assume a stable regulatory and tariff environment. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are 
extrapolated using a 2.5% (2016: 2.5%) growth rate.
Sensitivity analysis – the recoverable amount calculated based on value-in-use exceeded the carrying 
value by approximately £259m (2016: £294m). A fall in growth rate to 1.6% (2016: 1.9%) or a rise in discount 
rate to 8.5% (2016: 8.3%) would reduce the headroom to nil.
Impairment testing of Hirslanden goodwill and indefinite life trade names
Key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculations for the annual impairment testing were as follows:
Future earnings is based on budgets and forecasts that is calculated on a per hospital basis. These budgets 
and forecasts represent management’s best view of future admissions, tariffs and patient mix and include 
savings relating to operational and capital expenditures. 
Discount rates – discount rates reflect management’s estimate of the time value and the risks associated 
with the Hirslanden business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been determined by 
considering the respective debt and equity costs and ratios. The discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections is 4.7% (2016: 4.7%).
Growth rates – growth rates are based on budgeted figures and management’s estimates. The estimated 
figures assume a stable regulatory and tariff environment. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are 
extrapolated using a 1.6% (2016: 1.6%) growth rate.
Sensitivity analysis – for the goodwill, the recoverable amount calculated based on value-in-use exceeded 
the carrying value by approximately £1 073m (2016: £1 212m). A fall in growth rate to 0.5% (2016: 0.3%) or 
a rise in discount rate to 5.6% (2016: 5.8%) would reduce the headroom to nil. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 172 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Al Noor trade name
On 15 February 2016, an intangible asset relating to the Al Noor trade name of £33m was recognised as 
part of the acquisition of Al Noor. The useful life of the asset was determined to be five years. Up until 
the end of February 2017, £7m of the trade name has been amortised. Following the announcement on  
21 February 2017 regarding the rebranding of all Al Noor facilities to Mediclinic, the carrying value and 
the useful economic life of the trade name recognised were reassessed. The rebranding of all the Al Noor 
hospitals and clinics will be complete by the end of the next financial year and the majority of these will 
be rebranded before 30 June 2017 given that the carrying value of the trade name asset continued to be 
supportable. Accelerated amortisation of £7m was recognised in March 2017 and the remainder of the 
balance will be amortised in the next financial year. The total amortisation recognised in the 2017 financial 
year relating to the Al Noor trade name amounted to £14m.

Although the market value of the investment is below the carrying value 
at 31 March 2017, management has concluded that no impairment exists.  
An impairment test was performed with the following key assumptions 
used for the value-in-use calculation:
 
Discount rates – discount rates reflect management’s estimate of the 
time value and the risks associated with Spire's business. The weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) has been determined by considering the 
respective debt and equity costs and ratios. The discount rate applied to 
cash flow projections is 6.3%.
Growth rates – growth rates are based on budgeted figures and 
management’s estimates. The estimated figures assume a stable 
regulatory and tariff environment. Cash flows beyond the five-year  
period are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate.
Sensitivity analysis – a fall in growth rate to 2.4% or a rise in discount rate 
to 6.4% would remove any headroom.

8.1 Investment in associates (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
During the prior financial year, the Group acquired 29.9% of Spire Healthcare Group plc and recognised 
this investment as an investment in an associate. At the date of acquisition a provisional notional purchase 
price allocation assessment did not identify any significant intangible assets other than goodwill. During 
the finalisation of the notional purchase price allocation, NCRC was identified as a material intangible 
asset. An independent valuer was used to assist in the identification and valuation of the NCRC.  
The NCRC acquired was valued and measured by using the Multi Period Excess Earnings Method.  
The valuation of NCRC used assumptions relating to future cash flows and discount rates which are 
based on forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental.
The Group tests whether equity-accounted investments have suffered any impairment when a 
triggering event occurs, in this case the carrying value of the listed investment exceeds its market value.  
The value-in-use calculation of the investment is based on a discounted cash flow model. These 
calculations require the use of estimates in respect of growth and discount rates and it assumes a stable 
regulatory environment.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences that have the potential to reduce 
tax payments in future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that the realisation 
of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable, having regard to the projected 
future taxable income of these entities and after taking into account specific risk factors that affect the 
recovery of these assets. Management uses the same profit projections for these purposes as are used 
by the business, for example in assessing the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s judgement in 
this area is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is 
considered afresh at each balance sheet date. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 178 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
10. DEFERRED TAX (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unutilised tax losses of approximately £121m (2016: £172m) potentially 
available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £16m (2016: £29m) has been recognised 
in respect of losses based on profitability from approved budgets and business plans. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability and availability 
of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions. The majority of the unrecognised losses relate to the 
Mediclinic International plc in the United Kingdom, which have no expiry, and the remainder relates to 
Switzerland, which expire after seven years. Their utilisation is dependent upon the profitability of their 
entities. The financial projections used in assessing the future profitability are consistent with those used 
in assessing the carrying value of goodwill as set out in note 7. The rate of utilisation of these losses 
will depend on the incidence and timing of profits within each entity which consequently impacts their 
recognition as deferred tax assets. Unused tax losses for the Group are as follows:

Expiry in 1 year 1 1 
Expiry in 2 years – 1 
Expiry in 3 to 7 years 13 6 
No expiry 33 29 
47 37 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to the 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments where the Group is 
able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. Similarly tax is not provided where it is expected at the reporting date that 
such distributions will not give rise to a tax liability. The gross timing difference in this regard amounts 
to £1 518m (2016: £1 282m). There are no significant expected income tax consequences of earnings 
being distributed from Switzerland and the UAE, as there is no dividend withholding tax applicable to 
earnings being distributed from these operations. Although South African distributions to the UK are 
typically subject to dividend withholding taxes, distributions from South Africa are not expected to have 
income tax consequences in the foreseeable future as the operations in South Africa have a significant 
contributed tax capital balance from which may be paid dividends free from witholding tax. In line with 
the South African Reserve Bank requirement, it is intended that dividends to the South African resident 
shareholders on the South African share register will be paid from the dividend access scheme. Refer to 
note 13 for details on the dividend access scheme.

a carrying value of £165m (2016: £151m) that are past due at the reporting 
date, but which the Group has not impaired as there has not been a 
significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered to 
be recoverable. The ageing of these receivables are as follows:

and expected future cash flows.
Management considers the credit quality of the unprovided trade receivables to be high in light of the 
nature of these trade receivables as described in note 3.1(b).

a new issue of shares, the amount by which the Company's issued share capital is diminished on 
cancellation of the shares are transferred to a capital redemption reserve to maintain capital. The 
reduction of the Company's share capital shall be treated as if the capital redemption reserve were 
paid up capital of the Company.

Dividend Access Scheme (DAS)
A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd, formed a Dividend 
Access Trust to comply with a South African Reserve Bank requirement that dividends from a  
South African source due to South African shareholders on the South African share register must be paid 
locally to avoid an outflow of funds from South Africa.
The beneficiaries of the trust are the South African shareholders of the Company who hold their 
shares via the South African share register on the relevant record date in respect of each distribution 
paid through the dividend access scheme (DAS). The Dividend Access Trust does not participate in  
any profits.
When a dividend is declared by the Company, the Dividend Access Trust would receive a dividend 
from Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd which in turn is paid over to the Company’s transfer 
secretaries in South Africa, who arrange for the payment of the relevant amount to the South African 
shareholders (the beneficiaries of the trust) through the usual dividend payment procedures, as if they 
were dividends received from Mediclinic International plc. To the extent that the dividends due to South 
African shareholders are not ultimately funded from Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd, they receive 
those dividends as normal dividends from Mediclinic International plc. The South African shareholders' 
entitlement to receive dividends declared by Mediclinic International plc is reduced by any amounts they 
receive via the trust. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 182 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Mpilo trusts
The Mpilo trusts were created in 2005 for purposes of an employee share scheme to introduce Mediclinic 
Southern Africa employees up to first line management level as shareholders of the Group. This share-
based payment arrangement is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. 
As qualifying employees leave prior to entitlement and shares become available further allocations were 
made to new and existing qualifying employees. The allocations of units made by the trusts were subject 
to lock-in periods which expired in December 2015, with the shares linked to participating employees’ 
units either transferred to them or sold with the proceeds of the sale distributed to them.

Forfeitable Share Plan
The Mediclinic International Limited Forfeitable Share Plan ("FSP") was approved by the Company’s 
shareholders in July 2014 as a long-term incentive scheme for selected senior management (Executive 
Directors and prescribed officers). This share-based payment arrangement is accounted for as an  
equity-settled share-based payment transaction. With the change in control and the acquisition of the  
Al Noor Hospitals Group plc, the performance conditions of FSP have been finalised to the extent that 
the performance conditions were met as at 30 September 2015. The FSP shares will vest after the 
vesting period has lapsed.
Under the FSP, conditional share awards are granted to selected employees of the Group. The vesting of 
these shares are subject to continued employment, and is conditional upon achievement of performance 
targets, measured over a three-year period. The performance conditions for the year under review 
constitute a combination of: absolute total shareholder return (“TSR”) (40% weighting) and underlying 
diluted headline earnings per share (60% weighting).  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 184 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Apart from the FSP, there are no other share option schemes in place. Therefore, no director exercised 
any rights in relation to share option schemes during the reporting period. Share options exercised by 
Al Noor Hospital Group plc directors before the acquisition date (15 February 2016) are regarded as a  
pre-acquisition transaction in these consolidated financial statements.

Under the LTIP, conditional phantom shares are granted to selected employees of the Group.  
The vesting of these shares are subject to continued employment, and is conditional upon achievement 
of performance targets, measured over a three-year period. The performance conditions for the year

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The cost of defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical benefit liability obligations, and the 
UAE end-of-service obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves 
making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates 
are subject to significant uncertainty.
(a) Swiss pension benefit obligation
The Group's Swiss operations has four (2016: five) defined benefit pension plans, namely:
Pensionskasse Hirslanden (cash balance plan)
Vorsorgestiftung VSAO (cash balance plan) (Association for Swiss Assistant and Senior Doctors)
Radiotherapie Hirslanden AG; Pension fund at foundation "pro" (cash balance plan)
Clinique La Colline SA; Pension fund at banque cantonal vaudois (cash balance plan)
Effective 1 January 2017 active insured members for the Swissana pension plan have been transferred into 
the Hirslanden and VSAO pension plans. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 190 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. 
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the 
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit 
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability 
recognised within the statement of financial position.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 192 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Swiss defined benefit pension plans expose the Group to some actuarial and investment risks. 
The pension plans provides employees of the Hirslanden Group with post-employment, death-in-service 
and disability benefits in accordance with the Federal Law on Occupational Old-age. These funds are 
separate legal entities from the Hirslanden Group. The funds' governing bodies consists of an equal 
number of employer and employee representatives.
This governing body determines the level of benefits and the investment strategy for the plan assets 
based on asset-liability analyses performed periodically. The basis for these asset-liability analyses are 
the statutory pension obligations, as these largely determine the cash flows of the fund. In addition, the 
investment of the plan assets is based on regulations developed by the governing body in accordance with 
the legal investment guidelines (BVV2). The investment committee of the governing body is responsible 
for their implementation. The governing body has mandated the investment activity to Complementa 
Investment Controlling AG, as the global custodian. The investment strategy complies with the legal 
guidelines and is rather conservative. Alternative investments and unhedged foreign currency positions 
are rare.
The benefits of the pension plans are substantially higher than the legal minimum. They are determined 
by the employer's and employee's contributions and interest granted on the plan members’ accumulated 
savings; the interest rate is determined annually by the governing body in accordance with the legal 
framework (defined contribution, as defined by the occupational pension law). The employee's and the 
employer's contributions are determined based on the insured salary and range from 1.25% to 15.5% of the 
insured salary depending on the age of the beneficiary. 
If an employee leaves the Hirslanden Group or the pension plans before reaching retirement age, legally 
they are to transfer the vested benefits to a new pension plan. On retirement, the participant may decide 
to withdraw the benefits as an annuity or a lump-sum.
As per the pension law in Switzerland, benefits provided by the pension funds are financed through annual 
contributions. If insufficient investment returns or actuarial losses lead to a funding gap, the governing 
body is legally obliged to take actions to close this gap within 5 years to a maximum of 7 years. Such 
actions may include additional contributions by the respective group companies and the beneficiaries. 
The current financial situation of the fund does not require such restructuring actions. None of the Group 
companies benefit from any plan surpluses. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 193 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group's Southern African operations have a post-retirement medical benefit obligation for employees

liability in the statement of financial position.
During the last valuation on 31 March 2017 a 8.65% (2016: 9.25%) medical inflation cost and a 9.60% (2016: 
10.25%) interest rate were assumed. The average retirement age was set at 63 years (2016: 63 years).

Effective interest rate swaps
In order to hedge specific exposures in the interest rate repricing profile of existing borrowings, the Group 
uses interest rate derivatives to generate the desired interest profile. At 31 March 2017, the Group had 
twelve effective interest rate swap contracts (31 March 2016: eight) for borrowings specifically in Southern 
Africa. The value of borrowings hedged by the interest rate derivatives and the rates applicable to these

Ineffective interest rate swaps
Due to the current negative interest rates in Switzerland, the hedge relationship in respect of the 3 month 
Swiss LIBOR interest rate swaps became ineffective since the interest on the borrowings is capped at a 
rate of 0% but is fully considered as interest payments on the swap. Hedge accounting discontinued from 
the date when hedge effectiveness could not be demonstrated, i.e. from 1 October 2014.

*  The impact of the following non-deductive expenses on the tax rate in the prior year was an increase of 4.2% (£10m): 
 –  Transaction costs in relation to the Al Noor transaction were not deductible for tax purposes as these costs are 
capital of nature. The tax effect of this amounted £8m which resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate.  
 – Non-deductible accelerated IFRS 2 charges increased the tax charge by £2m.  
**  The effect of different tax rates is mainly because of profit earned from South Africa which is subject to an income tax 
rate of 28%, reduced by profit earned from the UAE which is not subject to income tax. Compared to the comparative 
period, the effect of different tax rates increased mainly due to the proportional higher contribution by the Southern 
Africa operating segment and lower proportional contribution from the UAE.
***  A deferred tax asset of approximately £3m was recognised in respect of previously unrecognised assessed tax losses 
in South Africa due to improvements in local profitability.
The income tax liability includes an amount of approximately £3m (2016: £8m) relating to unresolved tax 
matters. The range of possible outcomes relating to this liability is not considered to be material. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 200 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accountants’ circular 02/2015 (Revised) ‘Headline Earnings’. The table below sets out a reconciliation of 
basic EPS and HEPS in accordance with that circular. Disclosure of HEPS is not a requirement of IFRS, 
but it is a commonly used measure of earnings in South Africa. The table below reconciles the profit for 
the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent to headline earnings and summarises the

Al Noor Hospitals Group plc
On 15 February 2016, Mediclinic completed the combination between Al Noor Hospitals Group plc and 
Mediclinic International Limited. The combination was classified as a reverse takeover. After the reverse 
takeover, the Group is considered to be one of the world’s leading international private healthcare groups, 
with deep operational expertise and a well-balanced geographic profile in Southern Africa, Switzerland, 
the United Arab Emirates and in the UK (through a minority stake in Spire). The purchase price allocation 
calculation has been finalised and retrospective adjustments have been made to the calculation (refer to 
footnote 2 on the next page). The transaction resulted in £1 203m (restated) goodwill being recognised. 
Goodwill represents the earnings potential of the established Al Noor business with a geographical 
footprint in Abu Dhabi as well as synergies from a combined business in the UAE and a skilled workforce 
assembled at the operating facilities.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 205 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  The value of the share element represents the equivalent fair value of the shares at date of acquisition 
that the acquirer (Mediclinic International Limited) would have issued to the shareholders of Al Noor 
Hospitals Group plc if equity instruments of the acquirer had to be issued.

  The fair value exercise over the opening balance sheet of Al Noor remained provisional at  
31 March 2016 as permitted by IFRS 3. During the year the Group has made progress to conform  
Al Noor’s commercial practices with the rest of the Group. For this reason the fair value of acquired 
trade and other receivables was adjusted to align with the Group’s policies. A fair value adjustments 
of £14m was made to the opening balance of trade and other receivables as a result of the 
finalisation of the purchase price allocation. This adjustment resulted in a change in the goodwill 
figure recorded in the prior year’s financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions were made in the purchase price allocation of the  
Al Noor acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The fair value of an asset or liability represents the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  
An independent valuer was used to assist in the valuation of Al Noor’s opening balance sheet. During 
the current year the purchase price allocation was finalised for the Al Noor acquisition and retrospective 
adjustments were made. Refer to the retrospective adjustments made above. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 206 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

35. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, are classified 
using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the valuation. The fair value 
hierarchy has the following levels:
• 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• 
Level 2 –   Input (other than quoted prices included within level 1) that is observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices)
• 
Level 3 – Input for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (unobservable input).

• 
Available-for-sale assets (part of other investments and loans): Fair value is based on appropriate 
valuation methodologies being discounted cash flow or actual net asset value of the investment. These 
assets are grouped as level 2.
• 
Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash 
flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates. Based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, the interest rate swaps and forward 
contracts are grouped as level 2.

and loans: Due to the expected short-term maturity of these financial instruments their carrying value 
approximate their fair value.
• 
Borrowings: The fair value of long-term borrowings is based on discounted cash flows using the 
effective interest rate method. As the interest rates of long-term borrowings are all market related, 
their carrying values approximate their fair value.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT – COMPANIES ACT 2006 OPINION
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
OTHER COMPANIES ACT 2006 REPORTING
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 220 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 129, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an  
assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, 
we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Mediclinic International plc for the year ended 
31 March 2017.

6. DIVIDENDS
The Company declared interim dividends for the 2016/17 period and final dividends for the 2015/16 period 
amounting to £62m. The Company paid £35m of these dividends, the remainder of £27m was paid by the 
Dividend Access Trust.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd, formed a Dividend 
Access Trust to comply with a South African Reserve Bank requirement that dividends from a South 
African source due to South African shareholders on the South African share register must be paid locally 
to avoid an outflow of funds from South Africa.
The beneficiaries of the trust are the South African shareholders of the Company who hold their shares via 
the South African share register on the relevant record date in respect of each distribution paid through 
the dividend access scheme. The Dividend Access Trust does not participate in any profits.
When a dividend is declared by the Company, the Dividend Access Trust would receive a dividend from 
Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd which in turn is paid over to the Company’s transfer secretaries 
in South Africa, who arrange for the payment of the relevant amount to the South African shareholders 
(the beneficiaries of the trust) through the usual dividend payment procedures, as if they were dividends 
received from Mediclinic International plc. T o the extent that the dividends due to South African shareholders 
are not ultimately funded from Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd, they receive those dividends as 
normal dividends from Mediclinic International plc. The South African shareholders’ entitlement to receive 
dividends declared by Mediclinic International plc is reduced by any amounts they receive via the trust.
Details on the final proposed dividend has been disclosed in note 28.7 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
7. BANK BORROWING
The Company obtained a short-term bridge facility of £400m of which £313m was drawn down on  
24 February 2016. This loan was fully repaid within this financial year. This loan incurred interest at variable 
rates linked to LIBOR with a minimum base rate of 1% plus 3.75%. The facility was secured in favour of 
lenders over the shares in Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd and of Mediclinic CHF Finco Limited, 
Mediclinic Middle East Holdings Limited and Mediclinic Holdings Netherlands B.V.

9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT RESERVE
Forfeitable Share Plan
The Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd Forfeitable Share Plan (“FSP”) was approved by the Company’s 
shareholders in July 2014 as a long-term incentive scheme for selected senior management (Executive 
Directors and prescribed officers). This share-based payment arrangement is accounted for as an equity-
settled share-based payment transaction. With the change in control and the acquisition of the Al 
Noor Hospitals Group Plc, the performance conditions of FSP have been finalised to the extent that the 
performance conditions were met as at 30 September 2015. The FSP shares will vest after the vesting 
period has lapsed.
Under the FSP, conditional share awards are granted to selected employees of the Group. The vesting of 
these shares is subject to continued employment and measured over a three-year period.
2017 2016
As at 1 April 2016 (2016: 1 January 2015) 239 290 – 
Amount of shares transferred from Mediclinic International (RF) (Pty) Ltd – 239 290
As at 31 March 239 290 239 290
A valuation has been determined and an expense recognised over a three-year period. The fair value of 
the TSR performance condition has been determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the 
fair value of the headline earning per share performance condition, consensus forecasts have been used. 
The following assumptions have been used to determine the fair value of the TSR performance condition:
2017 2016
Risk-free rate 7.49% 7.49%
Dividend yield 1.0% 1.0%
Volatility 20% 20%
Apart from the FSP, there are no other share option schemes in place. Therefore, no Director exercised 
any rights in relation to share option schemes during the reporting period. Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc 
Directors which exercised options before the acquisition date (15 February 2016) is regarded as a pre-
acquisition transaction in these Group financial statements.
10. TAXATION
At 31 March 2017, the Company had unutilised tax losses of approximately £33m (2016: £20m). No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses. MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 230 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

d) Liquidity risk

built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short, 
medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity 
risk by maintaining adequate reserves by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will be unable to meet its funding requirements. The table below 
summarises the maturity profile of the Company’s non-derivative financial liabilities. The contractual 
maturities of the financial liabilities have been determined on the basis of the remaining period at the end
