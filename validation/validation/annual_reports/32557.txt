love to work and shop
Our goal is to make our customers’ lives 
easier by offering great quality products and 
service at fair prices.
We offer customers choice across our wide range of food, general 
merchandise, clothing and financial services. On 2 September 2016 
we acquired Home Retail Group plc, the owner of Argos and Habitat, 
creating one of the UK’s leading food, general merchandise and

fast delivery networks. 
Sainsbury’s Bank offers accessible financial services products such 
as credit cards, insurance, travel money and personal loans that 
reward customer loyalty.
Our 195,000 colleagues, strong culture and values are integral to 
achieving our vision and driving our success – now and in the future. 
Food
Sainsbury’s has sold great quality food at 
fair prices since 1869. We have a strong

growing food markets where we can 
increase our market share, such as 
Food to Go and FreeFrom, where we 
can be a market leader.

02 Strategic Report The world is changing faster  
than at any time
Convenience, speed and flexibility are key  
in today’s retail environment. Our strategy 
is to sell products whenever and wherever 
customers want.
Our supermarkets offer customers a comprehensive mix of food, 
general merchandise and clothing. Our smaller convenience stores 
are located where our customers live and work, with a product mix 
designed for regular top-up shopping and to meet their day-to-
day needs. 
We have a well-established and growing online offer that allows 
customers to shop from the comfort of their home, or on the go via 
a mobile phone or tablet, opting for either convenient delivery to 
their home or to Click & Collect from our stores. 
Our acquisition of Home Retail Group plc has accelerated our 
strategy. Customers now have access to Argos products, market-
leading Argos digital channels and delivery systems. Argos’s 
unique Hub and Spoke supply chain network and Fast Track 
delivery and collection service are points of competitive advantage.

model
How we create value and build customer loyalty
We achieve this by listening to our customers and anticipating their 
needs. We deliver quality products and great value through multiple 
channels and are there for our customers whenever and wherever 
they want to shop. 
Our values make us different and underpin everything we do, from 
sourcing with integrity to helping our customers lead healthier 
lives and providing a great place to work. Our colleagues make the 
difference, anchoring us in our communities and connecting us to 
the lives of our customers, day in, day out.
Power of the Sainsbury’s Group 
We are one of the largest retailers of quality food, general merchandise, 
clothing and financial services in the UK and we believe people 
trust the Sainsbury’s brand. Customers can shop with us whenever 
and wherever they want and we have a logistics network that gives 
us market-leading product availability in-store and online. 
A great place to work
Sourcing with integrity
Respect for our environment
Living healthier lives
Making a positive difference 
to our community
Our values key
Our business model is designed to create 
value for our shareholders, customers and 
colleagues, both now and in the future.
Supply chain
Our business is built on excellent, often long-standing relationships with our 
suppliers. We source Sainsbury’s branded products from the UK and over 70 
other countries, according to the ability of suppliers to meet our regularly audited 
quality, safety and ethical standards. The investment we make in our farmer 
and grower Development Groups, R&D programme and Apprenticeship Scheme 
supports the British agricultural sector and encourages young talent into British 
farming. We are also the world’s largest retailer of fairly traded products. 
Logistics
We have invested in our logistics capability and capacity to ensure we can meet 
our customers’ requirements for flexible, convenient shopping now and in the 
future. Across Sainsbury’s and Argos we operate 34 distribution centres. They 
cover our store and online businesses, across food, general merchandise and 
clothing, making home and store deliveries seven days per week. Argos’s unique 
Hub and Spoke logistics network enables us to fulfil Fast Track same day deliveries 
– to a customer’s home or to a store for collection.
Channels
Customer shopping habits are changing and our multi-channel proposition 
gives people the flexibility to shop with us whenever and wherever they want. 
We have over 2,200 supermarkets, convenience stores and Argos stores across 
the UK and Ireland and we have made it easy and convenient to shop on the go 
using our mobile apps. In fact, almost 20 per cent of Sainsbury’s Group sales now 
originate online. We have General Merchandise & Clothing businesses of scale 
and Sainsbury’s Bank is a growing, strategic part of our business.
What makes us different
We are a multi-product, multi-channel 
business with a strong, differentiated  
food proposition and respected brands 
in Sainsbury’s, Sainsbury’s Bank, Argos  
and Habitat. 
We benefit from a structurally 
advantaged store estate, world-class 
property assets, an efficient supply 
chain and a market-leading digital 
presence with fast delivery networks. 
All this is underpinned by customer 
insights that enable us to adapt our 
business to customers’ changing lives.

Quality
Selling great quality food has 
been at the heart of our business 
since 1869. Customers value 
the wide range of products and 
services on offer when they 
shop with Sainsbury’s and this 
differentiates us. Most of our 
customers buy Sainsbury’s 
branded products, which account 
for around half of our food 
sales. We recently invested in 
the quality of 3,000 Sainsbury’s 
branded food lines and have 
moved on to the next stage of our 
quality improvement programme. 
Our passion for quality extends to 
everything we sell – food, general 
merchandise, clothing and 
financial services.
Value
Offering great quality products 
and services at fair prices is 
part of our commitment to 
help our customers live well 
for less. Quality and price are 
both important in the value 
proposition and our regular 
lower prices reassure customers 
that they can always get good 
value at Sainsbury’s. We will 
always be competitive on price 
and will continue to invest in 
lowering prices and improving 
quality to ensure that we are 
well-positioned to meet the 
challenges of an increasingly 
competitive marketplace.
Service
In shops, depots and store 
support centres, our colleagues 
provide award-winning service 
day in, day out, offering 
customers choice, flexibility 
and convenience whenever and 
wherever they want to shop 
with us. We employ around 
195,000 colleagues who are 
the foundation of our business 
and make a real difference in 
the communities they serve. 
We take pride in the service we 
offer and our well-run shops 
and committed, well-trained 
colleagues have helped us win 
the Grocer Gold Awards for both 
Customer Service and Availability 
for the past four years. 
Choice
We are one of the UK’s 
largest retailers, with over 
90,000 products to choose 
from across food, general 
merchandise, clothing and 
financial services. Shopping for 
an evening meal, party dress, 
cookware or car insurance 
has never been easier at 
Sainsbury’s. Customers can 
choose between well-known 
food brands and our extensive 
own-brand differentiated food 
offer. In homeware, cookware 
and electrical products, 
customers now have an even 
wider choice of products, 
across Sainsbury’s, Argos  
and Habitat.

 05 Strategic Report Market 
context
The market
The UK economy has been stronger than 
anticipated since the European Union 
Referendum in June 2016. Conditions have 
remained supportive for UK consumers, 
with wage growth remaining higher than 
inflation. Consistent with recent years, 
the main beneficiaries of these conditions 
have been higher ticket discretionary 
categories such as eating out, car sales 
and holidays.
However, the picture is changing now, as the impact of 
the devaluation of sterling and a higher oil price filter 
through to food, general merchandise, clothing and 
fuel prices and the gap between inflation and wage 
growth narrows. 
After more than two years of deflation, food and 
fuel prices started to rise towards the end of our 
financial year, driven by the devaluation of sterling and 
commodity price increases. While this has benefited food 
retail market growth, general merchandise and clothing 
sales growth have been impacted by reduced consumer 
confidence and a marked slowdown in real pay growth. 
Economic commentators are divided on the implications 
for the UK economy, but there are fears that this 
slowdown in real income might drive a reduction in GDP 
growth, an increase in unemployment and a reduction in 
the rate of unsecured credit growth.
Customer shopping habits and the UK 
retail landscape continue to change 
rapidly. Our strategy reflects this and our 
business is well set to continue adapting 
to changing customer needs.

06 Strategic Report Shopping habits
Shopping habits continue to evolve 
rapidly, with consumers expecting far 
greater choice and flexibility in how, 
when and where they shop for food, 
general merchandise and clothing.
The UK grocery market remains very competitive. 
Convenience stores and online retail continue to show 
strong growth, as consumers shop more frequently 
across different channels and store formats. Discount 
food retailers continue to open significant numbers of 
new stores and gain market share, but at lower rates than 
in recent years. In line with our expectations, these trends 
place pressure on volumes through the supermarket 
format. However, we continue to expect supermarkets 
to remain the key channel for groceries.
Within general merchandise and clothing, traditional 
store formats, particularly on the high street, continue 
to see footfall and sales declines as online participation 
grows. The combination of a strong online proposition 
and a wide variety of delivery and collection options is 
popular with consumers, with Click & Collect accounting 
for a significant and growing proportion of UK online 
general merchandise and clothing sales.
Future retail trends
Consumers will increasingly expect a seamless, flexible 
retail offer across all products and channels, to fulfil their 
orders rapidly in a location and at a time that is most 
convenient to them. 
Addressing a changing 
marketplace
As our customers’ lives change, so will our business. 
To address the changing marketplace and changing 
shopping patterns we have prioritised four key areas of 
our business where we can differentiate ourselves, grow 
and create value. These priorities are: to further enhance 
our differentiated food proposition; to grow General 
Merchandise and Clothing and deliver synergies by 
integrating Argos; to diversify and grow Sainsbury’s Bank; 
and to continue to cut costs and maintain our balance 
sheet strength.
  To read more about the progress we are making 
against these priorities please see pages 15 to 23

 07 Strategic Report This year has been an important year 
in the history of Sainsbury’s. Our primary 
responsibility as a Board is to create 
value for shareholders in a sustainable 
way over the medium and long term and 
we have taken significant steps this year 
in delivering this objective.
Chairman’s 
Letter
08 Strategic Report Food is at the heart of our business. We 
continue to improve the quality and ranging 
of our grocery offer and with great products 
at fair prices, we have a clearly differentiated 
proposition in an increasingly competitive 
market. With the acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc, owner of Argos (including Argos 
Financial Services) and Habitat, we have 
created one of the UK’s leading retailers in 
food, general merchandise, clothing and 
financial services providing customers with 
a choice, breadth and quality of product 
whenever and wherever they shop with us. 
We have also successfully implemented a 
new banking platform and introduced new 
products and services at Sainsbury’s Bank 
which are generating increased customer 
demand. 
These changes are all in line with the 
five pillars of the strategy we outlined in 
November 2014 (see page 11). By knowing our 
customers well and anticipating what they 
want, we will help to make their lives easier 
every day and achieve our vision of being the 
most trusted retailer where people love to 
work and shop. 
In the competitive market conditions of the 
last 12 months, underlying profit before tax, 
which includes the Argos contribution from 
2 September 2016, was £581 million, down 
one per cent. Underlying basic earnings per 
share were down 9.9 per cent to 21.8 pence 
per share. The last three years have been 
challenging for grocery retailers and the full 
impact of the vote to leave the European 
Union remains uncertain. However, we are 
pleased with the resilience of our business 
and the progress we are making with our 
strategy against this backdrop. 
Acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc
In September, we completed the acquisition 
of Home Retail Group plc – owner of Argos 
and Habitat. Putting aside cash and store 
card receivables (which can be converted 
to cash), we purchased the business for 
an effective cash consideration of £156 
million. We believe this will prove to be a 
very economic acquisition of a valuable 
asset. The acquisition has accelerated our 
strategy, allowing us to offer our customers 
choice and convenience across food, general 
merchandise, clothing and financial services. 
Argos is making great progress, delivering 
strong like-for-like growth of 4.1 per cent in 
the six months since the acquisition. We also 
see a sales increase of between one to two 
per cent in Sainsbury’s supermarkets with 
an Argos Digital store. We are confident that 
we will achieve the £160 million of annual 
synergies we outlined at the time of the 
transaction six months ahead of schedule.
Dividend
We are committed to paying an affordable 
dividend to our shareholders and have fixed 
dividend cover at two times cover. We are 
therefore recommending a final dividend of 
6.6 pence per share, making the proposed full-
year dividend 10.2 pence per share. This brings 
our dividend payments over the last five years 
to 69.5 pence per share, equivalent to £1.4 
billion of cash paid to our shareholders. 
Management and colleagues
Mike Coupe leads a highly talented and 
experienced management team. In September 
2016, following the acquisition of Argos, we 
appointed John Rogers, previously Chief 
Financial Officer, as the Chief Executive 
of Sainsbury’s Argos, where he has put 
together a strong leadership team from both 
Argos and Sainsbury’s. In January, we were 
delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial 
Officer, Kevin O’Byrne, to the Company. 
Kevin has a wealth of retail and financial 
experience in executive leadership roles at 
Dixons, Kingfisher and Poundland and a 
track record of growing businesses. Finally, 
we were very pleased to welcome Simon 
Roberts as Retail and Operations Director. 
Previously President of Boots, I am sure 
Simon will make a significant contribution to 
our business, with his strong customer focus 
and extensive retail experience. 
Our Sainsbury’s store colleagues provide 
industry-leading service to customers every 
day and we have been awarded the Grocer 
Gold Awards for both Customer Service 
and Availability for the past four years. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our colleagues for their commitment 
and enthusiasm over the last year. We were 
pleased to increase the standard rate of pay 
of Sainsbury’s store colleagues by four per 
cent this year, the same rate as last year 
and well above the National Living Wage. 
In addition, colleagues across the Group will 
share a bonus of £78 million this year.
As we announced in March, Mary Harris will 
step down as a Non-Executive Director at 
our AGM in July 2017 . I would like to thank 
Mary for her extremely valuable contribution 
to Sainsbury’s over the past nine years and 
particularly for her skilful leadership of the 
Remuneration Committee. We expect to 
announce the appointment of a new Non-
Executive Director in due course. Susan Rice, 
our Senior Independent Director, is appointed 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Outlook
The retail market remains very competitive. 
However, I am convinced that we have 
the right strategy in place to meet future 
opportunities and challenges. With our 
talented leadership team and highly engaged 
and committed colleagues, we are well 
placed to navigate the external environment 
and to create value for shareholders.
David Tyler
Chairman
 09 Strategic Report Chief 
Executive’s 
Letter
The world is changing faster than ever before, 
shaping the way our customers live their lives. 
Growth of shopping via digital channels and 
customer expectations of speed and convenience 
are changing the retail industry. To meet these 
challenges, we will continue to adapt and evolve 
our business to meet new shopping habits and 
provide customers with great products and 
services at fair prices whenever and wherever 
they want to shop with us.
10 Strategic Report This has been a pivotal year for Sainsbury’s. 
The strategy we set out in November 
2014 was designed to address a changing 
marketplace and the investments we 
have made in our core Food business 
differentiated us through our combination 
of quality, choice and value. We will continue 
to enhance our food proposition further and 
to grow our General Merchandise, Clothing 
and Financial Services businesses. We 
welcomed 30,000 colleagues to our business 
in September when we acquired Home Retail 
Group plc – owner of Argos and Habitat. 
The acquisition will accelerate our strategy 
and gives us a strong platform to deliver 
synergies and future growth. 
The retail market remains very competitive. 
Underlying profit before tax for the Group 
is £581 million, down one per cent, and Group 
sales are £29,112 million, up 12.7 per cent on 
last year. These numbers reflect the positive 
contribution made by Argos to the Group. 
Sainsbury’s market share dropped by 23 basis 
points to 16.3 per cent and, while like-for-like 
sales are down 0.6 per cent, this is an 
improvement on last year, demonstrating 
the resilience of our Food business in a 
competitive market. Profits at Sainsbury’s 
continue to be impacted by ongoing price 
investment and cost price pressures.
Our balance sheet is robust and we are 
managing costs carefully. We are on track to 
achieve our current cost saving target of £500 
million by 2017/18 and we have committed 
to a further three-year cost saving target 
of £500 million from 2018/19. Net debt has 
reduced by £349 million this year. Consistent 
with our affordable dividend policy, this year’s 
final dividend is 6.6 pence per share, bringing 
the full-year dividend to 10.2 pence per share.
A pivotal year
Our goal is to make our customers’ lives 
easier every day by offering great quality 
products and services at fair prices. Food 
is at the heart of what we do and we have 
completed our programme to improve the 
quality of 3,000 food lines that matter most 
to our customers. We are now reviewing 125 
food categories, touching around 60 per cent 
of our food range, to further develop our food 
quality and value.
When we acquired Argos and Habitat in 
September, we became one of the UK’s 
leading food, general merchandise, clothing 
and financial services retailers – a multi-
product, multi-channel business that offers 
our customers more choice and gives us the 
capability to serve them with even greater 
speed and convenience. 
Sainsbury’s Bank is a great asset to the Group 
and played a key part in the acquisition 
by enabling us to finance the deal in a 
very cost efficient way. Sainsbury’s Bank 
reached a major milestone this year when we 
successfully transferred savings customers 
and our ATM estate on to our newly built, 
wholly-owned banking platform. We 
continue to make good progress and will 
introduce our new loans platform by the end 
of 2017. This gives Sainsbury’s Bank a solid 
base from which to grow. We also offer an 
enhanced range of products and services, 
such as a choice of home and car insurance 
options with our new panel of insurers 
and our new mortgage proposition which 
launched in April 2017.
This has been a pivotal year 
for Sainsbury’s. The strategy 
we set out in November 2014 
was designed to address 
a changing marketplace 
and the investments we 
have made in our core 
Food business mean we 
are clearly differentiated 
by our combination of 
quality, choice and value.”

Our Business Strategy
 11 Strategic Report The new Sainsbury’s Group 
We are building a business for now and 
the future. We go forward as a combined 
Sainsbury’s Group, strengthened by the 
addition of Argos, Habitat and Sainsbury’s 
Bank. We benefit from the trust customers 
have in our brands and from the ability to 
offer our customers great value and choice 
across multiple product categories and 
channels. We are well placed to increase 
customer loyalty across food, general 
merchandise, clothing and financial services, 
driving sales, profit and maximising the 
opportunities for growth to create value 
for all our stakeholders.
To focus on our four key priorities we have 
closed Netto, Sainsbury’s Entertainment and 
our Phone Shops.
Four key priorities for growth
Our strategy remains based on five pillars 
(see page 11). Within this we have prioritised 
four key areas of our business where we can 
differentiate ourselves, grow and create value: 
1 Further enhance our  
differentiated food offer
We continue to invest in our core Food 
business and to focus on the quality of 
Sainsbury’s branded food products. We have 
removed multi-buy promotions across our 
food ranges in favour of lower regular prices 
and we invest in our prices to ensure we offer 
customers value for money. We will always 
be competitive on price.
Sainsbury’s has a strong heritage of 
innovation in key products and categories. 
For example, we were the first retailer of 
organic produce in the UK. We continue to 
innovate, targeting growing food categories 
where we can increase our market share, 
such as Food to Go and Free From, where we 
can build on the trust customers have in the 
Sainsbury’s brand to develop and strengthen 
our offer and become a market leader. 
We regularly review the layouts of our stores 
so that customers can do their shopping 
with us quickly and more conveniently. We 
are investing in our Groceries Online service, 
improving the customer experience on our 
website and expanding our Click & Collect 
service. Demonstrating the speed of change 
within retail, the Groceries Online shopping 
app we launched in May 2016 now accounts 
for over ten per cent of online food orders.
2 Grow General Merchandise & 
Clothing and deliver synergies
Sainsbury’s General Merchandise business 
is well-established and growing. We are 
focused on developing complementary, 
clearly defined general merchandise ranges 
across Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat, 
offering our customers the best choice and 
quality at fair prices.
Our Tu clothing business provides high street 
style at supermarket prices and eight million 
customers buy our clothing. Our market 
share by volume increased by 20 basis points 
and we are the sixth largest clothing retailer 
by volume in the UK, with a strong position 
in womenswear and childrenswear and 
opportunities for future growth in menswear. 
We are integrating Argos in to our business 
at pace. The 59 Argos Digital stores located 
in Sainsbury’s supermarkets are performing 
well and sales in stores open for more than a 
year are delivering like-for-like sales increases 
of between 20 and 30 per cent. Reflecting 
the strong performance of the Argos Digital 
stores, we are accelerating our plans to open 
the planned 250 Argos Digital stores six 
months ahead of schedule. 
Our 207 digital collection points offer 
customers a fast, convenient delivery 
service across eBay, DPD, Tu clothing and, 
in 90 stores customers can also collect Argos 
deliveries. This gives customers the flexibility 
to pick-up their parcels when it is convenient 
to them and drives footfall in to our 
supermarkets. 
18 per cent of Group sales at peak times now 
originate online and our strength in digital, 
combined with Argos’s leading delivery 
services, including Fast Track, will enable us 
to grow both now and in the future and give 
us a crucial competitive advantage.
3 Diversify and grow Sainsbury’s Bank
Sainsbury’s Bank continues to grow and 
generates strong customer loyalty. We know 
that people who buy our financial services 
products shop with us more frequently and 
spend more money than those who do not, 
giving us a strong platform for growth. We 
have integrated Argos Financial Services in 
to Sainsbury’s Bank. There is opportunity for 
this to give us a significant boost in customer 
base and operations and we are injecting 
additional capital in areas of Sainsbury’s 
Bank which will generate good returns. 
Sainsbury’s Bank is well set to deliver strong 
profit growth.
The market remains very 
competitive and the impact 
of cost price pressures 
remains uncertain. However, 
we are well placed to 
navigate the external 
environment and remain 
focused on delivering our 
strategy.”  
Mike Coupe Chief Executive Officer, 
J Sainsbury plc
12 Strategic Report 4 Continue cost savings and maintain 
balance sheet strength
In line with other UK retailers, we anticipate 
that cost pressures will continue over the 
next few years. The price of raw materials 
and energy is increasing, along with wages 
and business rates. Across our business we 
are focused on finding ways to mitigate the 
impact of these rising costs so that we can 
continue to deliver for customers, colleagues 
and shareholders. 
We remain focused on cost reduction and 
efficiency. By the end of 2017/18 we will 
have delivered £500 million of cost savings 
in three years across our business and we 
are committed to a further £500 million 
reduction over the next three years, starting 
in 2018/19. 
This focus will allow us to continue to invest 
in our business and our colleagues, as well as 
provide our shareholders with a return on the 
investment they have made in Sainsbury’s.
Our values
As a major retailer, in a highly competitive 
industry, our values differentiate us from 
our competitors, make strong commercial 
sense and enable us to play a leading role in 
tackling some of the challenges facing our 
customers every day. Our values enable us 
to be more efficient in our own operations, 
for example, by using less electricity in our 
stores and also by protecting security of 
supply in our supply chain. Through our 
living healthier lives commitments we are 
also making it easier for our customers to 
make healthier choices through product 
reformulation and innovation. We are also 
helping customers to save money and 
reduce household food waste through our 
five-year Waste less, Save more initiative. 
This is now being rolled out to more than 
140 communities across the UK. As well as 
building trust among our customers, we 
know our values help to make Sainsbury’s 
a great place to work.
We are optimistic about  
the future
Our success relies on knowing our customers 
better than anyone else. We must offer them 
what they want now and anticipate what 
they will want in the future, across food, 
general merchandise, clothing and financial 
services. As we grow we will become a bigger 
part of our customers’ lives and find more 
ways to save them time and money, offering 
them the same great quality at fair prices that 
has been the core of what we do since 1869.
I would like to thank the 195,000 colleagues 
from across the Group for the market-leading 
service they deliver and the difference they 
make to our customers every day. Together 
with the values that underpin our business, 
they differentiate us from our competitors 
and I am pleased that colleagues across 
the Group will share in this year’s bonus of 
£78 million.
The market remains very competitive and 
the impact of cost price pressures remains 
uncertain. However, we are well placed to 
navigate the external environment and 
remain focused on delivering our strategy.

food proposition
Priority #1
Food will always be at the 
heart of our business. 
We have a strong and differentiated food 
proposition that offers customers market-
leading quality, choice and value. We have 
now completed our 3,000 Sainsbury’s 
own-brand product quality investment 
programme and will continue to make 
quality improvements where they matter 
most to our customers. Over the course of 
the next year, we will review 125 food ranges, 
touching around 60 per cent of our food 
sales. Customers continue to rank us ahead 
of our supermarket peers for food quality
1
.
Great quality at fair prices
Our Food business is resilient. While the 
grocery retailing market remains competitive, 
investment in the quality and price of our 
core by Sainsbury’s range delivered volume 
growth of two per cent. Our strategic focus is 
on growing categories where we can increase 
market share such as Deliciously FreeFrom, 
our new On the Go range and prepared 
vegetables. In September, we launched our 
On the Go range of breakfast, lunch and 
snacking lines. It is a market worth around 
£16 billion and we invested £8 million in our 
range, introducing new sandwich and bread 
options, salads and sushi. We also increased 
the number of breakfast and snacking options 
on offer, as well as improving existing lines. 
Snacking, in particular, has performed well.
The successful launch of our Deliciously 
FreeFrom range reflected the increasing 
importance of allergen-free food to our 
customers. Around 25 per cent of the UK 
population includes free from products in 
their weekly shop
2
. We have doubled the 
new range, incorporating fresh, frozen, 
chilled and ambient lines, offering customers 
more variety, improved products and 
market-leading allergen information on 
the packaging. We also became the only 
supermarket to offer gluten-free bread 
freshly baked in our store bakeries. The range 
has proved very popular and we sell nearly 
12,000 loaves a week. 
Our innovative prepared vegetable range has 
been a great success with customers who 
are increasingly looking for filling, healthy 
alternatives to carbohydrates and want to 
introduce more vegetables in to their diet. 
We responded to last year’s demand for 
courgetti (courgette spaghetti) and boodles 
(butternut squash noodles) by introducing 
eight more prepared vegetable lines this 
year, including first-to-market vegetable 
lasagne sheets and butternut squash waffles. 
These innovative new lines have helped drive 
double-digit year-on-year growth for the 
prepared vegetables category.
We continue to develop our overall food 
offer to ensure customers can buy great 
quality food at Sainsbury’s for different 
shopping missions. Our in-store sushi 
concessions are all performing well and offer 
customers something new to try when they 
visit our stores. 
As a major retailer, in a highly competitive 
industry, our values make us different and 
make strong commercial sense. Our values 
help us strengthen relationships with all our 
stakeholders, build trust, reduce operating 
costs, mitigate risks and attract and retain 
talent in a crowded marketplace. Our values 
also enable us to play a leading role in tackling 
some of the challenges facing our customers 
every day such as household food waste.
To help our customers live healthier lives we 
have reduced the sugar in our cereal range 
by an average of 13 per cent, exceeding the 
Government’s 2017 targets of a five per cent 
reduction. We also removed more than three 
tonnes of salt from our canned corned beef 
products without impacting taste or flavour. 
All our products are sourced with integrity 
and this year we were proud to be named 
the World’s Best Sustainable Seafood 
Supermarket by the Marine Stewardship 
Council. We sold over £490 million of RSPCA-
assured products this year and worked with 
our Dairy Development Group to reduce the 
need for certain classes of antibiotics, leading 
to a voluntary withdrawal.

Sales growth – Food
Food is our core business but growing 
our Clothing, General Merchandising and 
Financial Services businesses is an important 
part of our strategy. We know that our 
customers value greater choice and that 
there is a firm correlation between increased 
loyalty and spend across our whole offer 
when customers buy into these categories.

 15 Strategic Report Sales in our Groceries Online channel grew by 
over eight per cent and orders increased by 
nearly 12 per cent during the year. We deliver 
around 276,000 orders per week. We expect 
that demand for our online grocery service 
in London will double over the next eight 
years and to help meet that growing demand 
we opened our first purpose-built online 
fulfilment centre in Bromley-by-Bow, East 
London. With its cutting-edge technology, 
it has the capacity to fulfil 25,000 customer 
orders each week. We now have 151 Groceries 
Online Click & Collect sites and a growing 
number of our customers place their order 
online and collect their shopping at their local 
supermarket. To add to customer choice, we 
offer same-day delivery from 29 stores across 
the UK and are trialling one hour delivery 
to over 40,000 London postcodes through 
our Chop Chop bicycle delivery service. We 
introduced our Groceries Online app in 2016 
to give customers more ways to shop with 
us. Penetration is steadily increasing, with 
over ten per cent of orders received through 
the app, demonstrating the rapidly changing 
nature of customer shopping behaviour. 
Leading customer service
Our colleagues continue to deliver market-
leading customer service and we won 17 
weekly Grocer 33 Awards this year
4
. In 
addition, for the past four years we have 
won the Grocer Gold Awards for Service and 
Availability and we continue to exceed our 
Mystery Shopper internal targets.
3  The number of convenience stores stated includes our 
partnership with Euro Garages.
4 Grocer 33 for 52 weeks to 11 March.
Demonstrating our respect for our 
environment we now use nearly 12 per cent 
less electricity than we did in 2005, despite 
growing store space by over 54 per cent. 
Also since 2005, we have reduced packaging 
across Sainsbury’s branded ranges by almost 
33 per cent and we continue to work towards 
our target of a 50 per cent reduction by 2020. 
This year marked a significant milestone 
on food waste, as we moved to transparent 
reporting – one of only two major retailers 
to do so and we have set a clear benchmark 
against which we can measure progress. We 
completed a trial of Waste less, Save more, 
our five-year initiative to help our customers 
tackle household food waste in Swadlincote, 
Derbyshire, with 20 intervention trials. 
These trials ranged from apps to weigh and 
report on food waste to pioneering school 
programmes to engage young people on 
the issue.
In addition to providing excellent customer 
service, our colleagues are committed to 
making a positive difference to our 
community. In 2016/17, we generated over 
£53 million for charities through the efforts of 
our colleagues and customers. This includes 
nearly £12 million raised through our support 
of Comic Relief’s Red Nose Day.
We aim to be a company where people 
love to work and our colleagues are integral 
to the success of our business. We offer a 
competitive rewards package, including paid 
breaks, colleague discount and pension. This 
year, colleagues across the Group will share 
a bonus of £78 million. 
Serving customers whenever 
and wherever they want
A key part of our strategy is to be available to 
our customers whenever and wherever they 
want to shop with us. As at the end of this 
financial year we have 605 supermarkets and 
806 convenience stores
3
. Supermarket sales 
declined nearly two per cent and sales at our 
convenience stores grew by over six per cent. 
Supermarkets continue to be the main 
grocery shopping channel, responsible for 
over half of the grocery spend in the UK, and 
we expect this to remain the case. We are 
adapting our space and layouts to reflect 
customer requirements for convenience, 
flexibility, speed and choice. Supermarket 
shoppers can take advantage of extensive 
food ranges, Grocery Click & Collect services 
and in-store cafes and restaurants.
Our Convenience business grew by over 
six per cent and we opened 41 new shops 
including trials of seven franchises in Euro 
Garages’ petrol station forecourts.
Sales growth
Customers are choosing to shop across 
channels and are using convenience 
and online more frequently, leading to a 
decline in supermarket sales. It is therefore 
important that we invest strategically so 
that we can serve our customers whenever, 
however and wherever they want.

& Clothing and deliver synergies
General Merchandise
Sainsbury’s General Merchandise sales 
grew by over two per cent. We increased 
our market share by both volume and value 
driven by seasonal events such as Christmas 
and Halloween by offering design-led, 
ethically-sourced homeware products that 
are accessible to everyone. The ranges are 
updated every eight to ten weeks, at prices 
that are significantly better value than high 
street stores and homeware specialists. 
On-trend, in-house designed ranges and 
classic designs such as Harvest, Shore 
and Blue Daisy, displayed in an attractive 
department store-style setting, have proved 
to be very popular with our customers.
Clothing
Shopping for clothing in supermarkets has 
become firmly established and our strategy 
of offering customers high street style at 
supermarket prices has helped to increase 
our sales by over four per cent in the year 
and to outperform a challenging market. 
Eight million customers buy our Tu clothing. 
Our market share by volume increased by 
20 basis points and we are the sixth largest 
clothing retailer by volume in the UK
5
, with 
a strong position in the womenswear and 
childrenswear markets and opportunities for 
future growth in menswear. 
We launched our Tu Premium womenswear 
collection in September, offering our 
customers quality styling and fabrics 
that rival high street fashion brands, at 
significantly lower prices. The range has been 
well received by our customers with standout 
performers such as our women’s leather biker 
jacket at £95 and a silk blouse at £30.

Acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc
Our acquisition of Home Retail Group plc 
in September 2016 created a £6 billion 
General Merchandise and Clothing business. 
This made us one of the UK’s largest food, 
general merchandise, clothing and financial 
services retailers, with over 90,000 products 
across 2,200 stores. The deal was financially 
compelling and makes clear strategic sense.
Priority #2
Argos is the UK’s number one retailer for 
toys and a market leader in homeware and 
electrical products. With around one billion 
hits a year, Argos is the third most visited 
retail website in the UK and over half of all 
Argos’s sales originate online. The first UK 
retailer to achieve £1 billion annual sales 
online, Argos was also the first to achieve 
£1 billion sales through mobile devices. The 
unique Hub and Spoke supply chain network 
offers customers a wide choice of quick, 
efficient delivery options – Fast Tracked to 
their home the same day, or for collection at 
Argos and participating Sainsbury’s stores. 
Argos is performing well both commercially 
and operationally, with strong results during 
the Black Friday and Christmas periods. With 
10 million webpage visits on the day, 65 per 
cent of Black Friday sales were initiated 
online. Nearly 100,000 Fast Track deliveries 
were made over that weekend alone. There 
were over 120 million visits to the Argos 
website in the run up to Christmas, an 
increase of over nine per cent. 
There are now 59 Argos Digital stores in our 
supermarkets and they are performing well. 
Sales at stores that have been open for over 
a year are delivering like-for-like sales growth 
of between 20 to 30 per cent. There is also a 
clear sales uplift of between one to two per 
cent in Sainsbury’s stores where there is an 
Argos Digital store.
Customer satisfaction scores at our Argos 
stores are at their highest levels ever and 
digital remains a key differentiator. In 2017/18 
we plan to transform 60 existing Argos high 
street stores to a new digital format, meaning 
that over a third of the Argos store estate will 
be digital in a year’s time.
We also have 207 digital collection points 
where customers can collect their Tu clothing, 
eBay and DPD orders conveniently. Over 
700,000 parcels have been collected to date. 
Argos orders can be collected at 90 of these 
collection points. 
We now have seven Mini Habitat stores to 
date in Sainsbury’s supermarkets, to support 
Habitat’s multi-channel business strategy. 
Synergies
The opportunity to deliver £160 million of 
EBITDA synergies over three years was a 
key factor in our decision to acquire Home 
Retail Group plc. The synergies identified at 
the time of the deal included the integration 
of central and store support functions 
across the two businesses, as well as cost 
savings from opening Argos Digital stores 
in Sainsbury’s supermarkets. This year 
we have achieved £7 million of synergies. 
The integration of Argos and Sainsbury’s is 
happening at pace. Our retail expertise and 
experience of delivering change programmes 
in our stores has enabled us to accelerate 
the roll-out of 250 Argos Digital stores in 
Sainsbury’s supermarkets. We now expect 
this roll-out, together with our £160 million 
synergy target, to be achieved by March 2019, 
six months ahead of schedule.
Sales growth
Food is our core business but growing 
our General Merchandising, Clothing and 
Financial Services businesses is an important 
part of our strategy. We know that our 
customers value greater choice and that 
there is a firm correlation between increased 
loyalty and spend across our whole offer 
when customers buy into these categories.

Priority #3
Sainsbury’s Bank is a 
growing and profitable part 
of our business and a key 
strategic asset. 
Our vision is to be the destination bank for 
Sainsbury’s customers, listening to what they 
want and designing products, offers and 
services that meet their needs. We recently 
launched an innovative mortgage product, 
which introduced a money off reward on 
shopping, and is a strong channel to grow our 
assets and customer base in both mortgages 
and savings. 
Offering our customers complementary 
financial services products encourages loyalty 
across all our businesses – when customers 
take out a Bank product we see that they 
go on to spend more with us. Since taking 
full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank, we have 
embarked on a programme to transition our 
banking services on to our own infrastructure. 
We successfully migrated savings customers 
and ATMs to our new banking platforms 
during the year. We continue to make good 
progress and will introduce our new loans 
platform by the end of 2017 . 
Sainsbury’s Bank, including Argos Financial 
Services, achieved £62 million underlying 
profit. Sainsbury’s Bank profits declined 
nearly five per cent due to the impact of 
reduced interchange fees and investment 
required to enter the mortgage market. 
Sainsbury’s Bank has 1.8 million active 
customers, up nearly four per cent. 
Additionally, Argos Financial Services 
has 1.8 million customers. We take our 
responsibilities as a lender of consumer credit 
very seriously and saw strong growth in 
personal lending, with ten per cent year-on-
year growth in the number of advances to 
new personal loan customers.
We offered Sainsbury’s customers a strong 
range of credit cards throughout the year 
with the incentive of additional Nectar points. 
This resulted in a 70 per cent growth year-
on-year in new card accounts and a six per 
cent year-on-year increase in our credit cards 
being used in Sainsbury’s stores. We are 
regularly featured as a best buy credit card 
throughout the year.
In line with our strong lending performance, 
savings accounts grew by almost 60 per 
cent year-on-year with a strong performance 
across fixed term, easy access and ISA 
products. 
Our growth in customer lending and 
continued investment in the transition 
programme saw our Tier 1 capital ratio 
decrease to 13.3 per cent which remains 
comfortably above regulatory requirements. 
Capital and liquidity plans are robust and 
support future growth in secured and 
unsecured lending. 
In the last quarter, we launched new home 
and car insurance products. Our new 
products provide quotes from a bespoke 
panel of specially selected insurers, giving 
a greater number of Sainsbury’s customers 
more competitive pricing. In addition, we 
are rewarding Nectar card customers with 
a guaranteed discount on their insurance 
premium. 
We saw strong growth in travel money with 
transactions up 25 per cent year-on-year, 
despite market volatility and the impact of 
the vote to leave the European Union. We 
opened a further 26 Travel Money bureaux 
across the UK, taking our estate to 232 
bureaux. We have also successfully launched 
our new pre-paid travel money card which 
offers contactless functionality and no 
ATM fees. 
Our ‘free-to-use’ ATM estate grew by five 
per cent to 1,728 in the year and ATM 
transactions grew by almost one per cent 
year-on-year to nearly 240 million. This 
represents a significant UK market share with 
£1 for every £11 dispensed from a LINK ATM 
transaction coming from Sainsbury’s Bank. 
In September 2016 the Bank played a key 
role in the acquisition of Home Retail Group 
plc, successfully detailing full UK Regulatory 
permission and expanding the Bank’s 
savings portfolio which provided around £500 
million of funding for the transaction. The 
integration of Sainsbury’s Bank with Argos 
Financial Services will be phased, initially 
integrating certain reporting and governance 
capabilities. The planned nature, depth and 
pace of integration is expected to evolve 
within the Bank’s strategy during the 2017/18 
financial year. 
The acquisition of Argos Financial Services 
presents significant operational synergies. 
Argos Financial Services manages an existing 
store card estate which we will leverage 
by moving our credit cards onto the same 
platform. This will take place during the 
summer of 2018. 
Sainsbury’s Bank is committed to delivering 
customer service that is convenient, reliable 
and helpful. Our website receives over 1.9 
million visits every month, up 50 per cent year-
on-year. We continue to report industry-low 
levels of customer complaints, consistently 
recording fewer than 1.3 complaints per 
1,000 customer accounts over the last two 
years. We have won industry awards for 
customer service and quality of our products 
including Best Balance Transfer Credit Card 
(The Personal Finance Awards), Best Online 
Personal Loan Provider (Your Money) and 
Trusted Personal Loan and Pet Insurance 
provider (Moneywise Customer Services).
We continue to invest in Sainsbury’s Bank 
and will inject further capital for lending 
growth, increased regulatory requirements 
and to complete the Bank’s ongoing 
transformation.
Sales growth
Food is our core business but growing 
our General Merchandising, Clothing and 
Financial Services businesses is an important 
part of our strategy. We know that our 
customers value greater choice and that 
there is a firm correlation between increased 
loyalty and spend across our whole offer 
when customers buy into these categories.

 21 Strategic Report Continue cost savings 
and maintain balance 
sheet strength
Priority #4
In line with other UK 
retailers, we anticipate that 
cost pressures will continue 
over the next few years – 
the price of raw materials 
and energy is increasing, 
along with wages and 
business rates. 
Across our business we are focused on 
finding ways to mitigate the impact of rising 
costs so that we can continue to deliver for 
customers, colleagues and shareholders. 
We continue to find ways to simplify our 
business and reduce costs. We have achieved 
£130 million of cost savings this year, £355 
million in the last two years, and by the end 
of 2017/18 we will have delivered our target of 
£500m of cost savings over three years across 
our business. We are committed to a further 
£500 million cost savings over the next three 
years, starting in 2018/19. 
Our focus on efficiency and cost reduction 
will allow us to continue to invest in the value 
of our proposition and the development 
of our colleagues as well as provide our 
shareholders with a return on the investment 
they have made in Sainsbury’s.
Sainsbury’s food and grocery 
operations
Over the last three years we have made 
significant progress in developing our food 
and grocery proposition. We have simplified 
our prices and replaced multi-buys with 
lower regular prices – helping customers 
avoid waste at home and enabling us to 
forecast demand more accurately. We 
have invested in the quality of over 3,000 
Sainsbury’s branded products and shortened 
the time it takes to get innovative new food 
ranges on to our shelves. We source directly 
from farmers and growers and use cutting-
edge technology to forecast demand to 
give our food extra shelf life. We have also 
invested in our ranging strategy and tools 
to bring greater incremental choice and 
quality into each of our stores, while reducing 
duplication and products previously on multi-
buy or high-low promotion. Changes we 
have made to our in-store operating model 
have helped to reduce costs throughout our 
store estate.
As retailers we must continually respond 
to the changes in the way people shop and 
continue to identify how we can meet our 
customers’ needs while also achieving our 
cost savings target. We have identified a 
number of areas where we believe we can 
deliver significant savings at pace. These 
include:
— Improving product availability throughout 
the supply chain 
—  Making our checkouts more efficient, 
easier and faster to use 
—  Using improved technology to eliminate 
unnecessary complexity in some aspects 
of the in-store experience, making it faster 
and more efficient for both customers and 
colleagues 
—  Simplifying our offer so that we can 
deliver the food and groceries our 
customers want, whenever and wherever 
they want them
These are all areas we can address with agile 
solutions that we can test and deliver at 
pace, using technology whenever possible. 
In whatever we do, our colleagues and 
customers will remain firmly at the forefront 
of our thinking. 
Balance sheet strength
Our balance sheet remains strong with 
a significant reduction in net debt and 
high levels of liquidity. We have reduced 
net debt by £349 million in the year to 
£1,477 million. The reduction is as a result 
of continued strong cash generation from 
our retail operations, the financing of the 
acquisition of Home Retail Group plc and 
further working capital improvements, offset 
by exceptional pension payments, capital 
expenditure and dividends. Group core retail 
capital expenditure of £547 million was in line 
with last year (2015/16: £542 million), even 
with the addition of Argos core retail capital 
expenditure of £38 million. However, in line 
with our strategy, this is significantly lower 
than the average capital expenditure in the 
previous five years of £931 million.
The Group has financing facilities of 
£3.9 billion, of which only £2.7 billion was 
drawn at the year-end. These are from 
diverse funding sources in order to minimise 
refinancing risk and to maintain appropriate 
contingent liquidity. We have also concluded 
the Sainsbury’s pension scheme triennial 
valuation and recovery payments will 
increase by £6 million to £84 million per 
year. As part of the acquisition of Home 
Retail Group plc, we will also be paying 
recovery payments of £40 million per year 
to the Home Retail Group plc defined benefit 
pension scheme until October 2021.
The Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 6.6 pence per share (2015/16: 8.1 pence), 
making a full-year dividend of 10.2 pence 
per share (2015/16: 12.1 pence), covered two 
times by underlying earnings, in line with 
Sainsbury’s policy to pay an affordable 
dividend. Over the last five years Sainsbury’s 
has paid a total dividend of 69.5 pence per 
share, returning over £1.4 billion of cash 
to shareholders.
Like-for-like transactions
The structural change in the market means 
that customers have more choice than 
ever when it comes to doing their grocery 
shopping. This means that like-for-like 
transactions are at risk and we need to ensure 
that we execute our strategy effectively. 
Customers will then continue to see that we 
offer great products at great prices.

 23 Strategic Report Our values  
make us different
In a highly competitive industry, where price can often 
dominate the conversation, our values differentiate 
us from our competitors, strengthen our relationships 
with suppliers, colleagues and other stakeholders, and 
provide guiding principles that enable our teams to do 
their best work.
To achieve our vision to be the most trusted 
retailer, where people love to work and 
shop, at a time when trust in business and 
institutions is generally low, our values are 
more important than ever. We must live up 
to them through the choices we make across 
our business, so that we can play a leading 
role in tackling some of the challenges facing 
households and society. 
For example, we are transparent about our 
economic contribution to the UK, such as 
how much tax we pay, as well as how much 
we pay our colleagues. In 2016/17, we paid 
£1.9 billion
1
 in tax and were ranked 7th for 
taxes borne in the PwC 2016 Total Taxes 
Contribution survey of the 100 Group. We 
also want to help our customers to live well 
for less – whether that is through providing 
solutions for how to live a healthier life, 
and waste less food, or by playing our part 
in helping the UK become a better place to 
work and live. 
As well as building trust among our 
customers, our Sustainability Plan drives 
efficiencies and helps us reduce our 
operating costs, for example, by using less 
electricity and natural resources. It is also 
one of the ways that we manage risk across 
our business. For example, elements of our 
Sourcing with integrity commitments help 
us to protect security of supply of key raw 
materials at risk due to climate change 
affecting our global supply chain. We know 
that our commitment to sustainable business 
and our values helps us to attract and retain 
top talent too – according to our 2016/17 
Talkback survey, 80 per cent of colleagues 
trust us to do the right thing for the world 
we live in.
Our Sustainability Plan publicly sets out our 
ambitions across our values, and provides 
the measurement framework to track 
our progress. Also, by supporting the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals, we aim to 
contribute to the creation of a fairer, more 
sustainable and prosperous society – in the 
UK and internationally in places where our 
business can make a positive difference. 
Following the acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc – owner of Argos and Habitat – 
in September 2016, we have begun work to 
develop an integrated Sustainability Plan 
for the new Sainsbury’s Group. As this work 
is still underway, the information on the 
following pages focuses on the progress 
Sainsbury’s has made against our existing 
Sustainability Plan. We are working to 
review targets and programmes across 
our business and will share further details 
in the coming year.
Our values are the thread 
running through every part 
of our business. Whether it’s 
making it easier to choose 
healthier products, or saving 
money and reducing food 
waste at home – we’re 
always looking for ways 
to make life better for our 
customers while also doing 
the right thing for our 
colleagues, shareholders, 
the planet and society.”
Mike Coupe Chief Executive Officer, 
J Sainsbury plc
1  During the year ended March 2017 the Sainsbury’s Group 
(including HRG companies post acquisition) paid £1.9 billion 
(2015/16: £1.7 billion) to the UK Government, of which £927 million 
(2015/16: £890 million) was borne by Sainsbury’s and the remaining

Living  
healthier lives
We want to help our customers to live well and 
living well starts with eating well.
More than half of adults in the UK are overweight or obese, increasing 
their risk of a range of health problems, including heart disease, 
diabetes and stroke.
As one of the UK’s leading food retailers, we have an important role to 
play in providing customers with healthy, accessible food options that 
fit in with their lifestyles and their budgets.
We offer a wide range of healthy and nutritious food products, 
created by a team of dedicated product developers, product 
technologists and registered nutritionists. We continually reformulate 
our own-brand products to make them healthier and we aim to 
make it easy for our customers to make the right choices for them by 
offering a varied range of products, including many appealing options 
for those with allergies and intolerances. We also make it easier for 
customers to add more fruit and vegetables in their diets through 
product innovation and inspire kids to get active and lead healthier 
lives through our Active Kids scheme.
We engage our suppliers in our approach on health, for example 
through training and articles in our Working Together magazine. 
We have always led the way in helping our customers make informed 
healthier choices. We were the first UK food retailer to introduce front 
of pack traffic light labelling in 2005 and one of the first retailers to set 
stretching targets for salt reduction in our own-brand products. Our 
allergen-free range is clearly colour coded to highlight the allergens 
that they are free from. In 2014, we became the first UK retailer to 
include calorie labelling on our own-brand alcohol products, along 
with clear and consistent front of pack alcohol by volume (ABV) on 
our own-brand wine. 
Our commitments
Our customers can trust that they can always 
choose nutritious and healthy food when they  
shop with us.

41% 42% 45%
1  We measure this through the proportion of products in our customers’ baskets that are defined as 
healthy based on the product’s multiple traffic light (MTL) ratings around salt, sugar, fat and saturates.
We reformulate our products to reduce salt, sugar, fat and saturated 
fats. This year, we removed more than three tonnes (over 700,000 
teaspoons) of salt from our canned corned beef products to meet 
the Government’s 2017 salt targets without impacting taste or 
flavour. Our own-brand breakfast cereal range was reformulated to 
meet the 2017 Public Health England guidelines on sugar and salt 
reduction: they now meet the average 2017 salt targets, with 100 
per cent below the maximum target. We have reduced sugar across 
the range by an average of 13 per cent, exceeding the Government’s 
2017 targets of a five per cent reduction. We have also removed all 
illustrated characters from our breakfast cereal range as part of our 
commitment to responsibly market products to children.
In addition to the 37 tonnes of sugar we removed from our own-brand 
fruit yogurts range in 2015, we removed 36 tonnes of sugar from our 
Taste the Difference yogurts and other own-brand yogurt products, 
representing a reduction of up to nearly 20 per cent across these 
products.
We changed the recipe for our in-store doughnuts and cookies, 
removing 75 tonnes of sugar and 204 tonnes of fat, including 70 
tonnes of saturated fat, and a potential 1.5 billion calories from 
customer baskets. Our cafés now use semi-skimmed milk in our hot 
and cold beverages, unless the customer specifically requests whole 
milk, potentially saving a further 58.5 tonnes of fat and 0.5 billion 
calories annually from customer diets.
Many of our customers suffer from food allergies, but do not want 
to miss out on healthy and tasty food choices. In 2016/17, based on 
customer feedback, we improved and doubled our allergen-free 
range, re-branding it as Deliciously FreeFrom. The new product range 
uses market-leading product innovation to offer 97 allergen-free 
options, from everyday staples like bread to treats such as cakes and 
cookies. We also launched white and seeded gluten free bread batons, 
farmhouse loaves and rolls baked fresh in our stores – a result of a 
long and intense product development process.
We offer prepared vegetable products that not only make it easier 
for customers to eat more vegetables, but also help them save on 
cooking time. We have introduced courgetti, butternut squash 
boodles, cauliflower rice as well as butternut squash and courgette 
lasagne sheets. We added new product lines in 2017, including 
butternut squash waffles and sweet potato tagliatelle. Our broccoli 
rice and boodles not only taste great but help us reduce food waste 
by using up more of every vegetable and making use of wonky veg 
too (see page 33). We will encourage kids to live a healthy,  
balanced lifestyle.

At the heart of the UK’s obesity crisis lies the concerning statistic that 
in the UK, by the time children leave primary school, one in three is 
overweight and one in five is obese.
Our commitment to helping children to lead healthy, active lives 
is well known – we have been encouraging children, regardless of 
ability or impairment, to get active and lead healthier lives for the 
last 11 years with our Active Kids scheme. The initiative emphasises 
both calories in and calories out, helping children to understand 
the importance of diet and exercise. We use cooking competitions, 
teacher training, ambassador endorsements and education 
campaigns to inspire kids to eat and live well. Through Active Kids, 
schools and community clubs can redeem Sainsbury’s Active Kids 
vouchers in return for sports and cooking equipment and experiences.
In 2016/17, we introduced the Active Kids Paralympic Challenge, which 
offered specialist sports equipment to more than 8,000 schools to get 
kids to try four Paralympic sports. We also published research into 
the barriers faced by 11-14 year olds that prevent them from leading 
healthier lifestyles. 
Our prepared vegetable range, including butternut squash 
waffles, sweet potato tagliatelle and broccoli rice, helps 
customers to eat more vegetables and save on cooking time, 
while also enabling us to make the most of products that 
might otherwise have gone to waste.

3  As we continue to grow our estate we have moved to include the percentage of stores participating in 
these schemes, for ease of comparison year-on-year. These numbers reflect local charity partners across 
our supermarket and convenience stores.
In 2016/17, we generated over £53 million for charities, communities 
and good causes, through the efforts of our customers and colleagues, 
taking our total to £265 million since 2011. 
The efforts of our customers and colleagues allowed us to support 
over 3,400 charity partnerships, across Comic Relief, The Royal British 
Legion and Oxfam, Local Charity of the Year programme and our 
front and back of store food donation partnerships, delivering much-
needed services on a local, national and international level.
Our partnership with Comic Relief raised nearly £12 million for the 
charity’s Red Nose Day campaign this year, supporting their work 
to help those in need in the UK, Africa and India. We also celebrated 
22 years of our partnership with The Royal British Legion (RBL) to 
support current members and veterans of the forces, raising over 
£3.1 million. We are the exclusive retailer of RBL poppy seeds to 
increase the number of wild poppy fields to commemorate the 
centenary of the end of the First World War in 2018. 
Our annual Christmas advertising campaign raised more than 
£500,000 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital through merchandise 
sales and customer donations. We engaged 8,000 schools as part of 
our support for Paralympics GB, donating kits to encourage children 
to understand and participate in inclusive sports. We also supported 
Oxfam’s disaster relief and humanitarian efforts and were named as 
an official partner to their Emergency Response Network. 
In addition to our national partnerships, we continued to deliver 
great impact at a local level. Since 2009, we have donated more than 
£11 million for good causes through our Local Charity of the Year 
programme. Not only is this hugely beneficial for local communities 
– this year we expect to raise £2 million for more than 1,200 local 
charity partnerships – but it is a great engagement tool for customers 
and colleagues alike. Charities are initially shortlisted by our in-store 
teams, before the vote opens to customers, colleagues and the wider 
community. Thanks to refreshed and focused communications, we 
received an unprecedented 1.9 million votes, an increase of 440 per 
cent from last year.
Our stores are at the centre of local communities, 
helping customers live well for less. But our support 
goes beyond what we sell. Our colleagues help us 
build meaningful relationships with our customers 
and communities, positively impacting those in 
need through fundraising, volunteering, donations 
and by building awareness.
In 2016/17, we generated over £53 million for charities, communities

. Our longstanding national partnerships with Comic

part of our Local Charity of the Year programme, and saw a dramatic 
increase in participation. Our award-winning Payroll Giving systems 
made it easy for our colleagues to donate to causes they support. 
We also became an official partner of Oxfam’s Emergency Response 
Network which provides an effective channel through which we can 
respond to disasters and humanitarian crises around the world.

Fundraising and 
volunteering at Argos
During 2016/17, Argos colleagues and customers raised 
more than £900,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support 
and the Irish Cancer Society. The funds are being used 
to help the charities ensure that no one faces cancer 
alone. As part of our colleagues’ contribution, they ran 
collections in stores and participated in Macmillan’s 
flagship event, the World’s Biggest Coffee Morning.
28 Strategic Report To better understand our impact through this programme, we sent 
a survey to our 2015/16
4
 local charity partners. Every Sainsbury’s local 
charity partnership offers a different mix of money, volunteering time, 
food donations and support as needed. We have carried out research 
into the social return on our charitable activities and early results 
suggest that the programme delivered an equivalent of £11 worth of 
social impact for every £1 of investment. From these initial findings 
we also know we impacted over 360,000 people, across a variety of 
causes, including community and neighbourhood and health.
We saw an increase in our colleague volunteering through our Local 
Heroes programme, which sees us donate £5 for every hour that 
colleagues volunteer in their own time. This resulted in nearly £76,500 
being donated across a broad spectrum of charities and community 
groups throughout 2016/17. Our colleagues also donated over half a 
million pounds through the Payroll Giving scheme to support causes 
they care about. We are delighted that our scheme was externally 
recognised, with two wins from Payroll Giving Awards, including one 
for the Most Successful Sustained Scheme, which recognised our 
27 years of support. Our colleagues were also recognised for their 
continued support of Community Alcohol Partnerships to encourage 
responsible drinking.
4  We surveyed 2015/16 Local Charity of the Year partners – rather than those taking part in the 2016/17 
programme – to gather data from those who had completed a full year’s partnership.
Each year, a large number of our 
poppy collectors are welcomed 
into Sainsbury’s stores across 
the country, raising money and 
awareness for our Poppy Appeal 
and the Legion’s work to help the 
British Armed Forces, younger and 
older veterans and their families 
to live on to a more hopeful future. 
We’re thrilled with the high level of 
support from Sainsbury’s and are 
extremely grateful for our growing 
relationship.”

 29 Strategic Report Sourcing  
with integrity
Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer where 
people love to work and shop. That means staying 
true to our values and aligning our strategy with the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure we 
build a business that plays its part for the long term.
Customers care about where products they buy come from and they 
put their trust in us to make the right decisions on their behalf. This is 
why sourcing with integrity is key to our work with farmers, growers 
and suppliers in the UK and around the world. From our Research & 
Development and Ethical Trade conferences with almost 300 and over 
120 attendees respectively, our Farmer Development Groups with 
almost 2,000 members, our technical director’s forum of our 36 top 
suppliers through to our quarterly digital Working Together magazine 
going out to over 3,500 recipients, we collaborate specifically and 
engage broadly with a wide network of stakeholders.
In 2016/17, we continued to build on the number of key raw materials 
that are sourced according to an independent sustainability standard. 
We were named the Best Sustainable Seafood Supermarket in 
the world by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). We sold more 
Fairtrade products than any other retailer around the world and we 
continued to strengthen our measures to prevent the exploitation 
of vulnerable workers in our extended value chains.
We know much work lies ahead. But we are on track to help our 
customers, suppliers, farmers and growers live better today, 
tomorrow and in the future.
Our commitments
We will source our key raw materials sustainably 
to an independent standard.

tools for our standards. We will share our progress as we pilot and roll out across our value chains. 
We are committed to sourcing our key raw materials according 
to independently peer reviewed sustainability standards by 2020. 
These raw materials are key to our business, have significant social 
and environmental impacts and matter to our customers and 
wider stakeholders.
Our approach is to develop our own standards that build upon and 
give credit to existing independent third-party standards. Standards 
for 15 raw materials are ready to pilot, in addition to one already 
being piloted in Thailand and Belize. The remainder are in final 
stages of development and peer review with our chosen subject 
matter experts. Our key suppliers, producers and more than 50 
independent organisations such as UNICEF, Care International, Ethical 
Tea Partnership and Solidaridad Network have been involved in the 
peer review. We are also working with ISEAL, the global Sustainability 
Standards membership body, to evaluate our standards.
We are working to ensure that our own-brand products do not 
contribute to deforestation; 98 per cent of the palm oil in our own-
brand products is independently certified sustainable, and we 
are continuing work to certify the final two per cent. In addition, 
93 per cent of the wood we use comes from recycled, Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement 
of Forest Certification (PEFC) certified sources with full chain of 
custody. For palm oil and timber, our goal is to maintain our current 
performance, address pockets of opportunity and contribute to 
improving standards. We are also working with our suppliers and 
external partners to measure and map our soy usage – part of 
our process to source deforestation-free soy.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, 31 per cent 
of the world’s fish stocks have been fished beyond sustainable limits 
(SOFIA report, 2016). We want to ensure that customers can enjoy the 
products we carry with the confidence that they were sourced from 
sustainable fisheries. 
Our goal is to have 100 per cent of our wild caught seafood sales 
from certified sustainable sources by 2020. We carry over 200 Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC) certified seafood products, comprising 
79 per cent of our sales currently. In 2017 we were recognised by MSC 
for being the Best Sustainable Seafood Supermarket in the world, 
having held the number one spot in the UK since records began in 2010.
We are investing in fisheries improvement projects for wild caught 
species that are currently outside the MSC programme such as tuna, 
squid and crayfish. Our farmed salmon and trout are 100 per cent 
British and 100 per cent assured to RSPCA’s welfare standards.

Fairtrade products ensure farmers and workers are paid a fair 
price and receive an additional sum of money paid on top of the 
Fairtrade minimum price to invest in social, environmental and 
economic development projects to improve their businesses and 
their communities.
In 2015/16, we sold over £280 million worth of Fairtrade products, 
in line with business sales, making us the world’s largest retailer 
of Fairtrade products. Our 100 per cent Fairtrade bananas generate 
a premium of £4 million per year for farming communities in the 
Dominican Republic, Colombia, St. Lucia and Ghana. 
In addition to Fairtrade, just one of the projects that we are working 
on with our partners is to improve the livelihoods of small-scale 
cashew nut farmers in Madagascar. Through our work, farmers have 
more than doubled the price they receive for their cashew crop. In 
the factory, the breakage rate has reduced by 36 per cent, resulting in 
improved quality and better worker bonuses. The first 30 small scale 
farmers have begun the process to secure land tenure, and we aim to 
support all associated farmer groups through the life of the project.
In December 2016, as part of our work to tackle modern slavery, we 
launched new training for our British farmers and growers to identify 
vulnerable or exploited workers. It follows a successful pilot with our 
egg farmers to identify and address criminal or exploitative activities. 
We also hosted our third annual Ethical Trade conference for over 
120 of our key suppliers and stakeholders, which included a focus 
on the Modern Slavery Act and its reporting requirements. For more 
information, read our 2016/17 Modern Slavery Statement.

Our own research has shown that supporting local, British producers 
is important to UK consumers. We work to offer consumers a wide 
selection of British products and partner with British farmers 
and growers to improve their productivity, while reducing their 
environmental impacts.
For example, we have worked closely with our farmers to make the 
most of the lambing season, and source 100 per cent British lamb 
in the British season. We are also the UK’s largest retailer of English 
apples and pears.
Our farmers and growers are our partners; investing in their business 
benefits us too. We have invested in 28 Research & Development 
projects with a value of more than £9 million, focused on improving 
agricultural productivity and reducing the environmental impacts 
of British farmers. Through the year, we facilitated several farmer 
workshops, including 27 regional workshops for our Beef and Dairy 
Development Groups focused on soil health. Our annual farming 
conference focused on how farmers could use data to improve 
productivity and support animal welfare. 
We also continued working with our Sainsbury’s Dairy Development 
Group (SDDG), which was set up in 2007 with the more than 270 
farmers who supply 97% of our by Sainsbury’s own-brand milk, to 
improve herd health and efficiency, and reduce costs in our milk 
supply chain. The SDDG operates under a cost of production model, 
which was voted for by the majority of our farmers. It sets the price 
Sainsbury’s pays for milk independently. The model was introduced 
in 2012 and ensures that our SDDG farmers receive a fair price for 
their milk. The overall goal of the group is to work in partnership with 
our dairy farmers to deliver a sustainable sourcing model that drives 
production efficiencies through improved animal welfare and reduced 
environmental impact. 
We want to support the next generation of farmers. Our Farm Tech 
scholarship, delivered in partnership with Imperial College, is one 
of the first of its kind for a retailer. It helps our farmers and growers 
learn from experts and share best practice with each other. Twelve 
new apprentices joined Sainsbury’s Agriculture and Horticulture 
apprenticeship scheme this year. The apprentices will gain practical 
experience at Reaseheath College before they seek opportunities within 
our grower and farmer base. We also sponsored Open Farm Sunday, 
which is managed by Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF), an 
organisation that promotes sustainable agriculture, food and farming. 
We worked with nine key farms to invite members of the public to 
learn about our good agricultural practices and sourcing criteria.
Our meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products

Animal welfare is important to our customers and it is important to 
our business. High standards of animal welfare are good for animals 
and farm productivity and what is expected in our products. 
We work hard to raise health and welfare standards in partnership 
with leading experts across our supply chains and offer the widest 
range of higher welfare food and cosmetics products of any retailer. 
In 2016/17, we sold over £490 million worth of RSPCA assured 
products, and in 2016 we had more RSPCA assured products on shelf 
than any other UK retailer. We were the first major supermarket to 
only sell cage-free fresh eggs in 2009. This winter, some of our free-
range poultry, which includes chicken and turkey, were temporarily 
housed in barns to protect them from avian flu following guidance 
from Government and industry bodies.
We monitor health and welfare measures at abattoirs across all meat 
species and we are working to further measure on-farm health and 
welfare outcomes through our sustainability standards. Our Dairy 
and Cheese Development Groups are independently audited for 
compliance with our Higher Herd Health standard. Our chickens and 
turkeys have health and welfare outcomes recorded during their 
life on-farm and up to and including the point of slaughter. We are 
working closely with our farmers’ processing partners and steering 
group members to deliver our Sustainability Plan commitment of 
sourcing birds from 100% independently verified higher health and 
welfare outcome flocks by 2020. We are already starting to see the 
benefits of expecting a high level of health and welfare at all stages 
of production and collaborating to create a continuous improvement 
culture related to outcome measures.
We hosted 54 members of our Cheese Development Group for two 
practical, on-farm workshops to help them address and measure 
lameness in their herds, a key welfare outcome and challenge for 
dairy cattle. We worked with our Dairy Development Group to reduce 
the need for certain priority classes of antibiotics, leading to a 
voluntary withdrawal of these antibiotics – part of our commitment 
to ensure responsible medicine use within our supply chains. 
We are continuing to progress our two industry leading Research and 
Development projects to improve pig health and welfare outcomes 
in indoor production systems. 
Following this year’s Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare 
results, we are assessing how we communicate our work to improve 
animal health and welfare so we can bring our communications in line 
with the extensive industry-leading work that we carry out in this area.

Since 2005, we have reduced our own-brand packaging across all of 
our ranges by almost 33 per cent, and we continue to work towards 
our target of a 50 per cent reduction by 2020. For example, recently, 
we reduced the weight of our own-brand sherry bottles by 10 per cent, 
saving us 79 tonnes of glass packaging. 
We are also working hard to make recycling easier for our customers. 
We have changed the spray bottles we use within our cleaning 
products so that the whole bottle – including the trigger – can now be 
recycled. Last year we sold over five million of these bottles and the 
changes mean over 130 tonnes of additional plastic can now be easily 
recycled at the kerbside.
Packaging plays an important role in protecting food and ensuring it 
stays fresh and tasty. We continue to introduce packaging that helps 
customers waste less food in their homes. For example, our resealable 
large family packs of ham and our snap-pack Taste the Difference 
sausages allow customers to keep one half of the pack fresh in the 
fridge or even to store in the freezer and use at a later date. We will 
continue to innovate in this way to reduce waste from packaging and 
food in the home.
We will work with our key own-brand suppliers, 
farmers and growers to address the impact of 
our products.

By 2050, the food supply chain could contribute two degrees to global 
warming. We know that the majority of our environmental impacts 
occur in our supply chains. As well as reducing our own environmental 
impacts, we want to work with our suppliers, farmers and growers to 
reduce the impacts associated with our products.
We were a founder signatory to the Courtauld Commitment in 2004 
and have remained involved ever since. Courtauld 2025, among 
other commitments, seeks to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with food and drink consumed in the UK by 20 per cent 
and improve water stewardship in food and drink supply chains. 
We work to protect critical water sources, and ensure that we 
maintain water quality and availability in our supply chains. We 
work with partners such as Cranfield University to understand water 
vulnerability in our global supply chains, including the risk of water 
scarcity for fresh produce. We are also part of multi-stakeholder 
activities in the Doñana National Park in Spain and the East Anglian 
Water Stewardship Business Board and we fund and play an active 
role in the UK Water Partnership. 
As part of our broader commitment on reducing food waste, we work 
with suppliers to reduce food surplus and food waste in our supply 
chains. We source directly from farmers and growers which speeds 
up the journey from farm to shelf, giving food extra shelf life. We use 
cutting-edge technology to forecast demand and have invested in 
Research & Development to help our farmers plan their crop cycles 
more accurately. This avoids having more product than we can sell.
We aim to use as much of every product as possible – for example, 
we have developed boodles, noodles made from butternut squashes 
that we would otherwise not be able to sell, and our broccoli rice uses 
20 per cent stalk and 80 per cent floret – saving 42 tonnes of product 
that would have gone to waste.
In our General Merchandise and Clothing business, cotton is our 
most important natural resource and forms the basis of many of 
our products. Our cotton strategy will ensure that all of the cotton 
fibre used in our products originates from independently verifiable 
sustainably managed sources by 2020. Our membership of the Better 
Cotton Initiative underpins our cotton strategy and affirms our strong 
commitment to promoting and supporting positive environmental, 
social and economic change across the cotton value chain. 
The leather tanning process is water and chemically intensive, which 
is why we are fully committed to strict environmental stewardship 
across our leather supply chain. We are working to ensure that all the 
leather used in our own-brand products is certified to a recognised 
international environmental standard by 2020, verified through 
independent audit. 
For more information on how we are managing our environmental 
impact, see page 34.

 33 Strategic Report Respect for our  
environment
We are committed to operating a sustainable 
business, working closely with colleagues and 
suppliers to reduce our impact on the environment. 
At the same time, we are also helping our customers 
live more sustainably, most notably with our efforts 
to help them cut food waste at home. 
Through our investment in sustainable operations and technologies, 
we have reduced emissions by 8.2 per cent this year, compared to 
2015/16. We are now using 11.6 per cent less electricity than we did in 
2005 – despite growing our store space by 54.2 per cent. We are one 
of just three retailers worldwide to achieve an A rating in the 2016/17 
FTSE 350 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. 
We have continued our work to keep food waste at a minimum 
by ensuring supply chain efficiency, while growing our network of 
charity partners to redistribute unsold food. We also released our 
inaugural food waste report, setting a public benchmark against 
which we can measure future performance. 
Because we want to help make our customers’ lives better and easier, 
we look for ways to support them too. We are investing in a five 
year, £10 million Waste less, Save more initiative which is helping 
customers to cut food waste and save money. 
As the UK’s second largest grocery retailer, even small actions by 
our 162,000 Sainsbury’s store colleagues can have a big collective 
impact. We continue our work to be the Greenest Grocer by educating 
colleagues on how to grow our business while reducing our operational 
carbon emissions. We have also achieved our 2020 targets to reduce 
water use, driven largely by the introduction of waterless urinals 
across the business. 
These actions help us progress towards our vision of being the most 
trusted retailer, while improving the efficiency of our operations and 
minimising risks and disruption to our business.

This year marked a significant milestone as we moved to transparent 
reporting of our operational food waste. As one of only two major 
retailers to do this, we are leading the way and have set a clear 
benchmark against which we can measure progress. Our reporting 
also acts as a shared goal for colleagues across the business to ensure 
that we are all working together to make a difference, while helping 
build trust and engage customers through projects such as Waste 
less, Save more.
Our latest figures (2015/16) highlighted a 9.4 per cent reduction in 
operational food waste – driven in part by improved efficiencies 
in our supply chain. We are currently working to verify figures for 
2016/17, which will be released later this year. We are also working to 
refine our measurement process to further improve accuracy.
We were the first UK retailer to remove multi-buys on food products 
from our shelves – helping customers avoid waste at home and 
enabling us to forecast demand more accurately. Our new strategy 
of everyday low prices ensures we are well placed to give our 
customers what they want, when they want it, so they can enjoy 
increased choice and flexibility while cutting down on waste.
We are also using data to make smarter predictions on the weekly 
requirements of seasonal products so we can stock up with the right 
amount. This reduces surplus from seasonal items like burgers, 
sausages, salads and soft fruit, and helps suppliers better manage 
their production. See page 33 for more information.
To minimise food waste, we are donating more unsold food to good 
causes than ever before by rapidly growing our charity network. 
We now have 1,114 back of store food donation partnerships across 
970 stores, which enable us to redistribute surplus food to those in 
need. Eight out of ten of our supermarkets – which tend to generate 
more surplus food than other store formats – now have at least one 
charitable partner. 
We partner with recycling companies to manage customer-recycling 
and donation facilities at our stores, and now have 271 stores with 
Sainsbury’s recycling containers. Customers can also donate their 
mobile phones, clothing and books at Oxfam collection points in 
our car parks and our stores. In 2016/17, we collected 5,461 tonnes of 
clothing (over 16 million items) and 527 tonnes of books, making us 
the biggest single supplier of items to Oxfam shops.

UK households throw away 7.3 million tonnes of food each year, 
accounting for 70 per cent of the UK’s post-farm-gate total food 
waste. So it is no surprise that in 2015, our customers told us that 
they wanted help cutting their own food waste. 
Waste less, Save more – our £10 million, five-year initiative to bring 
about behaviour change and help our customers tackle food waste 
– has gone from strength to strength. This year, we completed our 
12 month trial in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, where we initiated over 
20 trials, ranging from apps that weigh and report on food waste 
to pioneering school programmes designed to engage young 
people on the issue. Our aim was to identify which tactics had the 
biggest impact on reducing food waste, and learn how they could 
be rolled out in more households. We know that behaviour change 
programmes take time, but by trialling tools early on in the initiative, 
we can focus our efforts on the solutions that really work. Our work 
in Swadlincote is being carried out in partnership with WRAP, which 
we are working with to evaluate the trial.
As part of our ongoing efforts to expand the impact of the 
programme, we have recruited eight Waste Warriors from our 
in-store colleague network to champion the project across the UK. 
They have participated in some of the trials and are sharing what 
they have learned in their communities.
As promised, we are now delivering the next phase of the 
programme, rolling out successful solutions to some 130 Discovery 
Communities – towns and cities across the UK that have signed up to 
tackle food waste. To get them started, we have provided a handbook 
featuring lessons from Swadlincote and will also be making £1 million 
in grants available to support the roll-out of individual projects.
We will test and learn through our work in the Discovery Communities 
and ensure that the campaign reaches people outside these areas. 
We will also publish our findings so that customers, communities and 
competitors can join the fight against food waste.
Many people still think that their 
unwanted clothes won’t make 
a difference to charities, but at 
Oxfam we can reuse or recycle 
almost anything. The items donated

We have continued to make progress this year, with relative CO

emissions down by 8.9 per cent and absolute emissions falling by 
8.2 per cent. We are now using 11.6 per cent less electricity than we 
did in 2005 – despite growing our operations by 54.2 per cent. 
We have achieved these reductions through several initiatives. 
In 2016/17, we launched our Greenest Grocer – Energy Matters 
programme, which has helped our colleagues in-store to reduce our 
energy use and it has already saved us around three per cent on 
our electricity costs compared to 2015/16. As well as encouraging 
colleagues to close fridge doors, turn down ovens and avoid overfilling 
freezers, we have asked them for their own suggestions to help reduce 
energy use. The best ideas will be adopted into the programme for 
wider roll-out. Engaging colleagues in this collaborative way, and 
making the most of their expertise, will help to achieve even better 
results. Since the campaign launched we have saved £1.8 million from 
store budgets. 
We installed LED lighting in 676 stores, depots and store support 
centres, which means around 49 per cent of our estate is using less 
energy on lighting. We will continue to roll out more LED lighting 
across our estate in 2017/18. 
We work with anaerobic digestion suppliers to create carbon-neutral 
green gas from organic waste (including from our stores), which is fed 
into the grid. Around 20 per cent of our total gas use is this green gas. 
Our use of combined heat and power engines also reduces our impact 
on the National Grid, protects us from any potential outages and 
creates renewable heat to supply all our heating and hot water needs.
In 2016/17, we increased the number of stores that use CO
2
e in their 
refrigeration to 246. This transition helps reduce our use of ozone-
depleting refrigerant gases, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) 
or hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), which can have a global warming 
potential that is 3,000 times higher than CO
2
e. The new fridges are 
also more energy efficient. 
We also became the first company in the world to trial a refrigerated 
delivery truck cooled by a liquid nitrogen powered engine, which 
will eliminate all emissions associated with refrigeration. During the

Our ongoing work to improve water stewardship reached a significant 
milestone with the introduction of waterless urinals across our 
business. We achieved our 2020 target, reducing our absolute water 
usage by 30 per cent, and our relative usage by 55 per cent, relative 
to 2005/06. Since 2014/15, absolute water use has decreased by two 
per cent and relative water use has decreased by one per cent. We are 
also working with our farmers, suppliers and growers to improve their 
water efficiency (see page 33).

 37 Strategic Report We want to be a place where people love to work 
and shop. That means harnessing the talent, 
creativity and diversity of our colleagues to ensure 
that customers receive great service every time 
they shop at Sainsbury’s.
Our colleagues are our foundation. We engage them in the long-term 
success of our business and invest in their training and development. 
We want to be the most inclusive retailer, where we celebrate the 
diversity of our colleagues and value the different perspectives they 
bring to help us meet the diverse needs of our customers. We listen to 
our colleagues’ views so we can continue making Sainsbury’s a place 
where everyone feels motivated, energised and enabled to offer the 
best value and service for our customers.
We offer a competitive rewards package, above the National Living 
Wage, we pay colleagues for breaks and we provide them with a 
range of benefits including a colleague discount and pension. It is 
important we remain a strong and competitive business for both 
current and past colleagues; we pay pension contributions for over 
120,000 current colleagues, and look after defined benefit pensions 
for 80,000 former colleagues. Investors in People, the international 
standard for people management, awarded us a Gold accreditation 
for the third time – making us the largest UK employer to receive 
this distinction. We have grown our investment in apprenticeships 
that give people the chance to receive on the job training while 
earning a professional qualification.

Our colleagues work hard to make a difference to our customers every 
day and we are committed to rewarding them fairly. We also support 
the Government’s commitment to address the gender pay gap. 
In August 2016, we announced a four per cent increase to our 
standard base rates for our retail colleagues, bringing our rate of pay 
to £7.66 per hour, ahead of the current National Living Wage of £7.50 
per hour. We pay our colleagues for breaks. 
To make Sainsbury’s a great place to work, it is important that we 
listen to our colleagues. We use several tools to help us understand 
how our colleagues feel about working here. In 2016/17, more than 
116,000 of our colleagues participated in our Talkback surveys. While 
we continue to look for ways to improve colleague engagement, we 
are pleased that 77 per cent of our colleagues feel Sainsbury’s is a 
great place to work and over 78 per cent trust us to do the right thing 
for them.
In 2016/17, we piloted a new online engagement survey – We’re 
Listening – across selected retail regions and store support centre 
divisions. Our new survey builds on traditional engagement; 
it measures employee affection and loyalty to our brand over the long 
term and whether colleagues feel they have the support to be the 
best they can be in their role. We will be rolling out the new survey to 
the rest of the business in 2017/18. 
To support making Sainsbury’s a great place to work, the insights 
we gather through our colleague voice channels are shared with 
the Operating Board, as well as senior leaders across the business. 
From May 2017 our Non-Executive Directors will meet with a subset 
of our National Great Place To Work Group representatives from 
supermarkets, convenience and store support centres, so that they 
can hear the issues raised by our colleagues first hand.
We always welcome having our approach externally validated. We 
were delighted to receive a Gold accreditation by Investors in People 
– we are the largest employer to have reached the Gold standard  and 
the only retailer to achieve three consecutive Gold awards. As part 
of the review, Investors in People considers how we listen and act on 
colleague feedback, how we develop and support our colleagues to 
learn and how we attract and retain talent.
We will continue to invest in the training and 
development of our colleagues.

Apprenticeships give colleagues on-the-job skills and training and 
they enable us to secure a talent pipeline to help Sainsbury’s thrive 
in the future.
We have been exploring a range of new apprenticeships this 
year. In 2016/17, we introduced a café hospitality apprenticeship 
programme that builds hospitality and customer service skills; 
59 colleagues are currently enrolled or have completed the pilot. 
We also piloted team leader and management apprenticeships: 
112 retail and logistics colleagues will complete the programme in 
2017. And in our store support centres, we recruited ten apprentices, 
including three women, for a new two-year structured software 
development apprenticeship programme.
We continued to run our industry-leading Diploma Level 2 craft 
apprenticeships in bakery and fish. In 2016/17, 304 colleagues were 
enrolled in or completed these apprenticeships, which last for a year 
and are awarded by City and Guilds. As part of the programmes, 
colleagues develop their Maths and English functional skills, and are 
awarded a full apprenticeship framework certificate. We continue to 
research new apprenticeships in preparation for the Apprenticeship 
Levy that will be introduced in 2017 , to support colleague development.

We value diversity not just because it is the right thing to do; research 
has shown that diverse teams perform better. In addition, we want our 
workforce to reflect and meet the needs of our diverse customer base. 
Supported by our Chief Executive Officer Mike Coupe, Board sponsors 
including our Director of Human Resources, Angie Risley, Company 
Secretary and Corporate Services Director, Tim Fallowfield, and Chief 
Executive of Sainsbury’s Bank, Peter Griffiths, together with Deborah 
Dorman, Director of Corporate HR, Iain Macmillan, Sainsbury’s Argos 
Chief Finance Officer and Helen Paxton, Head of HR Sainsbury’s Argos, 
form our Diversity Steering Group. The Group meets regularly to 
govern progress and updates the Board and Operating Board. We also 
have around 100 Diversity Champions who support diversity in every 
part of our business. 
During 2016/17 we have continued to put strong emphasis on 
inclusion, and have identified it as a priority for our people and 
our business. During our first annual Inclusion Week in 2016, we 
launched the Embrace the Difference campaign. Companies leading 
on inclusion have found that using visible symbols that represent 
inclusion, such as badges, helps colleagues to be themselves at work. 
As part of the campaign, managers held inclusion-themed huddles, 
gave colleagues the opportunity to wear badges to show their visible 
commitment to inclusion, and used scenario-based exercises to help 
colleagues make positive and inclusive decisions. We also profiled a 
range of stories on topics related to diversity and inclusion, such as 
International Women’s Day, Chinese New Year and Passover through 
our internal communications channels. Since 2008, we have employed 
25,700 people through You Can, our scheme to provide jobs for people 
who might otherwise struggle to find employment.
We are working to increase the diversity of our retail managers. 
The assessment for You Can Be, the programme retail colleagues 
complete to progress to the next grade, now aims for gender balance 
and to better reflect regional ethnicity. Our female mentoring 
programme, which was launched by Mike Coupe in November 2015, 
reached 2,000 colleagues, and our subscription to the Everywoman 
Network has risen to over 750. We are also beginning to see a positive 
impact, having added 41 female store managers in 2016/17. Our 
Operating Board hosted a series of women’s dinners and insights from 
these events helped us simplify our maternity policy and create our 
new Our Family Matters team. For a full breakdown of the gender 
diversity of our colleagues, see page 65.
Our Race, Religion and Belief reference group is helping us to tackle 
some of the challenges faced by our Black, Asian, and Ethnic Minority 
(BAME) colleagues. We used findings from one of the largest ever 
race at work surveys in the UK through Business in the Community 
to shape our first BAME colleague development event, which resulted 
in additional events being held at a local level. Diverse role models 
were leveraged to great effect at these events and the feedback was 
overwhelmingly positive. 
We aspire to be a leader in creating disability-friendly workplaces. 
We were delighted to win a Business Disability Forum Disability-
smart Award for the second year in a row. In June 2016, we celebrated 
our fifth year of partnership with Carers UK. Together we developed 
a policy specifically for carers, and we were one of the first FTSE 
100 companies to do so. As part of our non-visible disabilities 
awareness week, we created a video to teach all our colleagues 
basic sign language to enable them to better communicate with 
deaf customers, which won gold at the EVCOM Clarion Awards. In 
December, Tim Fallowfield was announced as Chair of the Disability 
Confident Business Leaders Group. The Group will engage with the 
business community, enabling employers to provide opportunities for 
disabled people and supporting the government in its aspiration to 
halve the disability employment gap. 
We are members of Stonewall’s Diversity Champions programme 
and were featured in this year’s Stonewall Workplace Equality Index. 
Our LGBTA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and allies) network, 
Proud@Sainsbury’s, hosted networking events throughout the year. 
In 2016/17, we also attended Pride events across the UK and Jemma 
Kameen, one of our Co-Chairs of Proud@Sainsbury’s, won Leeds Pride 
Partner of the Year for garnering the support of circa 400 colleagues.
I’ve been at Sainsbury’s for 35 years 
and I came out when I was 50. For 
me, it was about being open and 
visible – I chose to do this so that 
people could see that it’s okay to 
be gay, to be a Store Manager, and 
bring all of yourself to work.”

 41 Strategic Report Our principal risks 
and uncertainties
The risk management process is aligned to our strategy. Risk is 
an inherent part of doing business. The management of these 
risks is based on a balance of risk and reward determined through 
careful assessment of both the potential likelihood and impact as 
well as risk appetite. Consideration is given to both reputational as 
well as financial impact, recognising the significant commercial 
value attributable to the Sainsbury’s Brand. Each principal risk and 
uncertainty is considered in the context of how it relates to the 
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. As outlined on 
page 11, the current business strategy and objectives are categorised 
into the following areas:
Mitigations in place supporting the management of the risk to a net 
risk position are also described for each principal risk and uncertainty.
Where principal risks have been included in the risk modelling 
undertaken as part of the preparation of the viability statement 
(see page 45), this has been indicated with the following symbol 
Key risk movements
The principal and emerging risks are discussed and monitored 
throughout the year to identify changes to the risk landscape. 
Risks are reviewed in line with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
A new principal risk was disclosed in 2016 regarding the political and 
regulatory environment. Following the UK’s decision to leave the 
European Union (EU) in June 2016, Sainsbury’s believe that this risk 
has increased due to the ongoing uncertainty which may adversely 
impact trading performance across the sector. 
All principal risks were reviewed following the acquisition of Home 
Retail Group to ensure that they reflect the risk across the Sainsbury’s 
Group, including the acquired Argos business. It is considered 
that all of the risks are incorporated within the principal risks and 
uncertainties disclosed below, with no material change required. 
It was considered however that Sainsbury’s Group’s risk exposure to 
political and regulatory risks and business continuity incidents may 
be greater due to the increased size and complexity of the business.
The most significant principal risks identified by the Board and the 
corresponding mitigating controls are set out below in no order of 
priority.
Business continuity and major incidents response
Risk
A major incident or catastrophic event could impact on the 
Group’s ability to trade. Following the acquisition of Home 
Retail Group, Sainsbury’s exposure to business continuity and 
major incident risks may be greater due to the increased size 
and complexity of the business.
Mitigation
The Group has detailed plans in place, supported by senior 
representatives who are trained in dealing with major incidents 
and have the authority levels to make decisions in the event of a 
potentially disruptive incident.
The business continuity strategy, including incident management, 
resilience exercises and testing, has been aligned across the 
Group. The Business Continuity Steering Group, which includes 
representatives from Sainsbury’s Bank, Argos and Habitat, meets 
quarterly to ensure that the business continuity (BC) policy and 
strategy is fit for purpose. In addition, it oversees the mitigation of 
all risks associated with BC and IT disaster recovery. In the event 
of any unplanned or unforeseen events, the Business Continuity 
Management Team is convened at short notice to manage the 
response and any associated risk to the business.
Group wide business continuity resilience exercises are undertaken 
to imitate real life business continuity scenarios and test the Group’s 
ability to respond effectively. 
Key strategic locations have secondary backup sites which would 
be made available within pre-defined timescales and are regularly 
tested.

The Sainsbury’s Operating Board formally reviews the corporate risk 
map twice a year, which captures the principal risks to achieving 
Sainsbury’s business objectives. The risk discussion includes 
assessment of both gross and net risk, where gross risk reflects the 
risk exposure and risk landscape before considering the mitigations in 
place, and net risk the residual risk after mitigations. The risk appetite 
for each key risk is also discussed and assessed with a target risk 
position agreed to reflect the level of risk that the business is willing 
to accept. The Sainsbury’s Operating Board reviews risk dashboards 
during the year, comprised of key risk indicators, to ensure they 
identify any potential risk movement towards or away from their 
risk appetite. This enables the Operating Board to agree and monitor 
appropriate actions as required. 
The gross risk movement from prior year for each principal risk and 
uncertainty has been assessed and is presented as follows:
No change
Increased gross 
risk exposure 
Reduced gross 
risk exposure 
42 Strategic Report Business strategy and change
Risk
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy or does not 
communicate or implement its strategies effectively, the 
business may be negatively impacted. Risks to delivering the 
strategy, change initiatives forming part of the strategy and 
other significant supporting change such as the integration 
with Argos need to be properly understood and managed to 
deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all stakeholders 
alongside management of business as usual.
Mitigation
The business strategy is focused on the following:
— We know our customers better than anyone else;
— We will be there wherever and whenever they need us;
— We will offer great products and services at fair prices;
— Our colleagues make the difference; and
— Our values make us different.
The progress against strategic programmes and any risks to delivery, 
such as the ability to implement and deliver change and new business 
initiatives, are regularly reviewed by the Board and the overall 
strategy is reviewed at the annual two-day Strategy Conference. 
The Operating Board also holds regular sessions to discuss strategy. 
This activity is supported by a dedicated strategy team. To 
ensure the strategy is communicated and understood, the Group 
engages with a wide range of stakeholders including shareholders, 
colleagues, customers and suppliers on a continual basis. In 
addition, management performs ongoing monitoring of business 
as usual performance to determine indicators of potential negative 
performance as a result of change initiatives. 
Colleague engagement, retention and capability 
Risk
The Group employs 195,000 colleagues who are critical to the 
success of our business. Attracting and maintaining good 
relations with talented colleagues and investing in their 
training and development are essential to the efficiency 
and sustainability of the Group’s operations. Delivery of the 
strategic objectives, including integration with Argos and 
progress on multi-channel and digital, increases the risk impact 
of an inability to attract, motivate and retain talent, specific 
skill sets and capability. In addition, the challenging trading 
environment requires a focus on efficient operations which 
may include change initiatives impacting colleagues, therefore 
presenting a risk of loss of colleague trust or engagement.
Mitigation
The Group’s employment policies and remuneration and benefits 
packages are regularly reviewed and are designed to be competitive 
with other companies, as well as providing colleagues with fulfilling 
career opportunities. In addition to strong leadership and nurturing of 
talent by line managers, processes are also in place to identify talent 
and actively manage succession planning throughout the business. 
Ongoing reviews are performed to understand the nature of capability 
and specific skill sets required to deliver objectives. This is supported 
by embracing new ways of attracting talent and our corporate value 
‘Great Place to Work’ reinforces our commitment to giving people the 
opportunity to be the best they can be. 
Colleague surveys, performance reviews, listening groups, 
communications with trade unions, regular communication of 
business activities and colleague networking forums such as Yammer, 
the updated colleague portal (Our Sainsbury’s) and colleague learning 
portal are some of the methods the Group uses to understand and 
respond to colleagues’ needs. As change initiatives are implemented, 
the methods described above will continue to be employed to 
understand and maintain colleague trust and engagement.
Data security 
Risk
It is essential that the security of customer, colleague and 
company confidential data is maintained. A major breach of 
information security could have a major negative financial 
and reputational impact on the business. The risk landscape 
is increasingly challenging with deliberate acts of cybercrime 
on the rise, targeting all markets and heightening the risk 
exposure. 
Mitigation
A Data Governance Committee is established and is supported by 
focused working groups looking at the management of colleague 
data, customer data, information security, commercial data and 
awareness and training. Senior appointments have been made 
into roles specifically focused on data governance and information 
security. The Chief Information Security Officer continues to develop 
the Information Security Strategy and build the necessary capability 
to deliver against that strategy. The Head of Data Governance focuses 
on improving how we handle data across the organisation. Various 
information security policies and standards are in place which focus 
on encryption, network security, access controls, system security, 
data protection and information handling. A review of key third 
parties who hold sensitive customer or colleague data continues 
to take place, and progress is monitored by the Data Governance 
Committee. A risk based security testing approach across Group 
IT infrastructure and applications is in place to identify ongoing 
vulnerabilities.
Environment and sustainability 
Risk
Environment and sustainability are core to Sainsbury’s values. 
The key risk facing the Group in this area relates to reducing 
the environmental impact of the business with a focus on 
reducing packaging and new ways of reducing waste and 
energy usage across stores, depots and offices.
Mitigation
A number of initiatives are in place, which are being led by the 
Environmental Action Team and the Corporate Responsibility 
Steering Group, to reduce our environmental impact and to meet our 
customers’ expectations in this area.

section on pages 24 to 39.
 43 Strategic Report Financial and treasury risk 
Risk
The main financial risks are the availability of short and long-
term funding to meet business needs and fluctuations in 
interest, commodity and foreign currency rates. The business 
has acquired full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank which presents 
a risk that the Group’s financial performance and position may 
be negatively impacted if the Bank transition and performance 
are not delivered as planned. In addition, there remains a risk 
around pensions as the Group operates two defined benefit 
pension arrangements that are subject to risks in relation to 
liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates, life expectancy 
and inflation and their alignment to the value of investments 
and the returns derived from such investments.
Mitigation
The Group Treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s 
liquid resources, funding requirements, interest rate and currency 
exposures and the associated risks as set out in note 23 on page 
139. The Group Treasury function has clear policies and operating 
procedures which are regularly reviewed and audited.
Sainsbury’s Bank operates an enterprise wide risk management 
framework. The principal financial risks relating to the Bank 
and associated mitigations are set out in note 23 to the financial 
statements on page 139. 
With regard to pensions, investment strategies are in place which 
have been developed by the pension trustees, in consultation with 
the Company, to manage the volatility risk of liabilities, to diversify 
investment risk and to manage cash. Both Group defined benefit 
schemes are closed to future accrual.
Health and safety – people and product 
Risk
Prevention of injury or loss of life for both colleagues and 
customers is of utmost importance. In addition, it is paramount 
to maintaining the confidence our customers have in our 
business.
Mitigation
Clear policies and procedures are in place detailing the controls 
required to manage health and safety and product safety risks 
across the business and comply with all applicable regulations. These 
cover the end-to-end operation, from the auditing and vetting of 
construction contractors, to the health and safety processes in place 
in our depots, stores and offices to the controls in place to ensure 
people and product safety and integrity. 
In addition, established product testing programmes are also in place 
to support rigorous monitoring of product traceability and provide 
assurance over product safety and integrity. Supplier terms and 
conditions and product specifications set clear standards for product/
raw material safety and quality which suppliers are expected to 
comply with.
Process compliance is supported by external accreditation and 
internal training programmes, which are aligned to both health and 
safety laws and Sainsbury’s internal policies. In addition, resource 
is dedicated to manage the risk effectively, in the form of the Group 
Safety Committee and specialist safety teams.
Political and regulatory environment
Risk
There remain heightened levels of political and regulatory 
uncertainty in the UK following the referendum vote to leave 
the EU in June 2016, the triggering of Article 50 in March 2017, 
and the general election in June 2017. This uncertainty is 
expected to continue for the foreseeable future until EU exit 
negotiations have been completed and alternative trade deals 
have been put in place. This situation may adversely impact 
trading performance across the sector. An increasing focus 
on localism to drive and deliver policy and current legislative 
requirements including Business Rates, Workplace Pensions, 
the National Living Wage and Apprenticeship Levy place a 
cumulative burden on Sainsbury’s.
Mitigation
We continue to engage actively with governments, administrations 
and regulatory bodies. We publically communicate matters where 
we believe industry change is required with a view to enabling fair 
competition that is beneficial to our customers. We communicate 
our views, and those of our customers and colleagues, regarding 
geopolitical issues with the aim of informing the debate and 
ensuring our opinions are represented in the policy and decision 
making processes.
Trading environment and competitive landscape
Risk
Effective management of the trading account is key to the 
achievement of performance targets. The sector outlook 
has been and is set to remain challenging. The challenging 
trading environment, driven by ongoing competitive retail 
pricing combined with growing inflationary cost pressures, 
may adversely impact performance. There is also an ongoing 
risk of supplier failure, with possible operational or financial 
consequences for the Group.
Mitigation
We adopt a differentiated strategy with a continued focus on 
delivering quality products and services with ‘universal appeal’, at 
fair prices, helping our customers Live Well for Less. This is achieved 
through the continuous review of our product quality, key customer 
metrics, monitoring of current market trends and price points across 
competitors, active management of price positions, development of 
sales propositions and increased promotion and marketing activity. 
We continue with our commitment to provide customers even better 
value with lower regular prices. In delivering our strategic plan, 
including our price investment, we will maintain the strength of our 
balance sheet and have therefore identified a series of measures 
to conserve cash in the business. Through these measures we will 
deliver sustainable operating cost savings. With regards to supplier 
continuity, Sainsbury’s maintains regular, open dialogue with key 
suppliers concerning their ability to trade.
44 Strategic Report Statement of viability
1 How Sainsbury’s assesses its prospects
The Group’s business activities and strategy are central to assessing 
its future prospects. These, together with factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 01 to 53. The financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows and liquidity are highlighted in the Financial Review 
on pages 46 to 53. The Group manages its financing by diversifying 
funding sources, structuring core borrowings with long-term 
maturities and maintaining sufficient levels of standby liquidity.
The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through its corporate 
planning process. This includes an annual review which considers 
profitability, the Group’s cash flows, committed funding and liquidity 
positions and forecast future funding requirements over three years, 
with a further two years of indicative movements. The most recent 
was signed off in November 2016, and refreshed in March 2017 as part 
of the normal budgeting process. This is reviewed by the Operating 
Board and ultimately by the PLC Board with involvement throughout 
from both the CFO and CEO. Part of the Board’s role is to consider the 
appropriateness of any key assumptions, taking into account the 
external environment and business strategy. 
In performing the above analysis, the Directors have made certain 
assumptions around the availability of future funding options, 
including the ability to raise future finance. 
The scenarios above are hypothetical and severe for the purpose of 
creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of 
the Group; however, multiple control measures are in place to prevent 
and mitigate any such occurrences from taking place. In the case 
of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group 
in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation. These 
include reducing any non-essential capital expenditure and operating 
expenditure on projects, as well as not paying dividends. 
2 The assessment period
The Directors have determined that the three years to March 2020 is 
an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. 
This period is consistent to that used for the Group’s corporate 
planning process as detailed above, and reflects the Directors’ best 
estimate of the future prospects of the business. 
3 Assessment of viability
To make the assessment of viability, additional scenarios have 
been tested over and above those in the corporate plan, based 
upon a number of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties (as 
documented on pages 42 to 44). The scenarios were overlaid into the 
corporate plan to quantify the potential impact of one or more of 
these crystallising over the assessment period.
Whilst each of the risks on pages 42 to 44 has a potential impact 
and has been considered as part of the assessment, only those that 
represent severe but plausible scenarios were selected for modelling 
through the corporate plan. These were:
Scenario modelled
Link to principal risks and 
uncertainties
Scenario 1
Forecast savings targets are not achieved
The Group Corporate Plan currently assumes £160 million of synergies as a result of the HRG acquisition in the third full-year post acquisition, 
along with £500 million of cost savings to offset inflationary pressures by the end of 2017/18. A scenario has therefore been modelled in which 
all planned savings/synergies are not realised in the years planned and are delayed by one year during the assessment period.
— Business strategy and change
Scenario 2
Data breaches
The impact of any regulatory fines has been considered. The biggest of these is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fine for data 
breaches, which will be enacted in May 2018. This was considered both in isolation and in conjunction with a fall in sales volumes as a result of 
any reputational brand damage.
— Data security
Scenario 3
Legal breaches
Similar to the above, we considered the reputational impact of any legal or health and safety incidents, modelling a fall in sales volumes in the 
year of occurrence. We also considered regulatory fines such as those levied by the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).
— Health and safety, people and product
— Political and regulatory environment
Scenario 4
Brexit
The impact of the UK’s decision to leave the EU was considered. Scenarios were modelled assessing potential impacts of weakening sterling 
foreign exchange rates in all years, as well as World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs being applied to inventory purchases in year three of the 
assessment period.
— Political and regulatory environment
— Trading environment and competitive 
landscape
Scenario 5
Bank transition
It was considered what level of sustained loss would be required in Sainsbury’s Bank before its capital ratios were breached, leading to 
additional material funding requirements from the Group.
— Financial and treasury risk
The results of the above stress testing showed that the Group would 
be able to withstand the impact of these scenarios occurring over the 
assessment period.
4 Viability statement
Taking into account the Group’s current position and principal risks 
and uncertainties, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three years to March 2020.
5 Going concern
The Directors also considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements, which are shown 
on pages 99 to 185.
 45 Strategic Report 46
Financial 
Review
Dear Shareholder,
2016/17 has been a pivotal year in Sainsbury’s 
history, with the acquisition of Home Retail Group 
plc (HRG) on 2 September 2016. From an underlying 
trading perspective this has had a significant 
impact on the financial results, with £3,175 million 
(including VAT) of Argos (including Argos Financial 
Services) sales and £77 million of underlying profit 
before tax consolidated into the Group income 
statement for the 27 weeks Sainsbury’s owned 
the business. 
Sainsbury’s Group sales (including VAT) were up 12.7 per cent to £29,112 
million and improved 0.4 per cent when excluding the impact of the HRG 
acquisition. On a 52-week rolling basis Sainsbury’s market share (as measured 
by Kantar for the 52 weeks to 26 February 2017) declined 23 basis points, 
due to continued price investment and the continuing pace of new store 
expansion from the discounters. Discounters’ combined market share 
increased by 99 basis points, with the ‘big four’ declining on average by 35 
basis points. However, there was like-for-like transaction growth across all 
channels – supermarkets, convenience and groceries online.
Sainsbury’s continues to operate in a competitive and uncertain trading 
environment, impacting margins. In 2016/17, retail underlying operating profit 
decreased by 1.4 per cent to £626 million (2015/16: £635 million) reflecting 
lower like-for-like sales, investment in the customer offer and cost inflation. 
This was partly offset by cost savings of £130 million and a contribution from 
Argos of £77 million. Retail underlying operating margin declined 32 basis 
points to 2.42 per cent. Underlying profit before tax (UPBT) declined by 1.0 per 
cent to £581 million (2015/16: £587 million), and profit before tax of £503 
million (2015/16: £548 million) was down 8.2 per cent as a result of a £78 
million charge recognised outside of underlying results. 
Sainsbury’s Bank continues to perform in line with expectations. We have 
now migrated all of our savings customers and ATMs onto the new, more 
flexible banking platform. This has given us the opportunity to launch 
into the mortgage market in April 2017. Argos Financial Services (AFS) also 
transferred to the Bank in September, with its net £615 million customer loan 
book. This has enabled the Group to refinance the intercompany funding 
for AFS through increased customer deposits and wholesale funding – 
a significantly cheaper way to fund the Group than external debt. As a result 
the Group repaid the draw-down on the Revolving Credit Facility used for the 
cash consideration of the HRG acquisition.
The HRG acquisition completed on 2 September 2016. The economics of the 
deal were uniquely well set for Sainsbury’s, both in terms of the £160 million 
of EBITDA synergies we are now confident of achieving six months earlier 
than expected in 2018/19, and our ability to finance the deal through our 
refinancing of the AFS loan book. Final consideration was just under £1.1 
billion – paid for in cash and shares. The fair value of net assets acquired was 
just over £1.0 billion, resulting in goodwill of £58 million. The fair value of net 
assets acquired included a net £615 million customer loan book and £322 
million of net cash (after the capital return to HRG shareholders).
The balance sheet remains strong with a significant reduction in net debt. 
Net debt at £1,477 million (£1,971 million treating the perpetual securities as 
debt) has reduced £349 million since the 2015/16 year-end, mainly as a result 
of continued strong cash generation from our retail operations, the financing 
of the acquisition of HRG and further working capital improvements, offset by 
exceptional pension payments, capital expenditure and dividends paid. The 
Group has facilities of £3.9 billion with only £2.7 billion drawn at the end of the 
year. Like many other companies, we have seen a significant fall in discount 
rates since the year-end. This has increased the Sainsbury’s pension scheme 
IAS 19 accounting deficit (net of deferred tax) to £679 million (2015/16: £389 
million deficit), and the acquired HRG pension scheme deficit (net of deferred 
tax) is £171 million as at 11 March 2017. 
Underlying basic earnings per share decreased 9.9 per cent to 21.8 pence 
(2015/16: 24.2 pence), reflecting the fall in underlying profits and the effect of 
additional shares issued during the year, as a result of the HRG acquisition. 
Basic earnings per share decreased 26.8 per cent to 17.5 pence (2015/16: 23.9 
pence), lower than the underlying earnings per share due to the £78 million 
charge recognised outside of underlying results and a change in tax rate due 
to the comparatively smaller benefit of a one per cent revaluation of non-
underlying deferred tax balances (2015/16: two per cent).
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 6.6 pence (2015/16: 
8.1 pence), making a full-year dividend of 10.2 pence per share (2015/16: 
12.1 pence per share).

Group sales (including VAT) increased by 12.7 per cent. Retail sales (including

contribution from Argos, a 0.2 per cent contribution from new Sainsbury’s
Sainsbury’s LFL sales, excluding fuel, declined by 1.0 per cent in the first 
half, and by 0.1 per cent in the second half, driven by continued food price 
deflation which slowed in the second half. 
On a 52-week rolling basis Sainsbury’s market share (as measured by 
Kantar) declined 23 basis points, due to continued price investment and the 
continuing pace of new store expansion from the discounters. Discounters’ 
combined market share increased by 99 basis points, with the ‘big four’ 
declining on average by 35 basis points. However, there was like-for-like 
transaction number growth across all channels – supermarkets, convenience 
and groceries online.
Fuel sales grew 4.2 per cent, however as Argos sales contribution of 14.5 per 
cent is now included within sales growth (excluding fuel), this rate of growth 
was, in effect, dilutive to sales growth (including fuel).
 
space (excluding extensions and replacements and net of Pharmacy), and 
a Sainsbury’s like-for-like (LFL) sales decline of 0.6 per cent.
Our multi-channel strategy enables customers to shop whenever, wherever 
and however they want. The convenience business grew sales by over six per 
cent. Groceries online grew by eight per cent year-on-year, with order growth 
of nearly 12 per cent being partially offset by a reduction in basket size due 
to deflation and a lower number of items per basket. Sainsbury’s clothing 
and general merchandise offer continued to grow sales ahead of the market, 
supported by continued range development and the roll-out of new space.
Argos sales have contributed 14.5 per cent growth since acquisition and Argos 
like-for-like sales were up 4.1 per cent in the second half.
Contribution from Sainsbury’s net new space (excluding extensions, 
replacements and the disposal of the Pharmacy business which completed 
on 31 August 2016) is expected to be around 0.6 per cent for the full-year 
with a first half contribution of 0.6 per cent and a second half contribution 
of 0.6 per cent.
 47 Strategic Report 48
After the impact of the disposal of the Pharmacy business, net new 
space contribution is expected to reduce to 0.1 per cent for the full-year 
with a negative contribution of 0.3 per cent in the first half and a positive 
contribution of 0.6 per cent in the second half.
Space
The contribution from Sainsbury’s net new space (excluding extensions, 
replacements and the disposal of the Pharmacy business) was 0.8 per cent 
in 2016/17 (2015/16: 1.3 per cent). The impact of the disposal of the Pharmacy 
business reduces this to 0.2 per cent in 2016/17.

In 2016/17, Sainsbury’s opened six new supermarkets (2015/16: six new 
supermarkets), and closed two supermarkets. Convenience continues to grow, 
with 41 new stores opened in 2016/17 (2015/16: 69 stores). Eight convenience 
stores were closed in the year.
Net of replacements, closures and disposals, closing Sainsbury’s space 
of 23,397,000 sq ft was 0.8 per cent higher than last year (12 March 2016: 
23,202,000 sq ft).
In 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects to open three new supermarkets and around 
25 new convenience stores.
In 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects to open around 135 Argos Digital stores in 
supermarkets, resulting in around 175 Argos Digital stores in supermarkets 
by the end of the year. In addition, we expect to open a further ten Habitat 
stores within supermarkets in 2017/18.
In the first half of 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects to close 39 Argos stores within 
Homebase, with 18 to remain open longer.
Retail underlying operating profit
Retail underlying operating profit decreased by 1.4 per cent to £626  
million (2015/16: £635 million), reflecting lower LFL sales, investment in  
In 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects cost inflation in the two to three per cent 
range. We expect efficiency savings of around £145 million in 2017/18. We 
remain on track to deliver the strategic target of £500 million of savings 
over three years by the end of 2017/18 and are developing plans to deliver a 
further three year £500 million cost saving target from 2018/19 onwards as 
we simplify the business.
We expect the first half 2017/18 Group underlying profit to be lower than 
the second half 2017/18 as a result of: the consolidation of first half Argos 
operating loss; and the annualisation of 2016/17 price investment and the 
second half 2016/17 step-up in cost inflation due to the effect of the four per 
cent wage increase for store colleagues effective from 28 August 2016.
We expect depreciation and amortisation of around £700 million, an increase 
of around £70 million as a result of the consolidation of a full-year of Argos.

Argos acquisition impact on retail underlying profit
On 2 September 2016, Sainsbury’s completed the acquisition of HRG. 
Argos contributed £3,110 million of sales (including VAT) and £77 million 
of underlying profit before tax to retail performance since the point of 
acquisition (which includes £5 million of EBITDA synergies).
Previously HRG analysed their business as Argos, Homebase, financial 
services, central activities and interest income. Homebase has now been 
sold. The financial services element of HRG is now included within the 
Group’s Financial Services segment, and guidance on the effect of this is 
now included within the Sainsbury’s Bank guidance. The remaining Argos 
and central activities segments of HRG will be combined into the Group’s 
Retailing segment.

The consolidation of Argos has added an underlying profit contribution of 
£72 million in 2016/17 before synergies and Homebase transaction, separation 
and restructuring impact. The pre-acquisition loss of £27 million is not 
consolidated. Indicatively, a full-year profit contribution from Argos would 
have been £45 million.
Sainsbury’s announced as part of the transaction to acquire HRG, that the 
Group expected to achieve £160 million of EBITDA synergies by the end of the 
first half of 2019/20. Due to the acceleration of some of the activity, we now 
expect to deliver these in 2018/19. The synergies are derived from three areas:
Synergies from Argos stores in Sainsbury’s – £75 million. We will 
relocate some existing Argos stores into nearby Sainsbury’s supermarkets, 
as well as opening Argos stores in supermarkets where there is no Argos 
presence nearby. This also gives cross-selling opportunities within Sainsbury’s 
stores to the current food offer and a wider range of general merchandise 
products in Argos to Sainsbury’s customers. At the same time we will benefit 
from lower operating costs, particularly rent and rates.
Cost synergies from central and support – £70 million. We will 
remove duplication and overlap from both central and support functions at 
Financial Services total income increased to £347 million following 
a consolidation of AFS on 2 September 2016.
Financial Services delivered an underlying operating profit of £62 million, 
a 4.6 per cent decrease year-on-year. This decrease was mainly a result 
of the investment required to enter the mortgage market and the impact 
of reduced interchange fees.
Sainsbury’s Bank cost/income ratio has increased by 100 basis points as 
a result of the strategic costs incurred on products and infrastructure which 
are expected to drive improved performance in future years. 
Homebase separation
HRG announced on 18 January 2016 that the sale of Homebase would give 
rise to £75 million of additional exceptional costs in relation to transaction, 
separation and restructuring. Up to the date of the acquisition, HRG had 
incurred £30 million of these costs and incurred a further £4 million in  
Sainsbury’s and HRG. We will be able to realise product purchasing benefits 
from best practice and the combined Group’s scale.
Other revenue synergies – £15 million. We will sell Sainsbury’s clothing, 
homewares, seasonal and leisure ranges through the existing Argos network.
In order to achieve these synergies, £130 million of exceptional integration 
cost and £140 million of exceptional integration capital expenditure will 
be required. Exceptional costs will include the relocation of property, 
dilapidations, lease break costs and redundancy costs. Exceptional capital 
expenditure is required to reformat supermarket space and for fitting out 
the new Argos stores. The updated expected phasing of the synergies, 
exceptional costs and exceptional capital expenditure is shown below.
In 2017/18, we expect incremental EBITDA synergies of £58 million, resulting 
in total EBITDA synergies of £65 million since acquisition. EBITDA synergies of 
£160 million will be realised in 2018/19 (six months early).
Argos integration costs are expected to be around £60 million, integration 
capital expenditure is expected to be around £90 million.
Sainsbury’s Bank active customers increased 3.5 per cent year-on-year 
to 1.77 million (2015/16: 1.71 million). The acquisition of AFS added a further 
1.84 million customers in 2016/17.
Net interest margin increased by 30 basis points year-on-year to 4.4 per cent 
(2015/16: 4.1 per cent) driven by the acquisition of AFS that operates a higher 
risk and return operating model (excluding AFS, net interest margin was 
3.9 per cent, a 20 basis point decrease year-on-year). Bad debt levels as a 
percentage of lending increased to 0.8 per cent (2015/16: 0.4 per cent), also 
as a result of the AFS operating model. The Tier 1 capital ratio decreased by 
250 basis points year-on-year to 13.3 per cent (2015/16: 15.8 per cent), the 
primary drivers were increases to intangible assets and growth in customer 
lending. This growth in lending has led to an increase in the savings balance

from the original estimate, with £15 million of the cost to be incurred  
in 2017/18.
 49 Strategic Report of 28 per cent to £4,105 million (2015/16: £3,209 million). Loan balances 
including AFS increased by 39 per cent to £4,713 million, due to an increase 
in Sainsbury’s Bank loan and credit card balances (13.4 per cent and 32.7 
per cent respectively), as well as the addition of AFS store card balances of 
£710 million.
We have made good progress with our Bank transition programme. We 
have now delivered our flexible core platform, a new website, a new contact 
centre and migration of our savings customers took place successfully in 
September 2016, along with the migration of all our ATMs. We launched our 
new insurance offer in early 2017 and our new mortgage offer in April 2017, 
and our loans platform build is complete and now in test – we expect it to 
be operational by the end of 2017/18. Following the acquisition of HRG, we 
will now take the opportunity to create a common cards operating platform 
which we expect to launch by summer 2018. Spend to date totals £352 million, 
and we expect to spend a further £125 million to complete the transition – 
but with a significantly increased scope including the integration of AFS, 
insurance and mortgages. As a result of the growth opportunities Sainsbury’s 
Bank now offers, we are well set to deliver strong profit growth.
At the end of the first half, AFS was transferred to Sainsbury’s Bank and 
refinanced with the following key steps:
— £100 million capital injection from J Sainsbury plc to Sainsbury’s Bank
— New customer deposits and a wholesale loan were raised by 
Sainsbury’s Bank
— Sainsbury’s Bank lent AFS circa £600 million by way of an 
intercompany loan
— AFS repaid its current circa £600 million intercompany loan with HRG 
subsidiaries which have previously funded the business
— HRG subsidiaries paid a dividend to J Sainsbury plc of circa £600 million
— The £448 million draw down on the Revolving Credit Facility used as 
consideration for the HRG acquisition was repaid in full
AFS holds a loan book with gross receivables of £699 million, offset by a 
provision of £63 million resulting in a 9.1 per cent provision as a percentage 
of receivables.
In 2017/18, underlying operating profit growth is expected to be ten per cent.
Capital injections into the Bank are expected to be £160 million to £190 million 
in 2017/18. This is to cover card and loan platforms, regulatory capital and 
growth in loans, cards and mortgages.
Sainsbury’s Bank transition cost is expected to be around £55 million 
(2016/17: £60 million) and transition capital costs are expected to be around 
£30 million (2016/17: £16 million).
Underlying net finance costs
Underlying net finance costs decreased by £2 million year-on-year to £119 
million (2015/16: £121 million), due to lower interest costs as a result of lower 
net debt, offset by the full-year effect of the perpetual securities coupons.

— Profit on disposal of properties includes the profit on the completion of 
the Nine Elms store which is a mixed use development opened in August 
2016. Investment property fair value movements reflect the difference 
between the current and previous market values. The net impairment 
and onerous contract charge relates to lease exit and break costs and 
movements in the market value of land.
— The Group incurred £22 million of costs relating to the one-off legal and 
advisory fees in relation to the acquisition of HRG. Argos integration 
costs for the year of £27 million were part of the previously announced 
£130 million required over the three years in order to achieve the EBITDA 
synergies of £160 million. The Homebase separation and restructuring 
costs for the year of £4 million were part of the previously announced 
£75 million upon the sale of Homebase.
— Sainsbury’s Bank transition costs of £60 million (2015/16: £59 million) 
relate to the costs incurred in transitioning to a new, more flexible banking 
platform. 
— Business rationalisation includes £98 million profit on disposal of the 
Pharmacy business, offset by £26 million costs incurred closing non 
key businesses to enable the Group to focus on its core strategy. This 
included the closure of Netto, Sainsbury’s Entertainment and Phoneshops. 
£57 million was incurred on cessation of non core IT projects.
— Internal restructuring costs of £33 million relate to changes to our store 
colleague structures and working practices.
— The coupons on the perpetual securities are added back as accounting 
standards determine that for statutory reporting purposes they are 
treated as dividends. The increase year-on-year reflects a full-year charge 
compared to a part-year charge in the previous year. Non-underlying 
finance movements mainly relate to a gain recognised in fixed power 
purchase agreements due to an increase in the forecast forward energy 
prices. Acquisition adjustments of £8 million (2015/16: £3 million) reflect 
the unwind of fair value adjustments arising from the Sainsbury’s Bank 
and Home Retail Group acquisitions. Pension financing charge was £16 
million (2015/16: £22 million) and defined benefit scheme expenses were 
£8 million (2015/16: £6 million).
50 Strategic Report Taxation
The income tax charge was £126 million (2015/16: £77 million), with an 
underlying tax rate of 23.2 per cent (2015/16: 20.8 per cent) and an effective 
tax rate of 25.0 per cent (2015/16: 14.1 per cent). The underlying rate was higher 
than last year, mainly driven by the comparatively smaller benefit of a one 
per cent revaluation of underlying deferred tax balances in 2016/17 (2015/16: 
two per cent). The effective tax rate was higher than last year due to the 
comparatively smaller benefit of a one per cent revaluation of non-underlying 
deferred tax balances (2015/16: two per cent), and was also increased by 
non-tax deductible exceptional costs and the tax impact of transactions in 
2016/17, including the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the Nine Elms 
replacement store.

In 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects the full-year underlying tax rate to be between

Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share decreased by 9.9 per cent to 21.8 pence 
(2015/16: 24.2 pence) reflecting the fall in underlying profits and the effect of 
additional shares issued during the year, as a result of the HRG acquisition 
and a higher year-on-year effective tax rate.
The weighted average number of shares in issue was 2,049.0 million (2015/16: 
1,920.8 million), an increase of 128.2 million shares or 6.7 per cent primarily 
driven by the additional shares issued on acquisition of HRG. 
In total, 261.1 million shares were issued as part of the HRG acquisition. These 
shares increased the full-year weighted average number of shares by 130.3 
million. In 2017/18, the full effect of the shares issued on the weighted average 
number of shares will be 261.1 million.
Basic earnings per share was 17.5 pence (2015/16: 23.9 pence). The basic 
earnings per share was lower than the underlying basic earnings per share 
due to the items excluded from underlying results.

Dividends
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 6.6 pence per share (2015/16: 
8.1 pence). This will be paid on 7 July 2017 to shareholders on the Register 
of Members at the close of business on 12 May 2017, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM. In line with the Group’s policy to keep the dividend 
covered two times by underlying earnings, this will result in a decrease to the 
full-year dividend of 15.7 per cent to 10.2 pence per share (2015/16: 12.1 pence). 
The proposed dividend will be, subject to approval, recommended by the 
Board on 2 May 2017 and, as such, has not been included as a liability as at  
11 March 2017.
Sainsbury’s plans to maintain a full-year dividend covered two times by our 
full-year underlying earnings.
Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc
On 2 September 2016, Sainsbury’s completed the acquisition of HRG for a total 
consideration of £1,093 million, primarily through a cash and shares offer, 
comprising 55 pence per share (£447 million) and 0.321 shares in J Sainsbury plc 
for each share held of HRG (£261 million new shares at a share price of £2.461).
The fair value of assets acquired at that date was £1,035 million. This 
included net £615 million customer loan book, £322 million of cash (after 
the capital return to HRG shareholders of £226 million, mainly in relation to 
the sale of Homebase by HRG) and £98 million of other net assets. The fair 
value of assets acquired was less than the fair value of the consideration 
by £58 million, which has been treated as goodwill. Putting aside the cash 
acquired and the customer loan back (which can be converted to cash), 
Sainsbury’s effectively purchased the business for £156 million (£1,093 million 
consideration, less £615 million customer loan book and £322 million of 
net cash).
Financing
The Group’s key financing objectives are to diversify funding sources, to 
minimise refinancing risk and maintain appropriate contingent liquidity. 
As at 11 March 2017, Sainsbury’s has drawn debt facilities of £2,700 million 
(including the perpetual securities) and undrawn committed credit facilities 
of £1,150 million. The Group also holds £85 million of uncommitted facilities 
which were undrawn as at 11 March 2017.
The principal element of Sainsbury’s core funding comprises two long-term 
loans of £670 million due 2018 and £743 million due 2031 both secured on 
two ring-fenced portfolios of the Group’s property assets. The Group has 
other secured facilities, namely a £200 million ‘Green’ Loan due 2019 and a 
five year £450 million Convertible Bond was entered into in November 2014. 
Further the Group has borrowed £138 million via six hire purchase facilities in 
respect of in-store moveable assets and finance leases. The Group maintains 
a syndicated committed Revolving Credit Facility of £1,150 million. The facility 
is split into two tranches, a £500 million Facility (A) maturing in May 2019 and 
a £650 million Facility (B) maturing in May 2020. As at 11 March 2017, £nil had 
been drawn from Facility (A) (March 2015/16: £nil) and £nil from Facility (B) 
(March 2015/16: £nil).
 51 Strategic Report Property related items generated £28 million in the year which is net of 
£92 million spent on the acquisition of the Chiswick freehold and Argos 
integration capital expenditure. In the prior year £155 million was generated 
from property related items and £125 million was received in advance of 
completion of the sale of Pharmacy which completed in the current year.
The HRG acquisition and AFS loan book reduced net debt by £457 million. 
— Cash paid on acquisition of HRG (including £3 million on share issuance) 
totalled £450 million. 
— HRG held £548 million in cash at the point of acquisition of which £226 
million was immediately paid as a capital return to the HRG shareholders.
— Following the acquisition the Group was reorganised with the AFS business 
being transferred to the Financial Services division. This refinancing of the 
Argos Financial Services loan book generated £585 million.
Sainsbury’s expects 2017/18 year-end net debt to remain around £1.5 billion. 
We expect net debt to reduce over the medium term.
Group capital expenditure
Group capital expenditure was £703 million; made up of £639 million net retail 
capital expenditure and £64 million Financial Services capital expenditure. 
Core retail expenditure of £547 million was up 0.9 per cent (2015/16: £542 
million), driven by the addition of Argos core retail capital expenditure of  
£38 million. 
Net retail capital expenditure was £639 million (2015/16: £543 million), which 
includes the purchase of a freehold at Chiswick, where there may be future 
potential for a mixed use development, and £18 million Argos integration 
capital expenditure.

Net debt and retail cash flows
Group net debt includes the capital injections in to Sainsbury’s Bank, but 
excludes Sainsbury’s Bank’s own net debt balances. Sainsbury’s Bank 
balances are excluded because they are required for business as usual 
activities. As at 11 March 2017, net debt was £1,477 million (12 March 2016: 
£1,826 million), a decrease of £349 million since the 2015/16 year-end. If the 
perpetual securities were treated as debt, net debt would increase from 
£1,477 million to £1,971 million (12 March 2016: £2,320 million).

Operating cash flow before changes in working capital declined in the year 
to £1,172 million due to the fall in Group operating profit. However, due to 
continued focus on working capital and a reduction in capital expenditure, 
free cash flow increased in the year to £345 million (2016/17: £296 million).  
Cash generated by operations were used to fund dividends and exceptional 
pension contributions. Dividends of £230 million were paid in year, which are 
covered 1.5 times by free cash flow. Exceptional pension contributions of £199 
million were made in the year which included the £125 million announced 
in August 2016, to the Sainsbury’s defined benefit pension scheme, and 
£74 million to the HRG defined benefit pension scheme which included £24 
million in relation to the sale of Homebase and £50 million which was agreed 
as part of the acquisition of HRG.
52 Strategic Report In 2017/18, Sainsbury’s expects core retail capital expenditure including 
business as usual Argos capital expenditure (excluding Sainsbury’s Bank and 
Argos integration capital expenditure) to be around £600 million. Core retail 
capital expenditure is expected to be around £600 million per annum over the 
medium term.
Argos integration capital expenditure is expected to be around £90 million.
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
The ROCE on the 14 point average basis over the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 
was 8.8 per cent (2015/16: 8.8 per cent), a year-on-year decrease of four basis 
points. Excluding the retirement benefit obligation (net of deferred tax) from 
capital employed, ROCE over the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 was 8.0 per cent 
(2015/16: 8.3 per cent), 29 basis points lower than for the 52 weeks to 12 March 
2016. ROCE decline was mainly due to the fall in underlying operating profit 
and the additional capital employed following the HRG acquisition.

Property value
As at 11 March 2017, Sainsbury’s estimated market value of properties, 
including our 50 per cent share of properties held within property JVs, was 
£10.3 billion (12 March 2016: £10.6 billion). The £0.3 billion decrease was mainly 
due to a reduction in market rental values and a small yield movement. 
Defined benefit pensions
At 11 March 2017, the net defined benefit obligation for the Group was £974 
million (including HRG and the unfunded obligation). The increase in the 
deficit from the prior year-end is primarily driven by the consolidation of the 
HRG scheme, as well as a significant actuarial loss due to a fall in the discount 
rate from 3.65 per cent to 2.70 per cent.
Following agreement of the valuation of both schemes the Group is 
committed to make annual contributions of £124 million to the scheme 
(Sainsbury’s scheme: £84 million; Argos scheme: £40 million). The next 
triennial valuations are for the March 2018 year-ends for both schemes.

 57 Governance Report Compliance Statement
The Board is committed to strong governance and, during the year, 
the Company has complied with all the provisions of the UK Corporate

applied the Governance Code’s main principles throughout the year. 
Published by the Financial Reporting Council, the Governance Code is

Corporate 
Governance
Dear Shareholder
The Board this year has maintained its particular 
focus on the Company’s strategic direction and on 
driving the creation of sustainable long-term value 
for shareholders. This is particularly important in 
a sector like ours which is experiencing significant 
change and which is highly competitive.
Over an extended period, the Board considered the potential attractions of 
Argos and was closely engaged this year with the acquisition of its owner, 
Home Retail Group plc (HRG), believing that this will accelerate the strategy 
announced in 2014. We are pleased with the pace of integration and the 
opportunities that Argos is providing. We are now a multi-channel, multi-
product retailer with a market-leading digital offer and nationwide fast-track 
delivery capabilities. 
Food is our core business and it is our priority to offer customers great quality 
and choice at fair prices which differentiates us in an increasingly competitive 
market. The Board reviews our supermarket business on a regular basis to 
ensure it is well positioned to meet the challenges of the current trading 
environment. Our focus is on creating the differentiated offer our customers 
want and achieving cost savings and efficiencies. 
Another of our priorities has been the delivery of the growth strategy of 
Sainsbury’s Bank. During the year we have had a number of opportunities to 
meet the Bank’s management team and Board, to discuss progress and agree 
the key actions for the short and medium term. 
Upon the completion of the HRG acquisition, we reviewed our senior 
management structure and made some important changes to the executive 
team. We take succession at Board and senior management level very 
seriously and believe that we have management of the highest calibre. We 
announced that John Rogers, our Chief Financial Officer since 2010, would 
be appointed to the key role of Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury’s Argos. 
In this role he will continue to drive the integration of Argos with Sainsbury’s 
general merchandise business, and deliver the ongoing digital transformation 
across Sainsbury’s Argos. John and the experienced Management Board at 
Sainsbury’s Argos have made an excellent start in their new roles. 
We welcomed Kevin O’Byrne as our new Chief Financial Officer in January 
2017. Kevin has a wealth of retail and financial experience from his previous 
senior roles at Kingfisher, Dixons and Poundland and has a track record in 
growing businesses. We are sure that he will make a great contribution to the 
business and to the Board. We are also pleased that Simon Roberts is joining 
Sainsbury’s as Retail and Operations Director on the Operating Board. Simon 
previously held senior positions at Boots and Marks & Spencer and we believe 
that he will have a major impact on our future success. 
We are sorry that Mary Harris will be stepping down from the Board at this 
year’s AGM having completed over nine years of service as a Non-Executive 
Director. I would like to thank Mary for her very valuable contribution over 
that time and particularly for her skilful leadership of the Remuneration 
Committee over recent years. I am pleased that Susan Rice will take over as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on Mary’s departure. A search for 
a new Non-Executive Director to join the Board is under way.
As a Board, we take governance very seriously and we regularly discuss and 
review our ways of working and our effectiveness. During the year, we asked 
Manchester Square Partners (MSP) to carry out a review of our effectiveness 
and are now working through an action plan, based on their feedback, to 
build on our strong foundations. We believe that Sainsbury’s unique values 
and culture play a key role in our success and we were therefore particularly 
pleased with MSP’s conclusion in this regard that “the Board embodies and 
leads by example on the behaviours and culture which Sainsbury’s aims to 
drive throughout the organisation”. Their review is described in detail on  
page 61.
We continue to have a mix of men, women and ethnic backgrounds on our 
Board. This diversity is in line with good governance and appropriate for both 
Sainsbury’s and our customer base. We continue to focus on increasing our 
diversity and inclusivity at all levels of the business and I draw your attention 
to the detailed review on pages 39 and 65.

Key areas of focus of the Board
The Board and Committees have a scheduled forward programme of meetings. 
This ensures that sufficient time is allocated to each key area and the 
Board’s time together is used effectively. There is sufficient flexibility in the 
programme for specific items to be added to the agenda which enables the 
Board to focus on key matters relating to the business at the appropriate time.
The principal activities of the Board during the financial year included the 
following items, some of which were considered at each meeting, and others 
were reviewed periodically throughout the year:
Strategy
The Board continued to prioritise its reviews of the implementation of the 
agreed strategic plans, focusing particularly on the HRG acquisition, the  
core supermarket strategy and Sainsbury’s Bank. A two day strategy 
conference, with the attendance of the Board and Operating Board, was held 
in October. The strategy conference was a key opportunity for the Board 
to discuss, challenge and focus on strategy, including in-depth reviews of 
the retail market, competition, pricing and promotions, customer insights, 
Sainsbury’s Bank strategy and the five year corporate plan. The strategy 
conference is carefully structured to achieve a balance between presentations 
and time for debate and discussion. External advisers attended for part of 
the conference. During the year, the Board also received regular updates on 
progress against the strategy and, in July, it will agree the objectives and 
principal areas of focus for the next strategy conference. 
Risk management
During the year David Keens, the Audit Committee Chairman, gave detailed 
updates to the Board following each Audit Committee meeting on risk 
management and internal controls and the specific matters considered by 
the Audit Committee. The Director of Internal Audit attends at least one 
Board meeting a year as part of the Board’s overall review of the effectiveness 
of risk management and the system of internal controls. In addition, specific 
risks are regularly discussed. For instance, the Board receives an annual 
update and quarterly updates on health and safety, and food safety. One of 
the particular risks the Board also examined this year was data governance 
and information security and how the risks were being mitigated through a 
combination of people, process and technology change. 
Home Retail Group acquisition 
Given the strategic importance of the acquisition of HRG, the Board was fully 
engaged in planning, negotiating and approving the transaction, which is 
summarised below.
 Planning The Board had in depth discussions over 
several months about the benefits and 
potential long-term shareholder value 
that could be created through a potential 
acquisition of HRG. The Board provided 
challenge and guidance to the executive 
team. The Board’s detailed review confirmed 
that the combination of the businesses was 
attractive in principle for shareholders and 
customers of both companies.
Negotiation In November 2015, the Company approached 
HRG about the possibility of a combination 
of the two businesses. On 5 January 2016, 
Sainsbury’s announced a possible offer for 
HRG. A sub-committee was established to 
oversee the negotiations and due diligence, 
and to ensure robust governance. The Board 
approved the terms and conditions of the offer.
Completing 
the deal and 
planning the 
integration 
On 2 April 2016, the HRG Board announced 
they would recommend Sainsbury’s offer to 
their shareholders. During April to September, 
the Board had oversight of the progress of 
the transaction and supported the sub-
committee in making decisions on a timely 
basis. Relevant documentation was reviewed 
and approved by the Board. 
It was imperative that there was an 
organisational and operational plan in 
place to commence integration. The Board 
approved the appointment of John Rogers as 
Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury’s Argos 
on completion of the deal.
Post completion 
and integration
The acquisition completed on 2 September 
2016. The integration of the Argos business 
into Sainsbury’s started immediately. Regular 
updates on integration, synergies and trading 
performance and the emerging strategy of 
Sainsbury’s Argos were considered by the 
Board. The Board took the opportunity to 
meet the management team and visit stores.

Board operation and attendance
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year, including the two-
day strategy conference held in October. A significant number of additional  
ad hoc meetings and conference calls were also convened to deal with specific 
matters, particularly in relation to key decisions concerning the acquisition  
of HRG. 
The Board had a number of informal meetings during the year. These included 
informal meetings of the Board the day before most Board meetings, and 
meetings with individual members of the Operating Board and their leadership 
teams to receive updates on their specific areas of responsibility. In addition, 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors 
being present, and the Non-Executive Directors also met without the Executive 
Directors or the Chairman being present. 
All Directors were made aware of the key discussions and decisions of each of 
the four principal Committees by the Chairman of each Committee providing 
a detailed summary at the Board meeting following the relevant Committee 
meeting. Minutes of Board and Committee meetings were circulated to 
Directors shortly after those meetings took place.

and Committee meetings.

Notes: Ed Barker attended two meetings in his capacity as Interim CFO. The maximum number of meetings 
held during the year that each Director could attend is shown in brackets. Brian Cassin and Jean Tomlin were 
each unable to attend one Board meeting due to prior business commitments.
On the rare occasions that a Director is unavoidably unable to attend 
a meeting, the Chairman briefs them before the meeting so that their 
comments and input can be taken into account at the meeting, and 
provides an update to them after the meeting. 
Effectiveness
Board evaluation 
Key findings from 2015/16 review
1  Build on the strong links with the Board of Sainsbury’s Bank and the 
broader management team at the Bank.
  The Board has had regular opportunities to review the progress of 
Sainsbury’s Bank’s growth strategy during the year. The September Board 
meeting was held at the Bank’s offices in Edinburgh, giving the Board 
an opportunity to meet the Bank’s Board, including the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors, and the senior management team who made 
detailed presentations. 
2  Some specific items could be given more visibility at Board level, including 
the work to increase diversity at all levels across the business. 
  The Board received a detailed update on the Company’s diversity and 
inclusivity priorities at the strategy conference in October, with further 
updates at CR&S Committee and Board meetings. 
3  Continue to monitor the broader competitive landscape, given the extent 
of the multi-channel retail market and the pace of change. 
  The Board discussed the broader competition landscape at the strategy 
conference in October and frequently at Board meetings.
2016/17 review
The Board agreed that the 2016/17 review should be carried out by an 
external facilitator. Three different suppliers took part in a tender process 
and the Board determined that Manchester Square Partners (MSP) should 
be appointed to conduct the evaluation exercise of the Board and its 
Committees. MSP had carried out the previous external review in 2013/14 – 
this continuity was felt to be advantageous in tracking any changes in the 
Board’s effectiveness over that period. It was agreed that the review would 
explore a broad range of dimensions covering strategy, operational priorities, 
the Board’s role, its structure and balance, succession, risk management and 
governance. These themes were developed into a full written set of questions 
to ensure that the objectives of the Board review were met. 
The review was conducted from November 2016 to February 2017. MSP had 
access to the Board and strategy conference papers for the prior 12 months. 
Board members first completed a questionnaire and individual meetings 
were then held with all Directors, the Company Secretary, the Interim 
Chief Financial Officer, the Group HR Director, the Chief Executive Officer of 
Sainsbury’s Bank and the audit partner from Ernst & Young. As part of the 
process MSP attended and observed a Board meeting. MSP presented the 
conclusions to the Board at a meeting convened for that purpose and the 
Board discussed the key points and agreed certain actions. 
Following the presentation, the Senior Independent Director reviewed the 
Chairman’s performance with the other Directors and met him to provide 
feedback. The Chairman provided feedback to each Director on their 
individual contributions to the Board and, with each of them, considered their 
development priorities. 
MSP concluded that “the Board is functioning well and in line with first class 
corporate governance, the Board dynamics are excellent – this is a collegiate, 
consensual, cohesive and supportive but challenging Board with a high 
degree of mutual trust, respect and integrity”. 62 Governance Report 
Corporate Governance continued
MSP highlighted a number of positive themes which had 
emerged from the evaluation, which include:
— There is clarity and alignment on the role of the Board, the strategic 
priorities, key challenges and risks. 
— All Non-Executive Directors feel the need to challenge constructively 
and believe the quality of debate is high and has become more 
robust.
— The Board provides strong leadership and support to the business 
and is successfully overseeing a period of significant change.
— There is a strong sense of shared values. The Board embodies and 
leads by example on the behaviours and culture which Sainsbury’s 
aims to drive through the organisation.
— The pace has increased significantly, especially around strategy, 
decision making and execution.
— Risk is well monitored and managed.
— There are effective, efficient and thorough Board structures, 
processes and information flows.
 
The Board identified the following actions:
— Review the Board programme to continue to find sufficient time for 
strategy and deep dives on big topics, with integration of individual 
topics if possible.
— Develop more informative KPIs around digital activities and the 
competitive environment.
— Having discussed Mary Harris’s plans to step down from the  
Board at the AGM, start the succession process for an additional 
Non-Executive Director.
— Extend the timings of Board visits to the other business locations  
or suppliers in order to allow more time for interaction. 
— Find additional opportunities to meet the broader management 
teams.
 
It is anticipated that the 2018 Board evaluation exercise will be carried  
out internally.
Induction
We have a comprehensive and tailored induction programme in place for 
Directors in order for them to gain an understanding of all aspects of the 
Group, including our culture and values, strategy, sustainability, governance 
and the opportunities and challenges facing the business. The programme 
includes store and depot visits and meetings with other members of the 
Board, members of the Operating Board, senior management and external 
advisers. The programme is ongoing for Non-Executive Directors, who often 
meet members of the management team on an individual basis to continue 
to build up their knowledge of the Company or visit stores, depots and other 
business locations and also suppliers. Subsequent training is available on an 
ongoing basis to meet any particular needs.
During the year, Brian Cassin and Kevin O’Byrne joined the Board and 
John Rogers was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury’s Argos. 
David Keens continued his induction following his appointment to the Board 
in April 2015.
Brian Cassin 
Brian Cassin joined the Board on 1 April 2016. During his induction to date, 
Brian has met with members of the Board and had a series of one to one 
meetings with members of the Operating Board and senior management to 
get an insight into each of their areas of responsibility. He visited a number 
of stores including the new store at Nine Elms. He also attended a colleague 
listening group where he heard feedback from store colleagues and he met 
with external advisers to understand regulatory matters and obligations. 
David Keens
David Keens joined the Board on 8 July 2015. He has had a comprehensive and 
tailored induction which has continued this year and included further visits 
to operations around the Group which were particularly relevant to his role as 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. For more information see page 68.
Kevin O’Byrne and John Rogers also have continuing comprehensive 
inductions consistent with the scale and profile of their new executive roles.
Professional development, support 
and training 
We have a programme for meeting Directors’ 
training and development requirements. The 
Board programme includes regular presentations 
from management and informal meetings to 
build their understanding of the business and 
sector. This year a number of Board meetings 
were held at offsite locations including:
 
Marine Harvest
The Board held its June meeting at Sainsbury’s salmon supplier, Marine 
Harvest, at their Scottish office. Here the Board had the opportunity to meet 
with the Food Commercial Director, and the Trading Division leadership team 
and to discuss the overall trading strategy, including pricing and promotions, 
provenance and supplier relationships. The Board also received a presentation 
on Marine Harvest, met their management team and toured their facility. 
This has given the Board a greater understanding of Sainsbury’s trading 
strategy, focus on differentiation, supplier relationship management and the 
relationship with Marine Harvest.
 
Sainsbury’s Bank 
The Board held their September meeting at Sainsbury’s Bank in Edinburgh 
and met with Sainsbury’s Bank Non-Executive Directors, Chairman, Executive 
Committee and senior management. They discussed the opportunities and 
challenges facing the financial services sector, received a detailed overview 
of the Bank’s strategy including short and medium term plans and met the 
broader management team. 
 
Sainsbury’s Argos 
The Board met the Sainsbury’s Argos Management Board and senior 
management team, in Milton Keynes in November, and had the opportunity 
to discuss trading, integration and strategic plans, and to visit stores.
 
The Online Fulfilment Centre in Bromley-by-Bow
The Board discussed online strategy and toured the facility with the 
management team at the new Sainsbury’s Online Fulfilment Centre in 
Bromley-by-Bow. The purpose built Online Fulfilment Centre is 185,000 sq. ft. 
and has the capacity to fulfil 25,000 customer online orders per week. 
During the year the Company Secretary provided updates to the Board on 
relevant governance matters, Directors’ duties and obligations, and new 
legislation and its impact on the Company including the new Market Abuse 
Regulations and the Green Paper on Corporate Governance Reforms. Both the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees received regular updates on relevant 
accounting and remuneration developments, trends and changing disclosure 
requirements from external advisers and management. The Chairman, in 
collaboration with the Company Secretary and management, ensured that 
all Directors were properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and 
that they had sufficient, reliable and timely access to relevant information. 
Directors have access to independent professional advice if necessary 
and to the advice of the Company Secretary in fulfilling their duties and 
responsibilities.
Independence and conflicts of interest
The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria of the Governance Code 
on his appointment to the Board and all the Non-Executive Directors are 
considered to be independent. Each of the Directors has a duty to avoid a 
situation where he/she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The 
Company’s Articles of Association permit the Directors to authorise conflicts 
and potential conflicts, where appropriate. The Board has established 
procedures for the disclosure by Directors of any such conflicts, and also 
for the consideration and authorisation of these conflicts by the Board. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board considered and 
authorised each Director’s potential conflicts of interest during the year.   63 Governance Report
Whenever a Director takes on additional external responsibilities, the Board 
considers any potential conflicts that may arise. The Board continues to 
monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis. The 
Board has specifically considered the executive or non-executive roles that 
some of the Non-Executive Directors have with companies that may be 
suppliers to Sainsbury’s. The Board is satisfied that the independence of the 
Directors who have executive or non-executive roles with other companies is 
not compromised. 
Prior to appointment, each Non-Executive Director confirms that they will 
have sufficient time available to be able to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. During the year, the Board reviewed, in advance, disclosures by 
Non-Executive Directors seeking to undertake additional commitments. 
The Board remains confident that individual members are able to devote 
sufficient time to undertake their responsibilities effectively.
Relations with 
stakeholders
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications with 
stakeholders. 
Institutional shareholders
— Normal shareholder contact is the responsibility of Mike Coupe,  
Kevin O’Byrne and James Collins, Head of Investor Relations.
— The Chairman met with institutional shareholders and other large 
investors. The Senior Independent Director, Susan Rice, is also available  
to attend meetings as required. 
— The Company met regularly with its large investors and institutional 
shareholders who, along with sell-side research analysts, were invited to 
presentations by the Company immediately after the announcement of 
the Company’s interim and full-year results.
— Large investors and institutional shareholders also visited a number of 
stores and concessions.
— They are also invited to participate in conference calls following the 
announcement of the Company’s trading statements. The content of these 
presentations and conference calls are webcast and are posted on the 
Company’s website www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre so as to 
be available to all investors.
— While activity early in the year was constrained by Takeover Panel Rules 
relating to our offer for HRG, the Company met, through regular post-
results roadshows, ad hoc meetings, conference attendances and site 
visits in the UK, US and Europe, a total of 187 shareholders and potential 
investors in 229 meetings over the course of the year. 
Feedback from institutional shareholders
— The Board received regular updates on the views of major investors and 
the Investor Relations programme at each Board meeting.
— Makinson Cowell provided investor relations consultancy services to the 
Company and external analysis to the Board on the views of institutional 
investors and sell-side analysts. 
— Makinson Cowell additionally carried out an extensive Investor Study, 
covering share price performance, the share register, the Investor 
Relations programme and investor views on the retail market, 
communication, strategy and management. Key conclusions and 
recommendations arising from this survey were presented to the Board. 
— Non-Executive Directors also received regular market reports and broker 
updates from the Company’s Investor Relations department.
— Investors are increasingly interested in corporate responsibility matters, 
details of which can be found on pages 66 and 67. Information on 
countering bribery can be found on page 97. 
Private shareholders
— Our private shareholders are encouraged to access the Company’s  
Interim and Annual Reports and presentations on our website. Other 
useful information such as announcements, historic dividend records  
and shareholder communications is also available on the website 
 www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investors
AGM
— Shareholders had the opportunity to meet and question the Board at the 
AGM. There was a display of various aspects of the Company’s activities 
and Mike Coupe made a business presentation. This year the AGM will be 
held on 5 July 2017. 
— All resolutions proposed at the 2016 AGM were taken on a poll vote and 
were passed with significant majorities.
Suppliers
The Board receive regular updates on the trading strategy, and supplier 
relationship management was a key area of focus of the June Board 
meeting held at Marine Harvest’s facility in Scotland when Marine Harvest's 
management and the Trading Division Leadership team presented to the 
Board (page 62). The Company’s compliance with the Grocery Supply Code 
of Practice is monitored by the Audit Committee (page 73) and David Keens 
met the Grocery Code Adjudicator in his role as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Supplier relationship management was also discussed by the 
CR&S Committee and in two CR&S stakeholder meetings, Mike Coupe and 
Jean Tomlin had the opportunity to hold discussions with key suppliers and 
other stakeholders.
Colleagues
The CR&S Committee discussed insight on colleague engagement, and 
summaries of the key issues that were important to colleagues, at each of 
the meetings. It has been agreed that some of the Non-Executive Directors 
will meet colleagues from the National Great Place to Work Group to hear 
colleagues’ views on matters which are at the top of their agenda and share 
with them some of the items on the Board agenda. This will enhance the link 
between the Non-Executive Directors and colleague representatives.  Dear Shareholder
The Nomination Committee has overseen the 
Board’s succession planning during the year which 
has resulted in the appointments of John Rogers 
and Kevin O’Byrne to their new roles. We believe 
that they will carry out their responsibilities in a 
highly effective way, and that they will contribute 
significantly to our operational and strategic 
discussions, and complement the existing balance of 
skills and experience around the boardroom table. 
Nomination  
Committee
64 Governance Report 
Nomination Committee
Succession and diversity at Board and senior management levels are key 
aspects of our agenda. Our priorities over the year were as follows:
— To implement the succession plan for the Argos Chief Executive Officer 
role and ensure a smooth transition. 
— To plan and implement the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer. 
— To support succession at Operating Board and senior management levels, 
including the appointment of Simon Roberts as Retail and Operations 
Director, and the appointment of a new management board for 
Sainsbury’s Argos. 
— To plan succession at Non-Executive level in light of Mary Harris’ decision 
to step down from the Board at this year’s AGM, following over nine years 
of service to the Company. A search process for a new Non-Executive 
Director is under way. 
— To review our progress on becoming a more diverse and inclusive 
business. The Committee received a full update on the Company’s 
progress at the strategy conference in October and Directors continue to 
receive regular updates at Board meetings. 
— To oversee the Company’s approach to resourcing the needs of the 
business, developing our colleagues and recruiting new talent.
The Committee is pleased with the progress made on these priorities during 
the year and believes that the new appointments at Board and senior level 
position the business well for the future.
David Tyler
Chairman Succession planning
The Board takes succession planning for both Board members and senior 
management very seriously. All of the Non-Executive Directors are members 
of the Nomination Committee which is chaired by David Tyler. Mike Coupe is 
invited to attend meetings. During the year, the Committee held four formal 
meetings and there were regular updates on its various search processes  
and appointments.
At the strategy conference in October, the Committee reviewed succession 
plans, development and talent management for senior managers as well as 
progress on inclusivity throughout the business. In March 2017, following the 
Board evaluation, the Committee considered the balance, skills and diversity 
of the Board. As part of its succession planning the Committee agreed to start 
a search for a new Non-Executive Director in light of Mary Harris stepping 
down from the Board at the AGM, and discussed the preferred experience 
for the role specification. The Committee also approved the appointment of 
Susan Rice as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in July 2017. Susan 
has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since September 2015. 
Each of our Directors were recruited following a robust selection process 
which has been facilitated by independent executive search consultants. 
The Committee believes Sainsbury’s has a good balance and diversity 
amongst Non-Executive Directors, with several having extensive experience 
of retail and consumer-facing businesses and other highly relevant skills 
derived from serving in a range of major executive and non-executive 
positions throughout their careers. 
The Committee oversaw the two key appointments of John Rogers and  
Kevin O’Byrne during the year.
During the search process Ed Barker, Sainsbury's Director of Group Finance, 
was appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer from 5 September 2016 until  
9 January 2017. 
Kevin O’Byrne
 Identify. Using the agreed brief, the Committee reviewed and 
shared feedback on a list of internal and external candidates 
from independent executive search consultants Egon Zehnder 
International. The diverse list of candidates was appraised against the 
key competencies and experience required for the role. 
 I n t e r v i e w. Mike Coupe and Angie Risley (Group HR Director) led 
a series of interviews with the shortlisted candidates. Preferred 
candidates then met with David Tyler, David Keens and John Rogers 
following which the Committee met to discuss feedback. 
Select. After further meetings with Non-Executive Directors, Kevin 
O’Byrne was recommended for appointment by the Committee. 
He was identified as the preferred candidate particularly due to 
his wealth of retail and finance experience, and his track record in 
growing businesses.
Appoint. Kevin’s appointment as Chief Financial Officer was approved 
and announced on 7 November 2016 and took effect on 9 January 2017.
John Rogers
John was promoted to the role of Chief Executive Officer of 
Sainsbury’s Argos upon completion of Sainsbury's acquisition of HRG 
in September 2016. John’s experience goes beyond his most recent 
role as Chief Financial Officer. His vast experience as a leader in the 
business in strategy, digital, online, financial services and property 
since he joined Sainsbury’s in 2005 made John the ideal candidate to 
lead Sainsbury’s Argos. 
As Chief Executive Officer he will continue to drive the integration of 
Argos with Sainsbury’s general merchandise business, and deliver the 
ongoing digital transformation across Sainsbury’s Argos.
Diversity and inclusivity
We want to be ‘the most inclusive retailer'. We will achieve this aspiration by 
recruiting, retaining and developing diverse and talented people and creating 
an inclusive environment where everyone can be the best they can be and 
where diverse views are listened to. The Board is highly supportive of the 
initiatives to promote diversity and inclusivity throughout the business. For 
instance, Jean Tomlin attended Sainsbury’s first Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic 
(BAME) event, delivering a key note speech to over 200 BAME colleagues 
about her career journey, experiences and challenges.
The Board receives regular updates on inclusivity and both the CR&S 
Committee and the Nomination Committee had detailed presentations on the 
range of priorities and the progress against them during the year. More about 
these initiatives and the progress being made can be found on page 39. 
Our gender diversity statistics can be found in the table below. For most of 
the year, two members of the Operating Board (22%) were women, however 
following the departure of Sarah Warby in January 2017, the number fell to one.

 65 Governance Report Dear Shareholder,
Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer, 
where people love to work and shop, by living up 
to our values for customers, colleagues, suppliers, 
shareholders and wider society. This is critical to 
helping our customers to live well for less.
Throughout our 148-year history, we have always taken our responsibilities to 
society seriously. Today, the need for business to build trust by, for example, 
tax transparency or respecting human rights, is more important than ever. 
While we experience political change and uncertainty in some aspects of 
society, we know that we can still play an important role in supporting our 
customers in areas that matter to them. 
Enabling people to live healthier lives, protecting the environment, supporting 
our colleagues and people who work throughout our supply chains and 
championing issues that affect our local communities, creates valuable 
opportunities to deepen our relationships with all our stakeholders while 
reducing risk.
Corporate 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Committee
As Chairman of the Board’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
Committee, I oversee the governance of our Sustainability Plan which 
spans our five values: Respect for our environment, Living healthier lives, 
Sourcing with integrity, Great place to work, and Making a positive difference 
to our community.
Since we refreshed our Sustainability Plan in 2015, we have made significant 
progress in responding to changes in the world around us and deepening our 
understanding of the support our customers want from us. 
For example, as part of our Respect for our environment value, we have 
continued to increase the impact of our Waste less, Save more campaign. 
This initiative was developed as a direct response to the findings in our Closer 
to Customers insight programme which revealed that customers wanted help 
with reducing food waste at home.
Many of our customers also want help to live healthier lives. Through our 
Living healthier lives value, we have reformulated more of our products to 
reduce salt, saturated fat and sugar, and we have continued to support young 
people in communities across the UK to do more exercise and eat more 
healthily through our flagship Active Kids scheme. Since its launch in 2005, we 
have invested more than £173 million in sports and cooking equipment and 
experiences for schools. 
I am also particularly proud of the great progress we have made in Sourcing 
with integrity, towards developing sustainability standards across our 
key raw materials. The credibility and quality of this work relies on close 
partnership and co-creation with many independent, expert organisations 
around the world which help us to ensure we have world-class standards 
addressing economic, social and environmental issues. We place great value 
on these collaborations and I would like to thank all that have contributed 
to our journey. 
As part of our Great place to work value, we strive to be the most inclusive 
retailer. During the year, we have launched our Embrace the Difference 
inclusion campaign internally with a host of engagement activities and 
training to support colleagues to embrace the differences they see in others. 
We’re the largest employer to have reached the Investors in People Gold 
standard  and the only retailer to achieve three consecutive Gold awards, and 
the feedback we received recognised that our values are a core part of our 
DNA. I was also pleased to see acknowledgment of our progress on gender, 
LGBT matters and apprenticeships – all underpinned by strong colleague 
advocacy and open communication that runs as a golden thread through 
our business. 
As work to integrate and align activity across the Sainsbury’s Group 
progresses in the year following the acquisition of HRG, we are identifying 
opportunities to have an even greater, positive impact on society. Despite 
this being a year of significant change for colleagues at Argos, some key 
activities, such as fundraising for Macmillan Cancer Support and the Irish 
Cancer Society – part of our Making a positive difference to our community 
value – have continued with real commitment. Building on this, we are 
confident that 2017/18 will be an exciting year for developing our approach 
to sustainability across the whole Group. 
We continue to listen to all our stakeholders – customers, colleagues, suppliers 
and investors – to make sure we have the most relevant and effective 
strategy, leverage the knowledge and experience of experts and remain at the 
forefront of sustainability between now, 2020 and beyond. For me, what I am 
most proud of is how we work diligently across the organisation to deliver on 
our Sustainability Plan commitments and our values, day in and day out. 
Further information about our approach can be found at www.j-sainsbury.

broader trading statements.
Jean Tomlin
Chairman, Corporate Responsibility  
and Sustainability Committee
66 Governance Report
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee
Our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CR&S) Committee is 
chaired by Jean Tomlin and attended by its members Mary Harris and Mike 
Coupe. David Tyler also attends the meetings. It met twice during the year 
and discussed our progress across each of our five values as well as our 
Sustainability Plan as a whole. For example, it reviewed the development 
of the Waste less, Save more customer food waste initiative and plans for 
the integration of Home Retail Group sustainability activities into the wider 
Sainsbury’s strategy. Through these meetings the CR&S Committee also 
receives regular updates on colleague and customer views on issues relating 
to our values and Sustainability Plan so that we can respond appropriately. 
These formal Committee meetings were supported by two CR&S stakeholder 
meetings that were hosted by Jean Tomlin and Mike Coupe. Key external 
stakeholders, including representatives from the Government, industry, 
non-governmental organisations and key suppliers, joined us to discuss 
issues that relate to our values. Our Sourcing with integrity event focused 
on the role that Sainsbury’s can play in supporting the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals and stakeholders at our Living healthier lives event 
discussed the findings of our latest Active Kids research and the challenges 
faced by 11-14 year olds in leading a healthier lifestyle. These events are an 
important way for us to hear new perspectives and be challenged on issues 
that are important for our business and society. We feed what we learn 
back into our teams so that we can respond through how we deliver our 
Sustainability Plan. 
The Committee is supported by an internal CR&S governance structure 
whereby senior directors in the business have responsibility for each of our 
five values and sit on our CR&S Steering Group, chaired by Mike Coupe. The 
members of this biannual Steering Group are shown opposite.

 67 Governance Report Dear Shareholder,
This year, the wide-ranging activities of the 
Committee have included the acquisition and 
integration of HRG, monitoring the transition 
of Sainsbury’s Bank and the management of 
data security. 
Audit  
Committee
This is my second year on the Board and second report as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. Building on the previous year, I have continued to visit 
Company operations around the Group, including data centres, business 
continuity facilities, online fulfilment services and supplier premises. There 
were further visits to Sainsbury’s Bank in Edinburgh and to the newly 
acquired Argos Contact Centre in Widnes and Head Office in Milton Keynes. 
Retail store tours, both escorted and unannounced, are a regular feature.
The Committee provides oversight of the risk profile across the Group. This is 
undertaken by reviewing the principal risks and uncertainties and through 
regular updates from internal and external auditors. A new development 
this year has been the inclusion of Sainsbury’s Argos into the Group risk 
management approach and into the activities of the Committee. The 
Company’s principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 42 to 44.
We monitor the audit and risk activities of the operations of Sainsbury’s Bank; 
including the continued transition from Lloyds Banking Group and recent 
integration of Argos Financial Services. 
Data security and governance continues to be an area of focus for the 
Committee. Good progress is being made in identifying and managing data 
risks and in preparing for the introduction of new legislation in 2018. 
This year’s external Board evaluation process considered the role and 
effectiveness of the Committee. I am pleased to report that feedback relating 
to the Committee was positive and that we continue to provide the necessary 
support to the Board. 
The significant financial and reporting matters considered by the Committee 
during the year are set out from page 69.
I am indebted to my co-Directors on the Committee for their time and insight 
during this past year. We, together with internal colleagues and external 
advisers, covered a wide range of topics and governance matters. Our 
intention is to continue in a similar, diligent manner over the coming year.

Cassin as its other members, all of whom are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Susan Rice stepped down as a member of the Committee on  
4 May 2016. 
The Board has determined that David Keens has recent and relevant financial

Significant financial and reporting matters
An accounting and tax paper was prepared by management and presented 
to the Audit Committee four times during the year. This provided detail on the 
main financial reporting judgements and issues. Specific accounting papers 
were also prepared when considered necessary.
The Committee considered the following significant financial and reporting 
issues during the year:
Impairment of financial and non-financial assets
The impairment of financial and non-financial assets was considered 
by the Committee, this is particularly appropriate in today’s 
challenging marketplace. As disclosed in note 2 of the Notes to the 
Financial Statements, a review for impairment triggers is performed 
at each reporting date by considering if any current or future events 
suggest the recoverable value of certain assets may be less than their 
carrying value. 
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of recoverable 
value and relevant judgements made. An impairment and onerous 
contract charge of £37 million was recognised in the year, as well as 
£57 million in relation to IT assets written off.
Complex property transactions
There was one major property transaction in the year, being the 
opening of the Nine Elms store in August 2016. 
The Committee has reviewed the concepts of this transaction in 
a previous year to ensure that all accounting and tax issues are 
identified and appropriately presented in the accounts, including 
whether amounts recognised reflect the overall substance of these 
transactions. Please refer to note 3 of the Notes to the Financial 
Statements for property profits recognised in the year.
Pensions accounting
Following the acquisition of HRG during the year, the Group now holds 
two defined benefit schemes: the Sainsbury’s defined benefit scheme 
and the HRG defined benefit scheme.
The Committee reviewed a summary of the key assumptions used 
in arriving at the valuations and obligations for both defined benefit 
pension schemes for the half-year and year-end reporting including 
inflation, discount and mortality rates. Benchmarking is assessed to 
ensure that the assumptions are appropriate. 
Of particular note this year was the effect that the UK Referendum vote 
had on discount rates following a downward move in corporate bond 
yields, and the impact on the IAS 19 accounting deficit and therefore 
distributable reserves in the Group. The year-end reported discount rate 
was 2.7%, giving a consolidated IAS 19 pension deficit of £974 million 
before tax. 
Items excluded from underlying results
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published 
guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which 
applied to relevant communications released on or after 3 July 2016.  
In light of the ESMA guidance, additional disclosure is now also 
included on the APMs used by Sainsbury’s – please refer to page 190.
Items excluded from underlying results are reviewed by the 
Committee, and the Committee is satisfied that the Group’s 
presentation of these items is clear and that further disclosure is 
included where appropriate.

 69 Governance Report Sainsbury’s Bank reporting
The Committee receives updates on the key agenda items discussed 
at the Bank’s Audit Committee including accounting judgements and 
estimates and on all important operating and regulatory matters such 
as its liquidity, cash flows, capital adequacy and risk management 
processes. Representatives from the Bank Audit Committee and the 
Bank Internal Audit team attend meetings of the Committee at least 
twice a year. 
During the year the accounting judgements and estimates reviewed 
by the Committee have included impairment assessments of the 
loans and advances due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers, progress on 
the Bank transition, tax judgements and provisions and progress on 
the implementation of IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”.
Supplier income
Supplier income is considered by the Committee, and whilst the 
majority is calculated through a formulaic process, the Committee is 
satisfied with the controls in place to manage any areas of judgement 
and estimation.
The Committee ensures the Group provides adequate reporting, 
including income statement and balance sheet disclosures within 
the Financial Statements (from page 99) and is satisfied with the level 
of disclosure.
Acquisition of Home Retail Group
On 2 September 2016, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued 
share capital of HRG, a listed company based in the United Kingdom.
Significant work was undertaken to prepare for the integration of HRG, 
with the following areas in particular being considered by the Audit 
Committee:
— The approach to aligning the reporting dates of HRG and 
Sainsbury’s 
— The transfer of HRG financial services entities to Sainsbury’s Bank
— Alignment of accounting policies between HRG and Sainsbury’s
— Reviewed how the acquisition would impact the Group’s IFRS 8 
“Operating Segments” disclosures. Whilst an additional segment 
was identified, it was concluded that it met the aggregation 
criteria per IFRS 8 and the Group’s reported segments therefore 
remained as Retail, Financial Services and Property Investment.
— Reviewed the accounting and financial reporting for the 
acquisition. This included reviewing the assumptions made in 
relation to valuing the assets and liabilities, which resulted in 
net assets acquired of £1,035 million and goodwill of £58 million. 
Refer to note 31 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more 
information.
— The transition to Ernst & Young as auditors of Home Retail Group 
Updates to accounting standards
Management are currently preparing for the implementation of three 
new accounting standards:
— IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” effective for the year commencing 
11 March 2018
— IFRS 15 “Revenue” effective for the year commencing 11 March 2018
— IFRS 16 “Leases” effective for the year commencing 10 March 2019
We have reviewed impact assessments prepared by management 
on the transition to each of these accounting standards and the 
assumptions made. Additional disclosures in relation to each of these 
are included in note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
We note that within the External Audit report there is a risk associated with 
adjustments made to revenue. We have condensed this and have concluded 
that we have appropriate procedures and controls in place not to include this 
as a significant area of judgement.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
The Board is required to confirm that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
(see page 100). To enable the Board to make this declaration, there is a year-
end review process to ensure the Committee, and the Board as a whole, has 
access to all relevant information and, in particular, management’s papers 
on significant issues faced by the business. The Committee received a paper 
from management detailing the approach taken in the preparation of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Audit Committee, and all other 
Board members, also received drafts of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements in sufficient time to facilitate their review and enable them to 
challenge the disclosures if necessary. In addition, Ernst & Young reviewed 
the consistency between the narrative reporting of the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements.
Viability statement
The Committee has assessed whether three years continue to be an 
appropriate timeframe over which to make the viability statement. It was 
concluded that the current three year assessment period remains appropriate 
and this was reviewed and adopted by the Board. 
The processes underpinning the assessment of the Group’s longer-term 
prospects were reviewed.
The viability statement and our approach to assessing long-term viability can 
be found on page 45.
External auditor
Independence and objectivity of the external auditor
The independence and objectivity of the external audit function is a 
fundamental safeguard to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. 
In order to ensure their independence, the Audit Committee has overseen 
the Company’s policy which restricts the engagement of Ernst & Young in 
relation to non-audit services.
The policy is designed to ensure that the provision of such services does not have 
an impact on the external auditor’s independence and objectivity. It identifies 
certain types of engagement that the external auditor shall not undertake, 
including internal audit and actuarial services relating to the preparation of 
accounting estimates for the financial statements. It also requires that individual 
engagements above a certain fee level may only be undertaken with pre-
approval from the Audit Committee, or if urgent, from the Committee Chairman 
and ratified by the subsequent meeting of the Committee. The policy also 
recognises that there are some types of work where a detailed understanding 
of the Company’s business is advantageous. The policy is designed to ensure 
that the auditor is only appointed to provide a non-audit service where it is 
considered to be the most suitable supplier of the service.
The Audit Committee received a report on the non-audit services being 
provided and the cumulative total of non-audit fees. The cumulative non-
audit fees are capped at 70% of the average of the audit fees for the Group for 
the preceding three year period. 
The Audit Committee concluded that Ernst & Young remained objective 
and independent in their role as external auditors and that they continue to 
challenge management effectively. 
The Audit Committee confirms that it has complied with the provision of the 
Statutory Audit Services Order 2014.
Audit and professional fees paid to the external auditor
The Audit Committee reviewed Ernst & Young’s overall work plan, and 
approved their remuneration and terms of engagement. The majority 
of the non-audit work undertaken by Ernst & Young during 2016/17 was 
audit related assurance services and tax advisory services. These totalled 
£0.2 million. The total audit fees for the year in respect of the Group and 
subsidiaries were £1.9 million. For a breakdown on the fees please refer to 
note 5 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
Effectiveness of the external auditor
Ernst & Young were appointed in July 2015 as the Company’s auditor.
The Audit Committee reviewed Ernst & Young’s effectiveness during the 
year. Additionally, a questionnaire was completed by the members of 
the Committee with feedback sought from key stakeholders including 
70 Governance Report 
Audit Committee continued the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Director of Group Finance. The 
questionnaire included evaluation of the audit partner and audit team, the 
approach to the audit, communications with the Committee, how Ernst & 
Young supported the work of the Audit Committee, and their independence 
and objectivity. 
The Audit Committee concluded that Ernst & Young provided audit services 
efficiently and effectively and to a high quality. Areas for improvement 
or greater attention were discussed and shared with Ernst & Young and 
management. 
Appointment of the external auditor
The Audit Committee has made a recommendation to the Board to reappoint 
Ernst & Young as the Company’s auditor for the 2017/18 financial year. 
Accordingly, a resolution proposing the reappointment will be tabled at  
the 2017 AGM.
Audit Quality Review
The Audit Quality Review team of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
reviewed Ernst & Young's audit of the Group's Annual Report and Financial 
Statements 2016. The FRC have given us a copy of their report, which has been 
reviewed by the Committee and discussed with Ernst & Young. The report 
does not give the Committee any concerns over the quality, objectivity or 
independence of the audit.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the system 
of internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. Certain of these 
responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit Committee as outlined 
below. The risk management process is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Company’s business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The risk management process and the system of internal controls have 
been in place for the whole year, up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, and accord with the UK Financial Reporting 
Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting and the Governance Code. 
The Board received updates on risk management and internal controls from 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All Committee papers and minutes 
were made available to the whole Board.
The Board also received reports relating to safety, other relevant risks, 
controls and governance. Any specific matters which could have affected the 
Company’s reputation were reported to the Board as they occurred.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and has ensured that any required remedial action on any identified 
weaknesses has been, or is being taken.
The diagram on the right provides a high-level overview of the key risk 
management activities undertaken by the Operating Board, Audit Committee 
and Sainsbury’s divisional management that allow the Board to fulfil their 
obligations under the UK Corporate Governance Code and Companies Act 
2006. The annual risk management process concludes with the Board’s robust 
assessment of the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties, including 
those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity, and the completion of an annual internal controls certification. 
Corporate risk management process
Accepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, the risk 
management process is designed to identify key risks and to provide 
assurance that these risks are fully understood and managed in line with 
management’s risk appetite. The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness 
of the risk management process at least annually. 
The Operating Board maintains an overall corporate risk map which is 
reviewed twice a year by the Audit Committee and formally discussed 
with the Board. The risk map captures the most significant risks faced by 
the business and identifies the potential impact and likelihood at both a 
gross level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level (after 
consideration of mitigating controls). The Operating Board discusses and 
agrees the level of risk that the business is prepared to accept for each key 
corporate risk. The target risk position is captured to reflect management’s 
risk appetite where this differs to the current net position. The Operating 
Board reviews the corporate risk dashboards during the year, comprised of 
key risk indicators, to ensure they identify any potential risk movements 
towards or away from their risk appetite. This enables the Operating Board to 
agree and monitor appropriate actions as required.
The risk management process is embedded at the Operating Board level 
and supported by a divisional risk management process. Operating Board 
members certify annually that they are responsible for managing their 
business objectives and internal controls so as to provide reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance that the risks in their areas of responsibility are 
appropriately identified, evaluated and managed. 
Internal Audit provides the Audit Committee with a risk management update 
twice a year which provides detail of the key risk activities undertaken at the 
divisional and corporate level. 
The risk management process is illustrated in the diagram on page 72.  
The specific risk activities undertaken in the financial year 2016/17 were  
as follows:
— Internal Audit facilitated risk workshops with each divisional leadership 
team to identify the key risks which may prevent the achievement 
of divisional objectives. Each divisional management team produced 
and maintained a divisional risk map and supporting risk register. 
The likelihood and impact of each key risk was evaluated at a gross 
level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level (after 
consideration of mitigating controls). Management’s risk appetite 
was reviewed and further actions to mitigate the risk were identified 
as required. 
— The implementation of divisional risk actions were tracked by Internal 
Audit and reported to divisional leadership teams periodically. Risk action 
implementation rates are reviewed by the Operating Board regularly to 
monitor progress towards their risk appetite.

also provided through the delivery of the Internal Audit risk based plan.
— The Operating Board reviewed and challenged the output of the divisional 
risk process including new risks, risk movements and key risk themes. 
Where divisional risks are aligned to corporate risks the corporate risk 
map was updated as appropriate.
— Corporate risk dashboards comprised of key risk indicators have been 
developed to enable risk owners to identify any potential movements 
towards or away from their risk appetite. The Operating Board regularly 
reviewed the risk dashboards, reflecting any risk movements on the 
corporate risk map as required. 
— Internal Audit facilitated a game-changer and horizon scanning risk 
workshop to identify external and uncertain risks over a five to ten year 
timeline. Key themes and outputs from this exercise were reviewed  
by the Operating Board to identify the potential impact on key  
corporate risks.
— Internal Audit provided independent assurance to management and the 
Committee as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk management 
process; 
— Internal Audit conducted a risk appetite survey in December 2016 with 
the Operating Board to assess the extent to which consideration of risk 
appetite is embedded in the business. The output of the survey was 
presented to the Operating Board and Audit Committee for review and 
discussion; and
— The Board reviewed the risk management process and corporate 
risks at the year-end and approved the Company’s principal risks and 
uncertainties (as set out on pages 42 to 44).

Internal controls
The system of internal control encompasses all controls, including those 
relating to financial reporting processes (including the preparation of the 
consolidated Group accounts), operational and compliance controls and those 
relating to risk management processes. It also includes the controls over 
Sainsbury’s interests in joint ventures.
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls systems 
on an ongoing basis, enabling a cumulative assessment to be made. The 
processes used during the year to support this assessment are as follows:
— Discussion and approval by the Board of the Company’s strategy, plans 
and objectives, and the risks to achieving them
— Review and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts, including 
those for both revenue and capital expenditure
— Regular reviews by management of the risks to achieving objectives and 
mitigating controls and actions
— Regular reviews by management and the Committee of the scope and 
results of the work of Internal Audit across the Company and of the 
implementation of their recommendations
— Regular reviews by the Committee of the scope and results of the work of 
the external auditors and of any significant issues arising 
— Regular reviews by the Audit Committee of accounting policies and levels 
of delegated authority
— Regular reviews by the Board and the Committee of material fraudulent 
activity and any significant whistleblowing by colleagues or suppliers and 
actions being taken to remedy any control weaknesses
Additional matters
Internal Audit
The Committee has regularly reviewed the Internal Audit department’s 
resources, budget, work programme, results and management’s 
implementation of required actions and its recommendations.
The Director of Internal Audit reports to the Committee Chairman and has 
direct access to all members of the Committee and the Chairman. She is  
given the opportunity after each meeting to meet with the Committee 
separately without management being present. She has regular meetings 
with all Committee members. The purpose, authority and responsibility of 
Internal Audit are defined in the Internal Audit Charter which the Committee 
reviews annually.
The effectiveness of the Internal Audit department is monitored and 
reviewed over the course of the year. The Committee has set KPIs which 
are used to assist it in reviewing the effectiveness of Internal Audit. The 
Director of Internal Audit reported against these KPIs twice during the year, 
highlighting any failure to achieve the target scores and explaining the reason 
therefore. In addition, an effectiveness questionnaire was completed by the 
Chairman of the Board and the members of each of the Committees and the 
Operating Board. The Committee concluded that Internal Audit continued to 
be effective. 
Whistleblowing
The Company’s whistleblowing procedures ensure that arrangements are 
in place to enable colleagues and suppliers to raise concerns about possible 
improprieties on a confidential basis. All issues raised have been investigated 
and appropriate actions taken. Any significant issues are highlighted to the 
Audit Committee.
Sainsbury’s Bank
Sainsbury’s Bank is a subsidiary of the Company which has an independent 
board responsible for setting the Bank’s strategy, risk appetite and annual 
business plan as well as the day-to-day management of the business. 
The Board of the Bank has an independent Chairman and a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Bank will continue to provide to each Audit Committee an update 
on performance and the chairs of the Bank’s Audit Committee and Risk 
Committee will present to the Audit Committee. There is alignment 
between the Sainsbury’s Internal Audit function and their colleagues within 
Sainsbury’s Bank equivalent team.
Grocery Supply Code of Practice 
In February 2010, a new Grocery Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP) was 
implemented following the recommendation of the Competition Commission. 
Each grocery retailer to which it applies had to appoint a Code Compliance 
Officer whose duties include hearing disputes between suppliers and the 
relevant retailer. Sainsbury’s appointed the Director of Internal Audit as its 
Code Compliance Officer.
GSCOP requires that each grocery retailer (to which it applies) delivers an 
annual compliance report to the Groceries Code Adjudicator which has been 
approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Furthermore, a summary 
of the compliance report must be included in our Annual Report and Financial 
Statements.
Summary annual compliance report
Sainsbury’s has invested significant time and resource in providing 
comprehensive training to all relevant colleagues as required under GSCOP 
which is reinforced by online knowledge testing. Sainsbury’s has also 
dedicated internal resource to provide all relevant colleagues with day-to-
day advice and guidance. The Trading Division, in consultation with the 
Legal Services Department and the Code Compliance Officer, continues to 
assess the adequacy of policies and procedures in place to support GSCOP 
awareness and compliance.
A small number of alleged breaches of GSCOP have been received in the 
reporting period, which were dealt with within the Trading Division using  
our standard internal escalation procedure. The resolution of five of these 
alleged breaches was facilitated by the Code Compliance Officer during  
the reporting period. 74 Governance Report 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual 
Statement 
from the 
Remuneration 
Committee 
Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
With changing customer expectations and a  
rapidly evolving business, the incentive pay 
outcomes for 2016/17 reflect our performance  
in the context of a volatile UK retail grocery market. 
Key remuneration decisions for 2016/17
Total remuneration for the Executive Directors has decreased by 11 to 16 per 
cent as a result of our incentive arrangements reflecting our performance 
during the year.
— Annual bonus – Our Executive Directors are committed to developing our 
strategy and driving the performance of our business in the challenging 
environment. The profit and sales targets set at the start of the year 
were not achieved. However, good progress was made on a number of 
key strategic, operational and customer initiatives and there was strong 
performance against individual objectives. In light of the overall results, 
the Committee determined that no cash annual bonus should be paid in 
respect of the year.
— Deferred Share Award – The Committee determined that awards 
under the DSA should be granted at 70 per cent of the maximum for all 
participants recognising, in particular, the continued performance of the 
business in relative terms and the significant achievements made on our 
strategic goals. This award is deferred into shares. 
— 2014 Future Builder – Following two consecutive years of no payout, an 
element of the 2014 Future Builder vested as a result of our performance 
against the cash flow and relative sales measures. A performance 
multiplier of 0.9x was applied to the core award for all participants 
resulting in vesting of 22.5 per cent of the maximum. Half vests in May 
this year and the remaining half will vest in May 2018 after a further 
holding period.
2017 Remuneration Policy
The previous policy was approved by shareholders in 2014 and, therefore, we 
are bringing a revised Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval at the 
2017 AGM, in line with the regulatory requirement to renew our policy at least 
once every three years.
We have consulted extensively with our major shareholders regarding 
the new policy and as part of this review process we looked at alternative 
long-term incentive structures which could adapt to the dynamic nature 
of the grocery sector. While the Committee saw the merits of alternative 
structures, we recognised that shareholder views on these remain mixed at 
this stage. Consequently we have opted to maintain the key features of the 
Remuneration Policy previously approved by shareholders in 2014. 
While the overall approach and pay levels remain unchanged, we have taken 
the opportunity to make a small number of technical changes to reflect 
evolving market and best practice. These include:
— Introduction of a two-year holding period for Future Builder awards, 
meaning that shares will not normally be released until five years 
after grant; 
— Shareholding guidelines increased from 1.5 times to 2.0 times salary  
for Executive Directors (CEO will remain at 2.5 times);
— Reduction in retirement benefits for any future appointment from  
30 per cent to 25 per cent; and
— Strengthened recovery provisions (malus and clawback).
It is important for senior executive pay to be performance-based and  
to encourage sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. It is also  
in shareholders’ interests for the Company to be able to attract and retain  
the talented leaders required to deliver strong performance in  
challenging markets.
However, as a business with around 195,000 colleagues, we are also acutely 
aware of the wider context in which the Committee makes key decisions. 
We continue to consider wider colleague reward when determining pay 
arrangements for the Executive Directors, and this remains a fundamental 
part of our approach to pay. There is a strong focus on core values across 
the business, and this is reflected in the strategy. Taking a responsible 
and sustainable approach to business is a defining characteristic of 
the Sainsbury’s culture and this extends to the approach to executive 
remuneration.  75 Governance Report
Looking ahead
Salary review
In line with our policy, we have followed our normal approach to the review of 
salaries for the Executive Directors and have awarded both Mike Coupe and 
John Rogers a salary increase of 1.5 per cent effective March 2017, in line with 
other management colleagues. Kevin O’Byrne, who joined the Board as Chief 
Financial Officer in January 2017, was not eligible for an increase given his 
start date.
2016 and 2017 Future Builder
As we communicated in last year’s Report, the setting of performance criteria 
for the Future Builder award granted in May 2016 was delayed to ensure 
the measures and targets were relevant and meaningful in the context of 
the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc. The 
Committee ultimately decided that synergy targets should be added to the 
Future Builder to complement the existing Return on Capital Employed, 
Earnings Per Share, cash flow and costs savings measures. Details of these 
targets were published on our website during the year and are also set out in 
this year’s Remuneration Report on page 83.
The Committee has decided to retain this performance framework for awards 
to be granted during 2017, based on performance through to March 2020. We 
have recalibrated the ROCE targets in order to provide realistic but stretching 
goals reflecting the current and future prospects of the business as well as 
the retail sector as a whole over the next three years. The cost saving and 
synergy ranges have also been updated based on stated objectives over 
the period. Overall these provide an appropriately stretching incentive for 
participants. Further detail of targets for 2017 awards are set out on page 82.
The 2017 AGM
The Remuneration Committee remains firmly committed to the principle of 
pay for performance, ensuring that rewards for the senior leadership team are 
aligned with the experience of long-term shareholders, while also considering 
the pay and benefits of our wider workforce.
In line with the UK reporting regulations, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
will be put to a binding vote and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
put to an advisory vote at the AGM on 5 July 2017. 
Finally, as you will be aware, this is my last letter to you as Remuneration 
Committee Chairman as I am stepping down from the Board at the AGM. 
It has been a pleasure to work with an organisation such as Sainsbury’s

Summary of 2017/18 Remuneration Policy
 77 Governance Report Annual Report on Remuneration
The Committee takes a rounded approach to pay and considers a variety of 
factors when determining, and subsequently implementing, the policy for 
senior executives. It believes it is important to exercise sound judgement at 
all stages during the process to ensure that executive pay levels appropriately 
reflect performance and are aligned with the interests of shareholders. 
The Committee regularly reviews the overall structure of remuneration for 
senior executives to ensure that it continues to evolve and is aligned to the 
corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the interests of 
shareholders. When reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
considers pay practices across the Company and the retail sector more 
generally, the impact on colleagues, the cost to the Company, stakeholder 
views (including shareholders, governance bodies and colleagues) and best 
practice.
Remuneration principles
Our colleagues are a key part of the Company’s strategy and our overall 
reward strategy supports this. Our objective is to have a fair, equitable and 
competitive total reward package that supports our vision of being the most 
trusted retailer where people love to work and shop, encourages colleagues 
to perform in ways that deliver great service for customers, drives sales and 
provides opportunities for colleagues to share in Sainsbury’s success. This 
overall reward strategy is the foundation for the Remuneration Policy for 
senior executives.
The over-arching objectives of the Remuneration Policy are to ensure  
rewards are performance-based and encourage long-term shareholder  
value creation. The Remuneration Policy for senior executives is based  
on the following principles: 
Specifically built 
around our strategy
Linked to 
business strategy
Encourages the right 
behaviours  
to deliver long-term 
growth

2  Benefits include a combination of cash and non-cash benefits, valued at the taxable value. For Mike Coupe, John Rogers and Kevin O’Byrne this includes a cash car allowance (£15,250) and private medical cover. For 
John Rogers this also includes an annual travel allowance of £6,500 per annum and accommodation costs of £45,647 per annum in relation to a change of location to Milton Keynes following his appointment as CEO of 
Sainsbury’s Argos. Also included is a value for Sharesave options based on a 20 per cent discount on the savings in the year. 
3 Annual bonus relates to performance during the financial year, paid in May following the relevant year-end. 
4 The Deferred Share Award relates to performance during the financial year, shares are granted in May following the relevant year-end and vest after a two-year deferral period. 
5  The Long-Term Incentive Plan value relates to the Future Builder award vesting in May following the end of the relevant financial year, which is the third year of the performance period. 50 per cent of the shares are 
released in May after the end of the relevant performance period and the balance one year later. The figures include accrued dividends over the performance period. The 2015/16 awards lapsed. The 2016/17 awards are 
based on the average share price over the fourth quarter for 2016/17 of £2.632.
6  The Executive Directors are entitled to retain the fees earned from non-executive appointments outside the Company. Mike Coupe was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Greene King plc on 26 July 2011 and received

effective from

Mike Coupe £929,486 £943,428
John Rogers £685,125 £695,402
Kevin O’Byrne £625,000 £625,000
When considering salaries the Committee takes account of a number of factors, with particular focus on the general level of salary increases awarded throughout 
the Company. The salary review for management and central colleagues in March 2017 was generally 1.5 per cent and for Sainsbury’s hourly-paid retail colleagues 
in August 2016 was 4.0 per cent. Where relevant, the Committee also considers external market data on salary and total remuneration but the Committee applies 
judgement when considering such data. For 2017/18 both Mike Coupe and John Rogers will receive a salary increase of 1.5 per cent effective March 2017 in line 
with other management colleagues. Kevin O’Byrne, who joined the Board as CFO in January 2017, was not eligible for an increase given his start date. 
Pension 
In lieu of pension plan participation, Mike Coupe receives a cash pension supplement of 30 per cent of salary and John Rogers and Kevin O’Byrne receive 25 per 
cent of salary. No Director has any entitlement to a Sainsbury’s defined benefit pension.
Benefits 
For 2016/17 and 2017/18, benefits for Executive Directors include the provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, 
life assurance and colleague discount. Benefits for John Rogers also include an annual travel allowance and accommodation costs in relation to a change of 
location to Milton Keynes following appointment as CEO of Sainsbury’s Argos.
Performance-related pay
The Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the Executive Directors’ package is performance-related and the performance conditions 
applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Company’s strategy and the long-term sustainable success of the Company. The specific 
metrics incorporated into the annual bonus, Deferred Share Award and Future Builder are built around the overall strategy and our key priorities. The Board is of the opinion that the performance targets for the 2017/18 
annual bonus and Deferred Share Award are commercially sensitive as 
the Company operates in a highly competitive, consumer-facing sector. 
The disclosure of targets would provide competitors with insights into the 
Company’s strategic aims, budgeting and growth projections. However, in 
line with last year, the Company is retrospectively disclosing the financial 
performance targets set for the 2016/17 annual bonus in order to provide 
greater transparency. Consistent with previous years, detailed disclosure is 
provided in relation to the Deferred Share Award so that shareholders can 
understand the basis for payments. Targets for Future Builder awards have 
been disclosed on a prospective basis.
Annual bonus
2017/18 policy
All bonus plans across the Company are aligned under a set of common 
principles. The Board and senior management plans are based on profit, 
sales, a customer-focused measure and individual performance. For the most 
senior executives, at least 50 per cent of the award is weighted towards the 
achievement of profit under the current structure. A performance gateway 
also has to be achieved in order to trigger a payment of any awards. The 
annual bonus is paid in cash after the year-end. 
The profit and sales targets are set against the Company’s expected 
performance and are subject to a rigorous process of challenge before 
the proposals are considered by the Board. The targets are set such that 
considerably stretching performance in excess of internal and external 
forecasts is required for maximum payout. 
The customer-focused measure is based on a customer satisfaction index, 
which is a survey operated by a third party, that assesses the satisfaction 
of Sainsbury’s customers shopping with us in-store or online. Individual 
performance objectives are set annually for each Executive Director and are 
reviewed by the Committee. These objectives cover a variety of financial 
and operational targets that contribute to the achievement of longer-term 
strategic goals; some of these objectives relate, either directly or indirectly, 
to the Company’s value.
The maximum annual bonus award opportunity for the Chief Executive is 110 
per cent of base salary and for the other Executive Directors is 90 per cent of 
base salary. The weighting of each measure is shown in the table below.
Maximum opportunity as per cent of salary

Sales 10% 10%

2016/17 annual bonus payment (audited information)
The performance measures for 2016/17 were the same as outlined above  
for 2017/18.
Overall financial results for the year were good in the context of a  
challenging and competitive trading environment. However, the profit and 
sales outcomes were below the threshold performance hurdles due to the 
stretch of the targets. The targets were set at the beginning of the financial 
year prior to the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc and so performance 
has been measured excluding the impact of the transaction to allow for a 
comparison on a like-for-like basis. The table below sets out the threshold  
and stretch profit and sales targets and the actual outturn for 2016/17. 
Threshold Stretch Actual
Profit

£540m £640m £502m

1  Underlying profit before tax, excluding Home Retail Group plc, and derived from Group Profit minus  
Argos business as usual profit and synergies.
2  Total sales including VAT and duty, including petrol sales, excluding Argos and Sainsbury’s Bank.  
Petrol volumes and prices held constant to remove the effect of fuel volatility on sales. 
Both Mike Coupe and John Rogers exceeded a number of their customer-
focused and individual performance objectives set at the start of the year, 
with strong progress made on executing the key strategic priorities. 
Following the end of the financial year, the Committee reviewed performance 
and determined that the business results in absolute terms did not warrant 
the payment of a cash bonus to the Executive Directors. While no bonus 
is payable to the Executive Directors, colleagues across the Group shared in 
a bonus of £78 million, reflecting their contribution throughout the year. 
Deferred Share Award
2017/18 policy 
The Deferred Share Award (DSA) is used to drive performance against a 
diverse range of key financial and strategic scorecard measures, and rewards 
Executive Directors for achieving the short-term objectives that will directly 
lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company. These 
awards are made in shares to ensure further alignment with shareholders. 
The DSA covers broadly the top 50 senior leaders in the Company, including 
Executive Directors. Performance is assessed in the round based on the 
Committee’s judgement of performance against a number of measures 
within four broad categories. The categories and examples of the measures 
that will be reviewed for 2017/18 are set out below.
Financial performance Profit, earnings per share, sales
Returns to shareholders Total shareholder return, dividend yield
Relative performance 
against peers Market share, industry profit pool
Strategic goals Proposition, channels, price, customers, 
colleagues, values
As outlined in our Remuneration Policy, at least 50 per cent of the award 
will be based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to 
shareholders. In addition, no shares will be awarded unless a performance 
gateway target is achieved.
Performance is assessed over one financial year, but any shares awarded are 
deferred for a further two financial years. The shares are subject to forfeiture 
if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date. 
Dividends accrue on any shares that subsequently vest.
The maximum DSA award opportunity for the Chief Executive is 110 per cent 
of base salary and for the other Executive Directors is 90 per cent of base salary.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued The table below sets out details of the awards and these are the figures set

2016/17 Deferred Share Award (audited information) 
Following the year-end, the Committee conducted a rigorous assessment 
of performance. Consistent with the underlying principles of the DSA, the 
Committee assessed achievements in the round and also considered the 
manner in which these performance goals had been delivered, in particular 
how the overall performance of the Company had contributed to its future 
sustainable growth and success. 
2016/17 continued to be a challenging year for retailers and the Company only 
partially met its financial targets. However, the Company performed well 
against its peers in terms of price, quality, service and dividends paid. It also 
made significant progress against our strategic goals with the acquisition of 
Home Retail Group plc which will accelerate our strategy. The Committee, 
therefore, agreed that for 2016/17 awards would be made at 70 per cent of the 
maximum level, compared with 80 per cent last year. It also determined that 
the profit gateway for the plan was achieved. Although some of the specific 
measures and targets are commercially sensitive, the table below presents 
a selection of performance highlights which the Committee took into account 
within each of the four categories.

 81 Governance Report Long-term incentives
2017/18 policy
The long-term incentive plan operated at Sainsbury’s is known as Future Builder. Around 250 senior managers across the business participate in this 
arrangement. Awards were originally granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2006. A renewed Long-Term Incentive Plan was 
approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM, which is now being used.
Future Builder awards have been granted under the same structure for a number of years. A core award of shares is granted, generally calculated as a 
percentage of salary and scaled according to level of seniority. Vesting of the core award is dependent on performance against specific targets (common for all 
participants) tested at the end of a three-year performance period. The core awards can grow up to four times at stretch levels of performance. 
Historically, awards have been structured so that half of any awards vest following the end of the performance period, with the remaining half vesting after a 
further year. For awards granted to Executive Directors from 2017 onwards, awards will normally be subject to a new two-year holding period following the end 
of the three-year performance period. This will result in future awards to Executive Directors normally only being released five years after grant. 
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s underlying performance over the period justifies the level of vesting. Vesting will be 
reduced if the vesting outcome is not considered to be justified. At vesting, when making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such factors as 
it deems relevant. The Committee believes that having a gateway is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes. 
This gateway applies to all outstanding Future Builder awards. 
2017 Future Builder awards (2017/18 to 2019/20 performance period)
Award levels will remain unchanged for the coming year. In 2017 Mike Coupe will receive a core award of 62.5 per cent of salary (maximum 250 per cent of 
salary) and the other Executive Directors will receive core awards of 50 per cent of salary (maximum 200 per cent of salary). 
The 2017 awards will be subject to the same scorecard of metrics used for the 2016 awards. The Committee consulted with major shareholders regarding the 
targets for 2017 awards and the proposed target ranges were subsequently updated to reflect shareholder feedback. The cost savings and synergies targets for 
2017 have been updated to align with the strategy communicated to shareholders for the period to March 2020. The ROCE targets have also been recalibrated 
in order to provide realistic but stretching goals reflecting the current and future prospects of the business as well as the retail sector as a whole over the next 
three years. Overall the Committee is of the view that these targets provide an appropriately stretching incentive for participants. The agreed measures, targets 
and weightings for 2017 awards are as follows:
Measure Weighting
Threshold 
target
(1.0x core 
award)
Maximum 
target
(4.0x core 
award)
ROCE 20% 8% 11%
Underlying basic EPS 20% 23p 30p

Cumulative strategic cost saving 20% £450m £550m
Home Retail Group plc acquisition synergies 20% £160m £200m
2014 Future Builder (2014/15 to 2016/17 performance period) (audited information)
The 2014 Future Builder award was subject to ROCE, cash flow and relative sales performance targets, excluding Argos. In addition, a performance gateway 
must be achieved before any element could vest. 
The following table sets out the extent to which each performance measure was achieved and this resulted in a performance multiplier of 0.9x which is applied 
to the core award, i.e. 22.5 per cent of the maximum available award vested.

1 Figure relates to Group ROCE including Argos excluding pension fund deficit, while the targets exclude Argos.
2  Cumulative underlying cash flow from retail operations excluding Argos based on the reported cash flow generated from core retail operations over the performance period after adding back net rent and cash pension 
costs and adjusted for the cash impact of non-underlying items. Only core retail operations are included in recognition of the differences in cash generation between the retail business and Sainsbury’s Bank.
3  Relative sales performance is measured using the IGD Index (IGD Market Track) adjusted to reflect the constituents at the start of the performance period. The Index measures growth in like-for-like sales (excluding 
fuel and Argos) across the market based on the performance of all of the Company’s key competitors. This is an independent index of sales efficiency, which is viewed as a robust reference point for performance 
across the food retail sector.
82 Governance Report 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 2015 Future Builder (2015/16 to 2017/18 performance period)
Following the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc in September 2016, the targets will be assessed based on performance of the enlarged Group. After a 
detailed review, the Committee is satisfied that the targets originally set for this award remain appropriately stretching and that no adjustments are required. 
The Committee will continue to keep the targets under review in light of the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc. Appropriate disclosure of any adjustments 
necessary to ensure performance is assessed on a fair and consistent basis will be provided in next year’s report.

Future Builder performance measures
ROCE
— ROCE reflects the returns generated for shareholders and measures 
the efficiency of capital use. 
— It is based on the underlying profit before interest and tax for the 
whole business, with Sainsbury’s Bank fully consolidated, including 
the underlying share of post-tax profit from joint ventures. The capital 
employed figure excludes the impact of movements in the IAS 19 
pension deficit.
EPS
— EPS directly reflects returns generated for shareholders. 
— Underlying basic EPS is based on underlying profit after tax divided 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year.
Cash flow 
— Cash flow measures the total flow of cash in and out of the business 
as well as providing an assessment of underlying profitability. 
— Cumulative underlying cash flow from retail operations after capital 
expenditure is based on the reported cash flow generated from core 
retail operations, including Sainsbury’s Argos and Habitat, over the 
performance period after adding back net rent, cash pension costs 
and deducting core capital expenditure. Only core retail operations are 
included in recognition of the differences in cash generation between 
the retail business and Sainsbury’s Bank.
Cost savings
— Cost savings is one of our key strategic targets and the level of savings 
targeted will require structural changes. This is a key long-term 
measure which is fundamental to delivering returns to shareholders.
— Cumulative strategic cost savings represents cost reductions over the 
performance period as a result of identified initiatives. It excludes 
Sainsbury’s Bank and synergies.
Synergies
— Synergies represent the value driven from combining the J Sainsbury 
plc and Home Retail Group plc businesses since the acquisition in 
September 2016. The delivery of synergies was a key part of the deal.
— The target represents the EBITDA synergies delivered by the end of the 
three-year performance period.

1 The performance conditions applying to 2016 Future Builder awards are set out on page 83. The basis of award shows the maximum value, being four times the core award. The awards for Mike Coupe and John Rogers 
were made on 12 May 2016 and the number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (5 to 11 May 2016) of £2.6498. The award for Kevin O’Byrne was made on 26 January 2017 
and the number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (19 to 25 January 2017) of £2.6060. Subject to performance, 50 per cent of the award vests on 12 May 2019 and 50 per cent 
12 months later. The award is structured as a nil-cost option with an exercise period of up to two years.
2   The DSA was made on 12 May 2016 based on performance over the 2016/17 financial year. The award was made at 80 per cent of the maximum level (maximum of 110 per cent of salary for Mike Coupe and 90 per cent of 
salary for John Rogers). The number of shares has been calculated using the five-day average share price prior to grant (5 to 11 May 2016) of £2.6498. No further performance conditions apply. Awards become exercisable 
on 16 March 2018. The award is structured as a nil-cost option with an eight-year exercise period.
Summary of remuneration arrangements for Kevin O’Byrne
Kevin O’Byrne was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of J Sainsbury plc on 9 January 2017 following John Rogers’ appointment as CEO of Sainsbury’s Argos. 
Kevin was not eligible to receive a 2016/17 annual bonus or Deferred Share Award. He was awarded a 2016 Future Builder award with a maximum value of 200 
per cent of salary shortly after appointment. The operation and structure of the award is in line with other participants and will vest at the normal time of 50 
per cent in May 2019 and the remainder in May 2020. This performance based award is to compensate Kevin for remuneration forfeited on leaving his previous 
employment and is in line with our recruitment policy. The Committee is satisfied that this award is of comparable commercial value to the award which is 
being bought-out.

5 The 2012 and 2013 Future Builder awards lapsed and therefore no value is shown.
6 Relates to 2014, 2015 and 2016 Future Builder awards (maximum) where the performance period has not ended. As noted above, following the year-end, the 2014 award will vest at 22.5 per cent of maximum.
7 12 March 2016 figure relates to 9 January 2017 when Kevin O’Byrne joined the Board.
Note: The Executive Directors are potential beneficiaries of the Company’s employee benefit trust, which is used to satisfy awards under the Company’s employee share plans, and they are therefore treated as interested 
in the 1.0 million shares (2016: 7.9 million) held by the Trustees.  
Shareholding guidelines (audited information)
The Executive Directors are required to build up a specified 
level of shareholding in the Company. This is to create 
greater alignment of the Directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders, in line with the objectives of the Remuneration 
Policy. The guidelines have been updated for the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and continue to require the Chief Executive 
to have a holding of 2.5 times salary while the other Executive 
Directors are now required to hold 2.0 times salary. Directors 
are expected to build this shareholding within five years of 
appointment to the relevant role. In addition to shares held, 
share awards under the DSA and Future Builder awards where 
the performance period has ended count towards the guideline 
(on a net of tax basis).
Both Mike Coupe and John Rogers have shareholdings that meet 
and significantly exceed the current shareholding guideline. 
Kevin O’Byrne was appointed to the Board in January 2017 and 
will be expected to build his shareholding during the course of 
his tenure.

84 Governance Report 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued All-employee share plans 
The Company encourages share ownership and operates two all-employee 
share plans for colleagues, namely the Savings-Related Share Option 
Plan (Sharesave) and the All-Employee Share Ownership Plan, of which 
the Sainsbury’s Share Purchase Plan (SSPP) is a part. Participation in 
Sharesave is conditional on three months’ service. Executive Directors may 
participate in these plans in the same way as all other colleagues. Mike 
Coupe participates in Sharesave and John Rogers participates in SSPP. As 
these are all-employee plans there are no performance conditions. The 
Committee approves the adoption or amendment of these plans and awards 
to Executive Directors. 
The 2011 Sharesave plan (five-year), with a £2.38 option price, and the 2013 
Sharesave plan (three-year), with a £3.32 option price, came to an end on 
1 March 2017 for over 11,500 colleagues. Colleagues could either take their 
savings or use the money to buy Sainsbury’s shares at the option price. Using 
the market price on the date of the first exercise, the value of all the shares 
subject to the maturity was just over £19.3 million. The Company currently 
has over 32,500 colleagues participating in Sharesave with around 58,500 
individual savings contracts. 
Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration 
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s 
salary, benefits and bonus between 2015/16 and 2016/17 compares with the

Performance and CEO 
remuneration 
The graph shows the TSR performance 
of an investment of £100 in J Sainsbury 
plc shares over the last eight years 
compared with an equivalent 
investment in the FTSE 100 Index. 
The FTSE 100 Index has been selected 
to provide an established and broad-
based index. The graph also includes 
data for the FTSE All-Share Food & 
Drug Retailers Index. The Company is 
a constituent of both indices. The table 
details the total remuneration for the 
Chief Executive over this period.
Dilution 
The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Company’s 
share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within best 
practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not 
exceed ten per cent of the Company’s issued share capital for all-employee 
share plans and five per cent in respect of executive share plans in any ten-
year rolling period. The Company monitors dilution levels on a regular basis 
and the Committee reviews these at least once a year. Up to 11 March 2017, 
an estimated 7.8 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital has been 
allocated for the purposes of its all-employee share plans over a ten-year 
period, including an estimated 2.6 per cent over ten years in respect of its 
executive share plans. This is on the basis that all outstanding awards vest  
in full.

 87 Governance Report
The Committee typically meets four times each year, or more as required. The 
Committee has a calendar of standard items within its remit and in addition 
it held in-depth discussions on specific topics during the year. The key issues 
the Committee discussed during the year were remuneration arrangements 
in relation to changes on the Operating Board, the impact of the acquisition 
of Home Retail Group plc on incentives, a review of long-term incentive 
arrangements and the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if 
it considers this beneficial. Over the course of the year, the Committee was 
supported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). Deloitte were 
reappointed by the Committee as advisers in 2013 following a competitive 
tender. During the year they provided advice to the Committee on a range of 
topics including remuneration trends, corporate governance, incentive plan 
design, incentive plan rules and the Remuneration Policy. Their consultants 
attended all of the Committee meetings. In relation to their advice, Deloitte 
received fees of circa £170,000 (fees are based on hours spent). During the 
year, Deloitte provided the Company with unrelated advice and consultancy 
regarding due diligence on the proposed acquisition of Home Retail Group plc, 
information technology, organisational structure, data analytics, taxation and 
matters relating to Sainsbury’s Bank.
Deloitte are members of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, 
operate under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK. During the year, the Committee reviewed the advice 
provided by Deloitte and has confirmed that it has been objective and 
independent. The Committee has also determined that the Deloitte partner 
who provides remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any 
connections with the Company that may impact their independence. The 
Committee has reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that 
there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.

The following section sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy. This policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 5 July 2017 and, 
 if approved, will be effective from this date. 
Changes to the Remuneration Policy
Although the policy is being renewed, the key features remain unchanged from the policy previously approved by shareholders in 2014. As part of the review 
minor amendments have been made to reflect evolving market and best practice. These include:
— The introduction of a two-year holding period on Future Builder awards granted from 2017 onwards, which means future awards will normally be released  
five years after the grant date;
— Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors, other than the CEO, are increased to 2.0 times salary, with the requirement for the CEO remaining at 2.5 
times salary;
— Retirement benefits for any future appointment are reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent of salary; and
— Strengthened recovery provisions (malus and clawback).
Policy Table for Executive Directors
The table below summarises each element of the policy for Executive Directors, with further details set out after the table.

Opportunity Salary increases (in percentage of salary terms) for Executive Directors will normally be within the range of those for the wider 
workforce. There is no maximum salary opportunity.
Where the Committee considers it necessary and appropriate, larger increases may be awarded in individual circumstances 
such as:
— A change in scope or responsibility;
— If a new Executive Director is appointed at a lower rate and the salary is realigned over time as the individual gains 
experience in the role; or
— Alignment to market level.

90 Governance Report 90 Governance Report 90 Governance Report 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Setting performance measures and targets
The Committee believes it is important that the performance conditions 
applying to incentive arrangements support the short and long-term 
corporate ambitions of the Company. We operate in a dynamic market with 
evolving challenges and the Committee reviews the performance measures 
and targets each year to ensure that they remain relevant and stretching. 
Further details of the performance measures are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
The performance measures in the annual bonus and Deferred Share Award 
are selected as they are the key drivers of business performance. The targets 
for the annual bonus and DSA are set with reference to the corporate strategy 
and internal budgets as well as the external context (e.g. market forecasts). 
This approach seeks to ensure that the threshold and stretch targets are 
appropriately challenging. 
The Future Builder performance measures focus on longer term growth and 
returns to shareholders, and a similar target-setting approach is used. 
The Committee may vary or rebalance the weighting of the performance 
metrics for future annual bonus, DSA and Future Builder awards, in order to 
ensure that they remain aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The Committee may also adjust the targets for awards or the calculation 
of performance measures and vesting outcomes for events not foreseen 
at the time the targets were set to ensure they remain a fair reflection of 
performance over the relevant period.
Recovery provisions (malus and clawback) – preventing 
rewards for failure
The Remuneration Committee may operate recovery provisions (malus and 
clawback) on all incentive awards. The Committee may reduce or cancel an 
unvested award, or impose further conditions on an unvested award in the 
event of material mis-statement of financial results, serious reputational 
damage, serious misconduct or fraud. 
In addition, in the circumstances outlined above, the Committee may 
clawback incentives, by requiring an Executive Director to make a repayment 
in relation to bonus payments and share awards. This provision would apply 
for up to two years following the end of the relevant performance period. 
Consideration of colleague pay and conditions
When considering remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account, as a matter of course, the pay and conditions 
of colleagues throughout the Company.
In particular, the Committee receives regular updates of any major changes 
to the pay and benefits of colleagues generally and the Committee takes 
into account wider pay issues when determining Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. When setting Executive Director salary increases the 
Committee considers the overall salary increase budget for management and 
the increase in rate of pay for hourly-paid colleagues, including the impact 
that implementing the National Living Wage has on colleague pay.
The Committee does not formally consult with colleagues on the setting 
of the policy but as a result of the Company’s all-employee share plans, 
colleagues are able to become shareholders in the Company and can 
comment on the policy in the same way as other shareholders. Additionally, 
as mentioned in the Corporate Responsibility Report, we are looking at 
forums for our Non-Executive Directors and colleague representatives to 
discuss key business issues (including remuneration). 
Differences in Remuneration Policy for all colleagues
Many aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors are 
consistent with the reward strategy for other colleagues across the Company. 
Below executive level, pay and benefits are scaled to reflect the nature of the 
role and based on the levels of pay in comparable roles in the market. 
All colleagues, including colleagues at Sainsbury’s Bank and Sainsbury’s 
Argos, are entitled to base salary, benefits including pension and colleague 
discount. Eligible colleagues participate in our annual bonus plans which are 
aligned under a common set of principles with performance metrics tailored 
to different populations. 
Senior executives expected to have the greatest influence on Company 
performance over time are eligible for participation in long-term incentive 
plans. All colleagues have the opportunity to become shareholders in the 
Company through our all-employee share plans.
Participation in a pension plan is offered to all colleagues on a contributory 
basis, with the Company contribution varying by grade. Following auto-
enrolment, we now have over 120,000 colleagues in our pension plans.
 91 Governance Report Potential total remuneration opportunity 
under our pay policy
The Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the 
package for Executive Directors is performance-related and delivered 
in shares to align their interests with shareholders. The balance 
between fixed pay (base salary, pension and benefits) and variable pay 
(annual bonus, Deferred Share Award and Future Builder) changes with 
performance. The variable proportion of total remuneration increases 
significantly for increased levels of performance. At least 60 per cent of 
the package is delivered through variable pay at mid-point performance 
and this proportion increases to at least three-quarters of the package at 
maximum levels of performance.
The charts show the total remuneration potential of the Executive 
Directors, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, under three 
performance scenarios. In line with the regulations, the charts exclude 
the effect of share price movements.

Our approach to recruitment
The Committee believes it is vital to be able to attract and recruit leaders of the calibre required to deliver our strategic objectives, while remaining mindful 
of the cost to the Company. When determining remuneration arrangements for new appointments, the Committee intends to pay no more than it believes 
is necessary to secure the required talent. The Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the approved Remuneration Policy. 
Fixed pay Salary and benefits (including retirement benefits) would be determined in accordance with the Policy Table above. An alternative package may 
also be necessary where an individual fulfils an executive role on an interim basis.
In certain cases, the initial salary for a new appointment may be set at a lower level, with the intention of increasing the salary over time as the 
executive gains experience in the role. 
Benefits may need to be tailored based on the individual circumstances (e.g. relocation, housing or travel allowances may be required).
Variable 
pay
The maximum variable remuneration which may be offered to an executive will be no more than 500 per cent of salary (excluding any buy-out 
arrangements). This limit is consistent with the overall maximum set out in the Policy Table.
Within these limits and where appropriate the Committee may tailor the award (e.g. timeframe, form, performance criteria) based on the 
commercial circumstances. 
Shareholders will be informed of the terms for any such arrangements.
Buy-outs The Committee may need to buy-out remuneration terms forfeited on joining the Company. In such circumstances, the Committee will seek to 
ensure any buy-out is of comparable commercial value and capped as appropriate. 
The quantum, form and structure of any buy-out arrangement will be determined by the Committee taking into account the terms of the 
previous arrangement being forfeited (e.g. form and structure of award, timeframe, performance criteria, likelihood of vesting, etc.). The buy-out 
may be structured as an award of cash or shares. However, the Committee will normally have a preference for replacement awards to be made 
in the form of shares and to be within the Company’s existing incentive plans.
Where an executive is appointed from either within the Company or following corporate activity/reorganisation (e.g. acquisition of another 
company), the normal policy would be to honour any legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions.

Annual bonus No entitlement following date notice served. Bonus may be payable subject to performance. Awards 
normally pro-rated based on the period worked during the 
financial year, with payments usually occurring following the 
year-end.
Deferred Share Award No entitlement to current year’s award following date 
notice served.
Unvested awards will lapse on notice.
Participants may be considered for an award, but normally 
must be employed and not under notice to receive current 
year’s award.
Outstanding unvested awards normally do not lapse. Awards 
may be pro-rated for the proportion of the deferral period 
elapsed on cessation, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise. Awards may vest following cessation or at 
another date.
On death, unvested awards will be released and vest in full.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(i.e. Future Builder)
Unvested awards will lapse on notice. Unvested awards normally vest at the normal time subject to 
performance. Awards will normally be pro-rated by reference 
to the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed 
since cessation, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
On death, awards vest early on cessation with performance 
measured at this time. Awards are pro-rated by reference to 
the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed 
since cessation.
If the Director leaves in the first six months after the start of 
the performance period, the award normally lapses in full.
All-employee share plans In line with HMRC rules.
On the appointment of a new Non-Executive Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the terms and fees will normally be consistent with the fee policy 
outlined later in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Service contracts and policy for departing  
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’ service contracts to be 
terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
Contracts contain non-compete and non-solicit clauses with key suppliers 
and colleagues. The Company’s normal practice is that Executive Directors 
may take up one non-executive role outside the Company, with approval 
from the Board, subject to the role being in a business that does not compete 
with the Company and with consideration of the time commitment. Directors 
are normally entitled to retain the fees earned from such appointments. 
In the event of early termination without notice, any severance payment 
would be limited to one-year’s salary and benefits (including pension), 
normally payable on a phased basis and subject to mitigation. Benefits 
payable may include certain one-off benefits in connection with termination 
such as legal costs and the costs of meeting any settlement agreement. 
There are no specific terms relating to a change of control.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for shareholders to 
view at the Company’s registered office. 
The Committee retains discretion to determine the exact termination 
terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts 
and circumstances available to them at the time. The table below sets 
out the general position and range of approaches in respect of incentive 
arrangements. In accordance with the terms of the relevant incentive plan 
rules, based on the circumstances of any departure the Committee has 
discretion to determine how an Executive Director should be categorised for 
each element and determine vesting levels accordingly based on the range 
shown below.
Detailed provisions 
Deferred Share Awards and Future Builder awards are subject to the terms 
of the relevant plan rules under which the award has been granted. It is 
expected that future awards would normally be granted under the LTIP 
rules approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The Committee may adjust 
or amend awards only in accordance with the provisions of the relevant 
plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off 
corporate events, such as a change in the Company’s capital structure. In 
accordance with the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather than 
shares, where the Committee considers this appropriate.
On a change of control, Deferred Share Awards would be released or vest 
in full. Future Builder awards may vest taking account of relevant factors 
including progress against relevant performance conditions and may be pro-
rated based on time.
In the event of a demerger or other significant distribution, Deferred Share 
Awards or Future Builder awards may be allowed to vest wholly or in part. 
A winding up, administration or a voluntary arrangement event would 
result in Deferred Share Awards being released or vesting in full and Future 
Builder awards would normally vest subject to achievement of the relevant 
performance conditions on the same time pro-rated basis as above.
In similar corporate events, awards under HMRC approved all-employee plans 
would vest in accordance with the standard approved terms.
The Committee may approve payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior 
to the implementation of this policy where such commitment was either; 
(i) made prior to the implementation of the 2014 Remuneration Policy; or (ii) 
agreed during the term of, and was consistent with, the 2014 Remuneration 
Policy. This includes previous incentive awards that are currently outstanding 
and unvested (e.g. prior year Deferred Share Awards). The structure of 
these legacy awards are generally consistent with the Policy Table but 
the performance conditions applying may be different. Further details of 
outstanding awards are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee may also approve payments outside of this policy, in order 
to satisfy any legacy arrangements made to a colleague prior to (and not in 
contemplation of) promotion to the Board of Directors. 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy 
to aid its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approvals 
(e.g. for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to 
take account of a change in legislation) provided that any such change is not 
to the material advantage of colleagues.
 93 Governance Report Remuneration Policy for the Non-Executive Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Chairman is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors by the Non-Executive Chairman and Executive Directors. The Non-
Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive fees and are eligible 
for certain benefits. Non-Executive roles are not entitled to any performance-
related pay or pension. 
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service 
contracts. The Company’s policy is to appoint the Non-Executive Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors for an initial three-year period, which may be 
extended for a further term by mutual consent. The initial appointments and 
any subsequent reappointments are subject to annual election or re-election 
by shareholders. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee values the views of the Company’s shareholders and guidance from shareholder representative bodies. The Committee 
proactively consults extensively with our major shareholders to ensure that their views are represented in discussions on remuneration matters. As part of 
the process for approaching the renewal of the policy, the Committee consulted with major shareholders on a range of topics including potential alternative 
incentive structures. The renewed policy reflects guidance received from major investors during the course of the engagement process.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding vote and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory vote at the AGM on 5 July 
2017. The Directors confirm that this report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and reflects the provisions of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
Approved by the Board on 2 May 2017.
Mary Harris
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments may be terminated at any time 
by serving three months’ written notice by either party; six months’ in the 
case of the Non-Executive Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment are available for shareholders to view at the Company’s 
registered office.
Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Approach to setting 
remuneration
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level which is considered appropriate to attract individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to oversee the business. Fees may be paid in cash or shares.
Typically reviewed annually in September.
Judgement is used but consideration is given to a number of internal and external factors including responsibilities, market 
positioning, inflation and colleague pay increases.
Where appropriate benefits may be provided such as private medical cover, annual medical assessment and colleague 
discount. 
Travel and other reasonable expenses (including any associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing their duties are 
reimbursed to Non-Executive Directors.
Opportunity Fee opportunity reflects responsibility and time commitment.
Additional fees are paid for further responsibilities such as chairing committees.
The value of benefits provided will be reasonable in the market context and take account of the individual circumstances and 
benefits provided in comparable roles.
Fee levels as at 12 March 2017:
— Non-Executive Chairman – £500,000 per annum
— Basic fee – £65,000 per annum
— Senior Independent Director, Chair of Remuneration and Audit Committees additional fee – £18,500 per annum
— Chairman of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee additional fee – £13,000 per annum

Share capital and control
Except as described below in relation to the Company’s employee share 
schemes, there are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company; no 
person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company; and the Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions in the transfer 
of securities or voting rights. Further details of the rights, restrictions and 
obligations attaching to the share capital of the Company, including voting 
rights, are contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of 
Association may only be changed with the agreement of shareholders.
Shares acquired through the Company’s employee share plans rank pari 
passu with shares in issue and have no special rights. Where, under the 
Company’s All Employee Share Ownership Plan, participants are beneficial 
owners of the shares but the Trustee is the registered owner, the voting 
rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of 
the participants. The J Sainsbury Employee Benefit Trusts and Home Retail 
Employee Share Trust waive their right to vote and to dividends on the shares 
they hold which are unallocated. Total dividends waived by the Trustees 
during the financial year amounted to £497,762. Some of the Company’s 
employee share plans include restrictions on transfer of shares while the 
shares are held within the plan.
At the AGM held in July 2016, the Company was authorised by shareholders to 
purchase its own shares, within certain limits and as permitted by the Articles 
of Association. The Company made no purchases of its own shares during the 
year and no shares were acquired by forfeiture or surrender or made subject 
to a lien or charge.
All of the Company’s employee share plans contain provisions relating to 
a change of control. On a change of control, options and awards granted 
to employees under the Company’s share plans may vest and become 
exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable performance 
conditions at that time.
Certain of the Company’s credit facilities and banking arrangements 
contain change of control clauses under which lenders may cancel their 
commitments and declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and 
payable. There are no other significant agreements that would take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid. 
Ordinary shares
Details of the changes to the ordinary issued share capital during the year 
are shown in note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements including 
shares allotted as a result of the HRG acquisition. At the date of this report, 
2,188,900,863 ordinary shares of 28

Directors’ interests
The beneficial interests of the Directors and their families in the shares of  
the Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on  
pages 84 and 86. 
During the year, no Director had any material interest in any contract of 
significance to the Group’s business.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors are entitled to be indemnified by the Company to the extent 
permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of Association in respect of 
all losses arising out of or in connection with the execution of their powers, 
duties and responsibilities. The Company has executed deeds of indemnity 
for the benefit of each Director in respect of liabilities which may attach to 
them in their capacity as a Director of the Company. The Company purchased 
and maintained Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance throughout 
2016/17, which has been renewed for 2017/18. Neither the indemnities nor the 
insurance provide cover in the event that the Director is proved to have  
acted fraudulently.
Employment
Employment policies
The Company values the different perspectives and experiences of all our 
colleagues. We are proud of our diverse workforce because every colleague’s 
unique viewpoint helps us to innovate and to understand and embrace 
different customers’ needs and wants. We are committed to providing equal 
opportunities for all colleagues and applicants, including during recruitment 
and selection, training and development, and promotion.
A Great Place to Work strategy is in place, underpinned by well-developed 
policies for the fair and equal treatment of all colleagues. Training is provided 
which ensures that policies are understood throughout the organisation. We 
have a workplace adjustments process in place for our colleagues who are 
living with a disability or long-term health condition which operates through 
the Government’s Access to Work scheme. Workplace adjustments can be 
made at any point during a colleague's employment with us. See page 39 for 
further information on our diversity strategy.
Additional statutory information
 95 Governance Report Colleague engagement
We deliver regular colleague communications which build trust in our 
corporate strategy, vision and values, enable our colleagues to do a good 
job, and provide information which matters to colleagues about their pay, 
benefits and career opportunities. We are committed to delivering news and 
information to our colleagues in a clear and timely way, and communicating 
change sensitively. 
Colleagues receive information from their managers, as well as a range of 
internal communications including films and magazines and have access to 
a colleague intranet, and Yammer, our social platform. In addition, as we have 
detailed in the Great Place to Work section of this report on page 38, there are 
a number of ways for colleagues to have their say, from our colleague idea 
scheme, Message Mike, to Talking Shop when colleagues have an opportunity 
to meet members of our Operating Board and ask questions. 
All colleagues receive a letter from our Chief Executive Officer every time 
we announce our results detailing our Company performance, and how our 
colleagues have played their part. Through our communication channels and 
messages from the Chief Executive Officer we have also set out Company 
milestones, explaining how every colleague can help to achieve them, and we 
celebrate our success when we reach them by rewarding colleagues with an 
increase in colleague discount. 
Human rights and modern slavery
The Company does not have a specific human rights policy but fairness and 
integrity are an important part of the responsible way we run our business, as 
shown by the values and policies described above and throughout this report. 
In addition, our customers want to be confident that the people who make 
and sell our products are not being exploited, or exposed to unsafe working 
conditions. Our commitment to sourcing with integrity is reflected in long-
standing policies, processes and partnerships on ethical trade which seek to 
protect the rights of the people working in our supply chains. We are founding 
members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and work closely with our 
suppliers, government agencies, non-profit organisations, unions and others 
to ensure that our standards are maintained. 
This year sees the publication of our first statement in accordance with 
clause 54 of the Modern Slavery Act, 2015. It marks a development of our 
approach that sees us align across our entire business and supply chain, 
incorporating our own operations, from facilities management and logistics 
to Sainsbury’s Bank and Sainsbury’s Argos. In addition to maintaining our 
existing activities, we have taken a number of steps over this financial year to 
solidify our governance structure, processes and awareness-raising activities 
on the topic that will help us better identify and address worker exploitation. 
These include updates to our commercial terms and policies, enhancing our 
training, and a leading role in industry partnerships to develop a common 
standard for worker accommodation and a new certification scheme for 
labour providers. 
We have been developing our updated risk-based approach in response to 
the growing intelligence on where slavery and trafficking risk exists across 
our industry. We are using enhanced data analytics capability and human 
rights expertise to create a next-generation diagnostic risk assessment tool 
that can be applied across the many and different areas of our business. We 
are confident that it will help us to implement an effective strategy and set 
of prevention and remediation activities, that are appropriate for each area of 
our business. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
In line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition), we have recalculated our Group base year due to the 
acquisition, within this reporting year, of HRG which includes Argos and Habitat. 
This year we have disclosed the emissions performance of the combined 
Sainsbury’s Group, Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat. We have in addition, 
aligned scope and boundaries with legacy Sainsbury’s reporting. All of the 
following figures are therefore reflective of these changes.
Sainsbury’s has measured its greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint since 2005 and 
set a challenging target to reduce absolute emissions by 30 per cent by 2020, 
compared to our baseline (and 65 per cent relative to sales floor area).
Argos and Habitat have also set a target to reduce emissions by 40 per cent 
relative to sales floor area by 2020.
Location-based emissions 
Versus 2005/06, in 2016/17 our:
— Sainsbury’s Group emissions reduced by 11.9 per cent absolute and 
41 per cent relative;
— Sainsbury’s emissions reduced by 11.4 per cent absolute and 42.5 per cent 
relative; and
—  Argos and Habitat emissions reduced by 15.9 per cent absolute and  
26.5 per cent relative.

96 Governance Report Market-based emissions 
The market-based emissions method reflects the emissions from the 
electricity that a company is using, which may be different from emissions 
for the electricity that is generated as a UK average. For example, different 
electricity suppliers emit more or less greenhouse gases depending on the 
energy source or technology, and companies who have invested in their own 
renewable or low carbon energy generation by this method can show the 
actual emissions level for the energy used. 
Versus 2005/06, in 2016/17 our market based: 
— Sainsbury’s Group emissions reduced by 21.5 per cent absolute and 
47.4 per cent relative;
— Sainsbury’s emissions reduced by 22.2 per cent absolute and 49.6 per cent 
relative; and,
— Argos and Habitat emissions reduced by 16.3 per cent absolute and 
26.8 per cent relative.

Dual emissions reporting 
Overall emissions have been presented to reflect both location and market 
based methodologies, affecting both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
Scope 1: 16 per cent of total natural gas usage is covered by Green Gas 
Certification (100 per cent Renewable Gas Guarantee of Origin Contract); 
therefore 16 per cent of natural gas emissions have been reported at zero 
emissions. All other Scope 1 market-based emissions have been calculated 
using UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2016 
for all sources. 
Scope 2: 20 per cent of UK electricity is covered by a PPA, which meets all of 
the required quality criteria; therefore 20 per cent of UK electricity emissions 
have been reported at zero emissions. Remaining UK electricity has been 
reported at supplier-specific emissions rate. Non-UK electricity has been 
reported at local grid average. 
Electricity use
As a result of our ongoing investment in energy reduction initiatives:
— Sainsbury’s Group absolute UK electricity consumption decreased 
year-on-year by 1.5 per cent and 11 per cent versus 2005/06 whilst adding 
49.2 per cent more sales area;
— Sainsbury’s absolute UK electricity consumption has decreased year-on-
year by 1.4 per cent and 11.6 per cent versus 2005/06 whilst adding 54.2 
per cent more sales area; and
—  Argos and Habitat absolute UK electricity consumption decreased year-
on-year by 1.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent versus 2005/06 whilst adding 14.4 
per cent more space. 
Methodology 
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 
2013. We have calculated and reported our emissions in line with the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and 
emission factors from UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2016, and IEA 2014 for those overseas. The reporting period is 
the financial year 2016/17, the same as that covered by the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements. The boundaries of the GHG inventory are defined 
using the operational control approach. In general, the emissions reported 
are the same as those which would be reported based on a financial control 
boundary.
Political donations
The Company made no political donations in 2016/17 (2015/16: £nil).
Essential contracts
Sainsbury’s has contractual and other arrangements with numerous third 
parties in support of its business activities. None of the arrangements is 
individually considered to be essential to the business of Sainsbury’s.
Taxation
The Company complies with relevant tax laws, regulations and obligations 
regarding the filing of tax returns, payment and collection of tax. Sainsbury’s 
policy is not to undertake any tax planning schemes that seek to use so-called 
‘tax havens’ for aggressive tax planning and for the purpose of tax avoidance. 
The Group aims to develop an open, honest relationship with the tax 
authorities and involve them at an early stage should any complex tax issues 
arise. The taxation policy is reviewed annually by the Board. Tax is a key 
item on the Audit Committee agenda and is discussed quarterly where large 
or complex tax items will feature, together with compliance and key risk 
management updates. 
All of Sainsbury’s and Argos stores are based in the UK (with the exception 
of some Argos stores in the Republic of Ireland), as such, substantially all 
(more than 99 per cent) of our Group sales are generated and taxed in the UK. 
Branches 
Details of branches of Group subsidiaries can be found in note 37 of the Notes 
to the Financial Statements. 
Post balance sheet events
There were no post balance sheet events.
Financial risk management
The financial risk management and policies of the Group are disclosed in 
note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Ethical policies
The Company takes bribery extremely seriously and is committed to 
ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. Colleagues are expected to 
abide by a set of clearly communicated formal policies, such as the Ethical 
Supplier Policy and the Conflicts of Interest/Relationships at Work Policy. 
Training in support of these policies is provided to colleagues especially in 
the commercial divisions, firstly during their induction into the Company and 
thereafter through annual refreshers.

100 Financial Statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company as at the end of the financial year, and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for the financial year. Under that law, the Directors have 
prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) 
and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (UK Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
— make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
— state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Company financial 
statements respectively; and
— prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken all the matters considered by the Board and brought to the 
attention of the Board during the year into account, we are satisfied that the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
The Board believes that the disclosures set in this Annual Report provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 54 to 55, 
confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
— the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
— the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

— the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
— the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement
— Supplier arrangements
— Aspects of revenue recognition
— HRG acquisition purchase price allocation
— Financial Services customer receivables impairment
— IT environment
Audit scope
— We performed a full scope audit of the complete financial 
information of the following components: J Sainsbury plc, 
Sainsbury’s and Argos trading entities and Sainsbury’s Bank. 
We performed audit procedures on specific balances including 
for the property companies, joint ventures and the insurance 
company due to the size and risk of certain individual balances 
within these components.
— The components where we performed full or specific audit 
procedures accounted for 92 per cent of profit before tax before 
items noted below, 99 per cent of revenue and 96 per cent of 
total assets.
Materiality
—  Overall Group materiality is £34 million which represents 5.1 per 
cent of profit before tax before items noted below.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those 
that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. 
In addressing these risks, we have performed the procedures below which 
were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Changes from the prior year
The Group acquired Home Retail Group plc in the year and we have reflected 
this in our risk assessment, the results of which are below.
We have identified similar risks of material misstatements in Home Retail 
Group compared to the pre-existing Sainsbury’s Group. We have therefore 
included the risks relating to legacy Home Retail Group components Argos 
and Argos Financial Services together where appropriate in the risks below 
and we have adopted a similar audit strategy where possible.
We have designated Argos as a full scope component and performed audit 
procedures on specific balances including in the Argos Financial Services and 
Argos Asia entities.  Risk
Supplier arrangements
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 68); Accounting policies 
(page 114); and note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 114)
The Group receives material discounts from suppliers, referred to as supplier 
arrangements. Complex supplier arrangements recognised in the income 
statement for the financial year are £343 million (2015/16: £371 million). These 
arrangements are described in note 2 to the financial statements. 
We focused our audit procedures on the areas where management applies 
judgement, where the processing is either manual or more complex and 
where the quantum of agreements is high. 
Our response to the risk
— We walked through the controls in place within the supplier arrangements 
process. We were able to take a controls-reliance approach over certain 
aspects of the process, testing the key controls. 
— We selected a sample of suppliers to whom we sent confirmations across 
all ‘deal’ types to confirm key deal input terms. We did not receive any 
responses where suppliers disagreed with the deal terms recorded. Where 
we did not receive a response from the supplier, we performed alternative 
procedures, including obtaining evidence of initiation and settlement of 
the arrangement.
— We tested the existence and valuation of balance sheet amounts 
recognised in accounts receivable and as a contra-asset in accounts 
payable by reviewing post period end settlement. We also performed 
a ‘look-back’ analysis of prior period balance sheet amounts to check 
that these amounts were appropriately recovered. 
— We tested the settlement of a sample of supplier arrangements 
recognised in the income statement, which included settlement in cash 
or by off-set to accounts payable. 
— Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the 
appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments to supplier 
arrangements to corroborating evidence.
— We tested deals recorded post period end and obtained the supplier 
agreement to validate that the deal was correctly recorded post 
period end.
— We read management’s disclosure in respect of supplier arrangements 
amounts recorded in the income statement and balance sheet to confirm 
completeness and accuracy of amounts disclosed.
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Supplier arrangement amounts are appropriately recognised in the income 
statement and balance sheet.
Risk
Aspects of revenue recognition
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 68); Accounting policies  
(page 120); and note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 117)
Our assessment is that the vast majority of the Group’s revenue transactions 
are non-complex, with no judgement applied over the amount recorded. 
We focused our work on the manual adjustments that are made to revenue. 
Our procedures were designed to address the risk of manipulation of 
accounting records and the ability to override controls. 
Our response to the risk
— We obtained a detailed understanding of these manual adjustments. 
Due to the manual nature of these adjustments, we performed 
substantive audit procedures.
— We used our computer-aided analytics tools to identify those revenue 
journals for which the corresponding entry was not cash. These entries 
include Nectar points, coupons and vouchers.
— We obtained corroborating evidence for such corresponding entries. 
For the Nectar points adjustment we obtained evidence from the 
administrator of the scheme. For third party coupons and vouchers we 
obtained evidence of collection and settlement.
— Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the 
appropriateness of journal entries impacting revenue, as well as other 
adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements. 
We considered unusual journals such as those posted outside expected 
hours, or by unexpected individuals, and for large or unusual amounts. 
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Adjustments to revenue have been appropriately recognised.
Risk
Financial Services customer receivables impairment
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 68); Accounting policies 
(page 133); and note 15b of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 133)
Financial Services customer receivables, through either credit cards, loans or 
Argos store cards, are significant. Total amounts recognised at 28 February 
2017 are £4,602 million (2016: £3,344 million). The provision for impairment 
is £89 million (2016: £79 million). There is judgement in the assumptions 
applied to calculate the loan provisions against outstanding balances.
Our response to the risk
The audit of Sainsbury’s Bank was completed by a component auditor from 
another audit firm. We agreed an audit strategy with the component auditor 
in advance of their testing and we reviewed the results of their work. The 
primary team performed the specific scope audit of Argos Financial Services. 
The audit strategy for both Sainsbury’s Bank and Argos Financial Services 
included the following:
— The loan impairment methodology was reviewed to confirm it was 
consistent with both the IFRS requirements and that previously applied.
— The completeness and accuracy of the data from underlying systems that 
were used in the impairment models were tested.
— Key assumptions including the probability of default and the size of 
the loss if default occurred were assessed against internal and external 
evidence. The key assumptions within the models were compared to 
knowledge of assumptions used in the banking sector and also with 
internal historical trends, concluding that, based on the evidence 
obtained, management’s conclusions were supportable.
— Changes to the modelling assumptions were assessed to confirm these 
were appropriate and in line with accounting standards.
— The accuracy of prior year impairment reserves was considered to assess 
the quality of management’s estimation process.
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
The provision for impairment of Financial Services receivables due from 
customers is appropriately recognised.
102 Financial Statements 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of J Sainsbury plc continued  Risk
HRG acquisition purchase price allocation
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 68); Accounting policies 
(page 169); and note 31 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 169)
The Group acquired Home Retail Group plc during the year. The provisional 
business combination fair values are outlined in note 31 to the financial 
statements.
We focused our risk on the areas where management applies judgement 
in the accounting and valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities, for 
example in calculation of the Argos brand.
Our response to the risk
— Our audit of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities was 
subject to full scope audit procedures by the primary team.
— We walked through the controls in place within the purchase price 
accounting process and understood management’s process to be in line 
with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
— We corroborated management’s assumptions by comparing to relevant 
available information assisted by our business valuation specialists. 
In particular, we challenged the discount rate and the useful economic 
life of the Argos brand.
— We tested the prospective financial information utilised in the calculation 
of the valuations based on the viewpoint of a market participant as 
defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
— We evaluated the adequacy of the business combination disclosures to 
the requirements in IFRS 3.
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
The provisional purchase price allocation is appropriately recognised.
Risk
The IT environment
The IT systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels 
of integration between them. The systems are vital to the ongoing operations 
of the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process. 
For Sainsbury’s Bank the key system relating to the customer loan receivable 
impairment, as described above, is provided by an external party.
Our response to the risk
— We held discussions with management to understand the IT environment 
and walked through the key financial processes to understand where IT 
systems were integral to the Group’s controls over financial reporting. 
From this we identified which IT systems to include in the scope for our 
detailed IT testing. 
— We assessed the IT general controls environment for the key systems 
impacting the accurate recording of transactions and the presentation 
of the financial statements.
— We designed our IT audit procedures to assess the IT environment, 
including an assessment of controls over changes made to the system 
and controls over appropriate access to the systems. 
— Where we found that adequate IT general controls were not in place, 
we performed additional substantive testing to mitigate the risk of 
material misstatement.
— Sainsbury’s Bank’s auditors received a report from the auditors on the 
general control environment of the outsourced systems and followed 
up on matters arising, performing further procedures as necessary. 
We discussed the remediation work performed by Sainsbury’s Bank’s 
auditors and reviewed their work.
What we concluded to the Audit Committee
We have not identified any misstatements in the financial statements due 
to the limitations of the IT environment.
The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation 
of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity 
within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the 
organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes 
in the business environment and other factors such as recent Internal Audit 
results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts of the components of the Group in the Group financial 
statements, we selected the head office company, J Sainsbury plc, 
Sainsbury’s and Argos trading entities and Sainsbury’s Bank components 
to perform full scope procedures. These represent the principal business 
units within the Group based on their size and risk characteristics.
For other entities including Argos Financial Services, the property companies, 
Argos Asia, joint ventures and insurance components we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts which we considered had the potential for 
the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of 
all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the 
coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
Of the remaining balances, none are individually greater than 5 per cent of 
the Group’s profit before tax excluding items noted below. For these accounts, 
we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of 
consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Involvement with component teams
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, 
as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from 
other EY network firms operating under our instruction. Of the full scope 
components, audit procedures were performed on the head office company, 
J Sainsbury plc, Sainsbury’s and Argos trading entities and consolidation of  
the Group by the primary team. The work at the specific scope locations  
was performed by EY components in Hong Kong, the Isle of Man and the 
primary team.
For the Sainsbury’s Bank full scope component, where the work was 
performed by auditors from another audit firm, we instructed the component 
auditor to perform specified procedures in response to our risk assessment. 
During the current period’s audit cycle, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited 
Sainsbury’s Bank and held discussions with management. The team 
discussed the audit approach with the component team and significant 
issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers on risk 
areas. The closing discussion was attended by the primary team. This, 
together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us 
appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion.
 103 Financial Statements Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides 
a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £34 million, which is 5.1 per 
cent of profit before tax excluding the items described below. We believe 
that this materiality basis provides us with the best assessment of the 
requirements of the users of the financial statements. This is consistent with 
the approach taken in the prior period. 
Starting basis Profit before tax £503m
Adjustments Net impairment and onerous contract charge £37m
Argos transaction and integration costs £53m
Sainsbury’s Bank transition costs £60m
Business rationalisation (£72m)
IT write-offs £57m
Restructuring costs £33m
Materiality Profit before tax excluding adjustments £671m
Materiality (5.1% of materiality basis) £34m
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. 
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds 
materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance 
materiality was approximately 75 per cent (2015/16: 50 per cent) of our 
planning materiality, namely £25 million (2015/16: £15 million). The reason 
for the change is that we have assessed the risk of material misstatement 
to be lower now this is no longer our first audit.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk 
of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk 
of misstatement at that component. In the current period, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was £5 million to  
£19 million (2015/16: £3 million to £11 million).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1.7 million (2015/16: £1.5 million), 
which is set at 5 per cent of planning materiality, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative 
measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 100, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our

with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

J Sainsbury plc is a public limited company (the ‘Company’) incorporated 
in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded on the London 
Stock Exchange. The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its 
registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT, United Kingdom.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 (prior financial 
year 52 weeks to 12 March 2016). The consolidated financial statements 
for the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 comprise the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the Group’s share of the post-
tax results of its joint ventures and associates. 
The Group’s principal activities are Food, General Merchandise & Clothing 
retailing and Financial Services. 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest 
million (‘£m’) unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on a going 
concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative 
financial instruments, defined benefit scheme assets, investment properties 
and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
Significant accounting policies have been included in the relevant notes to 
which the policies relate, and those relating to the financial statements as a 
whole can be read further below. Significant accounting policies have been 
applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements. 
As part of the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc an exercise has been 
performed to ensure that the accounting policies within both businesses 
are aligned. Based on this review, there have been no material changes to 
existing accounting policies from those disclosed in this Annual Report.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group consist of the financial 
statements of the ultimate parent company J Sainsbury plc, all entities 
controlled by the Company and the Group’s share of its interests in joint 
ventures and associates.
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the 
Group has control. This is when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results 
of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of 
acquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are 
eliminated upon consolidation.
Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish 
Limited Partnership are two partnerships the Group has an interest in, which  
are fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken 
advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships 
(‘Accounts’) Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts 
of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts. Separate accounts 
for these partnerships are not required to be, and have not been, filed at 
Companies House.
b) Joint ventures and associates
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, 
investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations 
or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of 
each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements 
and determined them to be joint ventures. The Group’s share of the post-
tax results of its joint ventures and associates is included in the income 
statement using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group  
transacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated  
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture or associate.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance 
sheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but  
not control.
Investment properties held by the Group are those contained within its joint 
ventures with Land Securities Group PLC and The British Land Company 
PLC. These are properties held for capital appreciation and/or to earn rental 
income. They are initially measured at cost, including related transaction 
costs. After initial recognition at cost, they are carried at their fair values 
based on market value determined by professional valuers at each reporting 
date. The difference between the fair value of an investment property at the 
reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included 
within the income statement but is excluded from underlying profit in order 
to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance 
of the Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. 
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the 
ultimate parent company’s functional currency. 
a) Foreign operations
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year. 
b) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement.
Amendments to published standards 
Effective for the Group and Company in these financial 
statements:
The Group has considered the following amendments to published standards 
that are effective for the Group for the financial year beginning 13 March 2016 
and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or that they

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Basis of preparation continued
Standards and revisions effective for future periods:
The following standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:
— IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ 
— IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
— IFRS 16, ‘Leases’
— Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’ on the disclosures in 
financial statements
IAS 7 is expected to impact disclosures only. The remaining standards have 
been considered in turn below:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 in its entirety, and is effective for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. For Sainsbury’s, the effective 
date is the financial year commencing 11 March 2018. Any changes to 
recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting 
the opening balance sheet at that time. There is no requirement to restate 
comparative amounts. 
The core areas addressed within IFRS 9 are as follows:
— Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities
— Impairment of financial assets
— Hedge accounting
The Group does not expect any material changes in relation to the 
classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, nor for 
hedge accounting other than additional disclosure requirements. The most 
significant impact on the Group is likely to be in relation to impairment of 
financial assets as outlined below. 
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets which are measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
other comprehensive income under IFRS 9 will be subject to the new 
impairment provisioning requirements of the standard, and it is this area 
which has the most impact on the Group in relation to loans and advances to 
customers within Financial Services. 
Financial Services’ current impairment policy under IAS 39 is to recognise 
losses only when an impairment event has been observed, and where 
an impairment event has arisen but has not yet been identified through 
observation of a specific impairment trigger. As a result, losses are generally 
not recognised when credit risk deteriorates, and only materialise when the 
deterioration results in an impairment event.
IFRS 9 introduces a three stage ‘expected credit loss (ECL)’ model which is 
forward looking and which generally will result in earlier recognition of credit 
losses. It is no longer necessary for an impairment event to have occurred 
before credit losses are recognised.
Stage 1 As soon as a financial instrument is originated or purchased, 
12-month expected credit losses must be recognised in profit 
and loss and an impairment allowance will be established
Stage 2 If the credit risk increases significantly (and the resulting 
credit quality is not considered to be low credit risk) full lifetime 
expected credit losses will be provided for
Stage 3 Financial assets will move into Stage 3 when they are considered 
to be credit impaired, i.e. when one or more events have occurred 
that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the asset
Implementation approach
The Group’s implementation project has been in place since early 2015 
(and has been expanded to incorporate subsidiaries acquired as part of the 
J Sainsbury’s acquisition of Home Retail Group). The primary objectives of the 
project are to: define accounting policies in compliance with the standard; 
deliver the necessary data, system and operational changes; and update the 
credit provisioning models and overall governance framework. The project 
is being jointly led by Sainsbury’s Bank’s Finance and Credit Risk functions, 
with support from external professional advisers. The project has a steering 
committee in place to provide appropriate oversight and governance; and a 
Technical Working Group to ensure that policy decisions and approaches are 
appropriate and in line with industry practice.
The Bank has defined its approach and methodology for ECL provisioning 
under IFRS 9, and has been developing models to comply with the new 
requirements.
Key judgemental areas still to be concluded on include the determination 
of ‘significant increase in credit risk’ (which is the key concept for moving 
from 12-month ECL to lifetime ECL), and the approach to modelling future 
economic scenarios. 
Until the ECL models are fully developed, the Group is unable to quantify 
the impact of transition to IFRS 9. Furthermore, the mapping of the three 
IFRS 9 impairment stages to regulatory treatment (specific versus general 
credit risk adjustments) is not clear at this time, pending further guidance 
from regulators. The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) has 
proposed a transitional approach to the impact of IFRS 9 on regulatory 
capital, whereby the Day 1 impact on CET1 capital may be spread over several 
years. The decision on whether or not to apply such an approach has been 
delegated to individual regulatory jurisdictions. The Group will fully consider 
the impact of IFRS 9 on the Bank’s regulatory capital once these proposals 
have been finalised within the European Union.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue’ will replace IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction 
Contracts’ for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2018. For Sainsbury’s, the effective date is the financial year commencing 
11 March 2018. Any changes to recognition and measurement will be applied 
retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time. There is 
no requirement to restate comparative amounts. 
The core principle of the standard is that an entity will recognise revenue 
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to 
a customer.
To apply this principle, entities must follow the five-step model below: 
1 Identify the contract(s) with a customer – written, oral or implied by an 
entity’s customary business practices. 
2 Identify the performance obligations in the contract(s) – evaluate the 
terms in the contract to identify all the promised goods or services and 
then determine which of these will be treated as separate performance 
obligations. They are separate if the customer can benefit from the good 
or service on its own (i.e. it is distinct). 
3 Determine the transaction price – the amount that an entity expects to 
be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, 
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations – generally 
in proportion to their stand-alone selling prices.
5 Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance – 
when control of a promised good or service transfers to the customer.
The Group has performed a detailed impact assessment during the year, 
identifying all current sources of revenue and analysing the accounting 
requirements for each under IFRS 15. Currently the Group does not expect any 
material changes to either revenue or profit as a result of adopting IFRS 15.
112 Financial Statements 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Basis of preparation continued
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ for accounting periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2019. For Sainsbury’s, the effective date 
is the financial year commencing 10 March 2019. The core principal of the 
standard is to provide a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees 
to recognise a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases unless the 
term is less than 12 months or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16’s 
approach to lessor accounting is mostly unchanged from IAS 17.
The transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the balance sheet 
as all operating leases will need to be recognised on the balance sheet. 
Furthermore, rental expense in the income statement will be replaced with 
depreciation and interest expense.
The Group’s implementation project commenced in 2016 to ensure all leases 
acquired as part of the Home Retail Group transaction were also captured. 
The primary objectives of the project are to: define accounting policies in 
compliance with the standard; identify all leases within the Group; capture 
the necessary data for each lease, including discount rates; determine a 
transition approach; understand and implement necessary system and 
operational changes; and update the Group’s leasing strategy and overall 
governance framework. The project is being led by Group Finance with 
support from external professional advisers. The project has a steering 
committee in place to provide appropriate oversight and governance; and a 
Technical Working Group to ensure that policy decisions and approaches are 
appropriate and in line with industry practice.
The Group is currently in the process of developing updated accounting 
policies (including the application of practical expedients) and is assessing 
the information requirements for each lease.
A key area still to be concluded on is the transition approach. Whilst the 
impact of transition is likely to be material, the Group is unable to quantify 
the effect of transition at this time.
2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires 
the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Those which are significant to the Group are discussed separately below:
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has 
made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
a) Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale
At each balance sheet date management assesses whether any assets, 
whose carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than continued use, meet the definition of held for sale. Where there is an 
active plan in place to locate a buyer, management consider such assets 
to meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale if they are available for 
immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. 
For more information on the assets and liabilities held for sale, refer to note 16.
b) Operating lease commitments
The Group is party to commercial property leases on a number of its stores. 
At inception of each lease, the terms and conditions of the arrangements 
are evaluated to assess whether the lease terms constitute a major part 
of the economic life of the assets and whether the present value of the 
minimum lease payments amount to substantially all of the fair value of 
the commercial property. Where there is no evidence of this, management 
concludes that all the significant risks and rewards of ownership do not 
transfer to the Group and these leases are accounted for as operating leases. 
Further information about committed operating lease payments is included 
in note 32.
c) Consolidation of structured entities
A structured entity is one in which Sainsbury’s does not hold the majority 
interest but for which management has concluded that voting rights are not 
the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. In making such an 
assessment, management considers the terms of the arrangement to assess 
who has responsibility for the management of the entity and its assets. 
Where Sainsbury’s has this responsibility, it is deemed that the Group controls 
the entity and it is fully consolidated into the Group accounts. The structured 
entities applicable to the Group are Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership 
and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership.
d) Aggregation of operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments based on the 
information provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker for the Group) to make operational decisions on the management of 
the Group. Following the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc in September 
2016, four operating segments were identified as follows:
— Retail – Food
— Retail – General Merchandise & Clothing
— Financial Services
— Property Investment
Management has considered the economic characteristics, similarity of 
products, production processes, customers, sales methods and regulatory 
environment of its two Retail segments. In doing so it has been concluded 
that they should be aggregated into one ‘Retail’ segment in the financial 
statements. This aggregated information provides users the financial 
information needed to evaluate the business and the environment in which  
it operates.
Estimates and assumptions 
The areas where estimates and assumptions are significant to the 
financial statements are as described below. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. 
a) Business combinations
As part of the acquisition of Home Retail Group, the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired, including intangible assets and contingent liabilities, 
were recognised at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business 
combinations’. The determination of the fair values on acquired assets and 
liabilities is based to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. 
In particular, the valuation of £179 million for the acquired Argos brand was 
sensitive to management’s assessment of useful economic life (UEL), which 
was estimated to be ten years. A movement of plus or minus one year on  
the UEL would have resulted in a brand asset movement of £25 million/  
£(28) million.
b) Impairment of assets
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any impairment 
loss, based on the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) 
or group of CGUs to which it is allocated. The recoverable amounts of the 
CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations and these 
calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and 
suitable discount rates, as disclosed in note 11. Actual outcomes could vary 
from these estimates. 
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based 
on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable 
amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs 
to dispose. Value in use is calculated from expected future cash flows 
using suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions and 
estimates of future performance. 
 113 Financial Statements 2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions continued
Impairment loss calculations on loans and advances within Financial Services 
(note 15(b)) involve the estimation of future cash flows of financial assets, 
based on observable data at the balance sheet date and historical loss 
experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. This will typically 
take into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience and 
default levels. These calculations are undertaken on a portfolio basis using 
various statistical modelling techniques.
Impairment models are continually reviewed to ensure data and assumptions 
are appropriate, with the most material assumption being around expected 
loss rates. The accuracy of any such impairment calculation will be affected 
by unexpected changes to the economic situation, and assumptions 
which differ from actual outcomes. As such, judgement is applied when 
determining the levels of provisioning.
c) Post-employment benefits
The Group operates two defined benefit schemes for its employees – the 
Sainsbury’s Defined Benefit Scheme and the Home Retail Group Defined 
Benefit Scheme. The present value of the schemes’ liabilities recognised at 
the balance sheet date and the net financing charge recognised in the income 
statement are dependent on interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. 
Other key assumptions within this calculation are based on market conditions 
or estimates of future events, including mortality rates, as set out in note 29. 
The carrying value of the retirement benefit obligations will be impacted 
by changes to any of the assumptions used, however is most sensitive to 
changes in the discount rate. Sensitivities to movements in the discount rate 
are included in note 29.
d) Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, onerous contracts, 
dilapidations, restructuring, insurance and long service awards. These 
provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future cash 
flows are dependent on future events and market conditions. Any difference 
between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted 
for in the period when such determination is made. The carrying amount 
of provisions will be impacted by changes in the discount rate. Details of 
provisions are set out in note 18.
e) Income taxes
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation of 
the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate 
tax determination of certain items. Where the actual liability arising from 
these items differs from these estimates, such differences will have an 
impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period when such 
determination is made. Detail of the tax charge and deferred tax are set out 
in note 7.
f) Determining fair values
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available 
from the market on which the instruments are traded. Where market values 
are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been 
calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts and 
payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.
g) Supplier arrangements
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, collectively known as ‘supplier 
arrangements’, represent a material deduction to cost of sales and 
administrative expenses and directly affect the Group’s reported margin. The 
arrangements can be complex, with amounts spanning multiple products 
over different time periods, and there can be multiple triggers and discounts. 
The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade receivables or 
trade payables, depending on the right of offset. The four key types are  
as follows:
— Discounts and supplier incentives – these represent the majority of 
all supplier arrangements and are linked to individual unit sales. The 
incentive is typically based on an agreed sum per item sold on promotion 
for a period and therefore is considered part of the purchase price of  
that product.
— Fixed amounts – these are agreed with suppliers primarily to support  
in-store activity including promotions, such as utilising specific space. 
These involve a degree of judgement and estimation in ensuring the 
appropriate cut-off of arrangements for fixed amounts which span  
period-end. These require judgement to determine when the terms of  
the arrangement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the  
correct period. 
— Supplier rebates – these are typically agreed on an annual basis, aligned 
with the Group’s financial year. The rebate amount is linked to pre-agreed 
targets such as sales volumes and requires estimates of the amount 
earned up to the balance sheet date, for each relevant supplier contract. 
Where agreements span a financial period-end, estimations are required 
of projected turnover and judgement may also need to be applied to 
determine the rebate level earned as agreements may involve multiple 
tiers. In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, supplier 
confirmations are obtained to agree the value to be recognised at year-
end, prior to it being invoiced. Rebates represent the smallest element of 
the Group’s supplier arrangements and by aligning the agreements to the 
Group’s financial year, where possible, the judgements required  
are minimised.
— Marketing and advertising income – income which is directly linked to the 
cost of producing the Argos catalogue is recognised once agreed with the 
supplier and when the catalogue is made available to the Group which is 
the point at which the catalogue costs are recognised.
Of the above categories, fixed amounts, supplier rebates and marketing and 
advertising income involve a level of judgement and estimation. The amounts 
recognised in the income statement for these three categories in the financial 
year are as follows:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Fixed amounts (within cost of sales) 204 302
Supplier rebates (within cost of sales) 87 69
Marketing and advertising income

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Segment reporting 
Background
The Group’s businesses are organised into four operating segments:
— Retail – Food;
— Retail – General Merchandising & Clothing; 
— Financial Services (Sainsbury’s Bank plc and Argos Financial Services entities); and
— Property Investments (The British Land Company PLC joint venture and Land Securities Group PLC joint venture).
As discussed in note 2, the Food and General Merchandise & Clothing segments have been aggregated into a Retail segment in the financial statements.

Accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and online and, in the case of Financial Services, interest receivable, fees and commissions and excludes Value 
Added Tax. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.
a) Retail – sale of goods
Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, the cost of Nectar reward points issued and redeemed, colleague discounts, vouchers and sales made on 
an agency basis. Commission income is recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.
Sales of in-store goods are generally recognised at the point of cash receipt. Where Nectar credits such as vouchers or loyalty points are provided as part of the 
sales transaction, the amount allocated to the credits is deferred and recognised when the credits are redeemed and the Group fulfils its obligations to supply 
the credit. For delivered goods, sales are recognised when the goods have been delivered. 
b) Other income
Other income generally consists of profits and losses on disposal of assets. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset 
and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
c) Financial Services interest receivable 
Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This calculation 
takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the 
expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition. 
d) Financial Services fees and commissions 
Fees and commissions that are not integral to the effective interest rate calculation relate primarily to certain credit card and storecard fees, ATM interchange 
fees, insurance introduction commission and warranty commission receivable. These are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis as services 
are provided. Where in the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit share, both are recognised on completion 
of the service to the extent reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential claw back, an appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred 
and amortised over the clawback period. Where the relevant contract requires Financial Services to perform future services in respect of the income receivable, 
initial commission is recognised on completion of the service provided, with an element deferred to reflect services yet to be performed in future periods. 
e) Financial Services other operating income
Margin from the sale of travel money, representing the difference between the cost price and the selling price, is recognised when the sale to the customer 
takes place within other operating income.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all costs that are directly attributable to the point of sale including warehouse, transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail 
outlets. In the case of Financial Services, cost of sales includes interest expense on operating activities, calculated using the effective interest method.

Accounting policies
Finance income and costs, excluding those arising from Financial Services, are recognised in the income statement for financial assets and liabilities measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For Financial Services, finance income and finance costs are recognised in revenue and cost of sales.
Interest paid and interest received for the purpose of the cash flow statement relates to retail only, with Financial Services interest paid and interest received 
included in the net operating cash flow.
The coupons on the perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are accounted for as dividends in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Presentation’ and hence are not a finance cost.

Accounting policies
Current tax
Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or credited to the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or 
the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The main rate of UK corporation tax is reducing from 20 per cent to 19 per cent effective from 1 April 2017. A further reduction in the corporation tax rate to 
17 per cent, rather than 18 per cent, effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted in the year, so its effect is reflected in these financial statements. 
Deferred tax on temporary differences and tax losses as at the balance sheet date is calculated at the substantively enacted rates at which the temporary 
differences and tax losses are expected to reverse.

Deferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of all temporary differences and tax losses giving rise to deferred income tax assets because it is 
probable that these assets will be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the 
deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (note 22), which are treated as cancelled. For diluted earnings per 
share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the senior convertible bonds (net of tax) and by the coupons on the 
perpetual subordinated convertible bonds (net of tax).
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. These represent share 
options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the number 
of shares that would be issued if all senior convertible bonds and perpetual subordinated convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any non-underlying items as defined in note 3. This alternative measure of earnings per 
share is presented to reflect the Group’s underlying trading performance.

After the balance sheet date on 2 May 2017, a final dividend of 6.6 pence per share (2016: 8.1 pence per share) was proposed by the Directors in respect of the 
52 weeks to 11 March 2017. This results in a total final proposed dividend of £144 million (2016: £155 million), a decrease of 7.1 per cent on the previous year. 
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 7 July 2017 to the shareholders on the register at 12 May 2017. 
The proposed final dividend has not been included as a liability at 11 March 2017. 
Of the above dividend of £232 million, £2 million remained unpaid at the year-end.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policies
a) Land and buildings
Land and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Capital work in progress is held 
at cost less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
b) Fixtures and equipment
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use. 
c) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates:
— Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term if shorter
— Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – three to 15 years 
— Freehold land is not depreciated
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the asset’s carrying amount and are recognised 
within operating profit. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to 
dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For Retail property, plant and equipment, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store or store pipeline development site. 
Non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, are reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed a separate CGU.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change in 
the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional 
accumulated depreciation if lower. 
Capitalisation of interest
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief. 
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
a) Finance leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the 
lease term. The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term. The 
resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges. Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement.
b) Lease incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.
c) Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease.

11 Intangible assets
Accounting policies
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again 
whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
b) Computer software 
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software and software 
licences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to ten years. Costs relating to development of computer software for 
internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria 
are expensed as incurred. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives 
of five to ten years within administrative expenses. 
c) Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with finite useful economic lives 
are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
economic lives, ranging from three to ten years, within administrative expenses.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its 
value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For retail goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each retail chain of stores acquired. Non-store assets, including IT assets, are 
reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed a separate CGU.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss 
on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.

The goodwill balances above are allocated to the respective cash-generating units (CGUs) or group of CGUs within the Retail or Financial Services segment. The 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and the level at which it is monitored in the retailing segment are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains 
of stores, whilst Financial Services is a separate CGU. 
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group 
of CGUs with the carrying value of its goodwill. The calculation of the Retail CGU’s value in use is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the 
stores using the latest budget and forecast data. Board approved cash flow projections for five years are used and then extrapolated out assuming flat cash 
flows and discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent (2016: nine per cent) over the earlier of a 25 year period (being the estimated average remaining useful 
life of a freehold store) or lease length for leasehold stores. Financial Services CGU’s value in use is calculated using Board approved cash flows discounted at 
a pre-tax rate of nine per cent (2016: nine per cent) over a five year period with a terminal value. 
Based on the operating performance of the CGUs, an impairment of goodwill of £nil million was identified in the current financial year (2016: £nil million). 
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in any impairment of goodwill. 
Additions to acquired intangibles arose from the acquisition of HRG and relates to the Argos brand. This is being amortised over ten years.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12 Investments in joint ventures and associates
Accounting policies
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures 
depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to 
be joint ventures. The Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates is included in the income statement using the equity method 
of accounting. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
venture or associate.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance sheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control.

13 Available-for-sale financial assets
Accounting policies
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories (fair value through 
profit or loss and loans and receivables). They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of 
the balance sheet date. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the 
movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income reserves is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement 
when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. Interest on available-for-sale debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.

The other financial asset predominantly represents the Group’s beneficial interest in a commercial property investment pool. The fair value of the other 
financial asset is based on discounted cash flows assuming a property rental growth rate of 0.5 per cent (2016: 0.6 per cent) and a weighted average cost of 
capital of nine per cent (2016: nine per cent). There were no disposals or impairment provisions on available-for-sale financial assets in either the current or the 
previous financial year.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14 Inventories
Accounting policies
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for resale or in the course of development and are valued on a weighted average cost basis 
and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Cost includes all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing 
inventories to their present location and condition.

15 Receivables
(a) Trade and other receivables
Accounting policies
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are on commercial terms. Other receivables have both non-interest and interest bearing receivables. Trade and 
other receivables are stated at their carrying amounts and are written off when management deems them uncollectable or forgiven.

Current other receivables of £312 million (2016: £305 million), which include £165 million (2016: £170 million) of bank funds in the course of settlement, are 
generally non-interest bearing. The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the overwhelming 
majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means. New parties wishing to obtain credit terms with the Group are credit 
checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis.
(b) Amounts due from Financial Services customers 
Accounting policies
Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision for 
impairment and recognised on the balance sheet when cash is advanced. For the Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending and 
personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following 
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. Such evidence may include a missed interest or principal payment or the breach of a banking covenant. 
Provisioning on unsecured balances identified as being in arrears is calculated based on past experience, with regularly updated assumptions. The present 
value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined after taking into account any security held. The amount of impairment is calculated by comparing 
the present value of the cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate with the balance sheet carrying value. If impaired, the carrying value 
is adjusted and the difference charged to the income statement and a provision recognised in the balance sheet.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to the net realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate. This is reported 
through interest receivable within the income statement and represents the unwinding of the discount.
A write-off is made when all or part of a loan or advance is deemed uncollectable or forgiven. Write-offs are charged against previously established  
provisions for impairment or directly to the income statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off decrease the charge for loan impairment 
in the income statement.
 133 Financial Statements 15 Receivables continued
An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified 
as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors. This includes analysis of the likelihood of a particular balance to move into an arrears 
status within a defined period of time and application of an appropriate loss rate. The emergence period into an arrears state represents the average time 
elapsed between the loss trigger event and default. The methodology and assumptions used are regularly reviewed to reduce any differences between 
estimates and actual results.

to the Bank. As at 11 March 2017, there was £nil (2016: £nil) borrowings drawn down.
Financial Services has assigned the beneficial interest in £378 million (2016: £379 million) of its personal loans book to a Special Purpose Entity for use as 
collateral in securitisation transactions, facilitating £311 million (2016: £300 million) of drawings.

16 Assets and liabilities held for sale
Accounting policies
Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification and the assets and 
liabilities are available-for-sale in their present condition. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to dispose.

£311 million had been drawn as at 11 March 2017 (12 March 2016: £300 million). Interest on the notes is repayable at a floating rate linked to three-month LIBOR 
and their contractual repayment is determined by cash flows on the relevant personal loans included in the collateral pool.
Other deposits of £509 million (2016: £248 million) relate to deposits from wholesale counterparties. 
18 Provisions
Accounting policies
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefit will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
The need for provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, is assessed when the leased property becomes vacant and is no longer 
used in the operations of the business or when the leased property relates to an unprofitable trading store. Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised on 
a lease-by-lease basis.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits. The amounts provided are based on the 
Group’s best estimate of the likely committed outflow net of anticipated future benefits and after any impairment of pipeline development site assets where 
applicable.
The costs of long service awards are accrued over the period the service is provided by the employee when it is probable that settlement will be required 
and they are capable of being measured reliably. Liabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the 
estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those 
affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of 
a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring.

The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations 
from their functional currency to the presentation currency of the parent.
The available-for-sale assets reserve represents the fair value gains and losses on the available-for-sale financial assets held by the Group. The cash flow hedge 
reserve represents the cumulative effective fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges in the Group.
The convertible bond reserve represents the equity component of the £450 million convertible bond issued in November 2014.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of B shares. Shareholders approved a £680 million return of share capital, by way of a B share scheme, 
at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 July 2004. The final redemption date for B shares was 18 July 2007 and all transactions relating to the B 
shares have now been completed.
21 Perpetual securities
Accounting policies and key information
Perpetual securities (perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds) are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly any 
periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time it becomes obligated to pay the periodic return. 
Any associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.
On 30 July 2015 the Group issued £250 million of perpetual subordinated capital securities and £250 million of perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, 
collectively known as perpetual securities. Costs directly associated with the issue of £6 million were offset against the value of the proceeds. The securities 
are perpetual with no fixed redemption date. Holders of the perpetual securities do not benefit from any put option rights however the Group does have the 
right to call the perpetual subordinated capital securities at their principal amount on 30 July 2020, and the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds on 
30 July 2021. The perpetual subordinated convertible bonds may be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time 
up to 23 July 2021 at a conversion price of 327.4615 pence.
The Group has the right to defer coupons on the perpetual securities on any coupon payment date where the Company has not either paid a dividend on its 
ordinary shares or bought back ordinary shares (excluding shares bought to satisfy employee share schemes) within the previous 12 month period. The coupon 
rate on the perpetual subordinated capital securities increases after the fifth anniversary and for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds after the sixth 
anniversary.
The next coupon date on the perpetual securities is 30 July 2017. As the Company paid a dividend to ordinary shareholders in the 12 months prior to this date 
(in January 2017), the periodic distributions of £7 million for the perpetual subordinated capital securities and £16 million for the perpetual subordinated 
convertible bonds have been recognised in the financial year.

138 Financial Statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and 
capital risk.
Financial risk management is managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines which are reviewed and approved by 
the Board of Directors. The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance by identifying 
financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The risk management policies also ensure sufficient liquidity is available to the Group to 
meet foreseeable financial obligations and that cash assets are invested safely.
Financial risk management with respect to Financial Services is separately managed within the Financial Services’ governance structure. The risks are more 
fully described in the Financial Services section below. 
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts 
to hedge interest rate exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by Board approved policies which prohibits the use of derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector and the cyclical 
profile of the non-food retail sector. Cash flow forecasts are produced to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements. The Group’s liquidity 
policy sets a minimum funding headroom of £400 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time horizon. The Group manages its liquidity 
risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding contingent committed credit facilities.
The Group maintains a contingent committed revolving credit facility of £1,150 million. The £1,150 million facility is split into two tranches, a £500 million Facility 
(A) maturing in May 2019 and a £650 million Facility (B) maturing in May 2020. As at 11 March 2017, £nil had been drawn (2016: £nil). 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.  
The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows or an estimate of cash flows in respect of floating interest rate liabilities.

3.6 per cent for future years (2016: RPI of 1.1 per cent for the year ended 12 March 2016, 1.3 per cent for the year ended 11 March 2017, and 3.0 per cent for future years). 
2 Cash flows relating to debt bearing a floating interest rate have been calculated using prevailing interest rates as at 11 March 2017 and 12 March 2016.
3 Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated using spot rates as at 11 March 2017 and 12 March 2016.
4  The swap rate that matches the remaining term of the interest rate swap as at 11 March 2017 has been used to calculate the floating rate cash flows over the life of the interest rate swaps shown above 
(2016: 12 March 2016).
5  Cash flows relating to amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers and banks are calculated using contractual terms and interest rates for fixed rate instruments. Where balances are contractually 
repayable on demand, behavioural assumptions are applied to estimate the interest payable on those balances. These are shown as due within one year.

The year-on-year increase in foreign exchange projected cash outflows and inflows is largely as a result of the acquisition of Home Retail Group.
Further information relating to liquidity risk in Financial Services is more fully described in the separate section on Financial Services financial risk factors below.
Counterparty credit risk
Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the Group’s holdings of cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables and loans and advances to 
customers. The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £6,967 million (2016: £5,554 million), equivalent to the Group’s total financial assets, and of this 
amount £5,620 million relates to Financial Services (2016: £4,326 million). 
The Group (excluding Financial Services) sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on their credit ratings, the 
minimum unsecured long-term credit rating accepted by the Group is BBB+ (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) or Baa1 (Moody’s) or, in the case of sterling liquidity 
funds, AAA or Aaa/MR1+ from Moody’s. In the event of a split credit rating, the lower rating applies.
The table below analyses the Group’s cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash, cash in transit and cash at ATMs:

Management does not expect any losses arising from non-performance of deposit counterparties.
Interest rate swaps, forward contracts and commodity contracts for difference are used by the Group to hedge interest rate, foreign currency and fuel 
exposures. The table below analyses the fair value of the Group’s derivative financial assets by credit exposure, excluding any collateral held.

The Group holds certain financial derivatives which are subject to credit support agreements. Under these agreements cash collateral is posted by one party 
to the other party should the fair value of the financial derivative exceed a pre-agreed level. As at 11 March 2017, the Group held no collateral against financial 
derivative assets (2016: nil). 
Financial Services has derivatives that are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and their associated credit support annex bilateral 
agreements whereby if the fair value exceeds a pre-agreed level, cash collateral is exchanged. As at 11 March 2017, Financial Services and its subsidiary 
undertakings had provided collateral of £19 million (2016: £13 million) against the derivatives.
The Group also operates a cash pooling arrangement and collective net overdraft facility with its main clearing bank. As at 11 March 2017, the Group had  
£6 million (2016: £3 million) under this facility. 
Foreign currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in exchange rates impacting the Group’s foreign currency denominated  
supply contracts. 
The Group’s currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the Group’s income statement by requiring highly probable foreign 
currency cash flows to be hedged. Highly probable future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis using 
foreign currency forward contracts.
The Group has exposure to currency risk on balances held in foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing 
differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments. 
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact of a ten per cent movement 
in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling as at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, is summarised in the table below:

The year-on-year increase in foreign exchange related sensitivities is largely as a result of the acquisition of Home Retail Group.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of increased costs or lower income arising from unexpected movements in interest rates and inflation rates impacting on the 
Group’s borrowing and investment portfolios. The Group’s interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates by maintaining 
a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities. 
Interest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings are less frequent than once every 12 months. Interest on 
financial instruments is classified as floating rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings occur every 12 months or more frequently. Floating rate instruments are 
considered variable capped rate if the nominal interest rate is subject to a cap.

Commodity risk
Commodity risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in commodity prices impacting the Group’s own use consumption of 
electricity, gas and diesel. 
The Group hedges own use consumption of electricity and gas with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with its suppliers. The Group 
uses a combination of purchasing agreements and financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference. 
The Group considers a ten per cent movement in commodity prices a reasonable measure of volatility.

Capital risk management
The Group defines capital as total equity plus net debt.
The Board’s capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Group’s strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for 
shareholders and safeguard the Group’s status as a going concern. There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year. 
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover. 
The Board can manage the Group’s capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, recycling 
capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital expenditure.
From time-to-time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share option programmes; 
however the Group does not operate a defined share buy-back plan.
Part of the Group’s capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants included in the Group’s various borrowing facilities. There have 
been no breaches of general covenants in the financial year ended 11 March 2017.

Information relating to Financial Services capital risk management is detailed below.
Financial Services
Sainsbury’s Bank (including Argos Financial Services) has identified a set of primary risk types (see table) that are overseen by a dedicated second line function. 
These risks are actively managed through primary risk policies and supporting policy standards that clearly articulate the rules, boundaries and measures 
by which the risks are controlled and help each colleague to understand their individual responsibilities. Our risk reporting processes provide a detailed and 
aggregated view of these risks to facilitate an active review and management process within defined risk appetite.
Primary Risk Approach and mitigating actions
Financial Primary Risk
Liquidity and Funding Risk
Holding insufficient resources to meet obligations as they fall due or 
only being able to access them at an excessive cost.
Example: A sudden and significant withdrawal of savings balances due 
to market uncertainty.
— Liquidity and Funding policy aligned to risk appetite, with targets 
for key ratios and coverage of stress outflows.
— Key liquidity and funding ratios are monitored and reported on 
a daily basis with triggers in place for escalation.
— Regular reviews of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ILAAP), funding plan and Liquidity Contingency Plan to 
support resilience.
Market Risk
The risk that the Bank’s earnings and value would be reduced as result 
of adverse change to market parameters. 
Example: Changes in the level and volatility of movement in interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates.
— The Bank has a detailed market risk policy, which sets out its 
market risk limit structure. Earnings and market value sensitivity is 
reported on a regular basis to ALCO. 
— All new banking products or amendments to the terms of existing 
products are reviewed from an interest rate risk perspective to 
ensure compliance with existing risk appetite.
Retail Credit Risk
Losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their capital or 
interest repayment obligations as they fall due.
Example: Adverse changes in UK macro-economic factors impacting on 
the credit quality of the Bank’s assets.
— Credit Risk policy aligned with risk appetite limits.
— Robust credit decisioning tools use multiple sources of credit 
reference agency data in decisions and monitoring.
— Effective credit risk governance and committee framework.
— Regular reporting framework in place, including reference to 
external benchmarking. 
— Stress testing applied, early warning triggers in place.
Wholesale Credit Risk
Losses arising from institutional counterparties failing to meet their 
contractual cash flow obligations.
Example: Downgrades in the credit rating of counterparties.
— Counterparty limits are in place to control exposure levels.
— Key ratios are monitored and reported on a daily basis with triggers 
in place for escalation.
— Regular monitoring of credit ratings migration and CDS pricing of 
the Bank’s key counterparties.
Capital Adequacy Risk
Holding an insufficient level or quality of capital for normal or stress 
requirements, or an inefficient deployment of capital.
Example: Adverse changes in the economy could deplete capital 
resources and/or increase capital requirements.
— Capital policy aligned to risk appetite, with a range set for normal 
conditions along with stress minimums.
— Capital adequacy is monitored and reported on a daily basis with 
triggers in place for escalation.
— The annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) 
determines the adequacy of capital resources as well as mitigating 
actions.
Further detail on each of these risks is shown below:
Liquidity and funding risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its payment obligations as they fall due, or can only do so at extreme cost. We seek to ensure that we can 
meet our financial obligations at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.
The annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) enables the Bank to:
(1) demonstrate that it understands the liquidity risks it is running 
(2) assess its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and 
(3) put in place appropriate controls to mitigate liquidity risks. 
In meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Bank maintains a stock of high quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright 
sale or repurchase agreement to meet the Bank’s obligations to depositors and other creditors.
The Bank’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are regularly monitored and forecast alongside cash flow and funding ratios. 
We prepare long-term and short-term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual 
maturities and customer deposit patterns (stable or less stable deposits) as well as outflows regarding pipelines and commitments. These reports support daily 
liquidity management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with the risk appetite, 
Liquidity and Funding Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan. Asset encumbrance ratios and risk indicators for wholesale funding concentrations by type 
(total/secured/unsecured), maturity, sector, geography and counterparty are also regularly monitored and reported to ALCO.

Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the value of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, capital and earnings are exposed to the adverse change of the market risk drivers. 
The Bank’s market risks include Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk. The Bank does not have a trading book. 
Interest rate risk
IRRBB arises from interest rates movements which impact present value and timing of future cash flows resulting in changes to the underlying value of a 
bank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and hence its economic value. Interest rates movements also affect a bank’s earnings by altering 
interest-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest income.
The main types of interest rate risk faced by the Bank are:
a)  Re-pricing gap risk: the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of bank assets and liabilities (e.g. fixed rate personal loans and 
instant access savings accounts). 
b) Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve. 
c)  Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices (e.g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets 
linked to LIBOR).
d) Prepayment risk: the risk arising from the timing of customer prepayments which differ from planning and hedging assumptions.
e) Pipeline risk: the risk of a customer drawing down, or not, a product at a rate which is unfavourable for the Bank.
Interest risk exposure is actively managed within limits that are aligned with the Bank’s risk appetite by using financial instruments such as interest rate swaps 
and by taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities. The hedging strategies are implemented to ensure the Bank remains within its limits 
and that it takes advantage of natural hedging opportunities between fixed rate assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics. 
In order to measure the exposure to interest rate risk under various interest rates shock scenarios, the Bank uses both economic value and earnings-based 
metrics: Market Value Sensitivity and Earnings at Risk. These metrics are monthly monitored and reported to ALCO.
For interest rate risk measurement, products are allocated within re-pricing gap analysis based on their nearest re-pricing date (all non-maturing deposits are 
assumed to re-price in month one) and personal loans are allocated according to behavioural repayment profile. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Bank is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euro and US dollar, within its Travel Money bureaux in 
J Sainsbury’s stores. Starting February 2017 the FX positions are hedged on a daily basis.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the failure of customers or other counterparties to settle their financial obligations to the Bank. 
Retail credit risk
Management of credit risk in respect of retail customers makes use of automated credit decisioning techniques (both scorecards and policy rules) for new 
applications. In addition, behavioural scoring is used to assess the conduct of customers’ accounts on an on-going basis, for example granting extensions to 
limits. Underwriting is undertaken by specialist teams in operational areas to complement these processes. The Retail Credit Risk Committee ensures that 
appropriate policies are established and adhered to and this is subject to further oversight from the Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit teams carry out 
regular reviews of credit risk processes and policies are reviewed and re-approved on an annual basis.
Wholesale and derivative credit risk
The Bank invests its liquidity resources in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and internal Operational 
Liquidity Pool (OLP). These investments include the Bank of England’s (BoE) reserve account, UK government securities (gilts or Treasury bills), multilateral 
development bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities UK regulated covered bond programmes and asset backed securities. 
Limits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity. Consideration is also given 
to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings. Derivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied 
to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark to market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash 
collateral to cover exposures. Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Bank’s Treasury department, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers 
for escalation.

Financial Services capital resources (unaudited)
The following table analyses the regulatory capital resources under both transitional and end point measures of CRD IV (for which there is no difference in 
the case of the Bank). CRD IV regulations are being phased in over a five year period from 2013 – 2018. From a prudential perspective, the Bank is monitored 
and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, from the point of acquisition of Argos Financial Services 
onwards. The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis 
only. Therefore, the 28 February 2017 capital position shown below is on a regulatory consolidated basis, but the comparative shows the Bank standalone 
position.

Capital management
The Bank manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its activities. 
During the period to 28 February 2017, the Bank received planned injections of £130 million of ordinary share capital to support the increased capital 
requirements resulting from: the acquisition of Argos Financial Services and forecast costs and deductible intangible assets generated through the 
development of flexible banking platforms. Capital adequacy is monitored on an on-going basis by senior management, the ALCO, the Executive Risk 
Committee and the Board Risk Committee. Our submissions to the PRA in the year have shown that the Bank has complied with all externally imposed capital 
requirements. The Bank’s capital ratio of 13.3 per cent exceeds internal and regulatory thresholds.
Sainsbury’s Bank plc, as the principal regulated entity within Financial Services, will disclose Pillar 3 information as required by the Capital Requirements 
Regulations and PRA prudential sourcebook on the J Sainsbury plc external website.
 149 Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments
Accounting policies
a) Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), loans and receivables, and available-for-sale (AFS). 
AFS investments are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs and are recognised at the trade date. Financial assets held at FVTPL are initially 
recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed.
‘Financial assets at FVTPL’ include financial assets held for trading and those designated at FVTPL at inception. FVTPL are derivatives classified as held for 
trading unless they are accounted for as an effective hedging instrument. ‘Financial assets at FVTPL’ are recorded at fair value, with any fair value gains or 
losses recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They 
are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Subsequent to 
initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other 
comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
reserves are recycled is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entity’s 
right to receive payment is established. Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Group has no 
intention of trading these loans and receivables and include amounts due from Financial Services customers and amounts due from other banks. Subsequent 
to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method. Income 
from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially 
all risks and rewards of ownership.
Within Financial Services, securities sold subject to standard sale and repurchase agreements (‘repos’) are not derecognised where the Bank retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership by virtue of the predetermined repurchase price. The counterparty liability is included in other deposits.
b) Impairment of financial assets
An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment is carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets at the balance sheet date. 
An assessment of impairment may be of individual assets (‘individual impairment’) or of a portfolio of assets (‘collective impairment’) where indicators arise. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is considered to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of 
the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For individual impairment, the principal loss event is one or more missed payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, including 
arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual payments, fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators. An assessment of collective 
impairment will be made of financial assets with similar risk characteristics. For these assets, portfolio loss experience is used to provide objective evidence 
of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on loans and receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of 
financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, together with 
amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in 
determining whether the asset is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument 
classified as available-for-sale increases and can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income 
statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the written down carrying value based on the rate of interest used to discount the future cash 
flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. To the extent that a provision may be increased or decreased in subsequent periods, the recognition 
of interest will be based on the latest balance net of provision.
c) Financial Services loans and advances including impairment 
For Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending, storecard lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups 
of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. Such evidence 
may include a missed interest or principal payment or the breach of a banking covenant. Provisioning on unsecured balances identified as being in arrears is 
calculated based on past experience, with regularly updated assumptions. The present value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined after taking 
into account any security held. The amount of impairment is calculated by comparing the present value of the cash flows discounted at the loan’s original 
effective interest rate with the balance sheet carrying value. If impaired, the carrying value is adjusted and the difference charged to the income statement 
and a provision recognised in the balance sheet.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to its net realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate. This is reported 
through interest receivable within the income statement and represents the unwinding of the discount. 
A write-off is made when all or part of a claim is deemed uncollectable or forgiven. Write-offs are charged against previously established provisions for 
impairment or directly to the income statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off decrease the charge for loan impairment in the income 
statement.
150 Financial Statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued
An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified 
as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors. This includes analysis of the likelihood of a particular balance to move into an arrears 
status within a defined period of time and application of an appropriate loss rate. The emergence period into an arrears state represents the average time 
elapsed between the loss trigger event and default. The methodology and assumptions used are regularly reviewed to reduce any differences between 
estimates and actual results.
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts, other deposits and amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
d) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. This 
amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds are 
allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
e) Fair value estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed below in the financial  
disclosure section. 
f) Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company 
or the counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks. All derivative financial 
instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates. Where derivatives 
do not qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in the income statement as finance 
income or costs as they arise.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between 
the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risks being hedged and an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging 
relationship to ensure it is highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
Where a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in fair value are recognised depending on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item 
being hedged as follows:
a) Cash flow hedges
Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows 
resulting from a highly probable forecasted transaction. These include the exchange rate risk of inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency, as well 
as the commodity risk on purchases of power and fuel. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges 
of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset 
or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in 
the initial measurement of the asset or liability. 
b) Fair value hedges
Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of a financial asset or 
liability due to movements in interest rates. The changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement. The hedged item 
is also adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk, with the corresponding adjustment made in the income statement. 
c) Portfolio fair value hedging
During the period Sainsbury’s Bank used portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the personal loans portfolio. 
Portfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures. The hedged item can be 
designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement for the period.

Fair value hedges
Interest rate swaps
The Group holds a £160 million portfolio of interest rate swaps (2016: £206 million) to hedge a portion of fixed rate borrowings maturing in April 2018. Under the 
terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed rate interest and pays floating rate interest. 
Financial Services holds a £3,000 million portfolio of interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges (2016: £2,705 million). Interest rate swaps are 
transacted to hedge Financial Services customer assets, fixed interest treasury instruments and non-interest bearing items (including reserves) through a 
combination of pay and receive fixed swaps (£2,354 million and £646 million respectively (2016: £2,350 million and £355 million respectively)). All derivatives are 
designated into effective fair value hedge accounting relationships.
For the year to 11 March 2017, the fair value movement in the Group’s interest rate swaps resulted in a charge to the income statement of £7 million (2016:  
£6 million). The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate borrowings and Sainsbury’s Bank loans and advances to customers resulted in a credit to  
the income statement of £6 million (2016: £6 million). 
Cash flow hedges
Interest rate swaps
The Group holds a £400 million (2016: £400 million) portfolio of inflation rate swaps to hedge a portion of the inflation linked secured loan due 2031. Under the 
terms of the swaps, the Group receives annual RPI inflation (subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent) and pays fixed rate interest.
The Group holds a £100 million (2016: £100 million) portfolio of interest rate swaps to hedge £100 million of a £200 million floating rate bank loan due 2019. 
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.
As at 11 March 2017, an unrealised loss of £4 million (2016: loss of £13 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the swaps designated as 
cash flow hedges. This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 24 months. 
Foreign exchange forward contracts
The Group holds a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its future foreign currency trading liabilities. As at 11 March 2017 the Group had 
forward purchased a net €135 million (2016: €127 million) and sold sterling with maturities from March 2017 to July 2018 (2016: March 2016 to February 2017) and 
forward purchased US$1,521 million (2016: US$763 million) and sold sterling with maturities from March 2017 to June 2018 (2016: March 2016 to June 2017).
As at 11 March 2017, an unrealised profit of £28 million (2016: £16 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward contracts. This 
profit will be transferred to the income statement over the next 15 months. During the year a credit to the income statement of £83 million was transferred 
from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales (2016: £12 million credit).
152 Financial Statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued
Commodity forward contracts
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity forward contracts to hedge its own use fuel consumption over the next 24 months.
At 11 March 2017, an unrealised gain of £3 million (2016: loss of £5 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the commodity contracts. 
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 24 months.
Derivatives not in a hedge relationship
Some of the Group’s derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore not designated in a hedging relationship. In addition, where 
gains or losses on a derivative contract economically offset the losses or gains on an underlying transaction, the derivative is not designated as being in a 
hedging relationship. 
Interest rate and foreign exchange swaps
The Group holds a £295 million (2016: £327 million) portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss to convert floating rate obligations into 
fixed rates. Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest. Offsetting these swaps the Group holds a  
£341 million (2016: £386 million) portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss, to convert fixed rate obligations into floating rate interest. 
Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives fixed rate interest and pays floating rate interest. 
Commodity forward contracts
Commodity forward contracts at fair value through profit and loss relate to the Group’s long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent 
producers. 
Fair value 
Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amount and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at a value other 
than fair value. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded. Where market 
values are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, other receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.

 153 Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments continued
The fair value of financial assets as disclosed in the table above as at 11 March 2017 was £4,640 million (2016: £3,337 million). The fair value of the financial 
assets has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of financial 
liabilities was £7,508 million (2016: £6,366 million) of which £473 million (2016: £473 million) has been determined using market values and is within Level 1 
of the fair value hierarchy. The remaining £7,035 million (2016: £5,893 million) has been calculated by discounting cash fl ows at prevailing interest rates and 
is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the 
fair value is observable:
— Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet 
date. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instrument on public exchanges;
— Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows at 
prevailing interest rates; and
— Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market 
data (unobservable inputs).

The available-for-sale financial assets relate to the Group’s beneficial interest in a property investment pool. The net present value of the Group’s interest in the 
various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of 0.5 per cent per annum (2016:  
0.6 per cent) and a discount rate of nine per cent (2016: nine per cent), (see note 13). The sensitivity of this balance to changes of one per cent in the assumed

is £15 million (2016: £34 million) relating to these agreements. The Group values its Power Purchase agreements as the net present value of the estimated future 
usage at the contracted fixed price less the market implied forward energy price discounted at the prevailing swap rate. The Group also makes an assumption 
regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producer’s estimate of expected electricity output. The sensitivity of this balance

swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were de-designated from their fair value hedging relationship. The fair value adjustment of the debt previously 
hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current 
financial year of £1 million (2016: £1 million).
The Group has entered into inflation swaps to convert £400 million (2016: £400 million) of the £743 million (2016: £779 million) loan due 2031 from RPI linked 
interest to fixed rate interest for periods maturing April 2017 to April 2019. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges (note 24).
The principal activity of Eddystone Finance plc and Longstone Finance plc is the issuing of commercial mortgage backed securities and applying the proceeds 
towards the secured loans due 2018 and 2031 with the Group as summarised above. 
SFM Corporate Services Limited holds all the issued share capital of Eddystone Finance Holdings Limited and Longstone Finance Holdings Limited on trust 
for charitable purposes. Eddystone Finance Holdings Limited beneficially owns all the issued share capital of Eddystone Finance plc and Longstone Finance 
Holdings Limited beneficially owns all the issued share capital of Longstone Finance plc. As the Group has no interest, power or bears any risk over these 
entities they are not included in the Group consolidation.
b) Bank overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above Bank of England base rate.
c) Revolving credit facility
The Group maintains a secured contingent committed revolving credit facility of £1,150 million. This facility is structured on a dual tranche basis with a £500 
million Facility (A) due May 2019 and a £650 million Facility (B) due May 2020. As at 11 March 2017, £nil had been drawn (2016: £nil).  
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and drawdowns bear interest at a margin above LIBOR.
d) Bank loans due 2016
During September 2016, the Group repaid upon maturity a €50 million loan due September 2016 at floating rates of interest. The €50 million floating rate loan 
had been swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan using a cross currency swap. 
e) Bank loans due 2019
On 5 May 2015, the Group amended its £200 million unsecured bank loan due August 2019 into a secured corporate £200 million bank loan due August 2019 at 
a floating rate of interest. £100 million of this has been swapped into a fixed rate liability. The £100 million portion of the loan and associated interest rate swap 
has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
f) Convertible bond due 2019
In November 2014, the Group issued £450 million of unsecured convertible bonds due November 2019. The bonds pay a coupon of 1.25 per cent payable semi-
annually. Each bond is convertible into ordinary shares of J Sainsbury plc at any time up to 21 November 2019 at a conversion price of 321.47 pence. 
The net proceeds of the convertible bond have been split as at 11 March 2017 into a liability component of £427 million and an equity component of £23 million. 
The equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company.

Accounting policies 
In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the 
plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an 
annual basis using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recorded at fair value. 
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the statement of other comprehensive income as incurred, and comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The income statement charge consists of a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan assets 
and defined benefit pension scheme expenses.
The financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan 
assets at the beginning of the financial year.
The Group contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred. Any contributions unpaid at the balance 
sheet date are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
Background
At 11 March 2017, retirement benefit obligations relate to two defined benefit schemes, the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme and from 2 September 2016, the 
Home Retail Group Pension Scheme (the ‘Schemes’) as well as two unfunded pension liabilities relating to senior former employees of Sainsbury’s and Home 
Retail Group. 
The retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by KPMG, as actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method 
and based on adjusting the position at the date of the previous triennial valuations (see below) for known events and changes in market conditions as allowed 
under IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’. 
Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme
The Scheme is governed by a Trustee board, and the assets of the Scheme are held separately from the Group’s assets. The Scheme is an HMRC Registered 
pension scheme, subject to UK legislation with oversight from the Pensions Regulator. The governance of the Scheme is the responsibility of the Trustee; the 
Trustee comprises 11 directors – five selected from members, five appointed by the Company and one Independent Chairman who is selected by the Company 
in consultation with the Trustee. In accordance with legislation, the Trustee consults with the Company regarding the Scheme’s investment strategy and agrees 
an appropriate funding plan with the Company.
The Scheme has three different benefit categories: Final Salary, Career Average and Cash Balance. For Final Salary and Career Average members, benefits at 
retirement are determined by length of service and salary. For Cash Balance members, benefits are determined by the accrued retirement account credits. 
The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future benefit accrual on 28 September 2013. The Scheme is also used to pay life 
assurance benefits to current (including new) colleagues. The assets of the Scheme are valued at bid price and are held separately from the Group’s assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee, as at 14 March 2015 on the projected unit basis. 
On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit at 14 March 2015 was £740 million, an increase of £148 million from the March 2012 deficit of 
£592 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed in September 2016 which included:
— Two special contributions of £125 million paid in August 2015 and August 2016
— Deficit contributions increasing to £65 million a year until March 2021
— The interest in the property partnership to continue, of up to £600 million payable in 2030 if there is a deficit at that time.
The Scheme continues to receive annual coupons from the property partnership which are based on the average weighted discount rate used in the triennial 
valuation and so are effectively reset every three years. These coupons will reduce from 2017/18 to £19 million a year.

Home Retail Group Pension Scheme
The Scheme is governed by a Trustee board, and the assets of the Scheme are held separately from the Group’s assets. The Scheme is an HMRC Registered 
pension scheme, subject to UK legislation with oversight from the Pensions Regulator. The governance of the Scheme is the responsibility of the Trustee; 
the Trustee comprises six directors – two selected from members, four appointed by the Company including an Independent Chairman. In accordance with 
legislation, the Trustee consults with the Company regarding the Scheme’s investment strategy and agrees an appropriate funding plan with the Company.
The Scheme was closed to new employees in 2009 and closed to future benefit accrual in January 2013. The Scheme is used to pay life assurance benefits only 
to current (including new) colleagues. Pension benefits were based on service and final salary. The assets of the Scheme are valued at bid price and are held 
separately from the Group’s assets.
The Home Retail Group defined benefit pension scheme was subject to a Trustees’ triennial valuation as at 31 March 2015. This was carried out by Willis Towers 
Watson for the Trustee. On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit as at 31 March 2015 was £315 million, an increase of £157 million from the 
March 2012 deficit of £158 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed and implemented on acquisition which included:
— An immediate payment on acquisition by Sainsbury’s of £50 million
— Deficit contributions of £40 million a year, £10 million payable each quarter, until October 2021
— Security over £80 million of freehold property (to be completed in the year ending 10 March 2018)
— A parent guarantee of £470 million which reduces over time in line with deficit contributions paid and will be reset at following triennial valuations
As part of the sale of Homebase by Home Retail Group, it was agreed with the Trustee that a cash contribution of £50 million would be made to the Scheme. 
Of this total, £26 million was paid during Home Retail Group’s year ending 28 February 2016. Following the capital return to shareholders associated with the 
Homebase sale, the final cash contribution of £24 million was made to the Scheme in September following the acquisition of Home Retail Group by Sainsbury’s.
Unfunded pension liabilities
The unfunded pension liabilities are unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the 
event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
IFRIC 14
IFRIC 14 is the interpretation that details when a company can recognise any pension surplus that exists. Furthermore, if the company has a funding 
commitment in excess of the IAS 19 deficit, then IFRIC 14 requires recognition of this excess in those circumstances when the surplus that would result 
on fulfilling that commitment cannot be recognised. A surplus may be recognised either because of an unconditional right to a refund to the company, 
or on grounds of a future contribution reduction where schemes are still open to future accrual.
For the Sainsbury’s pension scheme, management is of the view that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14. As such no adjustment 
has been made for potential additional liabilities.
Based on the net deficit of the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme as at 11 March 2017 and the committed payments under the Schedule of Contributions 
signed on 2 September 2016, there is no notional surplus and therefore no additional balance sheet liability in respect of a ‘minimum funding requirement’ 
to be recognised at 11 March 2017.

Risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks as detailed below:
Risk Description Mitigation
Asset 
volatility
Returns on assets that vary from the discount rate create 
funding level volatility. Both schemes hold a significant 
proportion of growth assets such as equities and real estate. 
Whilst growth assets are expected to outperform corporate 
bond yields over the long term this might not always occur in 
the short term. 
All equities are invested passively across global indices. All 
other assets are invested actively and are widely diversified to 
reduce returns risk and enhance returns.
Currency The schemes’ liabilities are sterling based whereas the majority 
of assets are denominated in foreign currencies.
Currency hedging programmes in both schemes help dampen 
returns volatility caused by the fluctuation of sterling against 
other leading currencies.
Changes in  
bond yields
A decrease in bond yields, which in turn drive the discount rate, 
will increase the present value of the schemes’ liabilities for 
accounting purposes.
A significant proportion of assets are held in corporate bonds 
that provide a hedge against falling bond yields. Furthermore 
significant levels of interest rate hedging within the schemes’ 
liability hedging portfolios through interest rate derivatives 
serve to protect against falling bond yields. A buy-in policy in 
the HRG scheme transfers a proportion of interest rate risk to 
an insurer.
Inflation The majority of the schemes’ liabilities are linked to UK price 
inflation indices (to a maximum of five per cent per year).
The Sainsbury’s scheme’s liability hedging portfolios hedge 
significant proportions of inflation liabilities by holding index 
linked bonds and inflation rate derivatives. The schemes’ 
equities provide a natural hedge for inflation. A buy-in policy 
in the HRG scheme transfers a proportion of inflation risk to an 
insurer.
Longevity Beneficiaries living longer than expected could increase the 
schemes’ liabilities.
A buy-in policy in the HRG scheme transfers some longevity 
risk to an insurer.
Operational Poor administration of benefits may result in an increased 
defined benefit obligation in future years.
The schemes’ benefits administrators have agreed service level 
agreements and controls are carefully monitored.

1  Certain unquoted fixed interest securities, private equity and debt investments, property investments and hedge funds are stated at fair value. These fair values may differ from their realisable values 
due to the absence of liquid markets in these investments.
2 Swap contract derivatives outstanding at the year-end are stated at the net present value of future discounted cash flows of each leg of the swap.
3  Insurance policies of £357 million refers to a buy-in policy held by the HRG scheme. The income from this policy exactly matches the amount and timing of all of the benefits payable for the insured 
pensioner members. Therefore the fair value of the insurance policy has been calculated to be the present value of the related obligations.
Of the above assets, £3,230 million are denominated in sterling and £6,690 million are denominated in overseas currencies.

Inflation rate – RPI 3.30 3.15
Inflation rate – CPI 2.30 2.15
Future pension increases 2.00 – 3.15 1.90 – 3.00
The discount rate is based on the yield on AA-rated sterling corporate bonds appropriate to the term of the Schemes’ liabilities.
The life expectancy for members aged 65 years at the balance sheet date is as follows:

e) Sensitivities
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £1,095 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount 
rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £1,270 million. 
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £850 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate 
would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £796 million. This sensitivity includes the effect of inflation on the Scheme’s pension increases.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £381 million.
The sensitivities are based on management’s best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change. The sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology 
used to calculate the retirement benefit obligation, by considering the change in the retirement benefit obligation for a given change in assumption. The net 
retirement benefit obligation is the difference between the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Changes in the assumptions may 
occur at the same time as changes in the fair value of plan assets. There has been no change in the calculation methodology since the prior period.
30 Share-based payments
Accounting policies
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded 
or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes or 
Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme. 
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised 
through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals. 
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, 
with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. 
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to 
investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. 
The Group recognised £32 million (2016: £23 million) of employee costs (note 28) related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year. 
Of these, £nil (2016: £nil) were cash-settled.
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below:
a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave)
The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months’ continuous service. This is an 
approved HMRC scheme and was established in 1980. Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three-year or five-
year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price. Employees leaving for certain reasons are 
able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
A reconciliation of Sharesave option movements is shown below:

The weighted average share price for options exercised over the year was 269 pence (2016: 266 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life of 
options outstanding at 11 March 2017 was 2.4 years (2016: 2.3 years).

Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2017 2016
Share price at grant date (pence) 231 243
Exercise price (pence) 185 195
Expected volatility – 3 year period (%) 29.9 26.6
 – 5 year period (%) 25.5 24.1
Option life – 3 year period (years) 3.2 3.2
– 5 year period (years) 5.2 5.2
Expected dividends (expressed as dividend yield %) 4.9 5.1
Risk-free interest rate – 3 year period (%) 0.8 1.6
– 5 year period (%) 1.6 2.1
Fair value per option – 3 year period (pence) 49 48
– 5 year period (pence) 45 45
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the 
period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
As part of the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc (HRG) colleagues had the option to roll over their HRG Save As You Earn (SAYE) options to J Sainsbury plc 
SAYE option or let their HRG options vest. Therefore the above outstanding SAYE options include the rollover options. The calculation of the fair value per option 
rolled over has not been included within the table above.
b) Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, shares are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated as a percentage 
of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades. 
Performance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required performance conditions have been met, the awards vest and 50 
per cent of the award will be released. Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released one year after the 
vesting date. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date. Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the 
form of additional shares. 
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points. 
Awards are structured as nil cost options. 
A reconciliation of the number of shares conditionally allocated is shown below:
2017

Outstanding at the beginning of the year 5.4 6.1
Conditionally allocated 2.5 2.2

Options to acquire the award of shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2017 2016
Share price at grant date (pence) 265 276
Option life (years) 4.2 4.2
Fair value per option (pence) 265 276
During the year, a total number of 0.4 million shares were exercised (2016: 1.4 million shares). The weighted average share price during the year for options 
exercised was 272 pence (2016: 238 pence).
c) Deferred Share Award
The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of financial and strategic scorecard measures. These are intended to reward the top managers in the Company, 
including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company. Awards 
are structured as nil cost options. 
Share-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures. At least 50 per cent of the awards are based on the 
delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance is based on measures which will assess the Company’s performance relative to its 
competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year. Any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that management’s 
interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed. Dividends accrue on 
the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

d) Bonus Share Award
The bonus arrangements for our senior managers and supermarket store managers include corporate and personal performance targets. A profit gateway 
is in place where a certain level of underlying profit before tax must be achieved before any bonus related to the corporate element of the bonus is released. 
60 per cent of the bonus is paid in cash and 40 per cent awarded in shares. They are automatically released after three financial years. Shares are subject to 
forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed. 
Dividends accrue on these shares and are released at the end of the three-year retention period.

31 Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc
Accounting policies for business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair 
value of identifiable assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred. 
On 2 September 2016, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Home Retail Group plc (HRG), a listed company based in the United Kingdom, 
by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Act for a consideration of £1,093 million. The full analysis of the consideration is shown below:

168 Financial Statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc continued
Home Retail Group’s activities mainly comprise General Merchandise related retail. The acquisition is expected to accelerate Sainsbury’s growth strategy 
in General Merchandise & Clothing retail as well as its online presence. The combination brings together two of the UK’s leading retail businesses with 
complementary product offers through an integrated, multi-channel proposition.
None of the goodwill recognised of £58 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. This was calculated as the difference between the fair 
value of consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired as set out in the following table. 
The provisional assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows:
Fair value of net assets acquired (provisional) £m
Fixed assets 262
Intangible assets 322
Inventories 810

1  Other financial assets includes £9 million of J Sainsbury plc shares (converted from Home Retail Group plc own shares at the point of acquisition). On consolidation these become J Sainsbury plc own 
shares in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
2 Cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables acquired are both presented gross of the capital return of £226 million.
In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, the acquisition accounting will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date of 2 September 2016.
a) Intangible assets
Intangible assets include a brand of £179 million relating to the Argos brand name. This reflects its fair value at the acquisition date and is estimated to have 
a useful economic life of ten years.
b) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables include £40 million of trade receivables, against which a bad debt provision of £(1) million is held. Also included are prepayments 
and accrued income of £29 million, and other debtors of £78 million.
c) Amounts due from Financial Services customers (the ‘loan book’)
The loan book fair value of £615 million includes a fair value increase of £20 million and a provision for impairment of £(66) million.
d) Revenue and profit contribution
From the date of acquisition, Home Retail Group has contributed £2,661 million of revenue excluding VAT, £77 million of underlying profit before tax and a 
statutory profit before tax of £54 million to the Group. If the acquisition date had been on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period 
would have been £28,013 million, Group underlying profit before tax would have been £563 million and Group profit before tax would have been £361 million. 
These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies. The information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative 
of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchase actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future 
results of the combined Group.
e) Acquisition-related costs
Acquisition-related costs (included in administrative expenses and recognised outside of underlying profit) amount to £22 million in the current year 
(2016: £12 million) (see note 3). In addition £3 million of costs relating to the issuance of J Sainsbury plc shares have been recognised directly within equity. 
f) Capital return
Prior to the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc, it was announced that Home Retail Group plc shareholders would be entitled to a £226 million capital return 
comprising the following:
— 25.0 pence per share, reflecting the £200 million return to shareholders in respect of the sale of Homebase by Home Retail Group plc on 29 February 2016; 
and
— 2.8 pence per share (totalling £26 million) in lieu of a final dividend in respect of Home Retail Group plc’s financial year ended 27 February 2016.
This was recorded as a liability in the net assets acquired above within trade and other payables. The full amount was paid on 12 September 2016.

h) Hindsight adjustments
The provisional fair values acquired are different from those reported at the half-year due to hindsight adjustments as permitted under IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’. The goodwill arising as a result of the acquisition has therefore increased from £18 million, as reported at the half-year, to £58 million.
32 Operating lease commitments
Accounting policies
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
a) Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b) Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with the buyer. 
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating leasebacks, 
generally the assets are sold at fair value, and the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the income statement.
c) Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
d) Operating lease income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, depots and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses 
and renewal rights.
The Group’s future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Aggregate future minimum lease payments:  
Within one year 760 614
In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,615 2,245
After five years 7,117 7,209
 10,492 10,068
Further analysis of the Group’s future minimum lease payments after five years is as follows:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Aggregate future minimum lease payments:  
Greater than five years but less than ten years 1,924 1,866
Greater than ten years but less than 15 years 1,253 1,281
After 15 years 3,940 4,062
 7,117 7,209
The commercial terms of the Group’s operating leases vary, however they commonly include either a market rent review or an index linked rent review 
(with a cap and collar). The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease. The Group has pre-emption rights over a minor number of properties, 
which provides the Group with the right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event the landlord chooses to sell. The option price payable for the asset 
in each instance is normally referenced to current market value prevailing at the point of pre-emption. 
For the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt, the total value of the Group’s capitalised operating lease commitments is £5,938 million (2016: £5,500 million).

34 Financial commitments 
Sainsbury’s Bank has off balance sheet commitments to extend credit to customers of £98 million (2016: £77 million).
35 Contingent liabilities
The Group has a contingent liability for indemnities arising from the disposal of subsidiaries. No provision has been recognised on the basis that any potential 
liability arising is not considered probable. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this liability with any certainty.
Along with other retailers, the Group is subject to claims in respect of pay rates across supermarket and distribution centre workers. There is also a potential 
obligation in respect of holiday pay on voluntary overtime. The Group is keeping these matters under close review but considers the likelihood of payout to 
be remote.

Company statement of changes in equity
for the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017
180 Financial Statements 
Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Basis of preparation
The parent company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, in particular Financial Reporting Standard 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying entity’ as defined 
in the Standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities 
that otherwise apply the recognition measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
These are the first financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with FRS 101. The Company’s transition date to FRS 101 is 13 March 2016. FRS 
101 sets out amendments to IFRS as adopted by the European Union that are necessary to achieve compliance with the Companies Act and related regulations. 
These amendments had no impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet or Statement of Changes in Equity for the Company for the year 
ended 11 March 2017. 
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 11 March 2017 (prior financial year 52 weeks to 12 March 2016). 
The disclosure exemptions adopted by the Company in accordance with FRS 101 are as follows:
— The requirements of IAS 7 to present a cash flow statement.
— The requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24, ‘Related Party Transactions’, to disclose information related to key management personnel, and the 
requirements of IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group for wholly owned subsidiaries.
— The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 to disclose information assessing the possible impact of new standards issued but which are not yet 
effective.
— The requirements of IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 for disclosure of financial instruments and fair values. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest £million unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on the going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at  
fair value.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an Income Statement nor a 
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Company alone. The profit after tax for the Company for the year was £682 million (2016: £1,360 million).

Notes to the Company financial statements
 181 Financial Statements 4 Available-for-sale financial assets
Accounting policies
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories (of fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and receivables). They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months 
of the balance sheet date. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with 
the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income is recycled to the income statement. Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the 
entity’s right to receive payment is established. Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.

Notes to the Company financial statements continued 8 Provisions
Accounting policies
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value 
of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

9 Taxation 
Accounting policies
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is determined using tax rates 
(and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset 
is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive 
income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Company is able 
to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of B shares. Shareholders approved a £680 million return of share capital, by way of a B share scheme, 
at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 July 2004. The final redemption date for B shares was 18 July 2007 and all transactions relating to the B 
shares have now been completed.

Additional shareholder information Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held at 11.00am on Wednesday, 5 July 2017 at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE.  
The Notice of the Meeting and the proxy card for the meeting are enclosed with this report.
Registrars
For information about the AGM, shareholdings, dividends and to report changes to personal details, shareholders should contact:
Computershare Investor Services PLC 
The Pavilions 
Bridgwater Road 
Bristol BS99 6ZZ 
Telephone: 0370 702 0106
Please remember to tell Computershare if you move house or change bank details or if there is any other change to your account information.
You can view and manage your shareholding online at www.investorcentre.co.uk. You will require your 11 character Shareholder Reference Number (SRN)  
to log in. Your SRN starts with the letter C or G and is followed by ten numbers. It can be found on share certificates and dividend confirmations.
Dividends
Having your dividends paid directly into your bank or building society account is a more secure way than receiving your dividend by cheque. If you would  
prefer your dividends to be paid directly into your bank or building society account further information is available from Computershare Investor Services 
(address and telephone number above). You will still receive an annual dividend confirmation detailing each dividend to enable you to complete your tax return.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
The Company has a DRIP, which allows shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends in the Company’s shares bought in the market through a specially 
arranged share dealing service. No new shares are allotted under this DRIP and approximately 30,086 shareholders participate. Full details of the  
DRIP and its charges, together with mandate forms, are available from the Registrars. Alternatively, you can elect to join the DRIP by registering on  
www.investorcentre.co.uk.
Annual Dividend Confirmations 
The Company sends out an Annual Dividend Confirmation (ADC) in relation to dividend payments. This means that those shareholders receiving their dividend 
direct into their bank account will receive an ADC once a year detailing all payments made throughout that year.
Shareholder communications Company website
J Sainsbury plc Interim and Annual Reports, and results announcements are available via the internet on our website at www.j-sainsbury.co.uk. As well  
as providing share price data and financial history, the site also provides background information about the Company, regulatory and news releases, and 
current issues.
Electronic shareholder communications
The Company encourages all shareholders to receive their shareholder communications electronically in order to reduce the impact on the environment.  
To do this go to www.investorcentre.co.uk/etreeuk/jsainsbury. For each email registration by a Sainsbury’s shareholder, a donation will be made to 
the Woodland Trust, the UK’s leading woodland conservation charity. By registering with the eTree programme you will be giving the Company permission  
to send all shareholder documents to you via email with a link to a secure website.
Alternatively, the Company has set up a facility for shareholders to take advantage of electronic communications. The service allows you to:
— view the Annual Report and Financial Statements on the day it is published;
— receive electronic notification of the availability of future shareholder information (you must register your email for this service);
— check the balance and current value of your shareholding and view your dividend history; and,
— submit your vote online prior to a general meeting.
To register visit www.investorcentre.co.uk. You will need your 11 character SRN which can be found on your share certificate or recent dividend  
confirmation – the number is often preceded by the letter C or G.
Shareholder security
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company annual reports. If you  
receive any unsolicited investment advice, whether over the telephone, through the post or by email:
— make sure you get the name of the person and organisation;
— check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting involved by visiting https://register.fca.org.uk/; and, 
— report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or by completing an online form at  
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/report-scam-unauthorised-firm 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in Company mailings.

10.941 pence.

the values.
On Monday, 19 July 2004 the values were determined as follows:

Report and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those of our officers, Directors and employees concerning, 
amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the businesses we operate. Consequently, 
our actual future financial condition, performance and results could differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set out in our forward-looking
