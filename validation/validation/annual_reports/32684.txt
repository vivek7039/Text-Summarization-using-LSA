STRATEGIC REPORT

Chairman’s statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to update our 
stakeholders on what has been a successful year for 
Stride Gaming. The Group’s strong financial results for the 
year ended 31 August 2017 have been underpinned by further 
progress against our strategic objectives. Stride Gaming has 
grown its market share in its core UK bingo-led online gaming 
market, continued to develop new growth opportunities 
through product innovation, enhanced its proprietary technology 
platform and appraised attractive new markets for future 
expansion opportunities.
Results and dividend
The Group delivered a strong set of financial results in the year 
with net gaming revenue (“NGR”) up 18% on a pro-forma basis 
to £89.9 million (2016: pro-forma £76.4 million and reported 
£47.8 million). Like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA increased by 24% 
to £20.2 million (2016: pro-forma £16.3 million and reported 
£12.3 million) and like-for-like Adjusted earnings rose by 29% 
to £18.5 million (2016: pro-forma £14.3 million).
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 1.5p per share, subject to 
the approval of shareholders at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 1 February 2018. This final dividend, 
together with the interim dividend of 1.2p per share, brings the 
total dividend for the year ended 31 August 2017 to 2.7p per share.
Strategic progress
Stride’s progress during the year has continued to be 
underpinned by the Group’s first-class proprietary technology, 
leading business intelligence capabilities and clear focus on 
operating in markets where it is legal to do so. In the fast-growing 
and dynamic online gaming industry, the Board believes that 
these are key differentiators for the Group and, together, they 
underpin the Group’s strategy to develop as a leading online 
gaming operator. 
Revenue from the Group’s proprietary Real Money Gaming 
business increased by 39% during the year (2016: reported 31%) 
demonstrating the success of our multi-brand strategy as 
well as the integration of the transformational acquisitions 
of the 8Ball and Tarco brands, which are already delivering 
earnings-enhancing synergies.
Stride Gaming continues to innovate and appraise new products 
and markets where we see opportunities to leverage our expertise 
for further growth. During the year, we launched our B2B platform, 
Stride Together, which licences our proprietary platform to other 
operators, thereby enabling the Group to explore new growth 
opportunities both in the UK and globally. 
 • Strong financial results underpinned 
by further progress against 
strategic objectives 
 • Adjusted EBITDA up 24% to £20.2million
 • Launched B2B platform, Stride Together, 
and signed first joint venture partner, 
Aspers Casino, launching Aspers Casino 
Online in October
 • Post period end strategic investment 
in Passion Gaming, a Rummy-focused 
online operator in India
 • Interim dividend of 1.2p per share, 
with final dividend of 1.5p per share, 
subject to shareholder approval
Continuing to 
build momentum Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 09
Regulation continues to play a key role in shaping the online 
gaming industry, particularly in the UK. Whilst the Group is 
facing external industry pressures such as the second Point of 
Consumption tax applied to free bets, the introduction of GDPR 
legislation and potential changes to advertising regulations for 
gambling brands, the Board is very confident that Stride Gaming’s 
scale, technological edge and multi-brand strategy mean that 
we are very well positioned to continue to grow and take market 
share despite these pressures. 
Trading in the new financial year has started very well and the 
Board looks to the future with a high degree of confidence and 
enthusiasm. As a fast-growing and agile operator with leading 
technology and a focus on only regulated and legal markets, 
the Board believes that the Group remains very well positioned 
for further progress and continued growth.
Nigel Payne
Chairman
21 November 2017
Stride Together also signed its first joint venture partner, 
Aspers Casino to launch Aspers Casino Online, giving the 
established casino brand an online presence for the first time. 
Early indications from this new venture are encouraging. 
The Group is also pleased to announce that, post the period 
end, it has made a strategic investment in Passion Gaming, a 
Rummy-focused online operator based in India. This investment 
gives the Group an entry into a rapidly growing market with 
enormous potential for profitable growth.
Team 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank each of my colleagues for their hard work during the 
year. This has been a very busy year for the Group as we have 
integrated acquisitions, launched new products and adapted to 
regulatory changes whilst still delivering strong organic growth. 
These achievements speak volumes for the skill, talent and 
dedication of the people throughout the Company.
Regulation and responsibility 
The online gaming market is fast growing and dynamic and 
the Group’s firm focus remains on operating only in product 
verticals and markets where it is legal to do so. 
The Board is resolutely committed to best practice in responsible 
gaming and providing customers with the securest and most 
enjoyable entertainment possible across Stride Gaming’s brands. 
We believe that owning and developing our own proprietary 
technology is a key competitive advantage in such a dynamic 
market, enabling the Group to be agile, respond to market and 
regulatory changes effectively and successfully capture any 
growth opportunities that are presented.
Current trading and outlook
Building on the momentum of 2017, the Group will continue 
to invest in its proprietary technology and people to support 
Stride Gaming’s further growth. We remain focused on driving 
organic growth in our core UK real money gaming market 
whilst continuing to appraise acquisition opportunities and 
developing new products and markets.
Stride Gaming’s scale, 
technological edge and 
multi-brand strategy means 
that we are very well 
positioned to continue to 
grow and take market share.

STRATEGIC REPORT

Chief Executive’s report
I am delighted to report that during 2017 Stride Gaming 
continued to make excellent progress against its growth 
strategy. The Group has continued to drive strong organic 
growth and to scale the business through the successful 
integration of the transformational acquisitions that were 
made at the end of our previous financial year. Stride Gaming 
is now the third largest operator in the UK online bingo-led 
market* and we remain confident that this scale, supported 
by our proprietary technology and back office expertise, 
positions the business well to take advantage of further 
growth opportunities. 
Clear growth strategy 
Stride Gaming has a clear growth strategy to develop as 
a leading online gaming operator, thereby creating value for 
shareholders. We aim to achieve this based on three primary 
pillars of growth: 
1. Focus on the core by continuing to grow market share 
in both the UK bingo and casino markets.
2. Diversify the product offering by innovating the product 
and entering new online gaming verticals.
3. Appraise and enter attractive new markets outside of 
the UK.
We plan to execute this growth strategy by continuing to 
develop our proprietary gaming platform, investing in our 
skilled and dynamic team and focusing on operating only 
in regulated or legal markets. 
Stride’s technology edge
Stride Gaming’s proprietary online gaming technology 
underpins the Group’s clear growth strategy across products 
and markets. 
During the year, we have continued to invest in and develop 
our technology edge by creating more innovative and engaging 
gaming content, including on mobile; further integrating and 
enhancing our business intelligence capabilities; ensuring full 
compliance with regulatory developments; and increasing 
the platform’s robustness through improved cyber security 
and disaster recovery solutions.
1. Focus on the core
The key driver of the Group’s success in 2017 has been 
the excellent performance in the core Real Money Gaming 
vertical, which accounted for 91% of Group revenue. In line 
with the Group’s strategic focus, Real Money Gaming NGR 
generated from Stride’s proprietary platform increased by 
39% to £48.6 million, accounting for 54% of Group revenue 
(2016: pro-forma of 31% to £34.9 million accounting for 45% 
and reported: 73%). Real Money Gaming NGR from third-party 
non-proprietary platforms also increased by 16% to £33.1 million, 
accounting for 36% of Group revenue (2016: pro-forma 
£28.6 million, accounting for 37%).
 • Continued strong organic growth 
 • Excellent performance with NGR from 
Real Money Gaming increasing by 39%
 • Significant progress made with the 
integrations of 8Ball, Netboost and Tarco
 • 29% growth in yield per player reported 
at £147
 • Enter 2018 in a strengthened position 
to continue upward trajectory 
Clear growth strategy
*  Based on H2 Gaming Commission research report showing market size 
of £600 million based on net gaming revenue.   Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 11
The Group made significant progress in the integration of 8Ball 
Games Limited (“8Ball”), Netboost Media (“Netboost”) and the 
Tarco Assets (“Tarco”), which were acquired on 31 August 
2016 for a total consideration of up to £70.2 million. By 
applying the Group’s core capabilities, and as a result of the 
Group’s increased scale, we have already been able to grow 
revenues, strengthen gross profit margins and significantly 
increase Adjusted EBITDA of the acquired businesses. The 
Tarco Assets and Netboost Media current year Adjusted 
EBITDA is up 62% from the prior year unaudited pro-forma 
Adjusted EBITDA, whereas 8Ball’s current year Adjusted EBITDA 
has increased by 101%. The Group will continue to appraise 
acquisition opportunities in the fragmented UK bingo-led 
market to supplement and support our organic growth. 
Yield per player, one of the Group’s KPIs, increased 29% 
to £147 (2016: pro-forma £114). This strong growth has been 
driven by the Group’s sophisticated business intelligence 
capabilities and analytics know-how which underpin our 
customer relationship management, cross-sell and marketing 
initiatives. Even though Real Money Gaming funded players 
were down 10% to 146,000 (2016: pro-forma 162,000), this was 
as a result of our strategy to focus on lifetime value of players 
over volume of players, and the reduction of free bonuses across 
the Group. Together these support the Group’s objectives of 
acquiring customers effectively and increasing their lifetime 
value through higher engagement and monetisation. 
Targeted and returns driven marketing strategies are of 
utmost importance to us and we continually look at innovative 
ways to engage both new and existing customers. We look 
to optimise our marketing spend across a number of online 
and offline channels including natural search (SEO), digital 
and social media, affiliate marketing, email, SMS direct 
mails and cross-sell within our portfolio. 
Continuously enhancing our mobile offering is key to providing 
our customer base with the most convenient, easy and accessible 
online gaming experience. Mobile and touch revenue, another 
KPI of the Group, increased to represent 66% of gross Real 
Money Gaming revenue (2016: pro-forma 56%). 
Regulation, responsibility and compliance remain a major 
focus in the Group’s core UK market. As a result of our agility 
and technology, we are confident that Stride is in a robust position 
and see a number of pending and potential changes to regulation 
as an opportunity to further increase market share.
2. Diversify the product offering 
The second key pillar of the Group’s strategy is to grow 
the business by developing and diversifying Stride Gaming’s 
product offering into new, related product verticals, such as 
lottery-style games, Rummy and scratch cards. During the 
year we have developed and launched 17 new proprietary slots 
and instant win games; launched 29 new bingo and casino sites 
– with a focus on slot games – to capture the growth 
opportunities available in that fast-growing market; and 
entered the B2B vertical with the launch of Stride Together. 
Through Stride Together the Group intends to license its 
proprietary platform to gaming operators, media partners and 
retailers both in the UK and globally. This will enable partners 
to create an online presence for their customers and to enter the 
omnichannel gaming space, whilst offering Stride opportunities 
to penetrate new product verticals and geographic markets. 
We were very happy to coincide the launch of this B2B division 
with the announcement of our first Stride Together joint venture 
alongside a leading gaming operator in the UK, Aspers Group 
Limited (“Aspers”). Aspers Casino Online launched in October 
this year, which successfully provides a seamless integration 
between the online and offline gaming experience. We are 
delighted with the launch of our new B2B vertical and are 
now working hard to secure further partnerships with gaming 
operators, media partners and retailers in the UK and globally.
The Group has continued to work hard on improving the 
performance in Social Gaming, which accounts for 9% of total 
Group revenues, where NGR for the year was down 37% to 
£8.1 million, in light of the changing trends and dynamics in 
social gaming markets. The two principal markets in which we 
operate, Australia and North America, are reaching maturity, 
resulting in higher acquisition costs and lower lifetime values 
of players (“LTV”). Given the changing market dynamics, the 
Company made the decision to reduce marketing spend in this 
vertical and to implement significant changes in order to mitigate 
the expected reduction in revenues. Throughout the year we 
implemented a number of changes to the pricing models and 
added further personalisation to our content. At year end, we 
are encouraged by the results of the improvement plan so far 
and the Board will continue to closely monitor developments 
in this sector of the business.
We are confident of 
delivering further 
success in the year 
ahead and continued 
progress against our 
growth strategy. Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017

Chief Executive’s report continued
Stride’s technology edge continued
3. Enter attractive new markets 
The third key pillar of the Group’s growth strategy is to expand 
into attractive new markets outside of the UK, leveraging the 
strength of our proprietary platform and back office expertise. 
The Group owns an Italian remote gaming licence and is in the 
process of obtaining Spanish and Danish gaming licences. 
In line with our strategy, we are also delighted to announce 
today that we have made a strategic controlling investment of 
$3.75 million in Passion Gaming, a Rummy-focused online skill 
gaming company based in India, which gives us entry into the 
country’s rapidly growing skills gaming market. Our investment 
will be used to fund working capital, with the Group also sharing 
its marketing expertise and technological know-how to 
accelerate growth. 
Investment in our first-class team 
The Group’s progress during the year would not have been 
possible without the commitment of our skilled and dynamic 
team. I would like to thank each and every one of my colleagues 
for their hard work during the year. 
We continue to invest in our team and working environment 
to ensure that we remain a highly attractive place for 
industry-leading talent. We have invested in internal and 
external training, competitive employee benefits and new 
ways to communicate internally and increase efficiencies. 
To support Stride’s long-term growth plans, the Group’s 
headcount increased by 16% to 370 during the period. 
Outlook 
We are very pleased with the performance of the Group 
in 2017, having demonstrated key progress and development 
across our strategic pillars. Once again, we have demonstrated 
our ability to grow both organically and through acquisitions.
Real Money Gaming revenue is currently showing double-digit 
year-on-year growth in the first two months of the current 
financial year, in line with market expectations. This is being 
driven by strong deposit growth, with a stable yield per player. 
We enter 2018 in a strengthened position to continue on our 
upward trajectory.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Likelihood Issue Impact Mitigation
Regulations
Gaming regulations Low The Group operates in legalised 
markets. Online gambling is prohibited 
or restricted in some countries and 
legalised in others. The Group is 
currently licensed in the UK and 
Alderney, Baldo is licensed in Italy and 
QSB Gaming in Spain. As a Group we 
should only be accepting players from 
regulated and legalised markets, and 
this is one of our main principles. If we 
accept players from non-regulated 
jurisdictions, we run a risk of breaching 
legislation in that particular market.
High The Group procures legal and professional 
advice with regard to its activities in its 
principal countries of operation including 
any changes in legislation, and monitors 
updates on any potential future 
jurisdiction where it may start accepting 
customers. The latter is important as the 
Group’s growth rate, strategy and future 
revenue streams are, to a certain extent, 
affected by the regulation of new markets 
and the subsequent growth of end user 
interest and acceptance in such newly 
regulated markets.
Our Group is exposed to a number of risks that can have a 
financial, operational and reputational impact. A proactive 
approach to the management of risk is therefore critical to 
the Group’s success. 
The principal risks within our business model reflect the 
Group’s view that risks, by their very nature, also bring the 
potential for reward. Our risk management process involves 
a two-step approach – firstly to assess the likelihood of the 
risk occurring and then the impact it will have on the Group. 
This assessment enables the Group to then put the most 
appropriate measures in place to either avoid the risk 
altogether or mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.
The risks outlined below are those principal risks and

General taxation Medium The Group currently operates 
across different jurisdictions in a 
tax environment which is constantly 
evolving. It is therefore important that 
the Group remains up to date with 
all changes affecting its tax position.
Adverse changes to tax rules may 
increase the Group’s underlying 
effective tax rate and reduce profits 
available for distribution.
Specifically, the UK government 
has enforced further changes on the 
calculation of Point of Consumption 
Tax (“POC”), with an effective date of 
1 August 2017. Some uncertainty remains 
regarding how these calculation changes 
will be implemented in practice by the 
industry, but they will increase the cost 
of sales in the Group’s new financial 
year, which in turn will reduce 
Adjusted EBITDA.
Low The Group is constantly monitoring its 
tax position in each country it is a tax 
resident in. More importantly, we are in 
constant communication with external 
tax advisors and financial management 
ensures they remain up to date with any 
expected changes. In general, changes 
in tax rules and practices are carefully 
considered in advance of being passed 
as law, to assess their financial 
implications and ensure that changes 
are made to the Group’s operations 
in time for the change. 
On POC, the Group has engaged 
the services of tax advisors to better 
understand the general expectation 
of the industry.
The Group has a strong operating team 
which is working to update all systems 
including its reporting tools to comply 
with the new POC tax regulation and 
Group budgets have been updated 
to include the anticipated monetary 
impact on the Group’s results. The 
Group has also reviewed its bonus 
system to mitigate the impact of 
the inclusion of bonus funds in the 
calculation of POC tax without 
disrupting customer experience.
Customer Data 
protection 
 
Medium The Group as part of its business 
processes deals with a large quantity 
of personal customer data including 
sensitive data such as name, address, 
customer age, bank details and gaming 
betting history. The Group must ensure 
that its data handling policies are in line 
with the data protection regulations 
in the countries in which it operates, 
to prevent any breaches from happening 
since this may result in substantial fines 
which will have a negative commercial 
and reputational impact.
High The Group has a number of robust 
control processes in place to ensure the 
security of customer data and engages 
external consultants to test and verify 
these processes. In respect of the 
forthcoming EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”), the Group has 
engaged the services of a consultancy 
firm to provide professional advice 
and guidance on GDPR in order to fully 
assess the implications for the Group. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 15
Risk Likelihood Issue Impact Mitigation
Fraud and audit
Money laundering 
and being 
associated with 
crime and disorder
Medium The Group handles a high volume 
of online transactions from multiple 
consumers and through a number of 
payment service providers. If the Group 
inadvertently handles any proceeds of 
crime, it may be committing money 
laundering offences under the UK 
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and similar 
legislation in other jurisdictions in 
which the group operates. This would 
have a lasting and damaging effect 
on the Group’s reputation, which can 
subsequently affect relationships with 
service providers, in particular the 
payment processing providers which 
could refuse our business going 
forward. Furthermore, a weak 
anti-money laundering framework may 
also lead to sanctions from regulatory 
authorities, which could impose 
substantial fines or suspend our 
regulatory licence. In the latter case, 
the Group might be unable to operate 
in certain jurisdictions.
High Our internal software is set-up with 
various triggers to be able to detect 
customer transactions that may be 
considered to carry higher risk. For 
example, the system is designed to flag 
up immediately any unusual transactions 
such as high value and number of 
deposits in a day, deposits made 
in accounts which already have a 
significant balance and types of methods 
used for withdrawals especially where 
these differ from the deposit method. 
Any transactions picked up by the 
software will lead to due diligence 
or enhanced due diligence where 
customers have to provide identity 
documents. As a Group we have a 
dedicated fraud and compliance team 
which carries out all necessary checks 
for new players as well as unusual 
transactions with existing players.
Furthermore, our payment service 
providers are regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority. All business partners, 
which primarily comprises suppliers 
and employees, are subject to strict 
background and documentation checks.
As part of our ongoing commitment 
to keep crime out of the business, 
the Group has engaged the services 
of a consulting firm to conduct an 
independent assessment of its 
anti-money laundering policies. Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017

Information technology
Disruption 
of business 
continuity
Low The Group’s business is at risk from 
disruption of key systems and assets 
on which it depends. The functioning 
of the IT systems within the Group’s 
businesses or those of third parties on 
which it relies could be disrupted for 
reasons either within or beyond their 
control, including but not limited to 
accidental damage, disruption to the 
supply of utilities or services, including 
the internet infrastructure, security 
breaches and general systems failure. 
Any substantial disruptions could 
impact the Group’s ability to generate 
revenue and offer services to 
customers, which in turn could affect 
the Group’s reputation, performance 
and financial position.
High As part of its periodic review of key 
business controls, the Group carried 
out a system-wide upgrade of its 
disaster recovery system during the 
year. The new disaster recovery system 
can now enable a much faster recovery 
should there be disruptions in the 
business. The Group will continue 
to invest in its IT systems and 
technology to ensure that the network 
infrastructure meets and continues 
to enhance the performance and 
reliability criteria of the Group.
Distributed 
denial of service 
(“DDoS”), malicious 
viruses and other 
cybercrime attacks
Low IT systems may be impacted by 
unauthorised access, cyber-attacks, 
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) 
attacks, malicious viruses, theft or misuse 
of data by internal or external parties. 
Cyber-attacks, hacking and in general 
cybercrime is becoming increasingly 
common and may expose the Group 
to blackmail demands and the need to 
devote additional resources in recovering 
any physical or reputational damage that 
may result from an attack. In addition, 
substantial fines are being considered 
for breaches of the new data protection 
laws, such as the proposed fines of up 
to £17 million, or 4% of global turnover.
High IT policies, especially around security, 
are constantly monitored and reviewed 
to ensure compliance. Training is a 
significant part of our framework and 
we ensure that all employees are aware 
of the risks of cyber-attacks and can 
spot the signs.
To ensure that the Group is compliant 
with the industry guidelines and EU 
legislation, it has engaged the 
services of a consulting firm to 
conduct a cyber security review 
and any recommendations will 
be taken under advisement.
Operational
Dependence 
on third-party 
service providers
Low The Group engages with many providers 
of non-proprietary third-party games and 
payment processing services, as well as 
other important service providers. If there 
is any interruption to the products or 
services provided by third parties, or 
if there are problems in supplying the 
products or if one or more ceased to be 
provided or was provided on onerous 
terms to the Group, this could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s business 
and performance.
High To mitigate this risk the Group uses 
reliable industry suppliers and ensures 
that contractual agreements with 
key partners are adequate to offer 
protection to the Group. The Group 
now contracts with two card payment 
service providers to mitigate any risk 
associated with relying on one card 
payment service provider and to avoid 
bad user experience. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 17
Chief Financial Officer’s review
The financial information shown for the prior year is on a pro-forma 
basis so as to show both periods on a like-for-like basis, that is, 
as if the acquisitions of 8Ball, Netboost Media and Tarco Assets 
on 31 August 2016 had taken place at the start of the twelve-month 
comparative period.
Stride Gaming continued to deliver strong organic growth 
for the year driven by its Real Money Gaming vertical with Group 
pro-forma NGR growth of 18% to £89.9 million (2016: pro-forma 
£76.4 million and reported £47.8 million). Organic growth, driven 
by successful execution of the Group’s multi-brand strategy, 
was enhanced by the acquisitions of 8Ball, Netboost Media 
and the Tarco Assets in August 2016. Significant improvements 
in player engagement and monetisation across the Group’s 
brands helped deliver a strong overall performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased on a pro-forma basis by 24% 
to £20.2 million (2016: pro-forma £16.4 million and reported 
£12.3 million) whilst the Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 
2% to 23% (2016: pro-forma 21%). We anticipate some further 
margin improvement once acquisition earn-out periods 
conclude in the new financial year.
Stride Gaming remains highly cash generative, with net 
cash generated from operational activities at £12.9 million 
(2016: reported £13.7 million), which includes the year one 
InfiApps earn-out payment of £3.9 million, and a high cash 
conversion from Adjusted EBITDA. During the year the Group 
completed the refinancing of an existing £8.0 million shareholder 
loan facility with Barclays PLC without any impact to our 
cash position. 
Stride Gaming has a strong balance sheet with cash and cash 
equivalents of £26.2 million (31 August 2016: £21.1 million), 
which includes customer liabilities of £2.5 million 
(31 August 2016: £1.8 million).

STRATEGIC REPORT
18
Significant improvements in player engagement 
and monetisation across the Group’s brands 
helped deliver a strong overall performance.
Revenue
NGR from Real Money Gaming, which represents 91% of 
Group NGR (2016: pro-forma 83%), was up 29% to £81.8 million 
(2016: pro-forma £63.6 million and reported £34.9 million). 
This strong growth and operational momentum was reflected 
across all key performance indicators and demonstrates the 
benefits of our proprietary platform along with the quality of 
our diversified brands, business intelligence expertise and 
customer engagement. 
Total deposits in the real money vertical were up 25.6% to 
£147 million (2016: pro-forma £117 million), demonstrating 
the Group’s strength in the bingo-led market, driven by our 
multi-brand strategy. Yield per player from Real Money Gaming 
was up 29% to £147 (2016: pro-forma £114), a result of successful 
player engagement and improvement in monetisation. Real 
Money Gaming funded players were down 10% to 146,000 
(2016: pro-forma 162,000) as a result of our strategy to focus 
on lifetime value players over volume of players, and the 
reduction of free bonuses across the Group. The increased use 
of mobile and touch devices by our players across the brands 
also contributed to our growth with GGR up by 17.9% and now 
represents 66% (2016: pro-forma 56%) of the total Group Real 
Money Gaming GGR. The Group continued to invest in and 
develop our new content and business intelligence capabilities 
during the period, which supported our organic growth and 
places us in a strong position for the next financial year. 
Revenues from the Social Gaming vertical, which represent 
9% of Group NGR (2016: pro-forma 17% and reported 27%), 
were down 37% (on a constant currency basis down 44%) to 
£8.1 million (2016: reported £12.8 million). The Group continued 
to invest in product development and enhancing the player 
experience to mitigate the challenges in player acquisition in 
the social gaming market. As a result of the market decline, we 
are reviewing our Social Gaming strategy and have reallocated 
some marketing resources to our RMG vertical. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales totalled £11.6 million (2016: pro-forma £9.0 million 
and reported £5.3 million) and represent solely the UK Point of 
Consumption (“POC”) Tax on the Real Money Gaming vertical. 
In August 2017, the new POC tax on free bets was introduced 
but there was no material impact on the cost of sale in the year.  
Distribution costs 
Distribution costs of £38.6 million (2016: pro-forma £34.3 million 
and reported £18.7 million), which include licensing, processing, 
royalties (third-party games and platforms), hosting (social gaming) 
and marketing, reduced to 43% (2016: pro-forma 45%) as a 
proportion of Group NGR. This significant reduction reflects 
the benefits of scale on processing costs, as we leverage our 
proprietary software and content across our brands, thereby 
reducing third-party royalty payments. We have also continued to 
invest in marketing to support our online brands in the Real Money 
Gaming vertical. Total marketing expenses across both verticals 
increased by 29% to £22.6 million (2016: pro-forma £17.6 million), 
which represented 25% of NGR (2016: pro-forma 23%).
Administration costs 
The Group maintained a tight control on administration costs, 
which totalled £19.4 million (2016: pro-forma £16.7 million 
and reported £11.4 million). This was stable year on year at 22% 
of NGR (2016: pro-forma 22%) despite the Group’s continued 
investment in talent, software development, business intelligence 
and products in line with our vision to build a leading online 
gaming business.
Proprietary software development 
Capitalised costs totalled £1.3 million (2016: reported £1.0 million) 
across the Real Money Gaming and Social Gaming verticals. 
During the period, the Group continued to invest in its proprietary 
software to support its mobile offering, unique content and 
compliance in line with regulatory requirements. Amortisation 
of capitalised development costs during the year was £0.6 million 
(2016: reported £0.2 million).
Adjusted EBITDA and margin
Adjusted EBITDA on a pro-forma basis is up 24% to £20.2 million 
(2016: pro-forma £16.4 million and reported £12.3 million) reflecting 
the strength of the RMG vertical and control over costs, with an 
improved Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23% (2016: pro-forma 21%). 
The Adjusted EBITDA for the Real Money Gaming vertical in 
the period increased by 60% along with an increase in EBITDA 
margins to 24.1% (2016: pro-forma 19.3%). As we conclude the 
earn-out period for the acquisitions of Netboost Media and 
Tarco Assets (both December 2017), together with the 8Ball 
acquisition that concluded in August 2017, we expect further 
margin improvement to come from synergies and cost savings.  
The Adjusted EBITDA for the Social Gaming vertical decreased 
by 85% to £0.6 million (2016: reported £4.1 million) as a direct 
result of the decline in revenue arising from a reduced marketing 
spend together with the increase in our product development 
and administration costs in this vertical.

Exceptional costs
Impairment of intangible: On 28 February 2017, an impairment 
review was undertaken in respect of the Social Gaming cash 
generating unit (“CGU”) to determine if the carrying value of 
assets was supported by the net present value of future cash 
flows expected to be derived from those assets. As a result of 
the review, the Board approved an impairment of £9.9 million 
(2016: reported £Nil) charged against the goodwill and acquired 
intangibles reflecting the more challenging and competitive 
social gaming market. As of 31 August 2017 the Board undertook 
an additional review on this CGU’s business models and 
financial projections and concluded that no further impairment 
was required.
Contingent remuneration: The contingent remuneration 
charge for the period relates to the earn-out payments for the 
acquisitions of 8Ball and InfiApps linked to the employment of 
the sellers within the Group and therefore has been charged 
to the profit or loss account in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The total remuneration 
payable for the 8Ball acquisition was £4.0 million in cash and 
£10.1 million in share-based payments with the remainder of 
£0.9 million relating to the InfiApps second year earn-out 
payment. Both earn-outs were settled post year end in 
September 2017. 
Contingent consideration: The contingent consideration 
charge for the period relates to the liability for the Tarco earn-out 
liability. The liability increased during the period as a result of 
better than expected adjusted EBITDA performance to date and 
management expectations for the remaining earn-out period 
to 31 December 2017. During the year the Group successfully 
increased net gaming revenue by applying better operational 
know-how and realising cost synergies with the wider Group 
resources resulting in lower distribution and administration 
costs. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability at 
the year end is £17.4 million (2016: £5.6 million) with the increase 
of £10.8 million and unwinding of interest of £1.0 million being 
recognised in the profit or loss account. The contingent liability 
will be payable in a mix of cash and shares (51.44% and 48.56% 
respectively). At the time of acquisition, an amount of £3.0 million 
was placed in an escrow account, with a further £1.0 million 
during the current year, with the intention to cover part of 
the earn-out payment within three months from the end 
of the earn-out period. 
Finance expenses and tax
Finance expenses for the period totalled £1.5 million 
(2016: reported £0.7 million) and principally relate to the 
unwinding of the discounted contingent consideration 
that arose on the Tarco Asset acquisition of £1.0 million 
(2016: reported £Nil). Also included is the finance cost of 
the £8.0 million facility provided by Barclays PLC during the 
period at an annual rate of 3.6% plus LIBOR annual floating 
rate basis. 
The credit to taxation in the period was £1.1 million 
(2016: reported expense of £0.5 million). An adjustment was 
made for the deferred tax credits relating to the impairment 
of the social gaming CGU and acquired intangibles. The 
underlying current taxation charge in the period is £0.6 million 
(2016: expense of £1.1 million). 
Cash flow and balance sheet
Stride Gaming continues to be highly cash generative, 
delivering another period of strong operating performance 
with net cash flow from operating activities totalling £12.9 million 
(2016: £13.7 million). Cash outflow mainly related to the InfiApps 
first year earn-out payment of £3.9 million (2016: £Nil) as 
well as the payment of an interim dividend of £0.8 million 
(2016: £0.5 million) and a final dividend for the prior year 
of £0.9 million (2016: £Nil). 
As at 31 August 2017 the Group has a strong balance sheet 
with cash and cash equivalents amounting to £26.2 million 
(31 August 2016: £21.1 million), which includes ring-fenced customer 
liability balances of £2.5 million (31 August 2016: £1.8 million). 
Contingent remuneration included within current liabilities 
of £5.0 million (31 August 2016: £4.6 million) primarily relates 
to the 8Ball and InfiApps earn-out payment of £4.0 million 
(2016: £Nil) and £0.9 million (2016: £3.8 million) respectively. 
Both of these amounts were settled post year end and therefore 
represent agreed balances. The contingent consideration liability 
of £17.4 million (31 August 2016: £5.6 million) included in current 
liabilities relates to the acquisition of the Tarco Assets.
As at 31 August 2017, the fair value of the Group’s 24.2% 
available-for-sale investment in QSB Gaming Limited, an 
operator of online casino and bingo gaming sites in the Spanish 
market, has been increased from £810,000 to £1,595,000. As 
the security held is unquoted, the fair value has been assessed 
in the current year based on expected cash flows discounted 
using a rate of 50% (2016: 35%) based on the market interest 
rate and the risk premium specific to the investment.  Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017

Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Adjusted earnings, EPS and dividend
Basic loss per share was 38.1p (2016: pro-forma loss per share of 0.8p and reported loss per share of 0.75p). Adjusted basic earnings 
per share was up 29% to 27.5p (2016: pro-forma 21.3p). The Board believes that Adjusted basic earnings per share (excluding 
exceptional items such as impairment, contingent remuneration and consideration, acquisition costs, amortisation of intangible 
assets excluding those arising from internal development, share-based payments and associated taxes) enables a better 
understanding of the underlying business performance.

Chairman’s introduction 
to corporate governance
There are no specific corporate governance 
guidelines which apply generally to companies 
incorporated in Jersey. However, the Directors 
are subject to various general fiduciary duties 
and duties of skill and diligence under Jersey 
company laws and statute.
Furthermore, although companies traded on AIM 
are not required to provide corporate governance 
disclosure, or follow guidelines in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”), the Directors 
recognise the value and importance of high 
standards of corporate governance.
The Directors support high standards of corporate 
governance and confirm that they comply with 
the recommendations on corporate governance 
made by the Quoted Companies Alliance as far as is 
practicable, taking into account the Company’s size 
and stage of development. The Board is responsible 
for formulating, reviewing and approving the 
Company’s strategy, budgets and corporate actions. 
To this end, the Board holds regular Board meetings 
and has established Remuneration and Audit 
Committees. Details on the composition of 
the Board and reports from the Chairs of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees follow 
this Corporate Governance Statement.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement from the Chair of the Audit Committee
for the year ended 31 August 2017
This is the third report of the Audit Committee following 
the Company’s flotation on AIM in May 2015.
The Committee has responsibility for, amongst other things, 
the planning of, reviewing and reporting to the Board on financial 
reporting, internal financial control and risk management, and 
the involvement of the Company’s auditor in that process. The 
Committee focuses in particular on compliance with corporate 
governance, accounting standards and legal requirements, 
together with maintaining an effective system of internal 
financial control.
The Committee advises the Board on the statement by the 
Directors that the annual report, when read as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual report and the half-yearly 
report remains with the Board as a whole.
The Committee also has responsibility for the consideration of 
the requirement for, and scope of, internal audit and for reviewing 
the performance, independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor.
Our focus in the current year has been to work closely with 
management and the external auditor to plan for and monitor 
the integrity of the annual report and financial statements for 
the year ended 31 August 2017 and the audit thereof. We also 
carried out a review of the financial risks and subsequently the 
internal control framework to manage these risks. Although 
we did not consider that there was a need for the provision of 
an internal audit function in the current year, we will continue 
to assess this going forward. 
Our programme for the 2018 financial year will include a continued 
focus on the integrity of the annual report and financial statements 
and ensuring that the Company’s internal controls continue to 
evolve to cover any changes in the financial risks of the Company 
following the growth of the Company’s activities, including any 
changes arising from the integration of the businesses that 
were acquired at the end of the prior financial year.
Introduction
All three Non-Executive Directors are members of the Audit 
Committee. The Committee met three times in the year ended 
31 August 2017 with all Committee members attending every 
meeting. The Committee’s terms of reference are available 
for public inspection on the Company’s website at  
www.stridegaming.com.
John Le Poidevin, as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales and former audit partner 
and chair of other public company audit committees, is considered 
to have recent and relevant financial experience. Both Nigel Payne 
and Adam Batty have many years of relevant financial and audit 
committee experience and Nigel is also a Chartered Accountant.
By invitation of the Audit Committee Chair, Ronen Kannor, the 
Chief Financial Officer, has attended all Committee meetings 
held to date, as did representatives of BDO LLP, the external 
auditor. Other Executive Directors have been invited to attend 
Committee meetings where relevant for them to do so. The 
Audit Committee also meets with the external auditor without 
any Executive Directors present and the Audit Committee Chair 
met with BDO LLP separately on several occasions to discuss 
matters, including the audit process.
Key activities during the period
The focus of the Audit Committee’s activities during the year 
has been centred around the effective planning, implementation 
and review of our financial reporting processes.
During the period we have:
• 
reviewed and monitored the integrity of the published 
financial information, including the half-yearly report, 
the preliminary announcement and the annual report 
and financial statements;
• 
considered the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor;
• 
planned for the Company’s year end and reviewed the 
audit plan;
• 
assessed the key risks which could have a material impact 
on the financial statements; and
• 
reviewed significant issues and areas of judgement applied 
in the preparation of the financial statements.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
Set out below are the significant issues considered by the 
Audit Committee and discussed with the external auditor in 
relation to the financial statements and how these were then 
subsequently addressed.
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition gives rise to a risk over completeness, 
existence, accuracy and presentation in the statement of 
comprehensive income of net gaming revenue and also 
involves judgements as to estimates and treatment of certain 
customer bonuses and the liability required in respect of 
progressive jackpots. Furthermore, net gaming revenue 
generated from Real Money Gaming is reliant on complex IT 
systems and has therefore been considered as a specific risk.
The Committee reviewed the internal control procedures in 
respect of revenue recognition and discussed with management 
and the external auditor the accounting policies adopted and 
judgements made in respect of revenue recognition for both 
the Real Money and Social Gaming revenue streams and confirmed 
that they are appropriate and in line with relevant accounting 
standards and industry practice. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 25
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements 
continued
Goodwill and other intangibles
The Group undertook a number of acquisitions in the prior 
year, which gave rise to goodwill and other intangibles within 
the Group financial statements and the requirement to carry 
out impairment reviews for each subsequent reporting period.
The Committee discussed with management the discounted 
cash flow models and assumptions, estimates and judgements 
made for each separately identifiable cash generating unit 
in order to consider the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangibles. Key assumptions reviewed included discount rates, 
perpetuity rates, operating margins and growth rates as well 
as the periods covered by the projections and the sensitivity 
analysis applied.
The Committee discussed these with the auditor and 
confirmed how these assumptions compared with industry 
standards and were supported by historical trends within 
the businesses acquired.
Other issues
In addition to the above items, other areas considered by the 
Committee in relation to the financial statements included the 
adequacy of tax provisions and disclosures, the capitalisation of 
software development costs, the completeness of related party 
disclosures, the carrying value of the Group’s available-for-sale 
investments, the fair value of contingent consideration and the 
accounting treatments relating to the fair value of share 
options and LTIP awards granted in the period.
Internal control and risk review process
Whilst the Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
financial risks and internal controls to mitigate these, the 
Board as a whole is responsible for reviewing the overall business 
risks and risk management procedures. The Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties, together with mitigating actions and the 
internal controls and risk management procedures, are set 
out in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the 
annual report.
External auditor and independence
During the year, the Committee conducted its annual 
review of the effectiveness of the auditor and satisfied itself 
that the auditor is delivering the necessary level of service, 
scrupulousness and robust challenge in its work, together with 
a formal assessment of the external auditor’s independence. 
The external auditor carried out other services during the 
year amounting to fees of £33,800, including reviews of the 
interim financial statements and other accounting information, 
together with a transfer pricing review carried out by a BDO 
overseas office. The analysis of audit, audit-related and non-audit 
fees is provided in note 3 to the financial statements. The Group 
has engaged a number of other accounting firms to carry out 
such work during the financial year, including Grant Thornton 
UK LLP, which is engaged as the Company’s principal tax 
advisor, and the Committee satisfied itself that where the 
external auditor carried out non-audit work, it undertook its 
standard independence procedures in relation to those 
engagements and that they were selected by the Company on 
the basis of specific expertise or familiarity with the areas 
under review. The Committee required the external auditor to 
confirm in writing that it remained independent in its scrutiny 
of the financial statements and had sufficient policies and 
procedures in place, including the use of separate teams and 
different engagement partners for any non-audit work. The 
Committee was satisfied that the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity were not compromised by the 
non-audit work undertaken in the financial period.

Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
for the year ended 31 August 2017
Below is set out the annual report of the Remuneration Committee 
(the “Committee”). The report comprises a description of how 
the Committee operates; and a brief overview of the 
remuneration policy and how we intend to implement it in 
2017/18; together with details of compensation paid to the 
Board of Directors within the financial year.
The previous review of the remuneration policy took place 
in August 2015. The Committee therefore undertook a further 
review of Executive remuneration during the year under review 
in order to establish whether the remuneration levels set were 
competitive, sufficiently recognised the skills and experience 
of the Executive Directors and reflected the Company’s size and 
status on AIM. The Committee further reviewed the operation 
of variable incentive plans to ensure they have the correct 
link between performance and reward.
As a result of this review, the Committee decided that its 
previous policy was still, in the main, appropriate for the 2017/18 
financial year and for the foreseeable future. This policy can 
be summarised as follows:
• 
base salaries in line with equivalent roles at companies with 
similar characteristics and sector comparators, recognising 
the capabilities and strong performance to date and reflecting 
responsibility levels and complexity of the roles;
• 
an appropriate pension contribution to provide market 
competitive, yet cost effective retirement benefits;
• 
annual bonus maximum quantum set by reference to each 
individual’s salary, with performance assessed against a 
combination of financial and operational goals linked to 
the Company’s strategy; and
• 
an annual award of performance shares subject to a 
combination of performance conditions measured over 
a three-year performance period, aligned to the main 
strategic objectives of delivering sustained profitable 
growth and increasing the Company’s share price over 
the medium term.
Against the backdrop of another successful year for the 
Company, the Committee is satisfied that the remuneration 
policy adopted for the 2017/18 financial year operates in such 
a way as to incentivise Company growth and development, and 
reward for strong performance, offering an appropriate balance 
between fixed and performance-related, immediate and deferred 
remuneration, but without overpaying or creating the risk of 
rewards for failure. 
Remuneration Committee report
The Committee is appointed by the Board, and is formed 
of Non-Executive Directors. In the year the Committee was 
chaired by Adam Batty; the other members of the Committee 
were Nigel Payne and John Le Poidevin.
The Committee met three times during the year and all Committee 
members attended every meeting. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available for public inspection on the Company’s 
website at www.stridegaming.com.
Other members of the Board of Directors are invited to attend 
meetings when appropriate, but no Director is present when his 
remuneration is discussed. New Bridge Street (“NBS”), a part 
of Aon Hewitt Limited, provided advice to the Committee during 
the current and prior years. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group code of conduct and has no other connection 
with the Company other than in the provision of advice on 
remuneration from time to time. 
The Committee’s principal duties remain as follows:
• 
to review and make recommendations in relation to the 
Company’s Senior Executive remuneration policy;
• 
to apply these recommendations when setting the specific 
remuneration packages for each Executive Director, the 
Company Chairman and other selected members of senior 
management and to include annual bonuses, the eligibility 
requirements for long-term incentive schemes, pension rights, 
contracts of employment and any compensation payments;
• 
to ensure that the remuneration policy is aligned with the 
short and long-term strategy of the Company;
• 
to manage performance measurements and make 
awards under the Company’s annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans;
• 
to consult with key shareholders with regards to remuneration 
where appropriate and take their views into account; and
• 
to manage reporting and disclosure requirements relating 
to Executive remuneration.
Pay policy
The remuneration policy is designed to provide an appropriate 
level of compensation to senior management such that they 
are sufficiently incentivised and rewarded for their strong 
performance, their levels of responsibility and complexity of 
their role and to reflect their skills and experience over time. 
Using appropriate measures of financial and personal 
performance, as well as equity-based rewards, helps to align 
the interests of the Directors with those of the Company’s 
shareholders.
The Committee has taken into account market data when 
setting remuneration levels, positioning Executives’ pay at a 
broadly mid-market level relative to similarly sized AIM-listed 
companies, as well as those from the gaming sector. This 
provides a package which is both fair and competitive within 
the market.
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis, and any 
increases become effective from the start of the financial year. 
As a result of the salary benchmarking exercise undertaken in 
the 2016/17 financial year and reflecting the strong performance 
of the Company and Directors during the year, with effect from 
1 September 2017, Eitan Boyd and Darren Sims are entitled to a 
base salary of £290,000 following an increase of 14% over the 
previous financial year. Ronen Kannor is entitled to a base salary 
of £185,000, following an increase of 13% over the previous 
financial year.  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 27
Pension and benefits
The Executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution of up to 10% of salary in the form of a defined contribution to 
a pension plan and/or as a cash supplement. Additionally, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits in kind, including the 
provision of life assurance, group income protection and private medical and dental insurance.
Annual bonus
The remuneration policy allows the Committee, at its discretion, to make annual cash bonus awards to the Executive Directors, 
which will normally be limited to a bonus opportunity of 100% of salary per annum.
Stretching performance targets are determined by the Committee at the start of the financial year, which are fully aligned 
with the Company’s strategy and objectives. These targets (a majority of the bonus) are financial in nature (e.g. Adjusted EBITDA), 
with a minority of the bonus payable for the achievement of qualitative strategic and personal performance targets set by the 
Chief Executive Officer and agreed by the Chairman. For the financial targets, a sliding scale target range is used, with no 
bonus payable for this element unless a threshold level of performance is achieved. Clawback provisions do apply.
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the annual bonus opportunity to 125% of salary in exceptional circumstances 
where actual performance significantly exceeds targets set at the start of the financial year. It is intended that this flexibility will 
only be used in limited scenarios, reflecting the dynamic nature of the market. For the financial year ended 31  August 2017, in 
light of the exceptional performance by the Executive team in exceeding the financial targets set for the year, the Committee 
exercised its discretion to increase the annual bonus opportunity to 115% of salary. 
Long-term incentives
During the financial year under review, the Company made its first annual long-term incentive (“LTIP”) award, as announced 
on 6 June 2017. The awards will be satisfied in the form of ordinary shares, with a face value of up to 100% of each Executive Director’s 
salary for the relevant financial year, on a three-year vesting period. As disclosed in the Remuneration Report in respect of the 
financial year ending 31 August 2016, due to transaction activity during the previous financial year and then close periods, it was 
not possible to grant the planned awards; therefore, the award made in the year comprised both the 2016/17 award and the 
award carried over from 2015/16. As highlighted in last year’s Remuneration Report, the Committee has retained a discretion to 
shorten the standard vesting periods to take account of the delayed award cycles. 
The awards are subject to challenging performance conditions set at the time of grant, which includes metrics based on the 
Company’s financial performance which is in line with the Company’s stated growth strategy. The vested LTIP awards will be 
exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the grant date, subject to the individual’s ongoing employment. The awards are structured 
as forfeitable share awards whereby the beneficial interest in the ordinary shares will be transferred to the participants if the 
conditions set out in the Company’s LTIP have been met and after consulting with the Remuneration Committee. Dividends 
which accrue may be paid on vested shares. Clawback provisions apply.

Non-Executive Director fees
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are set with reference to market data, time commitment, responsibilities and chairmanship 
of Board Committees. Fees are normally reviewed biennially. During the year as part of the wider review of remuneration policy, 
the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors were reviewed (in the case of the Chairman of the Board by the Committee and 
in the case of the Non-Executive Directors by the Board) and, as a result, from 1 September 2017, the Chairman, Nigel Payne, will 
receive a fee of £60,000 per annum, an increase of 25% from the previous year. The two other Non-Executive Directors, Adam Batty 
and John Le Poidevin, will receive annual fees of £47,000, representing a 12% increase from the prior year. Other than their 
annual fee, as well as appropriate travel expenses to and from Board meetings, no additional compensation is payable. 
Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company
The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most Senior Executives in 
the Company, with a significant element of remuneration dependent on Company and individual performances. A lower aggregate 
level of incentive payment applies below Executive Director level. The vast majority of the Company’s employees participate 
in an annual bonus plan with the limits and performance conditions varying according to job grade. The Committee believes in 
broad-based employee share ownership being a key element in retention and motivation in the wider workforce, so many employees 
are provided with longer-term incentives through discretionary share schemes. The Committee takes into account remuneration 
packages within the Company as a whole when determining Executive pay levels.
Service agreements
The Executive Directors’ service agreements provide that their employment with the Company is on a rolling basis, subject to 
written notice being served by either party of not less than six months.
The current service contracts and letters of appointment include the following terms:
  Date of contract Notice period
Executive Directors Stuart Eitan Boyd 11 May 2015 Six months
 Darren Brett Sims 11 May 2015 Six months
 Ronen Kannor 11 May 2015 Six months
Non-Executive Directors Adam David Batty 19 May 2015 Three months
 Nigel Terrence Payne 8 May 2015 Three months
 John Le Poidevin 19 May 2015 Three months
Under these service contracts, the Company may terminate an Executive Director’s employment immediately by making a payment 
in lieu of base salary, benefits and statutory entitlements, and any bonus or commission payments pro-rated for the duration of 
the notice period. No bonus would be payable in the event of an Executive Director’s resignation.

first, second and third anniversaries of listing. As detailed above, the Company made the first and second long-term incentive 
awards under a new long-term incentive plan. The awards are in the form of performance shares, with a three-year vesting period 
subject to stretching performance conditions set at the time of grant and which include metrics based on financial performance 
in line with our key objectives of delivering returns to our shareholders through achievement of our growth strategy and 
continued service.

have been taken as a Director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
BDO LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution to reappoint it will be proposed for the Annual 
General Meeting.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial risk management objectives 
and policies are included in note 21 to the financial statements.
Events after reporting date
For significant events after the reporting period please refer 
to note 25 of the financial statements.
Going concern
The Board is satisfied that the Group has adequate financial 
resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future 
and is financially sound. For this reason, the going concern 
basis is considered appropriate for the preparation of 
financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the 
Directors to prepare accounts for each financial period. Under 
that law, and as required by the AIM Rules for Companies, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• 
retain accounting records that are sufficient to show, at any 
time, the financial position of the Group;
• 
give a true and fair view of the Group financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows;
• 
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with 
IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors and apply them consistently;
• 
present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• 
make judgements that are reasonable;
• 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, 
is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
• 
state whether the Group financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report 
and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

21 November 2017 Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 31
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Stride Gaming plc
Opinion on consolidated financial statements
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Stride Gaming plc for the year ended 31 August 2017 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements: 
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 August 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• 
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• 
the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Matter How we addressed the matter in our audit
Revenue recognition
Refer to note 1 to the financial statements for the accounting 
policy for revenue recognition. 
The Group has a number of revenue streams across its online 
games. Revenue is predominantly derived from gambling 
operations arising from high volume, typically low value 
transactions and is dependent on the overall volume 
and quantum of amounts wagered.
The accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised, and 
the related player liabilities, is dependent on the effectiveness 
of the systematic and manual financial controls in relation to 
player liabilities, calculation of bonuses, jackpots and prizes 
granted to players, cash and bank reconciliations.
Due to the complexity of the processes, there is a risk that 
revenue or player liability errors could go undetected or are 
not detected on a timely basis.
We evaluated and tested relevant IT general controls over the 
key revenue and financial information systems. We involved 
IT specialists for this purpose.
The key automated and manual general application controls over 
the completeness and accuracy of the Group’s main gaming systems 
have been documented and tested including conducting test bets.
We have completed a full extraction of all gaming data from the 
two proprietary platforms and reconciled the opening to closing 
client liability balances and the resulting gaming revenue for the 
year taking into account bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted 
to players during the year.
We have tested a sample of social gaming revenues and revenue 
generated from third party platforms to invoice and subsequent 
bank receipt. 
We noted no deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of the 
controls and no material errors in the substantive procedures 
performed in our audit of revenue in the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 August 2017.

Matter How we addressed the matter in our audit
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
At 31 August 2017 goodwill and other intangible assets 
amounted to £57.7 million.
During the year ended 31 August 2017 the Group performed 
an impairment assessment for all cash generating units as 
identified by management.
As a result of this review management determined that the 
weaker than expected social gaming market had an adverse 
effect on the projected value in use of that social gaming cash 
generating unit and consequently these intangible assets have 
been written down to their assessed value in use.
As disclosed in note 12 this resulted in an impairment of 
£6.1 million charged against goodwill and £3.9 million 
against acquired intangibles.
We agreed the forecasts used in the impairment calculations 
to the latest Board approved plans. 
We evaluated the assumptions in these forecasts and plans 
and considered the evidence in support of them, principally 
in relation to historical trends and actual performance in 2017.
We reviewed the net present values calculated by management 
against the overall net assets of the cash generating units.
We reviewed the basis and reasonableness of the discount 
rate used.
We performed a sensitivity analysis in respect of the key 
assumptions used in the impairment calculations. 
We have utilised a valuations specialist to review the models and 
certain assumptions used by management including the discount 
rate applied.
Based on the substantive procedures performed the impairment 
assessment and impairment charge appears reasonable. 
Our application of materiality
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be £907k (2016: £615k) which represents approximately 
4.5% of adjusted EBITDA. We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during 
our audit above £18k (2016: £12k).
We used adjusted EBITDA as a benchmark given the importance of EBITDA as a measure for shareholders in assessing the 
underlying performance of the Group.
Individual component audits were carried out using component materialities of between 60–75% of overall financial 
statement materiality.
An overview of the scope of our audit
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole taking into account the geographical structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls and the industry 
in which the Group operates.
All work was undertaken by the Group engagement team with the exception of components in Israel and Mauritius where we 
engaged with component auditors. Where work was performed by component auditors we determined the level of involvement 
we needed at those reporting units to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. We discussed the planned procedures ahead of the audit with 
the component auditors and also discussed the results of their procedures during the completion of the audit procedures.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the consolidated financial statements 
and our Auditor’s Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Key audit matters continued Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 33
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• 
proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• 
the consolidated financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, 
and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors 
are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

1 Accounting policies
Legal status
Stride Gaming plc, which includes its subsidiaries and together forms the “Group”, is a public limited company incorporated in 
Jersey. Stride Gaming plc was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 on 25 February 2015. The address of its registered 
office is 12 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey JE2 3RT. Stride Gaming plc shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market 
(“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is not required to present parent company information.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below and 
have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the parent’s functional currency and amounts 
are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively “IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with EU adopted IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements are disclosed below.
Changes in accounting policies
a) New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 September 2016
Where relevant, new standards and amendments to existing IFRSs that have been published and are mandatory for the first time 
for the financial year beginning 1 September 2016 have been adopted, but had no significant impact to the Group accounts.
b) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases 
have not yet been adopted by the EU) have not been early adopted. This includes the following:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
This standard becomes effective for the first time for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It contains new 
requirements which cover classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. The recognition and derecognition 
requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities are unchanged from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, which is the standard it is replacing. Main changes are:
Classification and measurement of financial assets
IFRS 9 replaces the rules-based model in IAS 39 with an approach which bases classification and measurement on the business 
model of an entity and on the cash flows associated with each financial asset (the solely payments of principal and interest 
(“SPPI”) test). This has resulted in a revision of the boundary between fair value and amortised cost. Some key changes include:
• 
elimination of the “held to maturity” and “available for sale” categories;
• 
elimination of the requirement to separately account for (i.e. bifurcate) embedded derivatives in financial assets; and
• 
elimination of the limited exemption to measure unquoted equity investments at cost rather than at fair value.
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
The requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities are largely unchanged from IAS 39. However, for 
financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, IFRS 9 requires that changes in the fair value which relate to 
changes in own credit risk should generally be recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
Unlike financial assets, the concept of embedded derivatives has been retained for financial liabilities. 
Impairment
IFRS 9 sets out a new forward-looking “expected credit loss (“ECL”)” model which replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 and 
applies to:
• 
financial assets measured at amortised cost;
• 
debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; 
• 
trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables; and
• 
certain loan commitments and financial guaranteed contracts.
The new requirements will lead to the earlier recognition of larger credit losses. Unlike IAS 39, entities will be required to consider 
forward-looking information when measuring ECL. Therefore, a credit event (or impairment “trigger”) no longer has to occur 
before credit losses are recognised. An entity will now always recognise (at a minimum) twelve-month ECL. Lifetime ECL will be 
recognised on assets for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. While most trade 
receivables will be subject to a simplified approach to ECL, entities will still need to consider forward-looking information.

b) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective continued
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
This standard becomes effective for the first time for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It is intended to clarify 
the principles of revenue recognition and establish a single framework for revenue recognition. IFRS 15 supersedes the following:
• 
IAS 11 Construction Contracts;
• 
IAS 18 Revenue;
• 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes;
• 
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate;
• 
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers; and
• 
SIC-31 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services.
The core principle is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
The core principle of IFRS 15 is applied through a five-step approach:
I. Identify the contract(s) with the customer.
II. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
III. Determine the transaction price.
IV. Allocate the transaction price.
V. Recognise revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
Additionally, the new requirements add specific guidance for multiple-element arrangements, contract costs and disclosures. 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods. 
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a 
contract, i.e. the customer (“lessee”) and the supplier (“lessor”). All leases result in a company (the lessee) obtaining the right to 
use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 
eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces 
a single lessee accounting model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognise:
a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and
b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement.
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its 
leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently.
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019. A company can choose to apply IFRS 16 before that date but only if it also applies IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 16 replaces the previous leases standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related interpretations. The amendments are not yet endorsed 
for use in the EU. The Directors are currently assessing the impact of this standard when it is adopted for the first time. 
Basis of consolidation
Acquisition of subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. Control is achieved if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to 
use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may 
be a change in any of these elements of control. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss from the date that control was obtained to the date that control was lost, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 41
1 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued
Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the financial reporting date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss account. 
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at rates ruling when the transaction took place. 
All assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at 
the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating inter-group loans considered to be investment in 
subsidiaries that the Directors do not expect to be repaid for the foreseeable future as well as the opening net assets at the opening 
rate and the results of foreign operations at the actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the foreign currency translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in 
the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and included in the computation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Net gaming revenue (“NGR”) is derived from online gambling operations and is defined as the difference between the amounts 
of bets placed by the players less the amount won by players. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes 
granted to players. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Social Gaming revenue is derived from the purchase of credits and awards on the social gaming sites, as well as “in-app” 
advertising revenue. Social Gaming revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured and where there are no further obligations. Revenue is recognised in the 
accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales consists primarily of gaming duties.
Distribution costs
Distribution costs represent the costs of delivering the service to the customer and primarily consist of processing and royalty 
fees, promotional and advertising costs together with gaming and other regulatory costs, all of which are recognised on an accruals 
basis. For the first time in the current financial year, distribution costs also include royalties payable to third-party platform suppliers, 
following the acquisition of 8Ball Games Limited and the Tarco Assets. 
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs and corporate and professional expenses, all of which are recognised 
on an accruals basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued, plus the amount attributable of any non-controlling interests in the acquisition and dependent on the terms 
of the sale and purchase agreement, deferred and contingent consideration.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the profit or loss account. 
Costs incurred in respect of the acquisition are expensed in full in the period of acquisition.
Contingent consideration
When contingent consideration arising on a business combination requires no ongoing employment from the former owners in 
order to receive payment, the fair value of contingent consideration is included within cost at acquisition date.
Contingent consideration is reviewed at the end of each accounting period as the consideration payable and any subsequent 
adjustments are recognised in profit or loss account.
When the former owners of an acquired subsidiary are required to remain in employment at each of the deferred or contingent 
consideration payment dates, the fair value of contingent consideration is built up over the period of service to the date of 
payment with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss account. When future service is required, this is described in the 
financial statements as contingent remuneration. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Externally acquired intangible assets 
Externally acquired intangible assets including intellectual property rights, developed software applications and licences are 
initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives which is typically 
over a period of 3–5 years or over the length of the licence.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual or legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at using appropriate valuation techniques 
(see section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and methods used to determine the cost 
(at initial recognition) of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life Valuation method
Brands 4–10 years Discounted cash flows
Developed software 3–10 years Relief from royalty
Customer relationships 4–14 years Discounted cash flows
Contractual relationships 3–10 years Discounted cash flows
Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss during the financial period to which it relates.
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
• 
it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
• 
adequate resources are available to complete the development;
• 
there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
• 
the Group is able to sell the product;
• 
sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
• 
expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from the assets generated, being 
three years.
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write off the 
cost of fixed assets on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates 
used for this purpose are:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 10–33% straight line
Computer equipment – 33–66% straight line
Motor vehicles – 25% straight line
Subsequent expenditures are included in the carrying amount of an asset or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs 
and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the profit 
or loss.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and internally generated assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the 
financial year end or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may be impaired and 
hence not recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and 
fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows: its cash generating unit (“CGU”). 
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the profit or loss account; an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 43
1 Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows from the financial asset expire or when the contractual rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognised 
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. Financial assets are either categorised as loans 
or receivables or available for sale. There are no assets classified as held to maturity or fair value through profit or loss. All financial 
liabilities are classified as amortised cost with the exception of contingent consideration which is at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less provision for impairment. Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the profit 
or loss account when there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade 
receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised 
within administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not 
be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held at bank, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
have maturities of three months or less from inception, are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Available for sale
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available for sale and comprise principally 
the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried 
at fair value with changes in fair value, other than those arising due to exchange rate fluctuations and interest calculated using 
the effective interest rate, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve. Exchange 
differences on investments denominated in a foreign currency and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method 
are recognised in the profit or loss statement.
Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset (which constitutes 
objective evidence of impairment), the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income, is recognised in profit or loss.
On sale, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from the available-for-sale reserve 
to profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially measured at their fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method; this method allocates interest expense over the relevant period by applying the “effective interest rate” 
to the carrying amount of the liability. Player liabilities are the amounts that customers place in their accounts along with any 
bonuses and progressive jackpots. These liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 
which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried 
in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Current and deferred tax
Taxation represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit reported in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Notes forming part of the financial statements continued

Current and deferred tax continued
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity through other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each consolidated statement of profit or loss date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the consolidated statement of 
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is realised or settled.
Operating leases
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group, these are classified as 
operating leases. The total rentals payable under the lease are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The amount charged to the profit or loss account in respect of pension 
costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable 
in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either other liabilities or prepayments in the consolidated statement 
of financial position.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of 
a financial liability or financial asset.
Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options (including under the long-term incentive plan – “LTIP”) are awarded to employees (refer 
to note 22), the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit or loss account over the vesting period. 
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each 
reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options 
that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. 
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are 
satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting 
condition is not satisfied.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the profit or loss account is charged with the fair value 
of goods and services received or, in the case of an asset, recorded within the appropriate classification.
UK National Insurance is payable on gains made by some employees on exercise of share options granted to them. The eventual 
liability to National Insurance is dependent on:
• 
the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of exercise;
• 
the number of options that will be exercised; and
• 
the prevailing rate of National Insurance at the date of exercise.
At each period end the potential liability is recorded as an expense within the profit or loss account and a corresponding 
provision recorded.
In relation to the LTIPs, the maximum number of shares expected to vest on the date of the award are gifted to an employee 
benefit trust. The Group has the power to instruct the trust on when to release the shares to the individuals in the LTIP, subject to 
certain performance conditions being met and the options having vested and being capable of exercise. The cost of gifting these 
shares to the trust has been included in retained earnings. These shares are excluded from the calculation of the weighted 
average number of shares used in the basic earnings per share.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this is when paid and in the case 
of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 45
1 Accounting policies continued
Adjusted EBITDA
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as the operating result before depreciation, amortisation, finance costs, and income or 
expenses that relate to exceptional items such as contingent consideration, contingent remuneration and acquisition costs as 
well as non-cash charges relating to share-based payments (including employer’s National Insurance). The Directors believe that 
Adjusted EBITDA represents more closely the underlying trading performance of the business.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Reference is made in this note to accounting policies which cover 
areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. 
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 August 2017 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net 
present value of future cash flows derived from those assets. The recoverable amounts of the Group’s CGUs have been determined 
from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets and long-term forecasts. These 
budgets and forecasts assume the underlying business models will continue to operate on a comparable basis under the current 
regulatory and taxation regimes, adjusted for any known changes. 
Specifically, this review was undertaken for the Social Gaming CGU at 28 February 2017 to assess whether any potential 
indicators were apparent and following this review a detailed impairment review was then completed. As a result the Group 
determined that the weaker than expected social gaming market had an adverse effect on the projected value in use and 
consequently the intangible assets have been written down to their value in use. An impairment of £6,056,000 has been 
charged against goodwill and £3,931,000 against acquired intangibles (refer to note 12). As of 31 August 2017 the Group 
undertook an additional review on this CGU’s business models and financial projections and concluded that no further 
impairment was required. 
Available-for-sale investment
The Group holds 24.25% (2016: 24.25%) in the equity share capital of QSB Gaming Limited, a company incorporated in Alderney 
and an operator of online casino and bingo gaming sites in the Spanish market. Despite holding greater than 20% of the voting 
equity instruments in QSB Gaming Limited, the Directors do not believe that they exercise significant influence over the investee. 
This is on the basis that the Group has no representation on the board and no participation in decisions over operating and 
financial policies. The Group has therefore recorded the asset as an available-for-sale investment at fair value of £1,595,000 
(2016: £810,000). As the security held is unquoted, the fair value has been assessed in the current year based on the Group share 
of expected cash flows discounted using a risk-adjusted interest rate specific to the investment of 50%. 
Acquisition accounting and fair value of acquired assets and liabilities including contingent consideration
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, including earn-outs that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are capitalised if they are separable from the 
acquired entity or arise from other contractual or legal rights. The amounts ascribed to these assets are arrived at by using appropriate 
valuation techniques to determine the fair value. Capitalised intangible assets are amortised over the useful economic life of the 
assets. This has ranged between three to five years for acquisitions to date. The fair value of contingent consideration, including 
earn-outs, is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the assessment of present values using appropriate 
discount rates. Further details in relation to key estimates and judgements are set out in note 23.
Capitalisation and amortisation of development costs
The identification of development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation is dependent on management’s judgement and 
knowledge of the work done. Development costs of gaming software platforms are separately identified. Judgements are based 
on the information available at each period end. Economic success of any development is assessed on a reasonable basis but 
remains uncertain at the time of recognition. Capitalised development costs are subject to amortisation over its useful life and 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
The Group amortises the assets over the life of the product. The estimated useful life of these assets at period end is three years. Notes forming part of the financial statements continued

2 Segment information
For management purposes and for transacting with customers, the Group’s operations can be segmented into the following 
reporting segments:
• 
Real Money Gaming, which is its UK-focused, bingo-led online operation, using its proprietary and purchased software to 
provide online bingo and related gaming activities to players. This segment only operates in regulated markets, principally 
the UK; and
• 
Social Gaming, which internationally provides players with entertaining applications and games.
Each of these operating segments generates independent revenues, and the risks and rewards associated with generating these 
revenues are considered to be different to each other.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the management team including the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.

6 Available-for-sale investment
The Group holds a 24.2% investment in QSB Gaming Limited, an operator of online casino and bingo gaming sites in the Spanish 
market and registered in Alderney. Despite holding greater than 20% of the voting equity instruments in QSB Gaming Limited, 
the Directors do not believe that they exercise significant influence over the investee. This is on the basis that the Group has 
no representation on the board and no participation in decisions over operating and financial policies. The Group has therefore 
recorded the asset as an available-for-sale investment. At 31 August 2017, the fair value has been increased from £810,000 to 
£1,595,000. As the security held is unquoted, the fair value has been assessed in the current year based on the Group’s share 
of expected cash flows discounted using a risk-adjusted interest rate specific to the investment of 50%. A reduction in interest 
rate of 10% would increase the fair value of the available-for-sale investment by approximately £460,000.

7 Directors’ interests and remuneration continued
As announced in the 2015 annual report, the Company committed to make the first long-term incentive award under a new 
long-term incentive plan in the 2015/16 financial year. However, due to the transaction activity during the prior year it was not 
possible to grant the planned awards during 2015/16. The awards for 2015/16 were therefore made in the current year with an 
effective date of 1 September 2015.

As of 31 August 2017 the Israeli Tax Authorities initiated a review on the tax liabilities of Netboost Media Limited for the years ended 
31 December 2012–2015. The company is registered in Israel and was acquired as part of the Tarco Assets and Netboost Media 
acquisition in 31 August 2016 (refer to note 23). As of the date of this report the review is still ongoing and there is no indication 
of the financial effects that may result from this review. As part of the sale purchase agreement the sellers have provided tax 
guaranties to cover certain tax liabilities. As there is currently no indication of any liability arising, no liability or corresponding 
asset for the indemnity has been recorded.  Notes forming part of the financial statements continued

An interim dividend of £808,000 (1.2p per share) was declared and paid in the year ended 31 August 2017 (2016: £564,000). The 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.5p per share subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, which 
has not been accrued at 31 August 2017 (2016: final dividend of 1.4p per share approved and paid representing a total of £943,000).

Software and licences
Included within costs of software and licences is the acquired software and related programs from NextTec Software Inc, 
fair valued at £4,132,000, in respect of the underlying gaming platform and software used by Table Top Entertainment. Based 
on the agreement, the contingent consideration payable (on the first, second and third anniversaries) is based on a percentage 
of net gaming revenue generated from the use of the software up to a maximum of £5,325,000. On 30 September 2015 and 
6 October 2016, 1,149,071 and 846,701 shares were issued respectively. The maximum earn-out was reached by the second 
anniversary and therefore the full earn-out has now all been settled in shares.

Impairment review 
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. 
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 August 2017 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the 
net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets. The recoverable amounts of all the above CGUs have been 
determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets and long-term 
forecasts. These budgets and forecasts assume the underlying business models will continue to operate on a comparable 
basis under the current regulatory and taxation regimes, adjusted for any known changes.
Table Top Entertainment and Spacebar Media CGUs
The recoverable amounts of Table Top Entertainment and Spacebar Media have been determined from value in use calculations 
based on cash flow projections covering the following five-year period and a calculation into perpetuity which exceeds the total 
values of each CGU’s assets.
The cash flows for 2018 and 2019 are based on Board-approved budgets with a long-term growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%) and 
a discount rate of 13.9% (2016: 13.9%). These assumptions were based upon management’s experience, past performance and 
drawing on industry data where relevant.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions which would cause the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
8Ball Games CGU
The goodwill and related assets included within this CGU resulted from the acquisition of the entire share capital of 8Ball Games 
which completed on 31 August 2016 (refer to note 23). The recoverable amount has been determined from value in use calculations 
based on cash flow projections covering the following five-year period and a calculation into perpetuity. 
The cash flows for 2018 and 2019 are based on Board-approved budgets with a long-term growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%) and 
a discount rate of 17.1% (2016: 17.1%). These assumptions were based upon management’s experience, past performance and 
drawing on industry data where relevant.
The Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions which would cause the 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
Tarco CGU
The goodwill and related assets included within this CGU resulted from the acquisition of certain trading assets of Tarco and 
the entire share capital of Netboost Media Limited, which completed on 31 August 2016 (refer to note 23). The recoverable 
amount of £27.6 million, which exceeds the total value of the CGU’s assets by £2.9 million, has been determined from value 
in use calculations based on cash flow projections covering the following five-year period and a calculation into perpetuity. 
Operating margins have been based on past experience of the acquired entity and future expectations in light of anticipated 
economic and market conditions. Discount rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect 
the specific risks of the CGU.

Social Gaming CGU
The goodwill and related assets included within this CGU resulted from the acquisition of InfiApps Ltd, which completed in 
the year ended 31 August 2015.
A review for indicators of impairment was undertaken as part of the half-year results at 28 February 2017 to assess whether 
any potential indicators were apparent and following this review a detailed impairment review was completed in respect of the 
Social Gaming cash generating unit to determine if the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future 
cash flows derived from those assets. The recoverable amount has been determined from value in use calculations based on cash 
flow projections from formally approved budgets and long-term forecasts. These budgets and forecasts assume the underlying 
business models will continue to operate on a comparable basis under the current regulatory and taxation regimes, adjusted for 
any known changes. As a result of this review the Group determined that the weaker than expected social gaming market had an 
adverse effect on the projected value in use and consequently the intangible assets have been written down to their value in use. 
An impairment of £6,056,000 has been charged against goodwill and £3,931,000 against acquired intangibles.
A further impairment review was carried out at 31 August 2017 and identified no further impairment. This has been determined from 
value in use calculations based on cash flow projections covering the following five-year period and a calculation into perpetuity.
The cash flows for 2018 and 2019 are based on Board-approved budgets as well as on past experience of the acquired entity. 
The key assumption in reaching the conclusion that no further impairment is required is a 34% increase in revenue forecast for 
the year ending 31 August 2019. Discount rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect 
the specific risks of the CGU.

In the prior year, as part of the acquisition of the Tarco Assets, which completed on 31 August 2016 (refer to note 23), an amount 
of £3,000,000 was transferred by the Group to an escrow account, with an intention to cover part of the earn-out payment which 
will be made to the sellers within three months of 31 December 2017, following the end of the earn-out period. A further £1,000,000 
was also transferred to the same escrow account in the current year, in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. 
Furthermore, in June 2017 £929,000 was transferred to an escrow account which related to the second year earn-out of the 
InfiApps acquisition. This was settled post year end. 
The carrying value of trade and other receivables classified as loans and receivables approximates fair value. All amounts shown 
in short-term trade and other receivables fall due for payment within one year. All non-current receivables are due within three

The carrying value of trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost approximates fair 
value. The contingent remuneration arose as a result of the 8Ball Games Limited acquisition in the prior year and the InfiApps acquisition 
in the year ended 31 August 2015, of £4,036,000 and £932,000 respectively. Both of these amounts were determined at 31 August 2017 
and settled post year end. The contingent consideration has arisen from the acquisition of certain trading assets of Tarco Limited 
on 31 August 2016 and as reassessed at 31 August 2017 (refer to note 23).

Group entered into a loan facility with Barclays PLC for £8.0 million. This facility matures four years from the date of the initial 
drawdown on a 3.6% plus LIBOR annual floating rate basis payable quarterly, with the principal sum outstanding amortising on a 
quarterly basis over the term of the facility. Daub Alderney Limited, Spacebar Media Limited, S.T.R. Financials Ltd and InfiApps 
Ltd (all 100% subsidiaries of the Group) have provided unlimited guarantee on the borrowings. The effective interest rate of the 
bank borrowings is 5.74% and the book value of the bank borrowings is not materially different to its fair value. Notes forming part of the financial statements continued

that were granted for 2015/16 and 2016/17. The effect of the issue of shares to the trust was to increase the issued share capital 
of the Group with a corresponding entry in retained earnings. As and when LTIP conditions are met, the Company will instruct 
the trust to release shares to each of the Directors involved in the LTIP. Refer to note 7 for further details.

Financial instruments not measured at fair value
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and loans and borrowings 
approximates their fair value.
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst 
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The overall objective of the Board is to 
set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. 
Further details regarding these policies are set out below.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group’s operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from payment service 
providers (“PSPs”), from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Group’s websites and from B2B 
platform providers following the acquisitions of 8Ball and Tarco Assets (see note 23) and also stemming from social gaming. 
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis, including aged debtor analysis, and promptly takes corrective 
action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded. Similarly, they monitor the B2B platform providers for any potential issues and take 
prompt action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial 
institutions, only independently rated parties with high ratings are accepted.
Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 14. Notes forming part of the financial statements continued

Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. The Group’s policy in this case is to allow the subsidiary 
to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. 
The majority of the remainder of the Group’s transactions are denominated in Sterling; therefore, the Directors deem the Group’s 
exposure to all other exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal.
Foreign currency-denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into Sterling at the closing rate, are as follows:

Total net exposure (16,289) (3,866) (1,225) (85) (21,465)
The effect of a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar against Sterling at the reporting date on the US Dollar-denominated financial 
instruments carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in post-tax profit for the year 
and an increase in net assets of £12,000 (2016: decrease of £430,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the 
same basis, have decreased post-tax profit and decreased net assets by £9,000 (2016: increase of £351,000). 
The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Israeli Shekel against Sterling at the reporting date on the Israeli Shekel-denominated 
financial instruments carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in post-tax profit 
for the year and decrease of net assets of £30,000 (2016: decrease of £136,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, 
on the same basis, have increased post-tax profit and increased net assets by £24,000 (2016: increase of £111,000). 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its 
short-term borrowings. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due 
and, as at the end of the financial year, projections indicate that the Group expects to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its 
obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

22 Share-based payment 
The Company has an equity-settled share option scheme for its employees and non-employees, which includes the following:
(i)  Enterprise Management Incentive share options (“EMI Options”) which qualify for favourable tax treatment under the 
provisions of Schedule 5 to ITEPA. Holders of EMI options have up to ten years from the date of grant to exercise these 
options. The number of options and vesting dates are in accordance with each individual agreement.
(ii)  Non-qualifying options made available to employees and Executive Directors of the Group also have up to ten years from 
the date of grant to exercise the options. The exact numbers and vesting dates will depend on each contract agreement, 
but all options will vest and will therefore be exercisable in no more than three years from the date of grant.
(iii)  Non-employee options are available to Non-Executives and individuals providing services to the Company who are 
non-employees. The vesting and exercise conditions are the same as non-qualifying options.
(iv)  Long-term incentive plans (“LTIPs”) are available to the three Executive Directors of the Group. Every year, a certain number 
of shares (depending on gross salaries and share price on the date of the award) will be placed in a trust. The vesting date 
of each share award will be three years from the date of the award, and the number of shares to vest will depend on specific 
earnings per share targets. The exercise price is £Nil. The LTIPs are discussed further in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

23 Business combinations
Prior year acquisitions
The acquisition of Tarco Limited assets, as well as the acquisition of the entire share capital of Netboost Media Limited and 
8Ball Games Limited all completed on 31 August 2016. On completion, the Group’s market share and brand offering increased. 
These acquisitions continue to bring significant scale to the Group’s business, together with the continuous opportunity for 
meaningful operational leverage. For both acquisitions, the main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill which is not 
deductible for tax purposes are the opportunities we now have for significant further improvement through leveraging off the 
Group’s leading software and marketing expertise, together with delivering synergies through cross-marketing, lowering of cost 
per acquisition, increasing customer value and reducing player churn. These factors do not qualify for separate recognition. 
Each acquisition is detailed below.
Acquisition of 8Ball Games Limited 
On 31 August 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of 8Ball Games Limited (“8Ball”), a company 
registered in the UK. The company is an online bingo operator with a 2% market share of the UK online bingo market. It has over 
60,000 active players and 74 sites, including Booty Bingo and WeWantBingo. The 8Ball acquisition brings scale and an efficient 
cross-marketing business intelligence platform utilised to reduce churn and increase lifetime value. 
The initial consideration was £11.3 million in cash which was paid on completion of the transaction as well as £1.2 million of 
assumed debt.

Acquisition of 8Ball Games Limited continued
The purchase agreement also included a one-year earn-out payable to the sellers as contingent consideration if they remain with 
the acquired company for twelve months post-acquisition. This element of the consideration is accounted for as remuneration 
rather than part of the consideration paid to acquire 8Ball in accordance with International Accounting Standards. The earn-out 
could not exceed £18 million and is calculated as a six times multiple of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period following 
completion, less the initial consideration. The total consideration was finalised as at 31 August 2017 and consisted of £4,036,000 
payable in cash and a share-based payment expense of £10,088,000. The overall earn-out liability including the share element 
was settled in September 2017 as follows:
• 
The first £3,000,000 was satisfied by the issue of 1,333,333 earn-out shares calculated by reference to the August 2016 
placing price of 225p. 
• 
The remaining consideration was split 40% in cash and 60% in shares. This represented 2,784,149 earn-out shares calculated 
as the first £1,000,000 to be satisfied at 225p, being the placing price of the August 2016 placing, and the remainder by 
reference to the average closing price of the ordinary shares for the 90-day period ending on 31 August 2017 of 216p. 
• 
The cash value, which was paid on 29 September 2017, was £4,036,800.
Total acquisition costs amounted to £543,000 and these have been recognised in the profit or loss account in the year 
ended 31 August 2016. In the prior year, had the acquisition been made on 1 September 2015, Group revenue would have 
been £10.8 million higher with an increase in profit after tax of £1.0 million.
Acquisition of Tarco Limited assets and Netboost Media Limited 
On 31 August 2016 the Group acquired certain assets (the “Tarco Assets”) of Tarco Limited (“Tarco”), a company registered 
in Belize, and the entire issued share capital of Netboost Media Limited (“Netboost Media”), a company registered in Israel; 
a marketing business which provides execution marketing services to Tarco Assets. On this basis the purchase price allocation 
has been completed on a combined basis. 
At the time of the acquisition, Tarco was an online bingo operator with a 3% market share of the UK online bingo market and 
had over 63,000 active players. It had 22 B2C bingo brands and four B2B brands, including Moon Bingo and Robin Hood Bingo. 
The Tarco acquisition brought scale and a number of leading bingo brands to Stride Gaming. 
The total consideration which cannot exceed £40.2 million for the Tarco Assets and Netboost Media was made up as follows:
Tarco Assets
• 
Initial consideration of £16.2 million (on a debt-free, cash-free basis) paid on completion, of which £7.9 million was paid in 
cash (before any working capital adjustments) and the balance of £8.3 million satisfied by the issue of 3,219,500 new ordinary

Current contingent consideration net of discounting finance cost 5,620
Working capital payable in cash 21
Total consideration 24,022
Goodwill (note 12) 13,973
The contingent consideration was recorded as a liability at 31 August 2016 based on the estimated fair value at acquisition date 
and discounted from this date until the consideration is paid. It was calculated based on the Group’s expectation of what it will pay 
in accordance with the sale and purchase agreement at the time. The earn-out targets are based on a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA 
for the year ending 31 December 2017. On 31 August 2017, the expected Adjusted EBITDA of the earn-out period was reassessed 
at approximately £4.5 million, which led to an increase in the fair value of the contingent earn-out of £10,797,197 which has been 
recognised in the profit or loss account and will be payable in cash and shares as noted above. During the period the Group 
successfully managed to increase net gaming revenue by applying better operational know-how and cost synergies utilising 
the wider Group resources which resulted in lower distribution and administration costs. A change in the actual Adjusted 
EBITDA achieved in the year ending 31 December 2017 of £100,000 would increase/decrease the fair value of contingent 
consideration by £750,000. 
Total acquisition costs amounted to £302,000 and these have been recognised in the profit or loss account in the year ended 
31 August 2016. In the prior year, had the acquisition been made on 1 September 2015, Group revenue would have been £17.5 million 
higher with an increase in profit after tax of £1.7 million.
