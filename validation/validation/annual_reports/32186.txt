Chairman’s statement
The Group has made 
good progress towards 
its strategic objectives.”
Overview
It gives me great pleasure to announce 
that Norcros has recorded its eighth 
consecutive year of revenue and underlying 
operating profit growth, with the result 
achieved in the year being marginally 
ahead of market expectations. The Group 
has also made good progress towards its 
strategic objectives and in particular, by 
achieving underlying ROCE of 18.4% in 
the year, ahead of target.
Group revenue for the year was £271.2m, 
15.0% higher than the prior year on a 
reported basis, 10.6% higher on a constant 
currency basis and 4.1% higher on a like 
for like constant currency basis. Underlying 
operating profit at £23.8m was 11.7% higher 
than the prior year, mainly reflecting a further 
significant improvement in performance in 
our South African business, and a first‑time 
contribution from Abode which was acquired 
in March 2016. Underlying diluted earnings 
per share was consistent with the previous 
year at 27.8p.
The recent acquisitions of Croydex and 
Abode have been integrated seamlessly 
into the Norcros Group and are performing 
in line with the Board’s expectations. I have 
been encouraged by the quality and 
enthusiasm of the management teams 
of those businesses in identifying and 
pursuing opportunities in collaboration 
with the Group’s existing portfolio, particularly 
in the areas of new business development, 
procurement and supply chain.
The Group has again delivered a strong 
cash performance, with underlying 
operating cash flow at 99% of underlying 
EBITDA (2016: 76%). The Group is in a 
sound financial position with a strong 
balance sheet and has reduced net debt 
by £9.3m to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m), 
representing leverage of 0.8 times 
underlying EBITDA.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend for the year of 4.8p (2016: 4.4p) 
per share. When added to the interim 
dividend of 2.4p (2016: 2.2p) per share 
which was paid on 12 January 2017, this 
will make a total dividend for the year 
of 7.2p (2016: 6.6p) per share, a 9.1% 
increase on the previous year.
Pension scheme
The gross deficit relating to our UK defined 
benefit pension scheme as calculated under 
IAS 19R has increased from £55.7m at 
31 March 2016 to £62.7m at 31 March 2017 
principally reflecting a reduction in bond 
yields. Notwithstanding, this position is a 
significant improvement on the £97.8m 
deficit reported at the half year, which 
had increased primarily because of the 
abnormally low bond yields following the 
EU referendum result. Despite the volatility 
experienced in the bond markets and the 
subsequent effect on our pension liabilities, 
which have little impact on scheme cash 
flows, we remain confident that our 
pension obligations continue to be 
appropriately funded and well managed.
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the 
Group operates to the highest standards 
in all aspects of governance and risk 
management. Our aim at Norcros is to 
manage a growing business effectively, 
while ensuring that proper operating 
procedures and internal controls are 
maintained at all times. Transparency 
is central to this objective and you will 
find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report.
SUMMARY
 — Eighth consecutive year of growth
 — Underlying operating profit up 11.7% 
at £23.8m (2016: £21.3m)
 — Group operating profit was £16.8m 
(2016: £16.7m) 
 — Strong cash generation – net debt 
reduced by £9.3m to £23.2m
 — Underlying ROCE at 18.4% (2016: 18.3%) 
– ahead of strategic target 
 — Full year dividend increased by 9.1% to 7.2p
Norcros has recorded its eighth

underlying operating profit growth. CASE STUDY – CROYDEX
Aberfeldy Village T ower 
Hamlets, Croydex 
“Hang ‘N’ Lock” 
system delivers 
cost savings with 
“one‑man” installation
THE CHALLENGE
Accessories provide the finishing touches to any 
bathroom but fitting larger items such as mirrored 
cabinets has traditionally been a time-consuming 
“two-man job”. When construction and fit-out specialist, 
Willmott Dixon, needed to install mirrored cabinets 
in 290 London apartments, it not only required an 
affordable yet stylish design, but also an easy and 
efficient fixing system.
THE SOLUTION
The Burwell and Westbourne triple door, tri-view 
cabinets from Croydex can be fitted by just one 
person using the patented Hang ‘N’ Lock system. 
The fully adjustable bracket enables the level of the 
cabinet to be changed after fixing holes have been 
drilled. Simply attach to the wall, adjust with the built-in 
spirit level and hang the cabinet before locking it securely 
in place. This eliminates the struggle of trying to mark 
screw holes with one hand whilst supporting a heavy 
bathroom item with the other. Both white steel cabinets 
have mirrored doors, two adjustable shelves and 
110 degree sprung hinges to maximise storage space.
THE RESULT
By enabling a single fitter to install each cabinet, 
significant cost savings in both labour and time 
have been achieved. 
Burwell and Westbourne cabinets have been fitted 
throughout the Aberfeldy development.

People
Our employees continue to be our most 
valuable asset and in recognition of this 
the Group aims to create an environment 
in which they can see their careers develop. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to 
thank the Group’s employees who have 
helped to deliver revenue and underlying 
operating profit growth over an extended 
timeframe and in particular for their 
contribution over the last twelve months.
Summary
These results demonstrate the Group’s 
resilience in the face of some difficult 
trading conditions, particularly the revenue 
growth achieved in the UK in the second 
half of the year and the continued progress 
in South Africa. The Group has delivered 
another strong performance, reflecting 
the successful acquisition strategy and the 
sustained focus on driving organic growth 
through market share gain, investment 
in new products, operational efficiency 
programmes and geographic expansion. 
The recent acquisition of Abode has 
been integrated seamlessly into the Group 
and we are already progressing revenue 
and procurement synergies with other 
Group businesses. In view of the success 
achieved in the current year and the strong 
momentum and focus on growth, I remain 
confident that we will continue to make 
progress towards achieving our medium‑ term strategic objectives.
Martin Towers
Chairman
14 June 2017 06 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Group Chief Executive’s statement
Overview
Building on our record of sustained progress 
over recent years, Group revenue for the 
year increased by 15.0% to £271.2m 
(2016: £235.9m) and by 10.6% on a 
constant currency basis. Group operating 
profit was £16.8m compared to £16.7m in 
the prior year.
Our performance in the UK in the second 
half of the year was in marked contrast 
to the first half, with like for like revenue 
(excluding revenues from Abode entirely 
and Croydex for quarter one) up 8.8% in the 
second half having been down by 5.0% 
in the first half against the comparative 
period. The first six months were extremely 
challenging, particularly in the retail sector, 
reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the 
implications of the EU referendum. I am 
pleased that our UK businesses recovered 
well in the second half of the year and were 
able to capitalise on the more stable trading 
environment, delivering growth in all of 
our key segments of retail, trade and 
export. UK revenue for the year at £182.3m 
(2016: £163.0m) was 11.8% ahead of the 
prior year and 2.0% higher on a like for like 
basis. The like for like increase mainly 
reflected the success of the recent 
acquisitions, Vado and Croydex, partly 
offset by the more challenging trading 
environment experienced by Triton in the 
first half of the year. UK underlying operating 
profit for the year was £0.2m higher than 
the prior year at £17.4m (2016: £17.2m) with 
an underlying operating margin of 9.5% 
(2016: 10.6%). The modest improvement in 
profitability in the year mainly reflected the 
first‑ time contribution from Abode and a 
full year of trading at Croydex partly offset 
by lower contributions from Johnson Tiles 
and Triton, reflecting lower revenues than 
the previous year. 
Our South African business continued the 
sustained progress of recent years with 
another year of strong growth. The 
combination of market share gain and the 
appreciation of the Rand against Sterling 
during the year resulted in reported revenue 
21.9% ahead of the prior year at £88.9m 
(2016: £72.9m). On a constant currency basis 
revenue was 8.3% higher than last year. 
Underlying operating profit for the year 
increased by 56% to £6.4m (2016: £4.1m), 
including a £0.9m benefit from the stronger 
Rand. This performance reflected the 
business‑ wide progress, particularly 
in operating efficiencies, procurement 
and supply chain management, with 
improvements made by all three businesses. 
The return on sales was 7.2% (2016: 5.6%), 
a considerable improvement on last year. 
In Johnson Tiles SA, the launch of new 
product ranges coupled with further 
manufacturing efficiencies resulted in an 
underlying operating profit ahead of last 
year. In TAL, further sales growth and 
focus on input costs, plant efficiency and 
logistics resulted in increased profitability. 
In Tile Africa, the enhanced store experience 
and success of the in‑ stock and on‑ display 
programme contributed towards a superior 
financial performance.
The Group sources a significant element 
of its components and raw materials from 
China and Europe. Following the UK’s vote 
to leave the European Union there was a 
substantial weakening of Sterling against 
the US Dollar and the Euro. In the year, 
the Group was largely protected from the 
impact of this devaluation of Sterling on 
its cost base through its currency hedging 
strategy. In addition, during the year, the 
Group actioned a series of measures to 
protect the future profitability of the business 
including a combination of effective 
purchasing, working with our suppliers, 
price management and cost reduction 
programmes and we are confident that 
these actions will mitigate the currency 
impact in 2017. 
Group underlying operating profit at £23.8m 
(2016: £21.3m) was 11.7% higher than the 
prior year, with Group underlying operating 
margins broadly consistent with last year 
at 8.8% (2016: 9.0%). Underlying operating 
cash flow improved considerably to £29.8m 
(2016: £20.4m) reflecting the improved 
underlying operating profit and strong 
working capital management. This resulted 
in net debt falling by £9.3m to £23.2m 
(2016: £32.5m), and leverage of 0.8 times 
underlying EBITDA (2016: 1.2 times). The 
Group is in a strong financial position with 
funding through a £100m unsecured debt 
facility (including a £30m accordion) available 
until July 2019, leaving the Group well placed 
to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.
Strategy
In 2013, the Board established three strategic 
targets: to double Group revenue to £420m 
by 2018; to maintain revenue derived outside 
of the UK at approximately 50% of Group 
revenue; and to sustain a pre‑ tax return on 
underlying capital employed of 12% to 15% 
over the economic cycle. We have again 
made good progress in the current year 
against all three objectives.
Group revenue in the year increased by 
15.0% to £271.2m. Our progress in relation 
to achieving the Group revenue target of 
£420m by 2018 has been held back by the 
significant depreciation of the Rand/Sterling 
exchange rate since the objective was 
established in 2013. In constant currency 
terms, Group revenue would have been 
£304.0m. The Board recognises that 
achieving the target of £420m by 2018 
remains challenging and accordingly will 
reassess this timeline later in the current 
financial year in light of our progress. 
We nevertheless remain committed to 
this revenue target. 
Group underlying operating 
profit at £23.8m (2016: £21.3m) 
was 11.7% higher than the prior 
year, with Group underlying 
operating margins broadly 
consistent with last year at 
8.8% (2016: 9.0%).”
The Group has built on our 
record of sustained progress 
over recent years. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 07
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
On a Sterling reported basis, Group revenue 
derived outside of the UK was 42.8% (2016: 
41.6%). Similarly, our progress in relation to 
this strategic target of 50% of Group revenue 
to be derived outside of the UK has also 
been impacted by the significant depreciation 
of the Rand/Sterling exchange rate since 
2013. In constant currency terms, we are 
in line with our target at 49% and remain 
focused on growing our current overseas 
markets and developing new ones to 
support this important strategic intent. 
As part of its growth strategy the Group has 
acquired three material and complementary 
businesses in the last four years. Vado, 
which was acquired in March 2013, has 
been an outstanding success with revenue 
growth of 10.4% per annum and underlying 
operating profits growing 18.0% per annum 
since acquisition. Croydex, acquired in June 
2015, has also delivered strong like for like 
revenue and underlying profit growth since 
its acquisition. Abode, which has only been 
part of the Group for twelve months, has 
grown revenue by 5.0% and recorded profits 
in line with our expectations and, like Croydex 
and Vado, has been seamlessly integrated 
into the Group. 
Along with our existing business portfolio 
all the recently acquired businesses have 
strongly contributed towards the Group 
achieving an underlying return on capital 
employed of 18.4% (2016: 18.3%), which is 
ahead of our strategic target. 
Our track record in acquiring quality 
businesses in our targeted sectors and 
geographies, and our skill in seamlessly 
integrating them into the Group and 
further developing them, together with 
our growing pipeline of opportunities 
gives me confidence that we will continue 
to successfully execute our acquisition 
growth strategy. I am also encouraged by 
the growing number of synergies and organic 
growth opportunities being progressed 
throughout the expanded Group.
Summary and outlook
The Group has continued to make good 
progress towards its strategic targets during 
the year. Whilst the UK market remains 
uncertain as the ramifications resulting from 
the UK’s vote to leave the EU begin to unfold, 
I am confident that our UK business is more 
resilient and better placed to capture further 
growth opportunities as they arise. Our South 
African business has continued to deliver 
sustainable growth, and, notwithstanding the 
recent political unrest, the medium‑ term 
outlook in South Africa remains positive, 
providing opportunities for the Group to 
continue to grow its market share. With our 
leading market positions, portfolio of strong 
brands, continued new product investment, 
strong financial position and self‑ help 
initiatives focused on market share gain and 
operational improvement, the Board remains 
confident that the Group should continue to 
make further progress for the year ending 
31 March 2018.

CASE STUDY – ABODE
Berkeley Homes: 
Vista, Chelsea Bridge
THE CHALLENGE
The challenge from Berkeley Homes to Leicht Kitchens 
was to supply a high quality, WRAS (Water Regulations 
Advisory Scheme) approved, kitchen tap. The brief was 
for a “designer model” of a square, cubic design to 
complement the on-trend, modern handle-less 
kitchen units being installed into this luxurious, top 
end development.
THE SOLUTION
The tap offered was the Abode New Media tap, available 
in four up-to-date colour finishes. This creatively 
designed model has the modern cubic design lines 
asked for, featuring a large square base, a rotating 
planate spout with integrated aerator and easy to use 
minimalist handle, which stands proud either on the 
sink or on the worktop, when installed. The tap finishes 
available were Chrome, Brushed Nickel, Granite Black 
and Gloss White. The specification was to co-ordinate 
with other appliances being fitted within the very 
modern kitchens. As a result, Abode’s AT1180 in the 
Chrome finish was chosen.
THE RESULT
Leicht Kitchens took delivery of 140 New Media taps.
Since gaining this contract, Abode has quoted the 
same tap plus a selection of other products from the 
Abode portfolio to additional regions of Berkeley Homes 
(Eastern Counties and South East London). Additionally, 
the two major kitchen suppliers to these two regions 
have quoted Abode products (taps and sinks) for all 
their London contract business, establishing Abode 
within this important and growing sector.  08 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Strategy and objectives
About our strategy 
The Board believes the execution of this strategy will enhance shareholder value.
Organic growth will continue to be driven by capitalising on our 
leading market positions in the UK and South Africa. Our strategic 
initiatives will ensure we maintain the provision of innovative new 
product programmes, excellent customer service and investment 
in our brand portfolio. We will also reinforce our “designed in Britain” 
credentials as well as capture the growth opportunities in 
South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, where 
medium-term growth rates are likely to be higher than the 
more developed markets. We will continue to drive faster 
revenue growth in our existing export markets and develop 
new emerging export opportunities.
Acquisitions will be targeted at complementary market and 
industry segments exhibiting attractive returns on capital which 
are likely to be bathroom and kitchen products with exposure 
to commercial and specification segments. The acquisitions 
of Croydex in June 2015 and Abode in March 2016 represent 
the most recent examples of the execution of our strategy.
Our strategy
1
Pursue a faster and focused growth 
strategy to scale up the size of the 
Group organically and by acquisition
2
Maintain investment in our strong 
brands and new product development
3
Leverage revenue synergies within our 
portfolio of complementary businesses
4
Target acquisitions in complementary 
markets with attractive returns on capital
5
Continue to ensure high standards of 
corporate governance and responsibility
A focused growth strategy 
and strong results.

Definition
Reported Group revenue for the year which excludes discontinued operations.
Performance
Total revenue for the year increased by £35.3m (15.0%), 10.6% on a 
constant currency basis, and 4.1% on a constant currency like for like 
basis. UK revenues increased by 11.8% and by 2.0% on a like for like 
basis. South African revenues rose by 21.9% on a reported basis and by 
8.3% on a constant currency basis.
*  When the strategic target to grow Group revenue to £420m by 2018 was first 
established in the year ended 31 March 2013, the Rand/Sterling average exchange 
rate was 13.37, compared to the average Rand/Sterling exchange rate for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 of 18.31. In order to demonstrate the underlying constant 
currency revenue growth over that period, Group revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2017 has been recalculated as if the exchange rate had remained 
constant, and on that basis would have been £32.8m higher at £304.0m.
Definition
Reported operating profit as adjusted for IAS 19R administrative 
expenses, acquisition related costs and exceptional operating items, 
as defined in note 8 to the financial statements.
Performance
Underlying operating profit increased by £2.5m (+11.7%) principally 
reflecting the continued improvement in the Group’s South African 
operating segment.
*  In the year ended 31 March 2013, the Rand/Sterling average exchange rate was 
13.37, compared to the average Rand/Sterling exchange rate for the year ended 
31 March 2017 of 18.31. In order to demonstrate the underlying progress in profitability 
in constant currency terms over that period, Group underlying operating profit for 
the year ended 31 March 2017 has been recalculated as if the exchange rate had 
remained constant, and on that basis would have been £2.9m higher at £26.7m.
Definition
The total of the interim dividend and the proposed final dividend for the 
financial year. Prior year figures have been restated to reflect the 10:1 
share consolidation completed on 29 September 2015.
Performance
In line with the Board’s progressive dividend policy the dividends per 
share increased 9.1% to 7.2p per share from 6.6p per share.
Definition
Revenue from the Group’s South African operating segment plus export 
revenue from the Group’s UK operating segment.
Performance
Group revenue outside the UK increased in the year to 42.8%, with the 
translation impact of the stronger South African Rand offsetting the 
additional revenues from the predominantly UK‑ focused acquired 
Croydex and Abode businesses.
*  When the strategic target to maintain approximately 50% of Group revenue 
derived outside of the UK was first established in the year ended 31 March 2013, 
the Rand/Sterling average exchange rate was 13.37, compared to the average 
Rand/Sterling exchange rate for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 18.31. In order 
to demonstrate the underlying progress over that period, the share of Group 
revenue derived outside of the UK for the year ended 31 March 2017 has been 
recalculated as if the exchange rate had remained constant, and on that basis 
would have been 49.0%.

UK business review
After an extremely challenging first half of the year, where 
UK like for like revenues were 5.0% below the prior year, the 
business has recovered strongly with like for like revenue 
in the second half 8.8% above the comparative period.
In the UK, revenue increased in the year 
by 11.8% to £182.3m (2016: £163.0m). 
This includes a full year contribution of 
£10.6m from our newly acquired Abode 
business, and an additional three months 
of contribution from Croydex (acquired 
June 2015). On a like for like basis (excluding 
revenues from Abode entirely and Croydex 
for quarter one), total revenue was 2.0% 
higher than the prior year, with growth in all 
key sectors. After an extremely challenging 
first half of the year, where UK like for like 
revenues were 5.0% below the prior year, 
the business has recovered strongly with 
like for like revenue in the second half 
8.8% above the comparative period. 
Underlying operating profit grew by £0.2m 
to £17.4m (2016: £17.2m) with an operating 
margin of 9.5% (2016: 10.6%). This mainly 
reflected a full year performance from our 
newly acquired Abode business, and an 
additional three months profit from Croydex 
partly offset by lower contributions from 
Triton and Johnson Tiles.
Triton
Revenue at Triton, our market leading 
UK domestic shower business, was 
3.8% lower at £48.7m (2016: £50.6m). 
Pleasingly, revenue in the second half of 
the year was 5.7% higher than the previous 
year following the significant destocking 
by a number of our major customers in 
the first half of the year.
UK revenue was 6.1% lower than the prior 
year overall, with the retail sector broadly 
flat, offset by a 9.5% reduction in revenue 
from the trade sector, principally reflecting 
the impact of the first half customer 
destocking. There has been investment 
in new product ranges, aimed at both the

key sectors.

professional installer and trade contract 
sectors, which have recently been launched 
including new mixer showers and the 
Thermostatic Electric T80Z and T80 Pro‑Fit 
showers. These two premium products 
join the Triton T80Z Fast Fit, which remains 
Britain’s leading trade electric shower, 
reaffirming Triton’s status and market 
leading position. Against the backdrop of 
a challenging DIY sector, Triton once again 
grew its overall share of the branded UK 
retail shower market in both the electric 
and mixer shower segments.
Export revenue, which represents 
approximately 17% of overall revenue, 
was 9.0% higher compared to the prior 
year. The primary export market is the 
Republic of Ireland and the success in 
this country was principally driven by the 
launch of the T90SR, the world’s first truly 
silent pumped electric shower. Growth in 
new overseas markets such as South America 
also continued, principally reflecting the 
launch of the new low pressure electric 
shower which was specifically developed 
for this market.
Triton again delivered strong underlying 
operating profits and good cash conversion, 
although lower than the prior year principally 
reflecting the reduction in revenue in the 
first half.
Vado
Vado, our leading manufacturer of taps, 
mixer showers, bathroom accessories 
and valves, recorded revenue of £37.2m 
for the period (2016: £33.1m), 12.4% higher 
than the prior year. The sustained growth 
in the UK continued, benefiting from the 
investments made in recent years, and the 
slow start to the year in export markets 
was reversed in the second half of the year 
as the benefits of our change in distribution 
arrangements in the Middle East took effect.
UK revenue was 17.5% higher than the prior 
year with continued growth in both the 
trade and retail segments. UK trade sector 
revenue grew by an impressive 28.0% 
against the prior year, which followed 
18.5% growth on the prior year, as Vado 
gained further share in the specification 
segment. In the previous year Vado won 
new business with Miller Homes, Stewart 
Milne and CALA Homes, amongst others, 
and these relationships have driven 
increased demand in the current year as 
Vado products have been specified for 
additional new home developments. 
UK retail revenue was 8.2% ahead of last year 
as Vado continued to gain market share in 
the independent retail sector. The business 
has continued to invest in additional sales 
resource and marketing programmes to 
support and drive further progress in this 
important market segment. Furthermore, 
the business has continued to make strong 
progress with independent trade buying 
groups and, as a mark of this success, in 
November 2016, Vado was awarded Supplier 
of the Year to the NBG Group for the 
second consecutive year.
Export revenue was 1.0% higher than last 
year with revenue in the second half of the 
year 22.2% higher than the same period 
last year reflecting stabilisation following 
the change in distribution arrangements 
in our important Middle East market and 
our establishment of a stocking hub in 
Dubai to increase service levels and 
support growth in the region. In addition, 
the business continues to support Vado 
revenue growth in South Africa through 
the Group’s Tile Africa retail operations.
New product development remains key for 
the business and three major new ranges, 
including the award winning Kovera range, 
will be launched in early 2017, with a strong 
pipeline of new product programmes in 
place for the future. Operationally, further 
expansion of our warehousing capacity 
will be available in the second quarter of 
the current financial year to support the 
growth in revenue and to maintain Vado’s 
leading customer service offer.
Notwithstanding the continued investment 
in the business to support future growth, 
underlying operating profit was ahead of 
last year.
Croydex
Croydex, our market leading, innovative 
designer, manufacturer and distributor 
of high quality bathroom furnishings and 
accessories, recorded revenue of £24.7m 
for the period (2016: £17.2m for nine months 
of Norcros ownership, £22.3m on a full 
year pro‑ forma basis), 10.8% higher than 
the prior year on a pro‑ forma basis.
Full year UK revenue was 8.5% higher 
than last year, with retail sector revenue 
14.0% ahead and trade sector revenue 1.1% 
higher. Export revenue, which accounts 
for approximately 7% of revenue, increased 
by 64% in the year, mainly from continued 
penetration into our existing markets of 
Germany and the USA. Growing our export 
business is a key focus and it is pleasing to 
report that there has been an encouraging 
take‑ up following the launch of a range of 
Croydex products into South Africa through 
the Group’s Tile Africa retail network.

demands outstanding form and function. KOV‑ 1098‑ C/P

CASE STUDY – JOHNSON TILES
Brics and Savoy 
provide style and 
sophistication to The 
Alverton Hotel, Truro
THE CHALLENGE
When it came to adding a touch of luxury to 
The Courtyard ensuites at The Alverton Hotel, Truro, 
interior designer, Matt Hulme of Dynargh Design 
required tiles that would combine elegance with 
contemporary, cutting-edge style.
THE SOLUTION
Using Johnson Tiles’ Brics range in Docklands Grey for 
the floor, and its Savoy range in Caraway for the walls, 
alongside high end accessories and wood panelling in 
a muted palette, the ensuites promote individuality and 
seamless style that transitions through from bedroom 
to bathroom for an unparalleled guest experience.
THE RESULT
The resulting space is both contemporary and stylish 
– creating the perfect environment for guests to relax 
and unwind. 
UK business review continued
Croydex continued
Growth in the UK has been achieved through 
continued product innovation and an 
increased emphasis on improving the 
service proposition for our customers. 
Unique IP protected innovations such as 
Flexi‑ Fix and StickNLock have led to the 
introduction of new product category 
programmes with certain customers, and 
many Croydex products are also being 
rolled out over a wider store footprint. 
Customers are also able to make their 
supply chains more efficient and reduce 
distribution costs by benefiting from our 
improved order fulfilment capabilities, 
with the option of delivery to distribution 
centres, stores or individual consumers. 
This is particularly important in the retail 
sector in support of the strong growth in 
online business.
Underlying operating profit performance 
was ahead of last year, with strong 
cash conversion. 
Abode
Abode, our leading niche designer and 
distributor of high quality kitchen taps, 
bathroom taps and kitchen sinks, recorded 
revenue of £10.6m for the twelve months 
since acquisition on 31 March 2016, in line 
with the Board’s expectations. Compared 
to the previous twelve months prior to 
Norcros ownership, Abode grew revenue 
by 5.0%.
Central to the growth in revenue has been 
new product introductions, such as the 
Pronteau hot water tap, and account 
wins, principally Bathstore and Homebase. 
Revenues of Abode‑ branded products 
continue to represent an increasing 
proportion of total revenues as recognition 
of the brand and the strength of its franchise 
increases. Operationally, the business has 
expanded its sales force and sourced 
additional warehousing to support 
future growth.
Consistent with our other recent acquisitions 
it is pleasing to report that Abode has been 
integrated seamlessly into the Group. The 
performance of Abode since acquisition 
has been highly encouraging, with the 
business generating an underlying profit 
and cash performance in line with the 
Board’s expectations. Abode is also 
progressing the potential synergies available 
to it through working with other Group 
businesses with new business and alternative 
sourcing opportunities being the initial 
areas of focus.
Johnson Tiles
Johnson Tiles, the UK market leading 
ceramic tile manufacturer and a market 
leader in the supply of both own 
manufactured and imported tiles, 
recorded revenue 1.7% lower at £53.2m 
(2016: £54.1m). Sales in the first half 
of the year were 9.0% lower than the 
comparative period, but encouragingly 
the performance in the second half was 
much stronger with revenue 6.1% higher 
than the prior period.
UK revenue was 1.3% lower overall, which 
was mainly driven by subdued demand in 
the DIY sector resulting in revenue being 
3.8% below prior year. After a challenging 
first six months, the second half of the year 
demonstrated considerable improvement.
UK trade sector revenue was 1.3% higher than 
the prior year. Johnson Tiles continued to 
make gains in the house developer sector 
with Barratt David Wilson, Persimmon, 
Redrow and an increasing number of 
smaller regional builders, although the 
social housing refurbishment market 
remained weak, because of continued 
tight funding control. The business has 
remained active in the commercial 
specification market supplying contracts 
as varied as the IBIS Manchester, the 
Darwin Shopping Centre in Shrewsbury, 
Anytime Fitness Health Clubs and the 
Silverstone Innovation Centre.
Export revenue was 4.8% lower than the 
prior year, with good project‑ led growth 
in the Middle East offset by our conscious 
decision to exit some lower margin business 
in Australia. During the year Johnson Tiles 
also agreed with Leroy Merlin to launch 
the innovative new tile fixing product 
Cristalgrip into its French stores. This 
product has been developed by Johnson 
Tiles over a number of years and has 
garnered an extremely positive reception. 
Although it is too early to estimate the 
quantum of the revenues that this product 
might generate we are confident of its 
ultimate commercial acceptance. We are 
planning to launch the product in the UK 
later this year. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 15

Operationally, the business continued to 
perform efficiently, though the reduction 
in revenue resulted in underlying operating 
profit being lower than the prior year. 
Consequently, and as previously announced, 
the Group commenced a restructuring of the 
business in March 2017. The re‑ organisation 
will increase manufacturing flexibility, improve 
operating performance, better align capacity 
with demand, reduce inventory and will 
entail the loss of around 90 jobs. This has 
resulted in a charge of £2.3m which has 
been treated as an exceptional operating 
item, with the subsequent cash outflow 
occurring in the first half of the year to 
31 March 2018. It is expected that the 
restructuring will pay back in cash terms 
within twelve months.
Norcros Adhesives
Revenue at Norcros Adhesives, our UK 
manufacturer and supplier of tile and stone 
adhesives and ancillary products, was 
marginally lower at £7.9m (2016: £8.0m).
Domestic revenue was 7.6% below last 
year, reflecting reduced activity levels in 
the market following the EU referendum, 
with softness in both trade and retail. 
This was offset by significant growth in 
export revenue as the local sales operation, 
established in Dubai in the previous 
year, began to gain momentum, with 
an encouraging pipeline of projects in 
place for the coming year.
More recently the business has secured 
significant contract wins to supply Wickes 
and the NMBS buying group, and has 
grown its relationship with Travis Perkins 
such that several new products will be 
rolled out across its extensive branch 
network. To meet this growth in volume 
we have started to expand the production 
facility in the UK which will be completed 
in the first half of the next financial year.
Our product development work has focused 
on developing a moisture suppressant, 
“Pro DPM”, which can be used to control 
the rate of moisture released from a surface 
to enable the fast track installation of floor 
coverings and a new range of tile backer 
boards, “Pro Ply”, that are magnesium oxide 
based and will complement our existing 
Pro Board range of cementitious boards. 
The Pro DPM will be a component part 
of Pro Gypbase, a product to be launched 
in the first quarter of the next financial 
year, which will meet a clear need in the 
market for a fast‑ track method to allow 
tiling onto gypsum‑ based screeds within 
seven days. 
Underlying operating profit performance 
was marginally below last year reflecting 
the lower revenue and the continued 
investment in developing our new product 
programmes and increasing sales presence. 16 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
South Africa business review
Business‑ wide progress has led to a considerable 
increase in the return on sales to 7.2% (2016: 5.6%).
Our South African business continued the 
sustained progress of recent years with 
another year of strong constant currency 
growth with revenue 8.3% higher than 
last year. The Rand appreciated against 
Sterling during the year with the average 
exchange rate 10.7% stronger at ZAR 18.31 
(2016: ZAR 20.50), resulting in full year 
reported revenue 21.9% ahead of prior 
year at £88.9m (2016: £72.9m).
Underlying operating profit for the year 
improved by 56% to £6.4m (2016: £4.1m) 
including a £0.9m benefit from the stronger 
Rand. This reflected the business‑ wide 
progress, particularly in supply chain 
management, with improvements made 
by all three businesses. The return on sales 
was 7.2% (2016: 5.6%), a considerable 
increase on last year.
Johnson Tiles South Africa
Johnson Tiles South Africa, our tile 
manufacturing business in South Africa, 
continues to operate at maximum 
manufacturing capacity. As a consequence 
of the growth in demand from Tile Africa, 
supply to the independent market was 
constrained with external revenues of 
£10.8m, 1.8% lower than last year on a 
constant currency basis. On a reported 
basis revenue was 10.2% ahead of the 
£9.8m achieved in the prior year.
The launch of new manufactured and 
factored ranges, such as the Johnson White 
Collection, together with sales of higher value 
large format tiles and coupled with further 
operational plant improvements resulted 
in an underlying operating profit ahead of 
last year, with excellent cash conversion.
Another year of strong 
constant currency growth.

It is pleasing to report that the plant was 
awarded the ISO 14001 environmental 
management certification during the period. 
Additionally, capacity expansion options 
for the short and medium term are well 
developed with the business currently 
engaged in a number of projects to 
gradually increase our existing plant 
capacity over the next two years.
TAL
TAL, our market leading adhesives business 
in South Africa, delivered strong growth with 
constant currency independent sector 
revenue increasing 4.5% compared to prior 
year or 17.9% on a reported Sterling basis 
to £21.1m (2016: £17.9m). This reflected 
further growth in exports to Sub‑ Saharan 
Africa with export revenue outside of 
South Africa now accounting for 17.3% 
of independent sector revenue.
During the year there has been continued 
focus on input costs, plant efficiency and 
logistics which in addition to the revenue 
growth resulted in further underlying 
operating profit growth. The business 
also maintained its record of strong 
cash conversion. 
Tile Africa
Tile Africa, our leading retailer of wall and 
floor tiles, adhesives, showers, sanitaryware 
and bathroom fittings, delivered its third 
successive year of double digit constant 
currency growth with revenue 12.0% higher 
on a constant currency basis, being 26.1% 
higher on a Sterling reported basis, at £57.0m 
(2016: £45.2m). 
The ongoing focus on delivering 
improvements in our supply chain and 
store experience continues to benefit 
our performance and has been particularly 
apparent in the success of our in‑ stock 
and on‑ display programme. The Customer 
Experience (CX) format stores, both new 
and upgraded, are performing ahead of 
expectations. We now have seven CX stores 
and we continue to improve our retail 
Norcros SA has a dedicated programme 
of investment in people. It looks to uplift 
both our own employees and the wider 
communities that we operate in. The 
programme internally includes extensive 
and wide‑ ranging training and to date 
429 Norcros SA employees, nearly half 
of the total workforce, has been coached 
or trained on various courses at every 
level of the Company. This training starts 
with basic adult numeracy and literacy 
programmes and goes right through 
to university degrees. 
As part of the Tile Academy Course, students were able to 
practise their skills by tiling three children’s crèches in local 
disadvantaged areas. Norcros SA donated the materials 
and covered all the costs.
proposition as our retail portfolio is upgraded, 
including all stores receiving updated tap 
displays. Growth is being delivered at 
improved margins as Tile Africa increasingly 
makes use of our international group supply 
chain infrastructure to source exclusive 
product ranges at lower costs. The launch 
of the Croydex product range earlier this 
year has exceeded our revenue projections 
and, along with a new Tap range from Vado, 
further progress is expected in the new year.
The business now has 31 owned stores 
and two franchise stores. A new store 
was successfully opened in Southgate in 
May 2017 and there are plans to upgrade 
three further stores to the CX format in 
the coming year.

Revenue
Group revenue at £271.2m (2016: £235.9m) 
increased by 15.0% on a reported basis, 
10.6% on a constant currency basis, and 
4.1% on a constant currency like for like 
basis (excluding revenues from Abode 
entirely and Croydex for quarter one).
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 
11.7% to £23.8m (2016: £21.3m). Our UK 
businesses delivered underlying operating 
profit of £17.4m (2016: £17.2m), and our 
South African businesses generated an 
underlying operating profit of £6.4m 
(2016: £4.1m). On a constant currency 
basis the improvement in underlying 
operating profit in the South African 
businesses was £1.4m. Group underlying 
operating profit margin was 8.8% 
(2016: 9.0%).
IAS 19R administrative costs
These costs represent the costs incurred 
by the Trustee of administering the UK 
pension schemes and are reflected in the 
Income Statement under IAS 19R. During 
the year a restructuring of the Group’s UK 
pension scheme’s administrative functions 
took place with a view to streamlining 
activities and reducing ongoing costs. 
This resulted in a number of termination 
costs being incurred and meant that costs 
of £2.0m (2016: £1.7m) were higher than 
the prior year. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 19

In accordance with IFRS 3R, a proportion of deferred consideration payable to the former 
shareholders of recently acquired businesses is required to be treated as remuneration 
and, accordingly, is expensed to the Income Statement as incurred. Included in the 
amount for the year to 31 March 2016 is the final charge for deferred remuneration in 
connection with the Vado acquisition. Non‑ cash amortisation charges in respect of 
intangible assets increased by £0.3m following the acquisition of Croydex in June 2015 
and Abode in March 2016. Staff costs and advisory fees reduced by £0.7m in the year, 
which is mainly because no acquisitions were completed in the year compared to two 
in the previous year (Croydex and Abode).
Exceptional operating items
A net exceptional operating charge of £2.3m (2016: £2.3m credit) was recorded as 
analysed in the table below. These are items of expense or income which arose from 
transactions which occurred outside of the Group’s normal operations.

2.3 (2.3)
In order to improve operating performance 
and better align capacity with demand, 
the Group commenced a restructuring 
of its UK tiles business in March 2017. The 
re‑ organisation will increase manufacturing 
flexibility, reduce inventory and involve the 
loss of around 90 jobs and has resulted in 
a charge of £2.3m. The subsequent cash 
outflow will occur in the first half of the 
year to 31 March 2018. It is expected that 
the restructuring will pay back in cash 
terms within twelve months.
In 2016, a legal claim relating to the land at 
the Highgate site in Tunstall, UK, was settled. 
Under the terms of the settlement with 
Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc, the Group 
received a payment of £2.0m and costs in 
connection with the claim of £0.1m were 
incurred. In 2015, the Group undertook a 
number of liability management exercises 
in connection with its principal UK defined 
benefit pension scheme. Whilst most of 
the net benefit was recognised in 2015, 
a further £0.4m benefit arose in 2016.
Operating profit for the year was £16.8m 
(2016: £16.7m).
Net finance costs
Net finance costs for the year of £5.3m 
(2016: £1.3m) increased mainly due to the 
£3.4m non‑ cash change relating to the 
movement in the fair value of foreign 
exchange contracts. Bank interest payable 
of £0.9m (2016: £0.9m) was consistent 
with the previous year.
In addition, the Group has recognised a 
£2.0m interest cost in respect of the pension 
scheme liability (2016: £1.4m) which 
increased by £0.6m principally reflecting 
the increase in the opening pension deficit. 20 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Profit before tax
Underlying profit before tax was £22.9m (2016: £20.4m), reflecting the increased

Balance Sheet
The Group’s Balance Sheet is summarised below. The comparative Balance Sheet has 
been restated to reflect measurement period adjustments in respect of the acquisition 
of Abode, though this had no impact on overall net assets. Further details are provided 
in note 28 to the financial statements.

Property, plant and equipment 43.0 38.2
Goodwill and intangible assets 44.8 45.2
Deferred tax 11.0 10.0
Net current assets excluding cash and borrowings 53.0 48.7
Pension scheme liability (62.7) (55.7)
Other non‑ current assets and liabilities (9.3) (6.3)
Cash and borrowings (23.2) (32.5)
Net assets 56.6 47.6
Property, plant and equipment increased by £4.8m overall, and included additions of 
£7.9m (2016: £6.2m) but there were no acquisitions in the year (2016: £2.0m). The 
depreciation charge was £6.4m (2016: £5.5m) and exchange differences were £3.3m 
(2016: £2.0m). The disposals in the year had no impact on net book value (2016: £0.1m).
The deferred tax asset increased by £1.0m to £11.0m (2016: £10.0m). This was mainly 
due to the fact that the balance attributable to the pension scheme liability rose by 
£0.7m due to the increase in the size of the underlying deficit.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of £3.0m 
(2016: £2.4m) represents an effective tax 
rate for the year of 26.1% (2016: 15.5%). 
In the previous year a further restructuring 
of the financing of our South African 
operations crystallised the remaining 
foreign exchange losses on historic 
intra‑ Group loans which gave rise to a tax 
benefit in the UK which had not previously 
been recognised as a deferred tax asset. 
The effect of this was to reduce the tax 
charge in the year by £1.4m. Adjusting for 
this, the tax rate would have been 24.7% in 
2016. The effective rate in the current year 
of 26.1% was higher than the adjusted 
comparative rate of 24.7% mainly because 
a higher proportion of the Group’s taxable 
profits were generated in South Africa 
where the rate of tax is higher than the UK.
The standard rates of corporation tax in 
the UK and South Africa, were 20% and 
28% respectively, unchanged from 2016.
Dividends
As previously announced it is the Board’s 
intention to continue a progressive yet 
prudent dividend policy subject to the 
Group’s earnings, cash flow and Balance 
Sheet position. As such the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 4.8p 
(2016: 4.4p) per share, which, if approved, 
together with the interim dividend of 2.4p 
(2016: 2.2p), makes a total dividend of 7.2p 
(2016: 6.6p) in respect of the year ended 
31 March 2017.
This final dividend, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be payable 
on 3 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register on 23 June 2017. The shares will 
be quoted ex‑ dividend on 22 June 2017.
Pension schemes
The gross defined benefit pension scheme 
valuation on the UK scheme showed a 
deficit of £62.7m compared to a deficit 
of £55.7m last year. Whilst the value of 
scheme assets rose by £38.5m in the year 
on the back of improving equity markets, 
the value of the liabilities increased by 
£45.5m, which was mainly due to a lower 
discount rate of 2.60% (2016: 3.55%). Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 21

CASE STUDY – JOHNSON TILES
Prismatics and Refine 
help Harry Ramsden’s 
seaside‑ inspired 
interiors
THE CHALLENGE
Harry Ramsden’s, Blackpool, has long been an institution 
of the Lancashire seaside town – located on its busiest 
seafront thoroughfare. Naturally, when it came to 
updating its interiors, heritage and brand retention 
were at the forefront of design and build specialist, 
CDS Wilman’s brief.
THE SOLUTION
Serving up products from Johnson Tiles’ iconic 
Prismatics range, in Shark, Lagoon and Victorian Blue 
Gloss, laid in a herringbone pattern, alongside Refine 
in Pewter Grip – for style and safety – the design-led 
collections proved the perfect catch. Paired with fun 
interior elements, such as wooden benches and beach 
hut-style striped tables, the restaurant delivers 
authentic nautical chic.
THE RESULT
Combining practicality with style, the Prismatics and 
Refine ranges enhanced the interior scheme to fully 
complete the fun, family-friendly environment. 
The plan undertook a number of liability management 
exercises during 2015 which resulted in a number of 
benefits being settled and some changes to pension 
increases in payment. A number of further settlements 
took place as a result of that exercise in the previous 
year reducing the net deficit by £0.4m, which was 
reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement 
as an exceptional operating item.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for the 
Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme was 
completed in March 2015 and showed a deficit of 
£73.5m (2012: £61.9m) representing an 84% funding 
level (2012: 85%). The increased deficit was driven 
predominantly by historically low gilt yields. A revised 
deficit recovery plan was agreed with the Scheme 
Trustee, with a cash contribution of £2.5m per annum 
starting in April 2016, and increasing with CPI, replacing 
the previous agreement to pay £2.1m plus CPI per 
annum. This will be payable over the next ten years 
and thereby provides a greater degree of certainty 
around future deficit recovery contributions.
In line with the above agreement the Group made deficit 
recovery contributions of £2.5m (2016: £2.1m) into its 
UK defined benefit pension scheme during the year.
The Group’s contributions to its defined contribution 
pension schemes were £3.1m (2016: £2.7m). 22 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Group Finance Director’s report continued
Cash flow and net debt
Net debt reduced by £9.3m in the year to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m). A summary of the 
movement in net debt is shown below.
Underlying operating cash flow was £9.4m higher than in the prior year at £29.8m 
(2016: £20.4m), which was mainly due to an increase in underlying operating profit 
of £2.5m and a £5.9m lower outflow from working capital. The Group’s working capital 
outflow was £1.8m (2016: £7.7m), with the movement in the previous year reflecting 
investment in inventory to support growth in Vado, Croydex and South Africa. This 
represents cash conversion in the year of 98.7% of underlying EBITDA (2016: 76.1%).
Net cash generated from operating activities was £7.0m higher than the previous year 
at £25.5m, largely due to the £9.4m improvement in underlying operating cash flows 
offset by a £2.0m increase in outflows from exceptional items and acquisition related 
costs. This was mainly because the previous year included a £1.9m inflow from the 
resolution of the legal dispute with Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc.

Outflows relating to acquisitions include the final deferred consideration payment of 
£2.5m to the former shareholders of Vado and £0.2m paid in respect of the acquisition 
of Abode. In the previous year, the total of £23.6m comprised outflows of £19.3m and 
£3.1m in respect of the acquisitions of Croydex and Abode respectively, together with 
£1.2m paid to the former shareholders of Vado under the earn‑ out arrangement.
Capital expenditure at £8.0m (2016: £6.6m) included the new store at Southgate and other 
store upgrades, mainly at Randburg and Springfield together with plant improvements 
at TAL and Johnson Tiles South Africa. In the UK, major items of investment included 
the installation of new ink jet printing capability together with machinery to produce 
the new Cristalgrip product at Johnson Tiles and continued investment in tooling for 
new products at Vado and Triton.
Bank funding
In July 2014 the Group agreed an unsecured £70m revolving credit facility plus a £30m 
accordion facility with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. 
The banking facility matures in July 2019.

Profits from our overseas operations are 
translated at the average exchange rate for 
the year and the balance sheets of these

The movement in average exchange 
rates compared to 2016 had the effect of 
increasing 2016 reported Group revenue 
and Group underlying operating profit 
by £9.2m and £0.9m respectively.
Alternative performance measures
The Group employs a number of alternative 
performance measures to assess the 
performance of its operations. These should 
not be viewed as a replacement of, or 
superior to, those defined by Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 
Definitions of alternative performance 
measures and, where relevant, reconciliations 
from GAAP‑ defined reporting measures 
to the Group’s alternative performance 
measures are provided in note 8 to the

Key performance indicators
Management uses a full suite of measures 
to manage and monitor the performance 
of its individual businesses. The Board 
considers that its key performance indicators 
are the most relevant measures in terms 
of monitoring its progress towards creating 
shareholder value. The relevant statistics 
for 2017 and 2016 are shown opposite.

Identification and 
management of risks
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on the Group’s 
performance. The Group has procedures in place 
to identify and monitor risks at the appropriate 
level and ensure that suitable mitigating actions 
are developed and put in place where possible.
During the year the Board led a ground-up evaluation 
of the risks facing each individual business and the 
Group as a whole. This took the form of each business 
carrying out a detailed risk assessment, categorising 
the risks in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and 
potential impact. Each business risk assessment was 
reviewed and challenged by Executive Management, 
following which a Group-wide risk assessment was 
prepared and reviewed by the Board. Going forward 
the divisional risk assessments will be reviewed 
periodically throughout the year and a formal 
annual review will be undertaken at Board level.
Principal risks
The Directors confirm they have undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The table opposite sets out 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
at the date of this Annual Report and how they are 
being managed or mitigated. The principal risks do 
not comprise all the risks that the Group may face 
and they are not listed in any order of priority.

range in flower design.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a longer 
period than the twelve months required by the “going 
concern” provision. Taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the nature of the risks and uncertainties 
it faces, the Board has decided to assess the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 31 March 2020. 
The Board considers this period appropriate as it believes 
it is not possible to credibly forecast beyond this time 
horizon, it reviews annually a three-year strategic plan 
and it is also the period over which long-term incentives 
are set for Executive Directors and senior management. 
The Strategic Report section on pages 8 to 29 sets out 
the key details of the Group’s financial performance, 
capital management, business environment and outlook. 
The principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 25 
to 27 detail the principal risks the Group is exposed to, 
including foreign exchange, interest rate, credit and 
liquidity risk, together with the Group’s actions to 
mitigate its exposures to these risks. 
The strategic plan is built up by individual business, using 
the output of the annual budgeting process for year one 
and applying conservative general and business-specific 
assumptions to build years two and three. The Board 
considers the outputs from this plan, including the 
Group’s cash flows, headroom under existing financial 
facilities, dividend cover and other key financial ratios 
over the three-year period. The strategic plan is then 
subject to scenario testing and sensitivity analysis 
which involves flexing a number of the underlying 
main assumptions, both individually and in conjunction, 
together with mitigating actions that the Directors 
would consider undertaking. The Board then focused 
on an extreme but plausible scenario, similar to that 
encountered by the Group following the global financial 
crisis of 2008/9, and considered the impact on its 
financial performance after taking mitigating actions. 
Based on this assessment the Board believes that, 
taking into account its current position, the principal 
risks it faces, and the mitigating actions available to it, 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and to 
meet its liabilities as they fall due for the three-year 
period of their assessment. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 25

Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change
Loss of key customers
Whilst the Group has a 
diverse range of customers 
there are nevertheless 
certain key customers  
who account for high  
levels of revenue. 
Many of the contractual 
arrangements with customers 
are short term in nature  
(as is common in our 
markets) and there exists 
some risk that the current 
performance of a business 
may not be maintained if 
such contracts were not 
renewed or extended, or 
were maintained at lower 
volumes due to a decline 
in economic activity.
The importance of relationships with key customers 
is recognised and managed by senior personnel within 
the Group who have direct and regular access to their 
counterparts at the highest levels of management.
Rebate schemes and incentive programmes help 
maintain these key relationships in a competitive 
market situation.
The Group stresses key selling points such as continuity  
of supply, financial strength of the Group and the level 
of customer service to help maintain relationships.  
As well as an excellent product offering, the Group  
is also able to take care of customers’ sourcing, 
storage and logistics requirements.
No

Competition
The Group operates within 
a highly competitive 
environment in all 
its markets.
The Group recognises that 
there is a risk to its results 
and financial condition 
caused by the actions of 
its competitors, including 
competitors’ marketing 
strategies and new 
product development.
To help identify such risks, the competitive environment, 
the specific marketplace and the actions of particular 
competitors are discussed at both Group and operating 
divisional Board meetings. In addition, each market is 
carefully monitored to identify any significant shift in 
policy by any competitor, any change in the routes to 
market, or any indication of new competitors and/or 
new product technology entering the market.
No 
change
Reliance on 
production facilities
The Group has a number  
of manufacturing facilities 
for the manufacture of tiles 
and adhesives. 
If any of these facilities 
(including technology used 
to operate them) were to fail, 
the effect on the Group 
could be significant. 
The Group has a well‑ established ongoing preventative 
maintenance programme as well as a comprehensive 
“annual shutdown” programme throughout its 
manufacturing operations. 
Furthermore, the Group has developed an experienced 
globally co‑ ordinated product sourcing function 
which could mitigate the risk of failure. 
Finished inventory holdings across the operations act 
as a limited buffer in the event of operational failure. 
Disaster recovery plans are in place and a business 
interruption insurance policy is maintained to mitigate 
losses caused by a serious insurable event affecting 
manufacturing capability.
No 
change
Loss of key supplier, 
availability of raw materials/
components/energy, and 
supply chain failure
Raw materials, components 
and energy represent a 
significant proportion of the 
Group’s input costs. 
Availability of supply and 
product quality standards 
are key to minimising risk.
A lack of supply of raw 
materials such as clay or 
sand, components such as 
electronics or brassware, or 
gas or electricity could have 
significant impacts on the 
Group’s ability to manufacture 
product. The risk of energy 
supply interruption is an 
elevated risk in South Africa 
as its utility infrastructure is 
less well developed than in 
the UK. 
The Group manages the risk in its supply chain 
through long‑ term relationships with key suppliers, 
audits of key suppliers and dual supply of critical 
materials or components where considered 
appropriate, and by holding appropriate levels of 
stock. The Group maintains strict product quality 
standards and, in particular, has procurement and 
quality control resource in China to ensure these 
standards are adhered to.
The Group will also look to mitigate risks on energy 
supply. For example, in order to mitigate the risk of 
electricity outages in South Africa, the Group recently 
invested in a standby diesel generator at its main 
Olifantsfontein plant which is capable of running 
critical parts of the plant. 
No 
change
Staff retention and 
recruitment
The Group employs around 
2,000 people worldwide. 
The Group’s ability to grow 
and increase its market share 
depends significantly on its 
continuing ability to recruit 
and retain highly skilled 
employees in each area of its 
activities. Future growth plans 
may be restricted or delayed 
by difficulties experienced in 
recruiting and retaining 
appropriate staff.
Group policy is to remunerate its personnel in line with 
market rates and practice. In addition to competitive 
salaries there are annual bonus schemes, share 
options and other benefits offered.
Executives and key management are incentivised via 
an Approved Performance Share Plan (APSP) which 
was approved at the 2011 AGM. A grant of options 
under the APSP has taken place annually since 2011. 
The Group is able to offer employees appropriate 
training and opportunities for advancement and has 
a demonstrable track record of internal promotion.

Interest rate risk
The Group pays interest  
and other facility fees based 
on local base rates and 
LIBOR rates.
A significant increase in 
interest rates would affect 
the Group’s profitability 
and cash flow.
The Group’s interest rate risk is reviewed regularly by 
Executive Management and at least annually as part of 
the Group budget process, and where considered 
appropriate the Group will enter into hedging 
arrangements. Given the current low level of interest 
rates, it is not considered advantageous to enter into 
hedging arrangements at the current time.

Performance against 
banking covenants
The Group is subject to  
key banking covenants 
including interest cover  
and debt cover.

Performance against banking covenants is regularly

Part of the Group’s strategy 
is to grow through selective 
acquisitions.
Performance of acquired 
businesses may not reach 
expectations impacting 
Group profitability and 
cash flows.
The Group has detailed target appraisal procedures in 
place, including appropriate due diligence, and has 
senior management experienced in M&A work. The 
Group also has robust Board approval procedures in 
place to ensure independent review of proposals. 
Integration plans are finalised prior to acquisition 
so that newly acquired businesses are integrated 
efficiently and swiftly after acquisition. The acquisitions 
of Vado, Croydex and most recently Abode provide 
demonstrable evidence of the Group’s ability to 
integrate new businesses.

Market conditions
Demand in our markets 
is dependent on new 
building activity and 
repair, maintenance 
and improvement (RMI) 
activity in both the public 
and private sectors. This 
is in turn influenced by 
macroeconomic factors, 
consumer confidence 
and government spending 
policy. The uncertainty 
caused by the UK’s vote 
to leave the European  
Union and the resultant 
depreciation of Sterling  
has led to increased 
inflationary pressures.
In South Africa, the 
country’s government debt 
has recently been lowered 
to non‑ investment grade 
status by certain credit 
rating agencies.
If market conditions 
unexpectedly deteriorated, 
demand for our products 
would reduce, impacting 
profitability and 
cash generation.
There are a number of factors that would limit the 
impact on the Group of a deterioration in market 
conditions such as the geographic spread of our 
businesses, a flexible cost base and supply chain, 
and the replacement cycle of a number of our 
key products. 
On an ongoing basis, actions are taken to ensure that 
the Group has the time and ability to react to unexpected 
changes in demand, such as maintaining appropriate 
headroom against its borrowing facilities and covenants, 
maintaining strong controls on working capital and 
capital expenditure, and having disciplined planning, 
budgeting and forecasting processes.
In previous cyclical downturns, management has 
proved effective in responding to such events, and 
it continues to have similar measures available to 
minimise the effects on profitability and cash 
generation should the need arise.

Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change
Foreign currency 
exchange risk
The Group’s financial 
performance is subject to 
the effects of fluctuations  
in foreign exchange rates. 
In particular, the Group 
sources a significant 
proportion of its components 
and goods for resale from 
Europe and the Far East 
which are denominated in 
foreign currencies (primarily 
the US Dollar and the Euro). 
Such currencies have 
strengthened relative to 
Sterling over the past year 
following the UK’s vote to 
leave the European Union.
Should Sterling or the  
South African Rand weaken 
against the major currencies 
this could result in an increase 
in future input costs.
The Group typically seeks to hedge its foreign exchange 
transactional flows for up to twelve months forward, 
which largely removes the effects of day to day 
exchange rate volatility on our businesses.
Regular monitoring of exchange rates and market 
conditions, together with frequent dialogue with 
suppliers allows our businesses time to negotiate 
revised commercial terms with customers to mitigate 
the impact of longer‑ term changes in exchange rates.
The Group may, where it is considered appropriate, 
denominate some of its borrowings in other 
currencies to hedge translational asset risk.
Increased
Pension scheme 
management
The Group has a defined 
benefit pension scheme 
with 7,600 members and 
liabilities of £467m and 
assets of £404m. Corporate 
bond and gilt yields are at 
historically low levels.
Triennial valuations are 
undertaken every three 
years after which recovery 
plans are agreed between 
the scheme Trustee and 
the Company. The next 
valuation is due in 
March 2018.
The Group’s financial results 
show an aggregate deficit  
in this scheme, as at  
31 March 2017, of £62.7m 
(2016: £55.7m) assessed 
in accordance with IAS 19 
(revised). There are various 
risks that could adversely 
affect the funding of the 
defined benefits under the 
scheme and consequently the 
Group’s funding obligations.
The scheme was closed to new members and future 
accrual with effect from 1 April 2013 and replaced by an 
auto‑ enrolment compliant defined contribution scheme. 
Risks from rising costs of providing a final salary pension 
scheme have therefore been materially reduced.
Executive Management regularly monitors the funding 
position of the scheme and is represented on both the 
Trustee’s board and its investment sub‑ committee to 
monitor and assess investment performance and 
other risks to the Group.
The Group considers each valuation (annual IAS 19R 
valuation and each triennial valuation) and reassesses 
its position with regard to its pension commitments in 
conjunction with external actuarial advice. The triennial 
valuation and recovery plan for March 2015 was agreed 
with the Scheme Trustee and provides certainty over 
deficit contributions for the next year.
Increased
Reliance on information 
technology
The Group relies heavily on 
IT systems to carry on its 
business. The increased 
prevalence and sophistication 
of cyber‑crime incidents 
has increased the threat 
to all businesses and 
organisations across 
the globe.
A major failure of systems 
or a cyber attack could result 
in a temporary inability to 
conduct operations or a loss 
of commercial or customer 
data. Such an incident may 
impact sales and profits and 
result in reputational damage 
to the Group.
The Group uses modern systems and ensures that they 
are adequately maintained and upgraded to mitigate 
the risk of failure. 
The latest network and security protocols are deployed, 
which are regularly updated, to protect against cyber 
attack or breaches of security. 
The Group provides regular updates to employees 
to raise awareness of the risk of cyber‑ attack. It has 
also undertaken a review during the year to improve 
IT controls and is appointing a new Head of Internal 
Audit to continue to help drive further improvements 
in this critical area.

Uncertainty surrounding 
Brexit
Negotiations have recently 
begun to agree the terms  
of the UK’s exit from the 
European Union. There is 
uncertainty around how 
this will potentially impact 
the Group’s operations and 
what the ramifications will 
be in the markets in which 
the Group carries on 
its business.
Changes in the way goods 
are imported into and 
exported from the UK may 
result in higher tariffs and 
other cost increases.
Economic uncertainty may 
impact input costs, consumer 
confidence and demand for 
the Group’s products.
The Group regularly monitors the markets and 
economic indicators in which it trades and is experienced 
in implementing appropriate mitigating actions.
The Group has strong relationships with technical 
specialists and regularly liaises with them to ensure that 
the Group is well placed to react to legislative or other 
changes which occur as a result of Brexit.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability
The Board promotes the success of Norcros for the 
benefit of its shareholders as a whole. In doing this, the 
Board takes regular account of many things, including 
the interests of all employees, the importance of positive 
relationships with suppliers and customers and the 
significance of environmental, ethical and social factors 
affecting the Group. We recognise that management 
of these matters is key to ensuring the long‑ term 
sustainability of our businesses.
Employees
The importance of good relations with all 
employees is well recognised and accepted 
throughout the Group. The Group is fully 
committed to keeping its employees 
informed about their work unit and the 
wider business, but because the Group’s 
activities are generally organised on a 
de‑ centralised basis, with each operating 
business having a reasonable degree of 
autonomy over its operations, there is no 
uniform set of arrangements for employee 
involvement imposed throughout the 
Group. Nevertheless, all businesses in the 
Group are strongly encouraged to devise 
and adopt whatever means of employee 
consultation best suits their circumstances. 
We believe this approach provides flexibility 
and enables divisional management to tailor 
their approach to employee engagement 
to the needs of their particular business.
Across Norcros, great emphasis is placed on 
the recruitment, training and development 
of our people. All businesses have training 
programmes for staff, and we have examples 
of best practice regarding management 
development. Norcros also recognises 
the need to train its staff in order to give 
them the necessary skills to perform their 
duties to the high standards required. 
For example, over the course of the last 
financial year, Triton has continued to invest 
in apprenticeship programmes offering 
positions for school leavers within its busy 
administration and technical departments. 
A number of spaces are available annually 
to young people who want to learn on the 
job and are keen to join one of the region’s 
largest employers. In the year, Triton 
employed five apprentices and there are 
now around 16 full‑ time staff members 
who have joined the business in this way. 
Each has become an expert in their field 
and an asset to the Company, due to the 
high level of support provided. 
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
towards disabled persons and therefore all 
applications from such persons are fully 
and fairly considered bearing in mind the 
respective aptitudes and abilities of the 
applicant. In the event of existing employees 
becoming disabled, every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment with 
the Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged. It is the policy of 
the Group that the training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of an able‑ bodied person.
Our people are key to our success as a 
business and we value the individuality 
and diversity that each employee brings. 
Prior to any senior appointment, the 
Nominations Committee ensures the best 
person for the role is appointed and in 
doing so gives due consideration to 
gender and diversity.
At senior leadership levels 23.8% of 
employees are female.
Business partners
We seek to create and maintain long‑ term 
relationships with our key suppliers, and 
often work together with suppliers and 
customers to develop new products and 
improve existing ones.
Human rights
The Directors do not consider human 
rights to be a material risk for the Group, 
principally due to the existing regulatory 
frameworks in place in the UK and South 
Africa, being the primary geographical 
locations in which we operate. In South 
Africa, the business is cognisant of its 
responsibilities under the Broad‑ Based 
Black Economic Empowerment legislation.
The Group has its Modern Slavery Act 
statement, and a policy in support of this, 
but does not at the present time have 
general policies which specifically address 
human rights. Our corporate values focus 
on respect, integrity and fairness, and we 
welcome the debate on the role of 
business in promoting human rights.
The environment
Care for the environment and sustainability 
are at the forefront of all our activities and 
products. The Board recognises that the 
Group’s activities do have an impact on 
the environment. We seek to manufacture 
all our products in a sustainable way, and 
many of the products themselves contain 
environmental features – for example, our 
taps and showers encourage water and 
energy saving and our tiles and adhesives 
use recycled products where appropriate. 
Norcros is committed to minimising 
this impact by continually improving its 
efficiency in terms of energy, water and 
material consumption. We also have 
rigorous programmes to seek to ensure 
compliance with all environmental 
legislation and requirements relating 
to our operations and our products.
The Group aims to minimise its carbon 
footprint. Its greenhouse gas emissions are 
reported on in detail on page 60. We are 
pleased to report that there has been a 
reduction in overall emissions compared 
to last year, notwithstanding the overall 
growth in the activities of the Group. 
Relative to revenue, emissions have fallen  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 29
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
by 14.6% year on year. We are cognisant 
of our obligations in the UK as regards 
the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme 
initiative, and we were fully compliant with 
this in the financial year under review.
For further information on Norcros’ 
commitment to the environment 
and sustainability please visit the 
“Corporate Responsibility” section  
of www.norcros.com.
Ethics
The Group aims to act with integrity 
towards all stakeholders in its businesses 
and respects the laws, regulations and 
customs in all the countries within which it 
operates. The Group makes every effort to 
ensure its employees are aware of, and 
comply with, the relevant business’ 
ethical code.
The Group has implemented an anti‑ bribery 
policy to comply with the Bribery Act 2010. 
Appropriate procedures are in place at each 
location to mitigate the risk of any employee 
committing an offence under this Act. 
Specific anti‑ bribery and corruption training 
has continued to be given to all senior 
management in the year under review.
We have published a Modern Slavery Act 
statement, which emphasises the Group’s 
commitment to the eradication of slavery 
and human trafficking, both within Norcros 
and in its supply chains.
In order to ensure an open culture of legal 
and ethical compliance, all of the businesses 
in the Group have in place “whistleblowing” 
procedures, so that any concerns can be 
raised. During the year the Audit Committee 
has reviewed these arrangements and is 
satisfied that all staff of the Group may, 
in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties.

Social
Our commitment to the society in which 
we operate is deep. Every Group business 
has programmes of social engagement, 
including many charitable activities. Each 
business has a track record of supporting 
local and national charities and other 
voluntary sector organisations. Given our 
de‑ centralised structure, business units 
in the Group are encouraged to become 
involved in and support local initiatives 
where possible. The Executive Management 
of the Group supports this commitment 
to our society, and reviews each business’ 
activities on a monthly basis.
Two specific examples of our commitment 
to the society in which we operate are given 
in the case study for Norcros South Africa 
on page 17, and at Triton where their close 
relationship with not‑ for‑ profit organisation, 
Dare2Dream (D2D), has resulted in the 
appointment of a new trainee. Since its 
formation in July 2014, D2D has grown 
rapidly and continued to evolve thanks 
to ongoing sponsorship from Triton. The 
core aim for every joint project is to raise 
aspirations and broaden the horizons of 
young adults in Warwickshire and the 
West Midlands. A recent D2D initiative, 
Aspire2Achieve, was facilitated by Triton 
to assist 16–18 year olds to secure further 
education or apprenticeship opportunities. 
The collaboration included a tour of Triton’s 
headquarters, providing first‑ hand experience 
of a professional environment, plus advice 
on CV writing and job interview techniques. 
Alongside well‑ established links with D2D, 
Triton is a firm supporter of other charities 
in the Nuneaton area too. Wider activities 
have included a three‑ year partnership 
with Warwickshire Young Carers’ Project, 
which assists those who play a key role in 
their home by looking after a parent or 
sibling with a disability, illness or mental 
health problem.

RE-ELECTION OF ALL DIRECTORS
It is proposed that each Director will seek re-election at the 2017 AGM. The Board is satisfied that the Directors, individually 
and collectively, contain the balance of technical expertise, skills and experience to manage the Company’s affairs and to further 
the Group’s strategic objectives. In particular, each Director has experience of growing an international business, organically, 
as well as by acquisition. 32 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Board of Directors
The Board is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate 
governance are maintained by Norcros plc and is accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. 
Its policy is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance 
with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code referred 
to in the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. For the year 
under review, the Company has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in September 2014 (the Code) in all 
respects. The following sections of this statement describe the 
Board’s approach to corporate governance and how the principles 
of the Code are applied. These sections refer to the year ended 
31 March 2017, unless otherwise stated.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises a Non-executive Chairman, two 
Non-executive Directors and two Executive Directors, who are 
equally responsible for the proper stewardship and leadership 
of the Company. The Directors holding office at the date of this 
report and their biographical details are given on pages 30 and 31. 
During the year under review there was a brief period of overlap 
between the outgoing and incoming Group Finance Directors, 
to ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities. Accordingly, 
for a period of six weeks there were three Executive Directors 
holding office.
Taking into account the provisions of the Code, the Chairman 
and the two Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board 
to be independent of the Company’s Executive Management and 
free from any business or other relationship that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Chairman and 
the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company. The letters of appointment set 
out the expected time commitment. Other significant commitments 
of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors are disclosed to 
the Board on a regular basis throughout the year. The Board is 
satisfied that the Chairman’s other significant commitments do 
not prevent him from devoting sufficient time to the Company.
David McKeith is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director. 
He is available to shareholders if they have any issues or concerns 
which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Group 
Chief Executive or Group Finance Director has failed to address 
or resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate.

standards of corporate governance.

CHAIRMAN’S 
INTRODUCTION 
TO GOVERNANCE
For the year under review the Company has complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
carried out a thorough evaluation of Board performance 
and it is satisfactory.

All Directors are supplied, in a timely manner, with all relevant 
documentation and financial information to assist them in the 
discharge of their duties by the making of well informed decisions 
that are in the best interests of the Company as a whole. The Board 
regularly reviews the management and financial performance of 
the Company, as well as long-term strategic planning and risk 
assessment. Regular reports are given to the Board on matters 
such as pensions, health and safety, and litigation.
Any concerns that a Director may have about how the Group 
is being run or about a course of action being proposed by the 
Board will, if they cannot be resolved once those concerns 
have been brought to the attention of the other Directors and 
the Chairman, be recorded in the Board minutes. In the event 
of the resignation of a Non-executive Director, that Director is 
encouraged to send a written statement setting out the reasons 
for the resignation to the Chairman who will then circulate it to 
the other members of the Board and the Company Secretary.
Chairman and Group Chief Executive
The positions of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are held 
by separate individuals and the Board has clearly defined their 
responsibilities. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the 
effective working of the Board, ensuring that each Director, 
particularly the Non-executive Directors, is able to make 
an effective contribution. The Group Chief Executive has 
responsibility for running the Group’s businesses and for the 
implementation of the Board’s strategy, policies and decisions.
Board, Committee and Director evaluation
The performance of the Board is appraised by the Chairman. 
The Executive and Non-executive Directors are evaluated individually 
by the Chairman. The Board, led by the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director, appraises the Chairman, and the Board 
evaluates the performance of its three Committees. Evaluation 
processes are conducted periodically and they are organised 
to fit in with Board priorities and succession planning activity. 
A formal evaluation took place in the year under review in 
accordance with the requirements of the Code. This evaluation 
was conducted by means of detailed questionnaires, the results 
of which were then considered as appropriate, combined with 
meetings and discussions. The Chairman is responsible for the 
review of each Director’s development and ongoing training 
requirements to ensure that the performance of each Director 
continues to be effective.
Advice for Directors
Procedures have been adopted for the Directors to obtain access 
through the Company Secretary to independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense, where that Director judges 
it necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities as a 
Director of the Company.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board 
policies and procedures are complied with. Both the appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary are matters reserved for 
decision by the Board.
Board procedures
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved 
to it for decision which it reviews periodically. This ensures the 
Board takes all major strategy, policy and investment decisions 
affecting the Company. In addition, it is responsible for business 
planning and risk management policies and the development of 
policies for areas such as safety, health and environmental policies, 
Directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration and ethical issues. 
The Board provides direction to the management of the Company, 
and it is ultimately accountable for the performance of the Group.
The Board operates in such a way as to ensure that all decisions 
are made by the most appropriate people in a timely manner that 
will not unnecessarily delay progress. The Board has formally 
delegated specific responsibilities to Board Committees, namely 
the Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and Remuneration 
Committee. The Terms of Reference of those Committees are 
published on the Company’s website at www.norcros.com.
The report of the Audit Committee is on page 36, the report of 
the Nominations Committee is on page 41 and the report of 
the Remuneration Committee is on page 42.
The Board will also appoint committees to approve specific 
processes as deemed necessary.
The Directors and management teams of each Group company 
are responsible for those business entities. They are tasked with 
the delivery of targets approved by the Board on budgets, 
strategy and policy.

Directors’ roles
The Executive Directors work solely for the Group. However, in 
appropriate circumstances, Executive Directors will be encouraged 
to take on one non-executive directorship in another non-competing 
company or organisation. The Group Chief Executive has no 
non-executive directorships and the Group Finance Director is 
a non-executive director of Air Partner plc. This non-executive 
role provides useful experience and does not adversely impact 
his duties to the Company.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-executive 
Directors are available upon written request from the Company. 
All the Non-executive Directors confirm that they have sufficient 
time to meet the requirements of their role. They also confirm to 
disclose to the Company their other commitments and to give an 
indication of the time involved in each such commitment.
The annual evaluation process includes an assessment of whether 
the Non-executive Director is spending enough time to fulfil his/her 
duties. If a Non-executive Director is offered an appointment 
elsewhere, the Chairman is informed before any such offer is 
accepted and the Chairman will subsequently inform the Board.
The Board has suitable procedures in place for ensuring that its 
powers to authorise conflict situations are operated effectively. 
Such powers are operated in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association by means of each Director having a 
responsibility to notify the Board of any conflict situation 
and for the Board to deal with that situation as appropriate.
The Board ensures that all new Directors (including Non-executive 
Directors) will receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Company. As part of that induction procedure, the Chairman 
will offer to major shareholders the opportunity to meet a new 
Non-executive Director. The Chairman also periodically assesses 
the training and development needs of all Directors and ensures 
that any suitable training and updates are provided to Directors.
Retirement by rotation
Each of the Directors is subject to election by shareholders at the 
first Annual General Meeting after their appointment. Thereafter, 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all of 
the Directors are subject to retirement by rotation such that one 
third of the Directors retire from the Board each year and each 
Director must seek re-election at intervals of no more than three 
years. However, the Board has decided that every Director should, 
where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting. Accordingly, each continuing Director will seek 
re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. Biographical details 
of all of the Directors are set out on pages 30 and 31, where there 
is also a statement on the Directors’ suitability for re-election. 
Financial reporting
When releasing the annual and interim financial statements the 
Directors aim to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s results and prospects. The Directors 
have a collective responsibility for the preparation of the Annual 
Report and Accounts which is more fully explained in the

Relations with shareholders
The Company recognises the importance of maintaining good 
communications with shareholders. The Company takes a 
number of steps to ensure that the Board and, in particular, 
the Non-executive Directors develop an understanding of the 
views of major shareholders about the Company. Directors have 
regular meetings with the Company’s major shareholders and 
have regular feedback on the views of those shareholders 
through the Company’s broker. Reports of these meetings, 
and any shareholder communications during the year, are given 
to the Board. In addition, the Company publishes any significant 
events affecting the Group and updates on current trading. 
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are also offered 
the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders 
and the Non-executive Directors, and in particular the Senior 
Independent Director, would attend such meetings if requested 
to do so by any major shareholder.
The Board regularly receives copies of analysts’ and brokers’ 
briefings. The Annual and Interim Reports, together with all 
announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange, are 
published on the Company’s website at www.norcros.com.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the meeting. It is the Company’s 
practice to propose separate resolutions on each substantially 
separate issue.
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms should provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote either for 
or against the resolution or to withhold their vote. The Company 
ensures that all valid proxy appointments received for general 
meetings are properly recorded and counted. For each resolution 
the Company ensures that the following information is given at the 
meeting and made available as soon as reasonably practicable on 
a website which is maintained by or on behalf of the Company:
 — the date of the meeting;
 — the text of the resolution;
 — the number of votes validly cast; Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 35
 — the proportion of the Company’s issued share capital 
represented by those votes;
 — the number of votes cast in favour of the resolution;
 — the number of votes against the resolution; and
 — the number of shares in respect of which the vote was withheld.
The Chairman seeks to arrange for the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees (or a deputy 
if any of them is unavoidably absent) to be available at the 
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions relating 
to the work of these Committees.
Accountability and audit 
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and auditor in 
connection with the financial statements are explained in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 61 and the 
auditor’s report on page 62. The Directors ensure the independence 
of the auditor by requesting annual confirmation of independence 
which includes the disclosure of all non-audit fees.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness (covering all material controls 
including financial, operational, risk management and compliance). 
This is undertaken via an annual programme to review the internal 
control environment at each business unit. Each review is carried 
out by senior finance staff independent of that business unit. The 
results of these reviews are communicated to the Audit Committee.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment in order to identify 
and evaluate what it considers to be the principal risks faced by 
the Group and has also assessed the adequacy of the actions 
taken to manage these risks. This process has been in place for 
the period under review and up to the date of the approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The principal risks are disclosed on 
pages 24 to 27.
The Group’s insurance continues to be managed and co-ordinated 
centrally with the assistance of insurance brokers. This gives the 
Group full visibility of both claims history and the insurance industry’s 
perception of the Group’s overall risk via the respective insurance 
premiums. The Company examines the size and trend of these 
premiums and the extent to which it can mitigate the risk and 
reduce the overall risk burden in the business by considering 
the appropriate level of insurance deductible and the potential 
benefit of self-insurance in some areas.
Viability
In accordance with the Code, the Board has assessed the prospects 
of the Company, using a three-year assessment timescale, and 
concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to meet its liabilities and continue in operation. 
The full viability statement is contained on page 24.
Operational structure, review and compliance
In addition to the Group Finance Director, the Group has Senior 
Financial Managers at its Head Office. The Board has considered 
whether the Company should have an internal audit department, 
having regard to the Group’s risk management and internal control 
programme noted previously, together with the size and complexity 
of the Group. In the year under review the Board’s view was that 
it was not necessary to employ such a department. However, the 
Board has continued to keep this matter under review and near 
the conclusion of the 2017 financial year the Board has decided 
to seek the creation of a Head of Internal Audit role and the 
employment of the appropriate resource.
The key elements of the controls framework within which 
the Group operates are:
 — an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements;
 — an embedded culture of openness of communication between 
operational management and the Company’s Executive 
Management on matters relating to risk and control;
 — defined expenditure authorisation levels; and
 — a comprehensive system of financial reporting. An annual budget 
for each business unit is prepared in detail and approved by the 
Group Executive Management. The Board approves the overall 
Group’s budget and plans. Monthly actual results are reported 
against budget and the prior year and the forecast for the year 
is revised where necessary. Any significant changes and adverse 
variances are questioned by the Board and remedial action 
is taken where appropriate. There is weekly cash and treasury 
reporting to the Group Finance Director and periodic reporting 
to the Board on the Group’s tax and treasury position.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The control framework as outlined above gives reasonable 
assurance that the structure of controls in operation is 
appropriate to the Group’s situation and that risk is kept to 
acceptable levels throughout the Group.

Members
The Committee consists of all the Non-executive Directors 
including the Chairman. Biographies of the members of the 
Committee appear on pages 30 and 31.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee, David McKeith, is considered 
to have recent and relevant financial experience as he is a fellow 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 
and a former senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
He also acted as chairman of the audit committee for Sportech plc, 
where he was a non-executive director until he resigned from 
that position in August 2016.
The Board is satisfied that the Committee has the appropriate 
level of expertise to fulfil its Terms of Reference. Additionally, 
an appraisal of the Committee was undertaken as part of an 
evaluation of the entire Board in the year ended 31 March 2017 
which concluded that the Committee is operating effectively.

Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 37
The Committee concluded 
that the 31 March 2017 
Annual Report and 
Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable.”
The Committee’s Terms of Reference, which are in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, were reviewed during the year 
and, subject to minor amendment, deemed fit for purpose. A copy 
can be obtained from the Company’s website, www.norcros.com.
Significant financial reporting matters in the 2017 Annual Report
The significant financial reporting matters that the Committee 
considered in the year are detailed below:
Accounting for customer rebates and other trade 
promotional spend
As part of its trading activities and in accordance with industry 
norms, a number of the Group’s customers are offered rebates 
and promotional incentives in order to encourage trade and cement 
strong relationships. Rebates and promotional spend are recognised 
as a deduction from revenue over the period of the agreement 
with the customer. Accounting for such arrangements involves 
judgment as agreement periods typically run for a number of 
months or years, and may involve assumptions around volumes 
of product purchased or sold into the future. 
The Committee considered the approach taken by management 
and the detailed testing undertaken by the external auditor and 
concluded that the commercial substance of the arrangements 
was appropriately reflected in the financial statements and in 
accordance with accounting standards.
Defined benefit pension plan liabilities
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme is significant both 
in terms of its context in the overall Balance Sheet and the results 
of the Group, particularly given that the net deficit has increased 
from £55.7m in 2016 to £62.7m in 2017. The valuation of the 
present value of scheme liabilities involves significant judgment 
and expertise particularly in respect of the assumptions used.
In order to value the liabilities, management had engaged an 
independent firm of qualified actuaries. The Committee reviewed 
the outputs from this work and benchmarked the assumptions, 
particularly the net discount rate, with those applied by other 
companies with defined benefit pension schemes with similar 
characteristics and having the same measurement date. The 
Committee concurred with the assumptions put forward by 
management to value the liability.
Valuation of acquired Abode intangible assets
As part of their consideration of how the Group has accounted for 
the acquisition of Abode, the Committee reviewed management’s 
assessment of Abode’s intangible assets. The Committee has recent 
experience of reviewing intangible assets following the acquisitions 
of Vado in 2013 and Croydex in 2015. The Committee reviewed 
management’s paper and challenged the assumptions used, the 
nature of the assets identified and the proposed useful lives of each 
asset, and agreed to recognise intangible assets in respect of Abode’s 
customer relationships, brand and patents valued at £7.9m.
In conducting these reviews, the Committee considered the work and 
recommendations of the Company’s finance function and received 
reports from the Company’s external auditor on its findings.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee formally reviews the Company’s annual and interim 
financial statements and associated announcements, and considers 
significant accounting principles, policies and practices and their 
appropriateness, financial reporting issues and significant judgments 
made, including those summarised above. 
The Committee also advises the Board on whether it considers 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s financial 
position and performance, strategy and business model.
The Committee concluded that these disclosures, and the 
processes and controls underlying their production, meet the 
latest legal and regulatory requirements for a listed company 
and that the 31 March 2017 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable.  38 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Meetings of the Committee
The Committee met formally three times during the year ended 31 March 2017. By invitation, the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary and Group Financial Controller also attended each of these meetings together with the engagement 
partner and other members of the audit team from the external auditor. 
The Committee may invite other individuals either from within the Company or external technical advisers to attend meetings 
to provide information or advice as it sees fit.
At each meeting the Committee had the opportunity to discuss matters with the external auditor without management being present. 
The Chairman of the Committee also has regular discussions with the external audit partner outside of the formal Committee process. 
The Committee reviews any financial communications issued to the market at each meeting.

Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal 
control systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the 
Group and to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. Such systems can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The strategy for reviewing internal controls is discussed with the 
external auditor and agreed with the Committee. Findings from 
the internal audit reviews together with any recommendations 
from the external auditor are considered by the Committee with 
improvements and weaknesses highlighted being followed up as 
appropriate. The status of internal audit recommendations is also 
reviewed at each divisional board meeting to ensure that they are 
implemented on a timely basis.
The Committee undertakes a review, at least annually, of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls 
and the Board will take into account the Committee’s report, 
conclusions and recommendations in this regard. The Board 
confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal 
control system, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, for the period from 1 April 2016 
to the date of approval of these Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The significant risks facing the Company, together with the actions 
taken to mitigate them, are highlighted on pages 24 to 27 of the 
Strategic Report. Lower-level risks are discussed at monthly divisional 
management meetings and highlighted to the Board as appropriate.
The Company operates a robust monthly financial reporting and 
forecasting process and an annual budgeting cycle. This incorporates 
several levels of management review to provide assurance that 
the data is reconciled to the underlying records and each month’s 
performance and the annual budget is ultimately approved by 
the Board.
Transaction-level financial reporting risks are identified and 
managed by each business within the Group completing an 
annual self-assessment questionnaire, the responses to which 
are considered during the internal control reviews. To bolster 
this, a management representation process is in place requiring 
each division to confirm that all known material facts have 
been appropriately communicated to the Executive Directors.
Internal audit framework
Although during the current year there was no dedicated Group-wide 
internal audit resource, internal control work is performed by 
members of the Group finance function who are appropriately 
qualified to undertake this type of work. Additionally, due to the 
particular risks faced by the Group’s retail and satellite manufacturing 
operations in South Africa, the Group employs a dedicated internal 
auditor based in South Africa focused on those risks. The work 
undertaken principally involves performing a cycle of Tile Africa 
store audits to ensure standard operating procedures are being 
followed and conducting internal control reviews of the satellite 
manufacturing facilities in South Africa operated by the Group.
During the year, the Committee considered, as it does at 
least annually, whether there was a need to have a dedicated 
Group-wide internal audit function. It was concluded that given 
the increase in the size and complexity of the Group, coupled 
with the Group’s publicised strategy of seeking further acquisitions, 
it was now appropriate to create such a function. As a result of 
this decision, a suitable candidate to lead the function has been 
identified and is expected to commence employment with the 
Group in the new financial year.
Internal audit activities during the year
During the course of the year seven internal audit reviews took place 
at four operating units in the UK and three in South Africa. Each 
review comprised an assessment of balance sheet reconciliations 
together with an evaluation of certain specific areas of focus. 
Following the identification of accounting for customer rebates 
as a significant audit risk for the Group, this was one of the areas 
selected for specific evaluation, and included an assessment of 
how such rebates were being accounted for to ensure that the 
assumptions used were reasonable. Additionally, each review also 
included consideration of employee incentive arrangements.
The findings from each review were presented to the Committee, 
with an update regarding the status of the recommendations 
given once follow-up visits had taken place.
In addition to the above, there was a focus during the year on 
IT security, and a specialist in this area was seconded to the internal 
audit function from one of the Group’s operating units in order to 
provide the appropriate level of resource. At the Committee’s request, 
the specialist attended one of the Committee meetings and gave 
a presentation on the proposed approach to the assignment. 
Subsequent updates on progress were provided to the Committee 
together with the status of the recommendations made.
Fraud and whistleblowing
The Committee receives regular papers on incidences of fraud 
and whistleblowing and reviews them at each meeting. At least 
annually, the Committee conducts an assessment of the adequacy 
of the Group’s procedures in respect of compliance, whistleblowing 
and fraud.
During the year, a suspected financial malpractice was identified 
by management at one of the Group’s operating units. The expected 
financial impact of this is not material and has been provided 
for in the result for the year. The Committee was provided with 
regular updates outside of the formal meetings and was consequently 
able to contribute on a real-time basis into the process of investigating 
the incident. At the conclusion of the internal investigation, the 
Committee reviewed management’s plan to address the risk of 
recurrence and the recommendations identified as part of the 
review. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation 
as the plan is implemented during the year. 40 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
External auditor
The Committee has primary responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditor. 
The Committee keeps under review the scope and results 
of the audit and its effectiveness, as well as the independence 
and objectivity of the auditor.
The external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, was 
re-appointed in November 2011 following a competitive tender 
process. The timing of a competitive tender will continue to be 
assessed on an annual basis, considering the results of the annual 
effectiveness review. The Committee has, however, committed 
to conducting a tender process for the role of external auditor 
at least every ten years in line with current legislation, meaning 
that the next tender must take place in 2021 at the latest.
The Committee is aware of the need to safeguard the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence and the issue is discussed by the 
Committee and periodically with the audit engagement partner 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In accordance with Auditing 
Practices Board requirements, external auditor independence 
is maintained by the rotation of the engagement partner every 
five years. In line with this requirement, Martin Heath, who had 
been in place as engagement partner, stepped down at the end 
of the 2016 audit. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP duly appointed 
Hazel Macnamara as his successor and in order to ensure a 
smooth transition she attended the presentation given by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the conclusion of the 2016 audit.
Policies on the award of non-audit work to the external auditor and 
the employment of ex-employees of the external auditor are in 
place which are reviewed annually. During the year, the Company 
updated its policy on the award of non-audit work to the external 
auditor in response to the Ethical Standards for Auditors published 
by the Financial Reporting Council. Under this policy, the external 
auditor is precluded from engaging in non-audit services that are 
prohibited by the Ethical Standards for Auditors, or that would 
compromise its independence or violate any laws or regulations 
affecting its appointment as external auditor. As a result of the 
policy being updated, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has ceased 
to provide tax advice and tax compliance services to the Group. 
Additionally, the approval of the Chairman of the Committee is 
required prior to awarding high value non-audit work to the 
external auditor, and the non-audit work planned and performed 
is monitored by the Committee at each meeting.
The external audit starts with the design of a work plan that 
addresses the key risks of the audit which were confirmed at 
the March 2017 meeting of the Committee. The Committee 
also agreed the terms of engagement and the fees payable 
for the engagement. At each meeting the Committee had the 
opportunity to discuss matters with the external auditor without 
management being present. The Chairman of the Committee 
also has regular discussions with the external audit partner 
outside the formal Committee process.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Committee was satisfied 
with the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external auditor. 
In light of this the Committee has recommended to the Board 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-appointed for the 
forthcoming year and a resolution proposing this will be put 
to the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Audit Committee priorities for the coming year
For the coming financial year, as part of its ongoing responsibilities, 
the Committee’s main areas of focus are as follows:
 — keep under review the Company’s risk management and 
internal control procedures;
 — continue to monitor the internal audit programme of work 
and ensure the new Head of Internal Audit is integrated 
effectively; and
 — consider extending the scope of the Committee’s activities 
to fully encompass risk assessment and management.

Nominations Committee report
The Nominations Committee and the Board seek to maintain an 
appropriate balance between the Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. The Nominations Committee is chaired by the Chairman 
and consists of all the Non-executive Directors. The Chairman 
will not chair the Committee when it deals with the appointment 
of a successor to the Chairmanship.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available for 
inspection upon written request to the Company and on its 
website at www.norcros.com.
During the year under review, the Nominations Committee 
has evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge, diversity and 
experience of the Board. If a new appointment to the Board 
is required, the Committee will use the appropriate selection 
process and will determine the scope of the role of a new 
Director and the skills and time commitment required and make 
recommendations to the Board about filling Board vacancies 
and appointing additional Directors. The Committee will utilise 
external search and selection consultants as appropriate and 
appointments will be made on the basis of merit and the most 
appropriate experience against objective criteria in the best 
interests of shareholders.
In selecting candidates due regard will be given to the balance 
of the Board, and to the benefits of different backgrounds and 
experience, and to diversity on the Board including gender.
In the year under review the Committee has, in addition to 
its routine responsibilities, conducted a thorough review of our 
succession planning process, and made appropriate plans 
for succession planning for Board members and senior 
management across the Group.

Remuneration Committee annual statement
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Committee continues to place the interests of shareholders 
at the forefront of its decision-making when implementing the 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders. The Group’s 
remuneration policy was first presented to the AGM in 2014 and 
was approved with 99.9% of votes cast in support of the policy. 
Our remuneration policy has remained unchanged in 2015/16 
and 2016/17 and, in accordance with the relevant regulations, 
is required to be submitted to a new binding shareholder vote 
at the 2017 AGM. 
During the year under review, we reviewed our remuneration 
policy, taking into account an assessment of its effectiveness 
to date at Norcros, the wider market context and developments 
in best practice remuneration governance. The Committee 
concluded from its review that the current Policy remains 
appropriate, and is therefore proposing only minor changes 
to the Policy for the next three-year period, as described below. 
As required by the regulations, the policy is included in full on 
pages 44 to 50 with the minor changes highlighted on page 44.
Remuneration strategy
The Committee’s overall approach to executive remuneration 
remains unchanged. We are focused on ensuring the Group’s 
remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ interests 
and enables us to attract, retain and motivate quality executive 
leadership, but without paying more than is necessary for this 
purpose. We do this with a simple remuneration structure 
comprising base salary and benefits, an annual bonus and a 
single performance-based long-term incentive. Targets for the 
annual bonus and long-term incentive are set at levels that are 
stretching and provide a clear link between pay and the 
achievement of our strategic objectives.
Our policy delivers an on-target reward mix for the Group 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director comprising 61% 
fixed pay (51% base salary, 8% pension and 2% benefits), 26% 
annual bonus and 13% long-term incentive. Under a scenario 
where all performance conditions are met in full, the Executive 
Directors’ package consists of 38% fixed pay, 31% annual bonus 
and 31% long-term incentive.
ROLE OF THE 
REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee 
are to:
 — determine the remuneration policy and keep it under 
review, including consulting with, and obtaining approval 
from, shareholders as appropriate;
 — implement the approved remuneration policy as regards 
Executive Director remuneration, benefits and incentives, 
including the design of, targets for and payout of all 
incentive arrangements; and
 — ensure alignment of the remuneration structure for senior 
executives to the Executive Director remuneration policy, 
including approval of changes to packages.
The Remuneration Committee will also prepare an Annual 
Remuneration Report to be approved by the members of the 
Company at the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration 
Committee meets not less than twice a year. The Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by Jo Hallas, and its other members 
are Martin Towers and David McKeith.
The Committee is focused 
on ensuring the Group’s 
remuneration policy is 
closely aligned with 
shareholders’ interests.” Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 43
Remuneration strategy continued
To further ensure remuneration is aligned with shareholder interests, 
half of any bonus paid is deferred for three years, shares vesting 
from APSP awards made in 2015 onwards need to be held for 
a further two years (i.e. until the fifth anniversary of grant), and 
the Executive Directors are additionally required to build and 
maintain a shareholding of at least 100% of salary. Finally, in the 
event of material misstatement in accounting records or gross 
misconduct, deferred bonus and APSP awards may be subject 
to malus or clawback.
The Group has for many years successfully operated an all-employee 
Save As You Earn (SAYE) share scheme in the UK, enabling the 
workforce to participate in growth opportunities for the business. 
This statutory scheme has now time-expired and therefore a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2017 AGM for the approval 
of a successor SAYE scheme. 
Year in review
As highlighted in the Chairman’s Statement and the Group Chief 
Executive’s Statement on pages 4 and 6 respectively, Norcros 
continues to perform strongly with an eighth consecutive year of 
growth in both revenue and underlying operating profit. Highlights 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 include:
 — revenue growth of 15.0% (10.6% on a constant currency basis) 
to £271.2m;
 — underlying operating profit up 11.7% to £23.8m;
 — underlying diluted earnings per share consistent with the 
previous year at 27.8p; and
 — underlying ROCE at 18.4%, which is ahead of the Group 
strategic target of 12–15%.
This strong performance delivered underlying profit above 
the target set by the Committee for the year, resulting in bonus 
outcomes of 68.42% of the maximum opportunity for the year 
ended 31 March 2017. The Group has also exceeded its targets 
for aggregate underlying earnings per share (EPS) over the 
three-year period from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2017. As a result, 
100% of the APSP awards granted in 2014 will vest on 27 July 2017. 
The Committee considers this outcome to appropriately reflect 
the Group’s very strong performance over the period.
2018 remuneration
In accordance with our remuneration policy, the Executive Director 
base salaries were increased by 2.0%, which is broadly in line with 
the increases for our senior employees in the wider UK-based 
workforce. There are no other changes to Executive Director 
remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2018.
The Committee believes that our remuneration strategy and 
its implementation remain appropriate. I hope you will feel able 
to support the binding vote on our remuneration policy and its 
implementation as described in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
at the 2017 AGM.
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support.

REMUNERATION DISCLOSURE
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The Report meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In this 
Report, we describe how the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), are applied in practice. The Remuneration Committee confirms that throughout the financial year 
the Group has complied with these governance rules and best practice provisions set out in the Code. 44 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration policy report
Directors’ remuneration policy
This section of the report sets out the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors, which will be put to 
a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM. If this resolution is carried, the Policy will come into effect on that date and will remain 
effective for up to a three-year period ending on the date of the 2020 AGM. The Policy set out in this report is unchanged from that 
approved by shareholders in 2014, other than the following minor updates:
 — in calculating the personal holding of shares of an Executive Director for the purposes of the Policy, nil-cost options granted under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan on or after 27 July 2017 can be taken into account; and
 — for the avoidance of doubt, the Policy makes clear that, in calculating such holdings, shares held beneficially by an Executive 
Director’s spouse or partner can be taken into account.
Executive Director remuneration policy table
This policy has been designed to support the principal objective of enabling the Group to attract, motivate and retain the people it 
needs to maximise the value of the business.
Component and objective Operation Opportunity Performance measures

To enable the Group to

Generally reviewed each year, with 
increases effective 1 April with 
reference to salary levels at other 
FTSE companies of broadly similar 
size or sector to Norcros.
The Committee also considers 
the salary increases applying 
across the rest of the UK business 
when determining increases 
for Executive Directors.
Base salary increases are applied 
in line with the outcome of the 
annual review.
Salaries in respect of the year 
under review (and for the following 
year) are disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Salary increases for Executive 
Directors will normally not exceed 
those of the wider workforce over 
the period this policy will apply. 
Where increases are awarded in 
excess of the wider employee 
population, for example if there is a 
material change in the responsibility, 
size or complexity of the role, the 
Committee will provide the rationale 
in the relevant year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
n/a
Pension
To provide a level of 
retirement benefit that 
is competitive in the 
relevant market
Executive Directors receive pension 
contributions (either as a direct 
payment or a cash allowance).
Base salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Maximum of 15% of base salary. n/a
Benefits
Provision of benefits in 
line with the market
Executive Directors are provided 
with a company car (or a cash 
allowance in lieu thereof) and 
medical insurance. Other benefits 
may be introduced from time 
to time to ensure the benefits 
package is appropriately competitive 
and reflects the needs and 
circumstances of the Group and 
individual Executive Director.
Benefits may vary by role, and the 
level is determined each year to 
be appropriate for the role and 
circumstances of each individual 
Executive Director.
It is not anticipated that the cost of 
benefits (as set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration) would 
increase materially over the period for 
which this policy will apply.
The Committee retains the 
discretion to approve a higher cost 
in exceptional circumstances (e.g. 
relocation expenses or an expatriation 
allowance on recruitment, etc.) or in 
circumstances where factors outside 
the Company’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. market increases in 
insurance costs).

Component and objective Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Annual bonus and 
Deferred Bonus Plan 
(DBP)
To focus Executive 
Directors on achieving 
demanding annual 
targets relating to 
Group performance 
and encourage retention
Performance targets are set at 
the start of the year and aligned 
with the annual budget agreed 
by the Board. At the end of the 
year, the Committee determines 
the extent to which these 
targets have been achieved.
50% of the total bonus payment 
is paid in cash, and 50% is 
converted into nil-cost options 
over Norcros shares under 
the 2011 Deferred Bonus 
Plan (DBP). These options 
are exercisable after three 
years, subject to continued 
employment and malus (in 
whole or in part) during the 
deferral period in the event 
of a material misstatement 
in accounting records or 
gross misconduct.
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have 
accrued on deferred bonus 
awards that vest will be made 
to participants on vesting.
Maximum opportunity: 100% 
of base salary.
Target opportunity: 50% of 
base salary.
For threshold performance, 
the bonus payout is up to 
25% of maximum.
The bonus will be based primarily 
on the achievement of financial 
performance targets but may, 
from time to time, include non-
financial performance measures 
(the weighting of which, if any, 
will be capped at 20% of the 
total opportunity).
The primary bonus measure is 
Group underlying operating profit, 
although the Committee may, at its 
discretion and from time to time, 
supplement this with additional 
financial measures that reflect the 
strategic priorities for Norcros for 
the financial year.
The Committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic bonus 
outcomes (including down to 
zero) within the limits of the 
scheme to ensure alignment 
of pay with performance.
Further details including targets 
attached to the bonus for the 
year under review are given on 
page 53 of the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Approved Performance 
Share Plan (APSP)
To incentivise 
Executive Directors 
to deliver long-
term performance 
by aligning their 
performance with 
shareholders’ interests
APSP awards comprise annual 
conditional awards of nil-
cost options following the 
announcement of the Group’s 
final results.
Awards normally vest after 
three years, subject to the 
achievement of a performance 
condition and continued 
employment with the Group 
until the vesting date.
To the extent an award vests, 
Executive Directors will be 
required to hold net vested 
shares for an additional  
holding period of two years.
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have 
accrued on APSP awards 
that vest will be made to 
participants on vesting.
APSP awards are also subject 
to malus over the vesting 
period and clawback over the 
holding period (in both cases 
in whole or in part) in the event 
of a material misstatement 
in accounting records or 
gross misconduct.
Maximum opportunity: 100% 
of base salary.
Threshold performance results 
in 25% vesting.
Details of actual APSP awards 
in respect of each year will be 
disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Vesting of APSP awards is 
dependent upon the Group’s 
diluted underlying earnings per 
share (EPS) performance over a 
three-year period.
At the start of each cycle, the 
Committee will determine the 
targets that will apply to an award. 
If the performance targets are not 
met at the end of the performance 
period, awards will lapse.
The Committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic APSP 
outcomes within the limits of 
the scheme if certain relevant 
events take place (e.g. a capital 
restructuring, a material acquisition/
divestment, etc.) with any such 
adjustment to result in the revised 
targets being no more or less 
challenging to achieve.
The Committee will consult major 
shareholders on changes to the 
APSP, although it retains discretion 
to make non-significant changes to 
the performance measure without 
reverting to a full shareholder vote.
Further details, including the targets 
attached to the APSP in respect 
of each year, are disclosed in the

Notes to the policy table
Payments from previous awards
For the avoidance of doubt the Group will honour any commitment entered into, and Executive Directors will be eligible to receive 
payment from any award made, prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report, i.e. before 
27 July 2017 (or the date, if later, at which the policy is approved). Details of these awards are, and will be, disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The use of Group underlying operating profit in the annual bonus directly reinforces our medium-term growth-oriented strategy 
(see page 9 for further details). For the APSP, the Committee considers that diluted underlying EPS is a transparent, objective and 
effective measure of performance which is in the long-term interests of all of our shareholders.
Targets applying to the bonus and APSP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points. Bonus targets 
are aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board. Annual bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive but will be 
disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration (see page 53 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). APSP targets 
reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels and factors specific to the Group. 
The Committee will determine the APSP targets at the time awards are made and these targets (along with other relevant details of the 
grant) will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration (see page 54 of the Annual Report on Remuneration).
Differences from remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above. Annual salary reviews 
across the Group take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies.
Executives and senior managers are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes. Opportunities and performance measures vary 
by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Other members of the Group senior leadership team participate 
in the APSP on similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award sizes may vary by organisational level. All UK employees are 
eligible to participate in the Group’s SAYE scheme on identical terms. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

Performance scenario charts
The graphs above provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for Executive Directors, and the potential mix between 
the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: “Minimum”, “On-target” and “Maximum”. This 
information is for the current financial year, as explained below.
The potential opportunities illustrated above are based on the policy applied to the base salary at 1 April 2017. For the annual bonus, 
the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for the year to 31 March 2018. It should be noted 
that any bonus deferred into the DBP and APSP awards do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. This is 
intended to illustrate the relationship between executive pay and performance. The values of the DBP and APSP assume no increase 
in the underlying value of the shares, and actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as the Group’s 
share price and the value of dividends paid.
Valuation assumptions
The “Minimum” scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration), being the only elements of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package not linked to performance.
The “On-target” scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus payout (50% of salary) and APSP threshold vesting 
at 25% of the maximum award level.
The “Maximum” scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout under all incentives (100% of salary under each of the annual 
bonus and APSP).
Approach to Executive Director recruitment and remuneration
External appointment
In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Policy
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience 
and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent in the role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make phased 
increases over a period of three years, subject to the individual’s development and performance in the role.
Benefits As set out in the policy table, benefits may include (but are not limited to) the provision of a company car 
or car allowance, medical insurance, and any necessary expatriation allowances or expenses relating to an 
executive’s relocation.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an 
equivalent cash supplement, or a combination of both. The maximum employer contribution will be 15% 
of salary on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
SAYE New appointees will be eligible to participate on identical terms to all other employees.
Annual bonus The bonus structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees. The maximum opportunity will be 
100% of salary, pro-rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed. Performance measures 
may include strategic and operational objectives tailored to the individual in the financial year of joining.
50% of any bonus earned will be deferred into the DBP on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
APSP New appointees will be granted annual awards under the APSP on the same terms as other Executive Directors, 
as described in the policy table. In exceptional circumstances, such as to facilitate the recruitment of an 
external hire, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, make awards up to 150% of salary.

Directors’ remuneration policy report continued
Approach to Executive Director recruitment and remuneration continued
External appointment continued
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and level for the appointee, the Remuneration Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of our shareholders. It is not the intention of the 
Committee that a cash payment such as a “golden hello” would be offered. However, the Committee may make an award in respect 
of a new appointment to “buy out” incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, over and above the approach and 
award limits outlined in the table above. Any such award will be made under existing incentive structures, where appropriate, and will 
be subject to the normal performance conditions of those incentives. The Committee may also consider it appropriate to make “buy 
out” awards under a different structure, using the relevant Listing Rule, where necessary to replicate the structure of forfeited awards. 
Any “buy out” award (however this is delivered) would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited, taking into account 
relevant factors including performance conditions, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting 
period remaining. Details of any such award will be disclosed in the first Annual Report on Remuneration following its grant.
Internal promotion to the Board
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, and it is 
agreed that a commitment is to continue, the Group will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where 
they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Executive Director remuneration policy at the time of promotion.
Service contracts and policy for payment for loss of office
Executive Directors have signed rolling contracts, terminable on twelve months’ notice by either the Group or the Director. The Group 
entered into a contract with Nick Kelsall on 1 April 2011, and with Shaun Smith on 31 March 2016. Copies of these contracts are 
available to view at the Group’s registered office.
The Committee’s policy for Directors’ termination payments is to provide only what would normally be due to Directors had they remained 
in employment in respect of the relevant notice period, and not to go beyond their normal contractual entitlements. Any incentive 
arrangements will be dealt with subject to the relevant rules, with any discretion exercised by the Committee on a case by case basis 
taking into account the circumstances of the termination. Termination payments will also take into account any statutory entitlement 
at the appropriate level, to be considered by the Committee on the same basis. The Committee will monitor and where appropriate 
enforce the Directors’ duty to mitigate loss. When the Committee believes that it is essential to protect the Group’s interests, additional 
arrangements may be entered into (for example post-termination protections above and beyond those in the contract of employment) 
on appropriate terms.
Under the service contracts for each Executive Director, the Company has the discretion to terminate the employment lawfully without 
any notice by paying to the Director a sum equal to, but no more than, the salary and other contractual benefits of the Director. 
The payment would be in respect of that part of the period of notice which the Director has not worked, less any appropriate tax 
and other statutory deductions. The Director would be entitled to any holiday pay which may otherwise have accrued in what would 
have been the notice period. The Company may pay any sums due under these pay in lieu of notice provisions as one lump sum 
or in instalments of what would have been the notice period. If the Company elects to pay in instalments, the Director is under an 
express contractual duty to mitigate his losses and to disclose any third-party income he has received or is due to receive. The Company 
reserves the right to reduce the amount of the instalments by the amount of such income. The Committee would expect to include 
similar pay in lieu of notice provisions in any future Executive Director’s service contract. In the case of Nick Kelsall’s service contract, 
these pay in lieu of notice provisions can also be activated by Mr Kelsall if he exercises his contractual right to terminate his employment 
upon a change of control of the Company or a transfer of his employment to an acquirer of the Company’s business. The Committee 
would not envisage including a similar right to terminate in any future Executive Director’s service contract, and there is no such 
provision in Shaun Smith’s service contract.
Also under their service contracts, if the Director’s employment is terminated for whatever reason, he agrees that he is not entitled 
to any damages or compensation to recompense him for the loss or diminution in value of any actual or prospective rights, benefits 
or expectations under or in relation to the APSP, the DBP, the SAYE plan or the annual discretionary bonus scheme. This is without 
prejudice to any of the rights, benefits or entitlements which may have accrued to the Director under such arrangements at the 
termination of employment. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

External appointments 
Executive Directors are permitted to take up non-executive positions on the boards of other companies, subject to the prior approval 
of the Board. The Executive Director may retain any fees payable in relation to such appointment. Details of external appointments 
and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employees and (where relevant) their representative bodies as part 
of its broader employee engagement strategy. The Committee is mindful of salary increases applying across the rest of the business 
in relevant markets when considering salaries for Executive Directors, but does not currently consult with employees specifically on 
executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the Annual General Meeting each year, as well as 
guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping remuneration policy. The vast majority of shareholders 
continue to express support for remuneration arrangements at Norcros. The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under regular 
review, to ensure it continues to reinforce the Group’s long-term strategy and aligns Executive Directors with shareholders’ interests. 
We will consult shareholders before making any significant changes to our remuneration policy.
Non-executive Director remuneration policy
Non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) have letters of appointment which specify an initial term of at least three years, 
although these contracts may be terminated at one month’s notice by either the Company or Director. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code guidelines, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the AGM.
Details of terms and notice periods for Non-executive Directors are summarised below:
Non-executive Director Date of appointment Notice period
Martin Towers 28 July 2011 1 month
Jo Hallas 27 September 2012 1 month
David McKeith 24 July 2013 1 month
It is the policy of the Board of Directors that Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s bonus, long-
term incentive or pension schemes. Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-executive Directors are set out in the table below:

Annual report on remuneration
The following section provides details of how our policy was implemented during the year ended 31 March 2017, and will be 
implemented in the year ending 31 March 2018. 
Remuneration Committee membership in the year ended 31 March 2017
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the 
members of the Group’s senior management, and for setting the remuneration packages for the Board Chairman and each Executive 
Director. The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference, which can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.norcros.com.
During the year under review, the following Directors were members of the Remuneration Committee:
 — Jo Hallas (Chair);
 — David McKeith; and
 — Martin Towers.
All members of the Committee are independent. They serve on the Committee for a minimum three-year term and a maximum of 
nine years, provided the Director remains independent. As part of an effectiveness review for the entire Board, an evaluation of the 
Remuneration Committee was undertaken in the year to 31 March 2017. We are pleased to report this review concluded that the 
Committee continues to operate effectively.
In addition, the Group Chief Executive was invited to attend Committee meetings to advise on specific questions raised by the 
Committee and on matters relating to the performance and remuneration of senior managers, other than in relation to his own 
remuneration. The Group Counsel and Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. No individual was present while 
decisions were made regarding their own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year. Attendance by individual members at meetings is detailed on page 34.
Main activities of the Committee during the year ended 31 March 2017

1. Shaun Smith was appointed Group Finance Director on 4 April 2016. The column for Shaun Smith shows remuneration received for the period 4 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. 
Martin Payne stood down from that role at that date, but continued in employment as a Director during the handover period ending 12 May 2016, when his employment ceased. 
The column for Martin Payne shows remuneration received for the period 1 April 2016 to 12 May 2016.
2. Taxable benefits consist of car allowance (Nick Kelsall – 2017: £15,000, 2016: £15,000; Shaun Smith – 2017: £11,923, 2016: n/a; and Martin Payne – 2017: £1,415, 2016: £12,000) 
and private medical insurance. For 2017, Shaun Smith’s taxable benefits also include the cost of hotel accommodation of £1,432 in connection with his relocation on joining 
Norcros. This cost is part of the relocation allowance (capped at £100k gross of tax) agreed in connection with his appointment and disclosed in last year’s report. Further costs 
relating to Shaun Smith’s relocation are expected to be reimbursed (up to the disclosed maximum) in the first half of the year ending 31 March 2018, and will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
3. Annual bonus comprises both the cash annual bonus for performance during the year and, where applicable, the face value of the deferred bonus element on the date 
of deferral. Any deferred share element is deferred for three years. See “Annual bonus in respect of performance in the year ended 31 March 2017” below for further details. 
Martin Payne received no annual bonus in respect of his period of employment in 2017.
4. For 2017, the APSP value reflects the estimated value of APSP awards granted in July 2014, of which 100% will vest to Nick Kelsall on 23 July 2017, and includes the value of 
dividends accrued on these awards over the vesting period (£33,500). The value of awards is estimated using the three-month average share price to 31 March 2017 of 165.44p, 
and will be trued up to reflect the vest-date value of awards in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. For 2016, the APSP value has been trued up from that disclosed in last 
year’s Remuneration Report to reflect the Group’s share price of 157.0p on the date of vesting (28 September 2016) of awards granted in September 2013. All of Martin Payne’s 
outstanding APSP awards lapsed on cessation of employment.
5. The pension benefit provided to Nick Kelsall and Shaun Smith in 2017 comprises cash in lieu (Nick Kelsall – £52,280; Shaun Smith – £34,888; and Martin Payne – £4,142 for 
the period of his employment in that year) and amounts related to the defined benefit scheme (Nick Kelsall – £27,860; and Shaun Smith – n/a). In 2016, pension benefits 
comprised cash in lieu (Nick Kelsall – £51,255; and Martin Payne – £34,425) and amounts related to the defined benefit scheme (Nick Kelsall – £32,475; Martin Payne – £631).

Annual bonus in respect of performance in the year ended 31 March 2017
The 2017 Annual Bonus Plan was based 100% on Group underlying operating profit performance for the year to 31 March 2017. 
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the year was 100% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and for the Group 
Finance Director. Based on the Company’s performance in 2017, against targets set at the start of the year, the Committee decided 
to award an annual bonus of 68.42% of the maximum opportunity to the Executive Directors. Further details, including the profit 
targets set and actual performance, are provided below:

50% of each Executive Director’s annual bonus award of 68.42% of base salary, i.e. 34.21% of salary, will be deferred into shares under 
the DBP. This DBP award will vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.

Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) 
The grant of options under the DBP in respect of the year to 31 March 2017 has not yet been made. As a result of this, the precise 
number of options to be granted in respect of the year to 31 March 2017 cannot yet be calculated, though the proposed monetary 
value of the bonus earned is known. Accordingly, Nick Kelsall will receive a number of nil-cost options calculated by dividing the 
proposed value of £119,233 by the share price at the date of grant. Shaun Smith will receive a number of nil-cost options calculated 
by dividing the proposed value of £79,569 by the share price at the date of grant.
2014 APSP awards vesting
Effective July 2014, an APSP award of 186,111 shares was granted to Nick Kelsall. Vesting of this award was based on Norcros’ 
aggregate diluted underlying EPS over the three financial years to 31 March 2017. Based on performance over this period, the 
Committee determined that 100% of this award will vest on 23 July 2017, being the end of the relevant three-year vesting period 
according to the APSP rules. Performance targets and actual performance against these, as determined by the Committee, are 
summarised in the table below:

Total pension entitlements (audited information)
As part of their remuneration arrangements, Nick Kelsall and Shaun Smith are entitled to receive pension contributions from the 
Company. Under these arrangements, they can elect for those contributions to be paid in the form of taxable pension allowance, 
or direct payments into a personal pension plan or the Group’s UK defined contribution scheme. If a payment is made in the form 
of taxable pension allowance, the amount payable is not reduced to allow for employment taxes.
During the year Nick Kelsall elected to take a taxable pension allowance of £52,280 (2016: £51,255) with no amounts paid directly into 
a pension scheme (2016: £nil). Shaun Smith elected to take a taxable pension allowance of £34,888 (2016: n/a) with no amount paid 
into a personal pension plan (2016: n/a). In line with the Regulations, the single figure table reflects the total of these amounts, as well 
as the capitalised increase in accrued pension (net of inflation) under the UK defined benefit scheme, of which Nick Kelsall is a deferred 
member. Shaun Smith is not a member of the UK defined benefit scheme. Details of Executive Directors’ retirement benefits under the 
Group’s UK defined benefit scheme and taxable pension allowances are summarised in the following table:

In accordance with the arrangements relating to his ceasing to be a Director Martin Payne was in the year under review entitled to 
exercise 21,206 nil-cost DBP option shares, which he did on 28 September 2016. He is also entitled to exercise a total of 64,730 nil-cost

Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, benefits (excluding pension) and annual bonus between the 2016 
and 2017 financial years compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for all UK staff 
employed in continuing operations. A UK subset of employees was selected as a suitable comparator group for this analysis because 
the CEO is based in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending 
on local market conditions (in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate between the South African Rand and British Pound). The 
comparison uses a per capita figure and accordingly this reflects an average across the Group’s businesses. No account is therefore 
taken of the impact of operational factors such as new joiners and leavers and the mix of employees.

Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2018
The Remuneration Committee conducted its normal review of Executive Directors’ remuneration, effective 1 April 2017. The results of 
this review are as follows:
Base salary
Base salaries were reviewed taking into account individual performance and competitive practice for similar roles in the Company’s 
remuneration peer group, and remuneration awards within the Group. The Committee decided to increase Executive Director salaries 
in line with the rest of the UK businesses in the Group by 2%. For the year ending 31 March 2018, base salaries will be £355,505 for 
Nick Kelsall and £238,772 for Shaun Smith.
Pension
There is no change in the contribution percentage for Executive Directors for the year ending 31 March 2018, which remains at 15% of salary.
Benefits
There is no change in the car allowance for Executive Directors for the year ending 31 March 2018, which is £15,000 p.a. for Nick Kelsall 
and £12,000 p.a. for Shaun Smith.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors will remain unchanged for the 2018 financial year with a maximum bonus 
entitlement of 100% of salary. The bonus outcome for Executive Directors will continue to be based entirely on Group underlying 
operating profit. Of any bonus earned 50% will be deferred into nil-cost options for a further three years under the DBP. Annual 
bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive but will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
APSP
The structure of APSP awards to be made in the 2018 financial year will be unchanged from 2017. Awards with face values of 100% of 
salary will be granted to Nick Kelsall and Shaun Smith, with vesting subject to the achievement of three-year aggregate diluted underlying 
EPS targets. To the extent an award vests, vested shares will be subject to a further two-year holding period. The Committee will determine 
these targets at the time awards are made and these targets (along with other relevant details of this grant) will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
SAYE
Nick Kelsall and Shaun Smith will continue to be able to participate in any SAYE contract offered to all employees, on identical terms.
Implementation of Non-executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2018
The Committee has reviewed the Board Chairman’s fee and concluded that an increase of 2.0% (to £100,980 p.a.) was appropriate. 
The Board Chairman and the Executive Directors reviewed Non-executive Director fees at the same time and concluded that a similar 
percentage increase would be appropriate. Accordingly, for the 2018 financial year, Non-executive Director fees will be as follows:
Executive Director
Fee at
1 April 2017
Fee from
1 April 2016
Percentage
increase
Board Chairman £100,980 £99,000 2.0%

The Group’s share incentive plans operate in line with the Investment Association’s Principles, which require that commitments 
under all-share schemes satisfied by newly issued shares must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling ten-year 
period, of which up to 5% may be used to satisfy options under executive share schemes. The Group’s position against the dilution 
limits at 31 March 2017 was 6.4% for the all-share schemes limit and 3.9% for executive schemes.

The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended 
31 March 2017 of 4.8p (2016: 4.4p). This follows the decision to 
pay an interim dividend earlier in the year of 2.4p (2016: 2.2p).
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and indemnities
The Company purchases liability insurance cover for Directors 
and officers of the Company which gives appropriate cover 
for any legal action brought against them. The Company also 
provides an indemnity for its Directors (to the extent permitted 
by the law) in respect of liabilities which could occur as a result 
of their office. This indemnity does not provide cover should a 
Director be proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Purchase of own shares
In 2007 the Company formed the Norcros Employee Benefit 
Trust (the Trust). The purpose of the Trust is to meet part of 
the Company’s liabilities under the Company’s share schemes. 
The Trust purchased no ordinary shares during the year (2016: nil). 
At the Company’s 2016 Annual General Meeting, the shareholders 
authorised the Company to make market purchases of up to 
6,099,593 ordinary shares. At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, shareholders will be asked to renew the authority to 
purchase its own shares for another year. Details are contained 
in the AGM Notice of Meeting on pages 114 to 118.
Employees
The necessity for, and importance of, good relations with all 
employees is well recognised and accepted throughout the Group.
However, because the Group’s activities are organised on a 
de-centralised basis, with each operating business having a 
reasonable degree of autonomy over its operations, there is no 
uniform set of arrangements for employee involvement imposed 
throughout the Group. Nevertheless, all Group companies are 
strongly encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of 
employee consultation best suits their circumstances.
The Group is fully committed to keeping its employees informed 
about their work unit and the wider business.
The Group recognises its responsibilities towards disabled persons 
and therefore all applications from such persons are fully and fairly 
considered bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities 
of the applicant. In the event of existing employees becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. 
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, 
be identical to that of an able-bodied person.

revolving credit facility and the £30.0m accordion facility which 
contain mandatory prepayment provisions on a change of control.
There are no provisions within Directors’ employment contracts 
which allow for specific termination payments upon a change 
of control.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 — state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements;
 — make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Directors’ Report, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 — the Company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company;
 — the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group; and
 — the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ 
Report is approved:
 — so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group and Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 — they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.

Report on the group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Norcros plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
 — the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
 — the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 — the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
 — the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 — the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Overview
 — Overall group materiality: £1,140,000 which represents 5% of underlying profit before tax.
 
 — The Group consists of nine operating divisions, alongside its head office functions. Our audit focused 
on the most significant of these in terms of materiality to the Group financial statements. The components 
within the scope of our work accounted for 93% of Group revenue and 94% of Group underlying profit 
before tax.
 — Accounting for customer rebates and other trade promotional spend.
 — Defined benefit pension plan liabilities.
 — Valuation of acquired intangibles.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order 
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Accounting for customer rebates and other trade 
promotional spend
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies) and page 75 (Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments).
As is normal industry practice, the Group has a number of trading 
agreements in place with its largest customers to encourage them 
to purchase and promote the Group’s products. These consist 
of various types of rebates and other trade spend commitments, 
which may then be subject to variation from time to time.
Rebates on sales are recognised as a deduction from revenue 
and are earned over the period of the contractual agreements 
with individual customers. The total amount recognised in a year 
is therefore based on the expected amount payable up to the 
balance sheet date under each customer agreement.
Promotional spend is a further deduction from revenue. 
The funding paid is recognised in the period to which it 
relates in accordance with the agreement with the customer.
We focused on such arrangements because of the significance 
of the amounts to the Group’s gross profit, the significant 
number of transactions and agreements in place, and the 
industrywide focus on this area of accounting.
The amount to be recognised in the income statement for such 
arrangements requires the directors to apply judgment based on 
the agreements in place with each of the Group’s customers, 
together with estimates of amounts the Group owes where 
transactions span the financial year end.
The relative level of judgment in each of the categories of 
arrangements noted above is considered below:
Volume based rebates
Volume based rebates are driven by customers achieving sales 
volume targets agreed with the Group for specific products over 
a pre-determined period. There is, therefore, judgment involved 
in estimating the volume of sales, particularly where rebate 
agreements span a financial year end, which is the case in a large 
number of instances. In such instances the key judgment that 
we focused on was the estimate of the rebate expense accrued 
at year end.
Other trade promotional spend
This expense varies with regards to the nature and timing of the 
activity to which it relates, and is recognised in accordance with 
the terms agreed with customers.
It derives from a number of varying agreements and its 
recognition requires the Group to determine the extent to 
which the promotional activity has taken place and, hence, 
the amount payable by the Group.
Our focus was on assessing the accuracy of the expense charged, 
whether the amount recognised was recorded in the appropriate 
period and the completeness of the expense. 
Our audit work in respect of accounting for customer rebates 
and other trade promotional spend comprised a combination 
of substantive testing, controls testing, and an assessment of 
the Group’s disclosures in this area. Each element of our work 
is considered in more detail below. 
Substantive testing
We tested a sample of the underlying agreements to provide 
the core evidence to support the amount and timing of recognition 
of both customer rebates and other trade promotional spend. 
This work involved evaluating whether the amount and timing 
of recognition was consistent with the contractual arrangements.
Where such agreements spanned the year end, or where the 
agreements were on a calendar year basis and the 2017 calendar 
year agreements had not yet been agreed, we critically assessed 
the judgments taken by the directors in estimating year end 
accruals for amounts owing to customers. This work included 
the use of look back tests to assess the accuracy of the accruals 
in previous years, alongside the use of “reasonableness checks” 
around the key assumptions of rebate terms and, in the case of 
volume rebates, the level of sales likely to occur in the rebate 
period, with reference to historic events. This testing did not 
identify any evidence of bias in the directors’ judgments.
We also analysed rebate expense and promotional expense 
recognised each month and compared them to gross sales to 
identify whether there were any unusual trends in the amounts 
or timing of rebate expense and promotional expense recognised 
in each period. Alongside this we held discussions with members 
of management within the sales teams to further understand 
the substance of these agreements and trends in the year. 
No unusual trends were identified.
Additionally, testing was performed in respect of post-year-
end credit notes issued and debit notes received, where 
applicable, to determine whether specific promotions were 
appropriately provided for as at the balance sheet date at 
the appropriate amount.
Controls testing
Where appropriate, our substantive work was supplemented  
by controls work which encompassed understanding, 
evaluating and testing key controls in respect of the approval  
of customer rebates and other trade promotional spend.  
We determined that we were able to obtain evidence from 
the operation of these controls for the purpose of our audit 
of whether customer rebates and other trade promotional 
spend had been recorded appropriately.
Disclosures
We read the disclosures within the financial statements in respect 
of customer rebates and other trade promotional spend and, 
based on our work, determined that they are consistent with 
accounting standards and the recent guidance on the reporting 
of complex supplier arrangements issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. 64 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Defined benefit pension plan liabilities
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies), page 75 (Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments) and note 22.
The Group has a defined benefit pension plan net liability of £62.7m 
(2016: £55.7m), which is significant in the context of both the 
overall balance sheet and the results of the Group, particularly 
given the significant movement in the valuation of the net liability 
in the current year. A major constituent of this net liability is the 
value attributed to the gross liabilities of the pension scheme.
The valuation of these gross liabilities requires significant judgment 
and expertise primarily in respect of the key assumptions used. 
These assumptions include both financial assumptions e.g. the 
discount rate and inflation, but also key demographic assumptions 
e.g. mortality rates. Modest changes in a number of these key 
assumptions can have a material impact on the calculation of the 
liability. We therefore focused our work on this area.
We obtained the external actuary’s report used in valuing the 
scheme’s liabilities and determined, using our experience of the 
valuation of similar schemes, and our own pension specialists, that 
the methodologies adopted by the actuary in forming the valuation 
were consistent with industry practice and our expectations.
We also agreed the key financial assumptions used within 
the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities, including the discount 
and inflation rates, to our internally developed benchmarks.  
We compared the assumptions around salaries increase and 
mortality to national and industry averages. The assumptions 
used within the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities were in line 
with our benchmarks and the external data.
Disclosures
We read the disclosures within the financial statements in respect 
of the defined benefit scheme and, based on our work, determined 
that they are consistent with accounting standards.
Valuation of acquired intangibles
Refer to note 1 Accounting policies, page 75 (Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments and notes 11, 12 and 28).
During the year, a fair value assessment was carried out over the 
Group acquired Abode Home Products Limited (‘Abode’) based 
in the UK. The accounting for the business combination resulted 
in the recognition of £0.8m of goodwill and £2.6m of intangibles 
assets relating to customer contracts and tradenames, which are 
separable from goodwill. In addition to this, a £0.5m deferred tax 
liability has been recognised in relation to the intangible assets.
The identification of intangible assets that meet the criteria for 
recognition and presentation in the financial statements requires 
significant judgment.
Management’s valuation method for those intangibles identified 
is subject to a number of key judgments surrounding cash flow 
forecasts, discount rates and attrition rates. We have therefore 
focused our work in this area.
We obtained management’s valuation model and assessed the 
appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions adopted in 
determining the valuation to be assigned to each of the intangibles 
identified. In doing so, we evaluated the appropriateness of the 
cash flow assumptions with reference to the current performance 
of the business and compared key assumptions, including attrition 
rates and growth rates, with current and historic trends and 
data. We also used our valuation specialists to consider the 
appropriateness of the discount rate applied.
Based on our work performed, we consider the assumptions 
and methodology adopted to be reasonable.
Disclosures
We read the disclosures within the financial statements in respect 
of the acquired intangibles and found them to be appropriately 
made in line with the requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
the group operates. 
The Group consists of 14 statutory entities (excluding dormant entities) and a number of divisions. These are predominately based 
within the UK and South Africa, which also form the reporting segments of Norcros plc. In the UK Norcros operate under six brands, 
each a separate division of Norcros Group Holdings Limited. These are Vado, Johnsons Tiles, Norcros Adhesives, Triton, Croydex and 
Abode. South Africa is similarly made up of three entities, Johnsons Tiles South Africa, TAL and Tile Africa which are each a separate 
brand. Each division or entity has its own finance function, who report directly to head office, with the head office function incurring 
certain central costs on behalf of the Group.
Consistent with the Group’s operations, we scoped our audit at a divisional level. The work at the operating divisions in the UK was 
performed by the UK engagement team whilst the work at the South African operating divisions was performed by a PwC team based 
in South Africa. The UK team instructed the South African team to perform a full scope audit of the South African operations, and to 
focus their work on customer rebates/other trade promotional spend in South Africa. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 65
Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope continued
The UK team had regular communication with the team in South Africa throughout the audit process. A senior member of the 
UK team visited South Africa to discuss the results of the work with the local team and to attend meetings with local management 
at which the financial results and audit matters were discussed. Furthermore, the UK engagement team performed procedures 
over the Group’s consolidation of these divisions and significant consolidation entries.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £1,140,000 (2016: £945,000).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before tax, adjusted for those items set out in note 8 to the Group financial 
statements (“underlying profit before tax”) provides us with a consistent year on year basis for 
determining materiality based on the underlying trading performance of the Group. Further to 
this it is the key benchmark used by key stakeholders, including management, in assessing the 
underlying performance of the group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £55,000 
(2016: £50,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 60, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that 
the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 66 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions 
of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 61, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgments against available evidence, forming our own 
judgments, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Norcros plc for the year ended 31 March 2017 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Group accounts
Year ended 31 March 2017
1. Group accounting policies
General information
Norcros plc (the Company), and its subsidiaries (together the Group) designs, manufactures and distributes a range of home 
consumer products in the UK, South Africa and other overseas markets.
The Company is incorporated in England as a public company limited by shares. The shares of the Company are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange market of listed securities. The address of its registered office is Ladyfield House, Station Road, Wilmslow, SK9 1BU, UK.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial 
instruments which are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
endorsed by the European Union issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), with the interpretations issued by the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are effective as of the Balance Sheet date and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving 
a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements, are detailed in the section on critical estimates on page 75. Although these estimates are based on management‘s best 
knowledge of amounts, events or actions, actual results may differ from expectations.
Accounting reference date
UK company law permits a Company to draw up financial statements to a date seven days either side of its accounting reference date. 
For operational reasons the Company adopts an accounting period of 52 weeks, and as a result of this, the exact year end date was 
2 April 2017 although the Company’s accounting reference date is 31 March 2017. All references to the financial year therefore relate to 
the 52 weeks commencing on 4 April 2016. In the previous year the accounting period was 53 weeks long, beginning on 30 March 2015 
and ending on 3 April 2016. 
Going concern
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence, and consequently they consider that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of preparation.
Restatement
The Group operates two cash-pooling arrangements in respect of its operations based in the UK and South Africa in order to maximise 
the efficiency of its treasury function. Under each facility, the Group and its bankers have a legal right to offset certain balances, which 
from time to time may be in an overdraft or positive funds position. In view of this, the Group previously offset the balances in an overdraft 
and positive funds position in determining the presentation of cash and borrowings in the Group Balance Sheet.
In March 2016, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued an agenda decision regarding the treatment of offsetting and 
cash-pooling arrangements in accordance with IAS 32: ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’. This provided additional guidance 
on when bank overdrafts in cash-pooling arrangements would meet the requirements for offsetting in accordance with IAS 32.
Following this additional guidance, the Group has reviewed its cash-pooling arrangements and has revised its presentation of bank 
overdrafts resulting in £30.9m of bank overdrafts being reported in borrowings, with a corresponding increase in cash. The comparative 
figures at 31 March 2016 have also been restated with an additional £19.6m of bank overdrafts being reported in borrowings. Consequently, 
borrowings within current liabilities have increased by this amount to £22.4m, with a corresponding increase in cash from £5.9m, 
as previously reported, to £25.5m.
The Group has considered the requirements of IAS 8 in respect of changes in accounting policies and the requirement to present 
a Balance Sheet as at the start date of the comparative period. As the change in accounting policy has no impact on the Group’s 
reported profit, or the net assets of the Group, the Group does not consider the adjustment to be material to require the presentation 
of an additional Balance Sheet. The impact on the opening comparative period, being as at 1 April 2015, would have been to increase 
both cash and borrowings by £17.5m. 74 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

IFRS 16 Leases 1 April 2019
Other than for IFRS 16, none of these standards or interpretations are expected to have a material impact on the Group. Under IFRS 16 
the present distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed, resulting in all leases being recognised on the Balance 
Sheet except for those with a very low value. At inception, a right-of-use asset will be recognised together with an equivalent liability 
reflecting the discounted lease payments over the estimated term of the lease. Whilst the overall cost of using the asset over the lease 
term should be the same, it is likely that the weighting of the charge between periods may differ due to the requirement to distinguish 
between the lease and non-lease elements of the agreement. Adoption of this standard is likely to result in an increase in gross assets 
and gross liabilities, and the Group will make an assessment of the full impact in due course. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 75
1. Group accounting policies continued
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out as follows. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all periods presented. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights 
to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on 
which the Group has the ability to exercise control, and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring them into line with those used by the 
Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition 
and, where necessary, the accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are adjusted to bring them in line with those of the Group. Any 
excess of the consideration (excluding payments contingent on future employment) over the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
(discount on acquisition) is credited to the Income Statement in the period of acquisition. Payments that are contingent on future 
employment are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. 
Critical estimates
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit Committee. The application of these 
accounting policies to specific scenarios requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future. These are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Under IFRS, estimates or judgments are considered critical where they involve a significant risk or cause a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities from period to period. This may be because the estimate or judgment involves matters which 
are highly uncertain, or because different estimation methods or assumptions could reasonably have been used.
Critical estimates have been made in the following areas:
 — acquired intangible fixed assets – intangible assets can only be recognised as part of a business combination where the intangible 
asset is separable from goodwill, can be reliably measured and is expected to generate future economic benefits. Judgment is required 
to assess whether these criteria are met and also to subsequently determine the appropriate assumptions which are used to place a 
value on the intangible asset. Had different assumptions been applied the valuation of acquired intangible assets could have differed 
from the amount ultimately recognised. Judgment is also needed to determine the useful economic lives of intangible assets and if a 
different period had been determined this could have resulted in amortisation charges differing from those actually recognised;
 — retirement benefit obligations – the present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on 
an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net expense for pensions principally 
include the discount rate and rate of inflation. Any changes in these assumptions can impact the carrying amount of retirement 
benefit obligations (see Note 22); 
 — deferred tax – deferred tax assets are recognised on losses and capital allowances carried forward only to the extent that it is 
probable they will be available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, 
management considers the regulations applicable to taxation and whether there are likely to be sufficient future taxable profits. 
Future taxable profits may be higher or lower than estimates made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax 
asset and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore changes to the legislative framework or application of tax law may result in 
a management reassessment of the level of recognition of deferred tax assets; and
 — customer rebate, incentive and promotional support accruals – a number of the Group’s customers are offered rebates, incentives 
and promotional support in order to encourage trade and cement strong relationships. Accounting for such arrangements involves 
judgment as agreement periods typically run for a number of months or years, and may involve assumptions around volumes of 
product purchased or sold into the future. However, where applicable, accrual calculations are underpinned by signed contracts 
and there has historically been a strong correlation between the amounts accrued in respect of a particular period and the amounts 
subsequently paid. 76 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the Group accounts continued
Year ended 31 March 2017
1. Group accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services provided alongside the supply of 
goods in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities and is shown net of value added and other sales-based taxes, customer rebates, 
incentives, discounts and promotional support.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer, which is usually on 
dispatch or upon sale to a customer in the case of the Group’s retail operations.
Revenue received in respect of extended warranties is recognised over the period of the warranty.
Customer rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support
Accrual is made at each Balance Sheet date to reflect management’s best estimate of amounts to be paid in respect of arrangements 
in place with customers regarding rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support. The cost of rebates, incentives, discounts 
and promotional support which have been paid or are accrued at the Balance Sheet date is shown as a deduction from revenue.
Segmental reporting
The Group operates in two main geographical areas: the UK and South Africa. All inter-segment transactions are made on an arm’s length 
basis. The chief operating decision maker (being the Board) assesses performance and allocates resources based on geography and 
accordingly segments have been determined on this basis. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on the basis of external turnover.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indicator of impairment. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less amortisation charged prior to the Group’s transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 less accumulated 
impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised in the period in which it is identified. 
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets comprise customer relationships, brands, trade names and patents recognised as separately identifiable 
assets on acquisition as well as product certification costs and development costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation (as explained 
below in the accounting policy for research and development costs). They are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation, with 
amortisation being charged on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful lives of Group assets are as follows:
Customer relationships  10–15 years
Brands, trade name and patents 8–15 years
Development costs   5 years
Product certification costs  5 years
Impairment of long-life assets
Property, plant and equipment, investment properties and other non-current assets are reviewed on an annual basis to determine 
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated as either the higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use; 
the resultant impairment (the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount) is recognised as 
a charge in the Income Statement.
The value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets and 
their eventual disposal proceeds. In order to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows the Group uses an appropriate 
discount rate adjusted for any associated risk. Estimated future cash flows used in the impairment calculation represent management’s 
best view of likely future market conditions and current decisions on the use of each asset or asset group.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and 
rebates) and any directly attributable costs. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provision for impairment in value. Impairment charges are recognised in the Income Statement when the carrying amount of an asset 
is greater than the estimated recoverable amount, calculated with reference to future discounted cash flows that the assets are expected 
to generate when considered as part of an income-generating unit. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is provided 
on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of 
acquisition by the Group.  Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 77
1. Group accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
The estimated useful lives of Group assets are as follows:
Buildings    25–50 years
Plant and equipment 3–15 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each Balance Sheet date.
Investment property
Investment property comprises mainly land and relates to property which is either sub-let to a third party or is not being utilised in 
the Group’s core operations. Investment property is held at cost less depreciation on buildings (land is not depreciated). Investment 
property is depreciated over 50 years.
Assets held-for-sale
Assets and disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to dispose of.
Assets and disposal groups are only classified as held-for-sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction 
as opposed to continuing use, and only when such a sale transaction is deemed highly probable. Such a sale transaction should 
be expected to complete within one year and accordingly assets and disposal groups held-for-sale are included within current 
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the associated liabilities included within current liabilities.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, and, where applicable, labour 
and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions are made for 
slow-moving and obsolete items.
Taxation
Current tax, which comprises UK and overseas corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the Balance Sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits and is accounted for using the Balance 
Sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
and is charged in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, when the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Operating leases
Annual rentals are charged/credited directly to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provisions
Warranty provisions – provision is made for the estimated liability on products under warranty. Liability is recognised upon the sale 
of a product and is estimated using historical data.
Restructuring provisions – provision is made for costs of restructuring activities to be carried out by the Group when the Group 
is demonstrably committed to incurring the cost in a future period and the cost can be reliably measured.
Property provisions – where the Group has vacated a property but is committed to a leasing arrangement, an onerous lease provision 
is recorded. This is calculated as the cost that management expects to incur over the period of the lease, which is net of any expected 
future sub-lease income.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount to be spent and discounted where material. 78 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has 
no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the 
benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined 
contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent 
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds 
that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms 
of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise, net of the related deferred tax.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually 
conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The 
expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for 
defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued 
annually by independent qualified actuaries.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of 
the following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs 
for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the 
offer. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
(d) Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the 
profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually 
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in accordance with the requirements of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’. 
They include profits and losses on disposal of non-current assets outside the normal course of business, restructuring costs and 
large or significant one-off items which in management’s judgment need to be disclosed to enable the user to obtain a proper 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
IAS 19R administrative expenses
As a result of the implementation of IAS 19R, the administrative expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with managing the 
Group’s pension schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 79
1. Group accounting policies continued
Acquisition related costs
Acquisition related costs include deferred remuneration, amortisation of acquired intangibles, the costs of maintaining an internal 
acquisitions department and professional advisory fees connected with business combination activity.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Group measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received. 
Transaction costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included 
in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Income Statement over the duration of 
the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Treasury derivatives – where deemed necessary, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is managed through the use of forward exchange contracts and cross 
currency swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognised immediately within finance costs/income 
in the Income Statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents – cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. 
Cash and cash equivalents are offset against overdrafts and borrowings only when there is a legally enforceable right to do so and 
there is a clear intention to undertake settlement of such overdrafts or borrowings held with the same counterparty within a short 
timeframe after the year end.
Trade receivables – trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. Evidence including significant financial difficulties of a debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation and default or delinquency in payment are considered indicators that the 
trade receivables are impaired. The amount of provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use 
of an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised in the Income Statement within administration costs. When a trade 
receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against administration costs in the Income Statement.
Trade payables – trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date. 
The Group determines the fair value of its remaining financial instruments through the use of estimated discounted cash flows. 
The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated as the net present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to 
their short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual 
cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is charged against profits for the year in which it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised once the 
technical feasibility of a project has been established and a business plan, which demonstrates how the project will generate future 
economic benefits, has been approved. Development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives 
from the point at which the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders, or when paid if earlier. 80 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Foreign currency transactions
Functional currency
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency that best reflects the 
economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to that entity (the functional currency). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the parent entity.
Transactions and balances
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at rates applicable at the year 
end and trading results of overseas subsidiaries at average rates for the year. Exchange gains and losses of a trading nature are dealt 
with in arriving at operating profit. 
Translation of overseas net assets
Exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of overseas net assets and results are taken directly to reserves.
Share capital
Issued share capital is recorded in the Balance Sheet at nominal value with any premium at the date of issue being credited to the 
share premium account.
Treasury shares
The cost of the purchase of own shares is taken directly to reserves and is included in the treasury reserve.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates in two main geographical areas: the UK and South Africa. All inter-segment transactions are made on an arm’s 
length basis. The chief operating decision maker (being the Board) assesses performance and allocates resources based on geography 
and accordingly segments have been determined on this basis. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on the basis of external turnover.

7. Taxation continued
The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate 
applicable to profits of the consolidated entities as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Profit before tax 11.5 15.4
Tax calculated at domestic tax rates applicable to profits in the respective countries 2.9 3.5
Tax effects of:
– overprovision in prior years (0.1) (0.4)
– expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.4 0.8
– effect of different tax rates and change in rate of deferred tax (0.3) (0.3)
– origination and reversal of timing differences 0.1 0.2
– previously unrecognised deferred tax assets — (1.4)
Total tax charge 3.0 2.4
The weighted average applicable tax rate was 25% (2016: 23%). The increase is mainly due to the Group’s South African businesses 
contributing a higher proportion of overall Group profitability compared to the previous year. The standard rate for corporation tax 
in South Africa is 28% (2016: 28%), compared to 20% (2016: 20%) in the UK.
8. Alternative performance measures
The Group makes use of a number of alternative performance measures to assess business performance and provide additional useful 
information to shareholders. Such alternative performance measures should not be viewed as a replacement of, or superior to, those defined 
by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Definitions of alternative performance measures used by the Group and, where 
relevant, reconciliations from GAAP-defined reporting measures to the Group’s alternative performance measures are provided below.
The alternative performance measures used by the Group are:
Measure Definition
Underlying operating profit Operating profit before IAS 19R administrative expenses, acquisition related costs and exceptional 
operating items
Underlying profit before taxation Profit before taxation before IAS 19R administrative expenses, acquisition related costs, 
exceptional operating items, amortisation of costs of raising finance, net movement on fair value 
of derivative financial instruments, discounting of property lease provisions and finance costs 
relating to pension schemes
Underlying taxation Taxation before tax associated with those items listed as being excluded from underlying profit 
before taxation
Underlying earnings Underlying profit before tax less underlying taxation
Underlying capital employed Capital employed adjusted for business combinations where relevant and the average impact of 
exchange rate movements
Underlying operating margin Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of revenue
Underlying return on capital 
employed (ROCE)
Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of the average of opening and closing 
underlying capital employed
Basic underlying earnings per share Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for basic earnings per share
Diluted underlying earnings per share Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share
EBITDA EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors and financiers to assess business performance 
and is derived from operating profit before depreciation and amortisation
Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA reflects EBITDA as adjusted for IAS 19R administrative expenses, acquisition 
related costs and exceptional operating items
Underlying operating cash flow Cash generated from continuing operations before cash outflows from exceptional items and 
acquisition related costs and pension fund deficit recovery contributions
Pro-forma EBITDA An annualised EBITDA figure used for the purpose of calculating banking covenant ratios
Pro-forma leverage Net debt expressed as a ratio of pro-forma EBITDA Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 85
8. Alternative performance measures continued
Underlying profit and earnings per share measures provide shareholders with additional useful information on the underlying 
performance of the Group. This is because these measures are those principally used by the Directors to assess the performance of 
the Group and are used as the basis for calculating the level of the annual bonus and long-term incentives earned by the Directors. 
Underlying ROCE is one of the Group’s strategic key performance indicators and is therefore provided so that shareholders can assess 
the Group’s performance in relation to its strategic targets. Underlying EBITDA and underlying operating cash flow are also used 
internally by the Directors in order to assess the Group’s cash generation. The term ‘underlying’ is not recognised under IFRS and 
consequently the Group’s definition of underlying may differ from that used by other companies.

Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year, excluding those held in the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive 
ordinary shares. At 31 March 2017 the potential dilutive ordinary shares amounted to 2,042,900 (2016: 1,639,137) as calculated in 
accordance with IAS 33.

10. Share-based payments continued
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant 
and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. A charge 
of £1.4m was recognised in respect of share options in the year (2016: £1.3m). The Group uses a Black-Scholes pricing model to 
determine the annual charge for its share-based payments. The assumptions used in this model for each share-based payment are 
as follows:

The additions in the previous year relate to the acquisitions of Croydex (£7.8m) and Abode (£0.8m). Goodwill of £2.9m relating to 
Abode had previously been recognised on a provisional basis, but this has been revised to £0.8m following the completion of the fair 
value exercise during the year, and the comparatives restated accordingly. Further details are provided in Note 28. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs). A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:

£m
2016
£m
Croydex 7.8 7.8
Abode (see Note 28) 0.8 0.8
Triton Showers 19.1 19.1
Tile Africa 3.4 2.7
31.1 30.4
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by a value-in-use calculation. These calculations use cash flow projections derived 
from data and metrics used on an ongoing basis, with the key assumptions being those regarding discount rates, growth rates, future 
gross margin improvements and cash flows. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are:
 — cash flows before income taxes are based on approved budgets and detailed forecasts for the first five years; 
 — long-term growth rates of 2.1% (2016: 2.0%) for Croydex, Abode and Triton Showers and 7.6% (2016: 7.6%) for Tile Africa applied 
to the period beyond which detailed budgets and forecasts do not exist, based on macroeconomic projections for the geographies 
in which the entities operate; and 
 — pre-tax discount rates of 7.8% (2016: 9.0%) in the UK and 16.6% (2016: 17.8%) in South Africa based upon the risk free rate for 
government bonds adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and investing in the Group’s 
specific sectors and regions.
Management has applied sensitivities to the key assumptions and believes that there are no reasonably possible scenarios which 
would result in an impairment of goodwill.

The creation and release of the provision for impaired receivables has been included in administration costs in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Amounts charged to this provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
As of 31 March 2017, trade receivables of £0.6m (2016: £0.4m) were impaired and provided for. The individually impaired receivables

Capital risk management
In July 2014 the Group agreed an unsecured £70m revolving credit facility with a £30m accordion facility with Lloyds Bank plc, 
Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. The facility has a five-year tenure and consequently expires in July 2019.
The facility provides the Group with a sound financial structure for the medium term with £33.0m of headroom being available at 
31 March 2017 (2016: £28.8m), after taking into account net debt and ancillary facilities in use of £3.3m (2016: £2.4m). The Group 
has been in compliance with all banking covenants during the year.

19. Financial instruments
During the year the Group held financial instruments for two purposes:
 — financial instruments relating to the operations, financing and risks of the Group’s operations; and
 — financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Group’s bank debt.
Financial risk management 
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and energy price 
risk); credit risk; and liquidity risk. The Group actively seeks to limit the adverse effects of these risks on the financial performance of 
the Group.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies, primarily the US Dollar, 
the Euro and the South African Rand. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Through its centralised treasury function the Group seeks to hedge its UK-based transactional foreign exchange risk on a rolling 
annual basis through the use of forward exchange contracts and similar hedging instruments. The Group’s principal UK-based foreign 
currency exposures are largely hedged until at least March 2018 based on current forecasts. In the overseas businesses the policy is 
to hedge the local transactional risk to the extent this is permitted and not cost prohibitive.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translational risk. The Group 
seeks to mitigate this exposure through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies to the extent that this is considered 
to be commercially beneficial.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. The Group has the ability to secure a substantial proportion of its bank 
loans at fixed rates via interest rate swaps. However, due to the current level of debt and historically low UK LIBOR rates, the Group has 
decided not to take out any such swaps at the present time. This position is regularly reassessed.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
as well as credit exposures to customers. Each Group business is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk of potential 
customers prior to offering credit terms and uses independent ratings agencies, past trading experience and other factors in order to 
assess the credit quality of the customer. Additionally, the Group maintains a credit insurance policy for all its operations which covers 
a substantial portion of the Group’s trade debtors. For banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties with a strong 
rating are accepted.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s banking facilities are designed to ensure there are sufficient funds available for current operations and the Group’s further 
development plans. Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Group’s businesses on a rolling basis and is monitored centrally to 
ensure that sufficient cash is available to meet operational needs while maintaining an appropriate level of headroom on undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash, trade receivables and payables and forward exchange contracts. Based 
on the hierarchy defined in IFRS 7, the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 instruments. Consequently, fair value 
measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 March 2017 were €22.9m and US$48.0m 
(2016: €10.7m, US$39.1m and CNY¥1.2m).
The related forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next twelve 
months. Gains and losses recognised on forward exchange contracts to date have been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Sensitivity analysis
IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group’s profit and loss and equity of reasonably 
possible fluctuations in market rates. To demonstrate these, hypothetical variations of 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates 
and 5% strengthening or weakening in major currencies have been chosen.
(A) 1% increase or decrease on market interest rates for most of the coming year
As the Group has net debt of £23.4m (excluding unamortised finance costs) the effect of a 1% change in market interest rates would 
be a change in the net finance costs of approximately £0.2m per annum.
(B) 5% strengthening or weakening in major currencies
A number of the Group’s assets are held overseas and as such variations in foreign currencies will affect the carrying value of these 
assets. A 5% strengthening of Sterling across all currencies would lead to a £2.3m devaluation in net assets. Likewise a 5% weakening 
in Sterling would lead to a £2.5m increase in net assets.
The Group’s profits and losses are exposed to both translational and transactional risk of fluctuations in foreign currency risk. The 
Group seeks to mitigate the majority of its transactional risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. Taking into account both the 
translational impact and the level of forward exchange contracts in place relative to forecast foreign currency requirements, either a 
5% strengthening or a 5% weakening in both Sterling and South African Rand against all other currencies would have an impact on 
reported profits of less than £0.1m.
20. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
As previously announced, the main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020, 
with the latter amendment being substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. Consequently, the deferred tax asset at 31 March 2017 
reflects these rate changes.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method. The movement on the deferred tax account is as 
shown below:

The warranty provision has been recognised for expected claims on products which remain under warranty. It is expected that this 
expenditure will be incurred within five years of the Balance Sheet date.
The restructuring provision was recognised during the year in connection with the restructuring of the Group’s UK tiles business. 
Further details are provided in Note 5. It is expected that this expenditure will be incurred within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
The UK property provision relates to the expected liability arising from lease shortfall on the remaining surplus Group property. 
It is anticipated that the cash outflows will be incurred within six years of the Balance Sheet date. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report

22. Retirement benefit obligations
(a) Pension costs
Norcros Security Plan
The Norcros Security Plan (the Plan), the principal UK pension scheme of the Group’s UK subsidiaries, is funded by a separate trust 
fund which operates under UK trust law and is a separate legal entity from the Company. The Plan is governed by a Trustee company, 
which has a board currently composed of four employer representatives and three member representatives. The Trustee is required 
by law to act in the best interests of the Plan members and is responsible for setting policies together with the Company.
It is predominantly a defined benefit scheme, with a modest element of defined contribution benefits. Norcros plc itself has no 
employees other than the Directors and so has no liabilities in respect of these pension schemes. The scheme closed to new 
members and future accrual with effect from 1 April 2013, though active members retain a salary link. As a result of the closure a 
new defined contribution pension scheme was implemented to replace the Plan from the same date.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years (2016: 16 years) and can be attributed to the 
scheme members as follows:
2017 2016
Employee members 8% 8%
Deferred members 31% 31%
Pensioner members 61% 61%
Total 100% 100%
The Plan assets do not include any investments in the Company or any property or other assets utilised by the Company.
The Plan is funded by the Company based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ 
from those opposite. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and 
Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustee and the Company. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for the Group’s UK defined 
benefit pension was in March 2015 and showed a deficit of £73.5m (2012: £61.9m) representing an 84% funding level (2012: 85%). The 
increased deficit is driven predominantly by historically low gilt yields. Following the completion of the March 2015 triennial actuarial 
valuation a revised deficit recovery plan covering the subsequent ten years was agreed with the Scheme Trustee, with a cash contribution 
of £2.5m per annum starting in April 2016, and increasing with CPI. The balance of the deficit is expected to be met by asset outperformance 
as set out in the Plan’s Statement of Funding Principles. As a result of this agreement employer deficit recovery contributions in the 
year to 31 March 2018 are expected to be £2.5m.
In the year ended 31 March 2015 the Plan undertook a number of liability management exercises which resulted in a number of 
benefits being settled and some changes to pension increases in payment. The net impact of these exercises in 2015 was to reduce 
the net deficit by £1.7m with a further £0.4m reduction arising in 2016, which has been reflected in the Consolidated Income 
Statement as an exceptional operating item as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Liabilities extinguished on settlements — 2.0
Assets distributed on settlements — (1.6)
Total — 0.4
Risks
The Plan exposes the Company to a number of actuarial risks which may result in a material change in the net scheme deficit and 
potentially result in an increase in cash contributions in later years and higher charges being recognised in future Income Statements. 
Given the long-term time horizon of the scheme’s cash flows this may result in volatility in the valuation of the net scheme deficit from 
year to year. The main risks are set out below:
 — Mortality risk – the assumptions used by the Group allow for improvements in life expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves 
at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the Plan and consequently an increase in scheme liabilities. 
The Group regularly reviews the mortality assumptions to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption. 
 — Interest rate risk – a reduction in corporate bond yields would result in a lower discount rate being used to value the scheme 
liabilities and consequently result an increase in scheme liabilities. Additionally, an increase in inflation would increase the scheme 
liabilities as the majority of the pension payments increase in line with inflation, although there are a number of caps in place to 
ensure that the impact of high inflation is minimised. To mitigate some of the investment volatility a proportion of the scheme 
assets are held in liability-driven investments which involve hedging some of the Plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates and 
inflation by investing in assets that match the sensitivity of its liabilities. This means that if interest rates or inflation expectations 
change, assets and liabilities rise or fall together, and the funding level of the Plan should be less volatile. 98 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

(a) Pension costs continued
Risks continued
 — Investment risk and currency risk – a reduction in the value of investments caused by fluctuating exchange rates and a variety of 
other market factors would result in a lower valuation of scheme assets. The scheme invests in a diversified range of asset classes to 
mitigate the risk of falls in any one area of the investments and implements partial currency hedging on the overseas assets to 
mitigate currency risk.
Defined contribution pension schemes
Contributions made to these schemes amounted to £3.1m (2016: £2.7m), which includes £0.3m (2016: £0.4m) for the provision of life 
insurance cover.
(b) IAS 19R, ‘Employee benefits’
Norcros Security Plan
The valuation used for IAS 19R disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2015 and updated by 
KPMG, a firm of qualified actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19R in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 
31 March 2017. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2017.
(i) The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities of the Norcros Security Plan under IAS 19R are:
2017
Projected 
unit
2016
Projected 
unit
Discount rate 2.60% 3.55%
Inflation rate (RPI) 3.15% 2.90%
Inflation rate (CPI) 2.15% 1.90%
Increase to deferred benefits during deferment (non-GMP liabilities) 3.01% 2.83%
Increases to pensions in payment (other than pre-1988 GMP liabilities) 3.01% 2.83%
Salary increases 2.40% 2.15%
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are 
summarised below:
2017 2016
Life expectancy at age 65:
Current pensioners – males 21.1 21.4
Current pensioners – females 23.3 23.7
Future pensioners – males (currently aged 40) 22.5 23.2
Future pensioners – females (currently aged 40) 24.8 25.7
Members are assumed to take a 25% (2016: 25%) cash commutation sum on retirement.

Acquisition of Abode Home Products Limited
On 31 March 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Abode Home Products Limited (Abode), a leading niche 
designer and distributor of high quality kitchen taps, bathroom taps and kitchen sinks. Full details of the acquisition are provided on the 
Group’s website (www.norcros.com) and on page 104 of the Group’s 2016 Annual Report.
The consideration payable in respect of the acquisition was as follows:
£m
Consideration
Cash 3.7
Deferred consideration 1.1
4.8
In accordance with the sale and purchase agreement, an exercise to review the completion balance sheet at the date of acquisition 
was undertaken and following this a payment of £0.2m was made in line with the Group’s expectations. This payment has been 
disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows within investing activities. There have been no changes to the estimate of 
the remaining deferred consideration payable during the year.
Due to the fact that the acquisition took place on the last day of the previous accounting year it was not possible for the Group to 
finalise the fair values of Abode’s assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the amounts stated in the 2016 Annual Report were provisional and 
principally reflected the reported balances of Abode, as adjusted where possible to comply with the accounting policies of the Group.
The Group has now reviewed the identifiable net assets of Abode and has identified the following measurement period adjustments:
Provisional

£m
Measurement

Intangible assets — 2.6 2.6

Deferred tax liability — (0.5) (0.5)
Total identifiable net assets 1.9 2.1 4.0
Goodwill 2.9 (2.1) 0.8
Total 4.8 — 4.8
The principal adjustment that has been made in the measurement period is to recognise intangible assets of £2.6m. Deferred tax at 
the prevailing rate of 20% as of the date of acquisition has been applied where appropriate resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax 
liability of £0.5m. Due to the complex nature of these assets, it was not possible to reliably measure their value in the time available 
before publishing the 2016 Annual Report, and for this reason they have been recognised subsequent to the period of acquisition. 104 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

 — the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2017;
 — the Parent Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 — the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 — the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. 
We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the parent company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 61, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgments against available evidence, forming our own 
judgments, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

The new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 April 2016 are set out in the Group financial statements on page 74. None of these standards and interpretations has had any material 
effect on the Company’s results or net assets.
The standards, amendments and interpretations which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company are 
set out in the Group financial statements on page 74. None of these standards or interpretations is expected to have a material impact on 
the Company.
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, 
‘Reduced disclosure framework’ (FRS 101), on the going concern basis and under the historical convention modified for fair values, 
and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and with applicable accounting standards. Effective 1 April 2016 the Company 
transitioned from previously applicable UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to FRS 101.
These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with the reduced disclosure framework for all 
periods presented. A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented as permitted by 
Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in 
accordance with FRS 101:
 — the following paragraphs of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’:
 — 10(d) (statement of cash flows);
 — 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 — 111 (cash flow statement information); and
 — 134–136 (capital management disclosures);
 — IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’;
 — IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’;
 — IAS 24 (paragraph 17), ‘Related party disclosures’ – key management compensation; and
 — IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ – the requirement to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group.
As the Group financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken the exemptions available under FRS 101 
in respect of the following disclosures:
 — IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payments’, in respect of Group equity-settled share-based payments; and
 — certain disclosures required by IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, and disclosures required by IFRS 7, ‘Financial instrument: disclosures’. 110 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
1. Statement of accounting policies continued
Critical estimates and judgments
The Directors believe that there is one critical accounting estimate as set out below:
 — deferred tax – deferred tax assets are recognised on certain timing differences only to the extent that it is probable they will be 
available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers the 
regulations applicable to taxation and whether there are likely to be sufficient future taxable profits. Future taxable profits may be 
higher or lower than estimates made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax asset and the amount to be recorded. 
Furthermore changes to the legislative framework or application of tax law may result in a management reassessment of the level 
of recognition of deferred tax assets. 
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. The Directors believe the carrying value of 
investments is supported by their underlying assets and cash flow projections derived from detailed budgets and forecasts. Dividends 
received from investments are included within turnover and recognised on receipt of the dividend.
Foreign currency transactions
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates applicable at the year end. Exchange 
gains and losses are dealt with in arriving at operating profit.
Taxation
Deferred taxation has been recognised as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the Balance Sheet date that give rise to an 
obligation to pay more taxation in the future or a right to pay less taxation in the future. An asset is recognised only when the transfer 
of economic benefits is more likely than not to occur.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or when paid if earlier.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Company measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration 
received. Transaction costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are 
included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Income Statement over the duration 
of the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Notes
1.  A member who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint another person, or two or more persons, in respect 
of different shares held by him, as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote at the meeting.
2.  The right of a member of the Company to vote at the meeting will be determined by reference to the register of members. A member 
must be registered on that register as the holder of ordinary shares of 10p each (ordinary shares) by close of business on 25 July 2017 
in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting as a member in respect of those shares.
3.  A member wishing to attend and vote at the meeting in person should arrive prior to the time fixed for its commencement. A member 
that is a corporation can only attend and vote at the meeting in person through one or more representatives appointed in accordance 
with Section 323 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended. Any such representative should bring to the meeting written evidence 
of his appointment, such as a certified copy of a board resolution of, or a letter from, the corporation concerned confirming the 
appointment. Any member wishing to vote at the meeting without attending in person or (in the case of a corporation) through 
its duly appointed representative must appoint a proxy to do so. Forms for the appointment of a proxy that can be used for this 
purpose have been provided to members with this Notice of Annual General Meeting. To be valid, a proxy appointment form 
must be completed in accordance with the instructions that accompany it and then be delivered (together with any power of 
attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such item) to Capita Asset Services, PXS at The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU so as to be received by 11.00 am on 25 July 2017. Alternatively, a member may 
appoint a proxy online by following the instructions for the electronic appointment of a proxy at www.signalshares.com. If you 
have not previously registered to use this facility you will require your investor code which can be located on the enclosed proxy 
form. In order to be a valid proxy appointment, the member’s electronic message confirming the details of the appointment 
completed in accordance with those instructions must be transmitted so as to be received by the same time. Members who hold 
their shares in uncertificated form may also use the CREST voting service to appoint a proxy electronically, as explained below. 
Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting should he so wish.
4.  Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights under 
Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended (a nominated person), may have a right under an agreement between him 
and that member to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a nominated person has no 
such right or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned 
as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement in note 1 above of the rights of a member in relation to the appointment of 
proxies does not apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only be exercised by the member concerned.
5.  Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll, rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting 
as members’ votes are counted according to the number of ordinary shares held. As soon as practicable following the meeting, 
the results of the voting at the meeting and the numbers of proxy votes cast for and against, together with the number of votes 
actively withheld in respect of, each of the resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and will also be 
placed on the Company’s website: www.norcros.com.
6.  As at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document), (i) the Company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 61,259,666 ordinary shares carrying one vote each and (ii) the total voting rights in the Company were 61,259,666.
7.  Each member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting which, 
in accordance with Section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, and subject to some exceptions, the Company must 
cause to be answered. Information relating to the meeting which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006, as amended, 
to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at www.norcros.com. A member may not use any electronic 
address provided by the Company in this document or with any proxy appointment form or in any website for communicating 
with the Company for any purpose in relation to the meeting other than as expressly stated in it.
8.  It is possible that, pursuant to members’ requests made in accordance with Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, 
the Company will be required to publish on a website a statement in accordance with Section 528 of that Act setting out any matter 
that the members concerned propose to raise at the meeting relating to the audit of the Company’s latest audited accounts. 
The Company cannot require the member concerned to pay its expenses in complying with those sections. The Company 
must forward any such statement to its auditor by the time it makes the statement available on the website. The business that 
may be dealt with at the meeting includes any such statement. 118 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes continued
9.  CREST members who wish to appoint one or more proxies through the CREST system may do so by using the procedures described 
in the CREST voting service section of the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed one or more voting service providers, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or a proxy 
instruction made using the CREST voting service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST proxy appointment instruction) 
must be properly authenticated in accordance with the specifications of CREST’s operator, Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (Euroclear) 
and must contain all the relevant information required by the CREST manual. To be valid, the message (regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must be 
transmitted so as to be received by Capita Asset Services (ID RA10), as the Company’s issuer’s agent, by 11.00 am on 25 July 2017. 
After this time, any change of instruction to a proxy appointed through the CREST system should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means. The time of the message’s receipt will be taken to be when (as determined by the timestamp applied by the 
CREST Applications Host) Capita Asset Services is first able to retrieve it by enquiry through the CREST system in the prescribed 
manner. Euroclear does not make available special procedures in the CREST system for transmitting any particular message. 
Normal system timings and limitations apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy appointment instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or a CREST sponsored member 
or has appointed any voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action 
as is necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. CREST members 
and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should take into account the provisions of the CREST 
manual concerning timings as well as its section on “Practical limitations of the system”. In certain circumstances, the Company 
may, in accordance with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 or the CREST manual, treat a CREST proxy appointment 
instruction as invalid.
10.  The Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication which it 
sends but does not accept responsibility for any loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachment sent 
by the Company. The Company recommends that members subject all emails and attachments to virus checking procedures 
prior to opening or use. Any electronic communication received by the Company or Capita Asset Services (including the 
lodgement of an electronic proxy form) which is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
11.  Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours each business day and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes 
prior to and during the meeting.
12.  Information regarding this meeting, including information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, is available at

Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 119
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will take place at 11.00 am on 27 July 2017 at The Mere Golf Resort & Spa, Chester Road, 
Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire WA16 6LJ. The notice convening that meeting, together with the resolutions to be proposed, appears on 
pages 114 to 118 of this document. The Directors recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of all of the resolutions to be proposed, 
as the Directors intend to do so in respect of their own shares, and consider that they are in the best interests of the Company and the 
shareholders as a whole.
Explanatory notes in relation to the resolutions appear below:
Resolution 1
Report and accounts
For each financial year, the Directors are required to present the audited accounts, the auditor’s report and the Directors’ Report 
to shareholders at a general meeting.
Resolution 2
Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, shareholders are invited to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017. The vote on this resolution is advisory only and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional 
on it being passed
The Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2017 is set out in full on pages 42 to 58 of the Company’s Annual Report 
and Accounts 2017. For the purposes of this resolution, the Directors’ Remuneration Report does not include the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy which is set out on pages 44 to 50 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2017. Any shareholder who would like a copy of the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2017 can obtain one by contacting our registrar on 0871 6640300. Alternatively, the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
can be viewed on our website at www.norcros.com.
Resolution 3
Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 44 to 50 
of the Annual Report and Accounts 2017. The vote on this resolution is binding and, if passed, will mean that the Directors can only 
make remuneration payments in accordance with the approved policy unless such payments have otherwise been approved by a 
separate shareholder resolution. The Company is required to ensure that a vote on its remuneration policy takes place annually unless 
the approved policy remains unchanged, in which case the Company need only propose a similar resolution at least every three years.
The shareholders of the Company approved the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the Company’s 2014 AGM and in 2015 and 
2016 there were no changes to that policy. The policy proposed for approval by shareholders at this year’s AGM is broadly the same as 
the previous policy, subject to some minor amendments, which are explained on page 44 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2017.
Resolution 4
Dividend
The payment of the final dividend requires the approval of shareholders in general meeting. If the meeting approves resolution 4, the 
final dividend of 4.8p per ordinary share will be paid on 3 August 2017 to ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members on 
23 June 2017 in respect of each ordinary share.

The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting before which accounts are laid, to hold office until the end of 
the next such meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated that it is willing to continue as the Company’s auditor for another year. 
You are therefore asked to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit Committee has reviewed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s

re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Resolution 11

Resolution 12
SAYE
Resolution 12 is to authorise the adoption of the Norcros plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2017 (SAYE). The SAYE is an 
all-employee share scheme that takes advantage of the beneficial tax status of savings related share option schemes which comply with 
Schedule 3 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. Participation in the SAYE will be open to all employees and encourages 
employees to build a stake in the Company. The principal terms of the SAYE are set out on pages 123 to 124 of this document.
The rules of the SAYE will be available for inspection during normal business hours on Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays) at the 
Company’s registered office at Ladyfield House, Station Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 1BU and at the offices of Addleshaw Goddard LLP

AGM for at least 15 minutes before, and during, the meeting. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 121
Resolution 13
Power to allot shares
Most listed companies renew their directors’ authority to issue shares at each annual general meeting. Such an authority was granted 
at last year’s Annual General Meeting and is due to expire on 27 October 2018 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company. In accordance with best practice, this resolution seeks to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares.
Resolution 13, if passed, will renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal value of £4,083,977 (representing 40,839,770 ordinary shares). This represents the The Investment Association’s guideline 
limit of approximately two thirds of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this document). Of this amount, ordinary shares to an aggregate nominal value of £2,041,988.50 (representing 20,419,885 
ordinary shares which is approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 13 June 2017 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this document)) can only be allotted pursuant to a rights issue.
As at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares 
in the Company in treasury. The renewed authority will remain in force until 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, 
at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2018.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority. The purpose of giving the Directors this authority is to maintain 
the Company’s flexibility to take advantage of any appropriate opportunities that may arise.
Resolutions 14 and 15
Disapplication of pre-emption rights for “customary” 5% and disapplication of pre-emption rights in relation to acquisitions 
and specified capital investments
The Directors are currently authorised, subject to certain limitations, to issue securities of the Company for cash without first offering 
them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. That authority will expire on 27 October 2018 or, if earlier, 
at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and, in accordance with best practice, resolutions 14 and 15 
(which will be proposed as special resolutions) seek to renew the Directors’ authority to disapply pre-emption rights as referenced below.
Other than in connection with a rights or other similar issue or where, for example, difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas 
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements, the authority contained in resolution 14 will be limited to an aggregate nominal 
value of £306,298. This aggregate nominal amount equates to approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
as at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice of Annual General Meeting). Resolution 14 
follows guidance from the Pre-Emption Group’s revised Statement of Principles, published on 12 March 2015, and adopts the 
Pre-Emption Group’s template wording that was published on 5 May 2016.
In line with the revised Statement of Principles, the Company is seeking authority, pursuant to resolution 15, to issue up to an additional 
5% of its issued ordinary share capital for cash without pre-emption rights applying. In accordance with the revised Statement of 
Principles, and the Pre-Emption Group’s template wording issued on 5 May 2016, the Company will only allot shares with a nominal 
value of up to £306,298 (representing 5% of issued ordinary share capital) pursuant to resolution 15 where that allotment is in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital investment (within the meaning given in the Statement of Principles) which is announced 
contemporaneously with the allotment, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the 
announcement of the allotment.
This renewed authority will remain in force until 15 months after the passing of resolution 15 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting in 2018.
In accordance with the Statement of Principles (which is supported by The Investment Association and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings 
Association (formerly National Association of Pension Funds Limited)), the Board confirms its intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued 
share capital will be issued for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to resolutions 14 and 15 during any rolling three-year period. 122 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Resolution 16
Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, is a resolution which the Company proposes to seek on an annual 
basis, in line with other listed companies in the UK, to give the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006. The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to an aggregate maximum 
of 6,125,966 ordinary shares which have an aggregate nominal value of £612,596.60 (representing approximately 10% of the aggregate 
nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of this document)) and sets minimum and maximum prices. The renewed authority will remain in force until 15 months 
after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2018.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares, but will keep the 
matter under review, taking into account other investment opportunities. The authority will be exercised only if the Directors believe 
that to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and would promote the success of the Company and be in the best 
interests of its shareholders generally. To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury (see below), earnings per share 
will be enhanced until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. If any shares are 
purchased, they will be either cancelled or held in treasury. Any such decision will be made by the Directors at the time of purchase on 
the basis of the shareholders’ best interests. Shares held in treasury can be cancelled, sold for cash or, in appropriate circumstances, used 
to meet obligations under employee share schemes. Any shares held in treasury would not be eligible to vote nor would any dividend be 
paid on any such shares. If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares, then 
such shares would be immediately cancelled, in which event the number of ordinary shares in issue would be reduced.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice. Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares gives 
the Company the ability to re-issue them quickly and cost effectively and provides the Company with additional flexibility in the 
management of its capital base.
As at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), there were warrants and options over 
3,955,017 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 6.46% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options and warrants 
would represent approximately 7.17% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at 13 June 2017 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.
Resolution 17
Notice of general meeting
This special resolution is required in order to preserve the ability of the Company to convene general meetings (other than Annual 
General Meetings) of the Company on not less than 14 clear days’ notice, rather than on not less than the 21 days’ notice which would 
otherwise be required. In order to preserve this ability, the Company’s shareholders must have approved the calling of such meetings 
on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. Resolution 17 seeks such approval.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by 
the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of the shareholders as a whole.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be 
proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic proxy submission under the Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations 2009 before it can call a general meeting on such notice. Corporate governance Overview Financial statements Strategic report
Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 123
Summary of the main provisions of the Norcros plc savings related share option scheme 2017 (SAYE)
General
The SAYE is a savings related share option scheme designed to take advantage of the tax beneficial status of savings related share 
option schemes which comply with Schedule 3 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (Schedule 3). 
The SAYE will be administered by the board of directors of the Company (Board) or a duly authorised committee of the Board.
Eligibility
UK employees and full-time directors of the Company and participating companies within the group are eligible to participate in the 
SAYE. The Board may, however, determine that a qualifying period of service (of up to one year) is required before an employee or 
full-time director can participate in the SAYE.
The Savings Contract
To participate in the SAYE, an eligible employee must enter into a Save As You Earn contract (Savings Contract) with the savings body 
designated by the Board, agreeing to make monthly contributions of between £5 and £500 for a specified savings period of three or 
five years (or such other period as may be specified from time to time under Schedule 3). The Board has discretion to determine the 
length of the Savings Contracts that will be available in respect of any invitation to apply for options (three years, five years or both). 
A bonus determined by HMRC may be payable after the expiration of the savings period.
Applications to participate in the SAYE may be scaled down by the Board if applications exceed the number of shares available for the 
grant of options. Such scaling down may include:
(a) excluding the HMRC bonus;
(b) reducing monthly contributions above a certain level pro rata; 
(c) reducing monthly contributions for each eligible employee pro rata; or 
(d) treating elections for five-year Savings Contracts as elections for three-year Savings Contracts.
Option price
The option price for each ordinary share in respect of which an option is granted shall not be less than the greater of: 
(a)  80% of the closing middle-market quotation as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the dealing day 
immediately prior to the date on which the invitation to participate in the SAYE is made (or, if the Board so determines, the average 
of the closing mid-market quotations for the three dealing days immediately prior to the invitation date); and 
(b) the nominal value of the shares.
Grant of options
The number of shares over which options may be granted must as nearly as possible be equal to, but not in excess of, that number 
of shares which may be purchased out of the repayment proceeds (including, if the Board so determines, any bonus payable) of the 
relevant Savings Contract at the option price.
Subject to any regulatory restrictions, options under the SAYE may only be granted within the period of 30 days following the date on 
which the option price is determined or, if the option price is determined over three consecutive dealing days, within 30 days after the 
earliest of those dealing days.
No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the SAYE.
Options granted under the SAYE may not be transferred (other than on death). 
No consideration will be required for the grant of the option.
Benefits under the SAYE are not pensionable.
Limits on the issue of shares
In any ten-year period no more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company for the time being may be issued or 
issuable pursuant to rights acquired under the SAYE and any other employees’ share plans established by the Company. For the 
purposes of this limit, options or other rights to acquire shares which lapse or have been released do not count.  124 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Summary of the main provisions of the Norcros plc savings related share option scheme 2017 (SAYE) 
continued
Exercise of options
Options will only normally be exercisable for a period of six months commencing on the third or fifth anniversary (as the case may be) 
of the starting date of the related Savings Contract and, if not exercised by the end of that period, the option will lapse.
Earlier exercise may, however, be permitted in specified circumstances, including:
(a)  termination of employment as a result of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or the sale of the subsidiary or business 
for which the participant works; and
(b) in the event of a takeover or liquidation of the Company.
In these early exercise circumstances, options will only be exercisable to the extent of the savings in the relevant Savings Contract 
at the date of exercise. 
Rights attaching to shares
All shares allotted or transferred under the SAYE will rank pari passu with all other shares of the Company for the time being in issue 
(save as regards any rights attaching to such shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of allotment or transfer) and the 
Company will apply for the listing of any new shares issued under the SAYE.
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company, options will become exercisable for a limited period. 
Alternatively, options may be exchanged for new equivalent options over shares in the acquiring company where appropriate.
Variation of capital
In the event of any rights or capitalisation issue, sub-division, consolidation, reduction or other variation of the ordinary share capital, 
the Board may make such adjustments as it considers appropriate to the number of shares subject to options and/or the price payable 
on the exercise of options.
Amendments to the SAYE
The Board may alter the provisions of the SAYE in any respect provided that the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting 
is obtained for alterations or additions to the advantage of participants to provisions relating to eligibility, option price and variation, 
limits on the number of newly issued shares available under the SAYE or the rights attaching to options or Shares.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply in relation to any alteration or addition which 
is minor in nature and made to benefit the administration of the SAYE, to take account of any changes in legislation or to obtain 
or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the Company, any of its subsidiaries or for participants.
Termination
The SAYE will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its adoption, or such earlier time as the Board may determine, but the rights 
of existing participants will not be affected by such termination. In the event of termination, no further options will be granted.
Employees outside the UK
The Board may at any time without further shareholder approval establish appendices to the SAYE or further share plans corresponding 
to the SAYE for the benefit of employees in non-UK jurisdictions. Any such appendices or plans will be similar to the SAYE, but modified 
to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws, provided that any shares made available under such further appendices 
or plans are treated as counting against the relevant limits in the SAYE.  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
