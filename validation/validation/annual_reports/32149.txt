Strategic report The performance of the Group 
against our strategy underpins 
our confidence in delivering our 
long-established sector-leading 
dividend policy.
Pennon’s long-established 10-year 
dividend policy of 4% year-on-year 
growth above RPI inflation to 2020 
results in a doubling of dividend over 
10 years (2010-2020)
(1)
. This reflects 
the Board’s confidence in the continued 
outperformance of our water business 
and our significant investment in our 
waste business, which is successfully 
delivering on its targeted contribution 
to Group earnings.

Strategic report Chairman’s  
statement
Sir John Parker 
Chairman
 Pennon Group performed 
well in the year, delivering on 
its strategy of market-leading 
performance across its 
businesses. 
Dear Shareholder
Pennon Group performed well in the year, delivering 
on its strategy of market-leading performance, 
efficiency and investing for growth. The Group has the 
UK’s top two water businesses as measured by return 
on regulated equity (RoRE) while Viridor’s expanding 
portfolio of Energy Recovery Facilities (ERFs) is on 
track to generate further growth in earnings over the 
next few years. The Group’s Shared Services Review 
addressed a key strategic objective to drive value 
through increased efficiency during the year.
The Group’s final dividend of 24.87 pence per 
share reflects an increase of 7.1% and maintains 
our long-standing sector-leading dividend policy 
of RPI plus 4% year-on-year growth. This should 
see dividends per share almost doubling over 
10 years to 2020. 
Pennon is committed to 
providing a safe place for our 
people to work, where health 
and wellbeing comes first.
Since my previous report we have continued to make 
good progress in establishing an effective Group 
structure by drawing together all aspects of the 
Group under the Pennon umbrella. Our CEO, with the 
support of a high-calibre executive team, is pulling 
together support functions at Group level that were 
previously held within each subsidiary. The two 
Managing Directors who are running the water and 
waste businesses as operational divisions report 
directly to the CEO. Pennon’s Non-Executive 
Directors are now also members of the South West 
Water board, along with three dedicated South West 
Water non-executive directors, one of which is 
currently a vacancy.
Safety
The position of health and safety as the first item 
on the agenda for every Board meeting reflects the 
importance I and my colleagues attach to this crucial 
area. It also underlines our determination to increase 
employee engagement, address the culture and 
behaviours that lead to accidents and learn all 
relevant lessons for the future from any incident. 
Regrettably, a tragic incident occurred in August 
2016, resulting in the death of a Viridor employee 
whilst at work. Our thoughts are with his family, 
friends and colleagues as we work with the Health 
and Safety Executive in relation to this incident. 
08
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 We strive for the highest standards of health and 
safety to achieve our objective of a harm free 
environment. Pennon is committed to providing a 
safe place for our people to work where health and 
wellbeing comes first. The Board has supported the 
appointment of a Group director of Safety, Health, 
Quality and Sustainability, who will devise and 
implement a strategy to raise the Group’s health 
and safety performance.
Employees and culture 
Throughout the Group, there is a spirit of pride and 
professionalism and these are key qualities at a time 
of change. We have no shortage of new talent joining 
the company too, through graduate recruitment 
and our award-winning apprenticeship programmes. 
We are determined to recognise talent in both the 
Group’s businesses and to support development 
of people from early on in their careers, not just in 
top-level succession planning. 
As many aspects of the Group’s structure are still 
relatively new, we intend to provide more information 
about Pennon’s culture and values in next year’s 
annual report. Our subsidiary companies each have 
a strong sense of purpose supported by their own 
set of corporate values and this provides a sound 
foundation on which to build. I firmly believe that by 
getting the structure and governance of the Group 
right, and by attracting and developing the right 
people, the right culture and values will follow.
We are developing a culture 
that can be lived throughout 
the Group.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the Board, I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all our employees for their 
professional approach and their dedication to the 
many communities and stakeholders we serve daily. 
Shared services and other 
Group synergies 
Efforts to centralise key corporate services and 
operational functions following the Shared Services 
Review reflecting our more unified Group are 
progressing well. This is part of an efficiency 
programme that is increasing integration, 
encouraging the sharing of best practice and 
creating shareholder value. This work has been 
facilitated by the creation of the role of Group Chief 
Executive Officer, which has now been in existence 
for over a year and is binding the Pennon Group more 
closely together.
Sustainability
As a leading environmental infrastructure company, 
the Group actively contributes to the UK’s long-term 
needs for water, energy and waste management and 
we aim to ensure that all our business activities have 
a positive economic, social and environmental impact. 
Our evaluation of risk consistently addresses 
sustainability requirements. The Board’s Sustainability 
Committee oversaw the Group’s performance during 
the year in maintaining a responsible approach to 
business operations.

Governance
Key achievements during the year
 • The Non-Executive Directors have quickly 
adapted to their expanded roles in respect of the 
subsidiary businesses
 • We have created new senior executive roles at 
Group level and have brought in subject matter 
specialists of a high calibre who will drive a 
consistent and effective approach in safety, health 
and environmental impact
 • The new Group executive meeting arrangements 
have allowed the senior executives from Pennon, 
South West Water and Viridor to operate 
collaboratively in one forum when dealing with 
Group-wide issues
 • The change is also facilitating holistic discussion and 
has improved communications across the Group with 
clear lines of sight into the subsidiary companies
 • The administration required to support the Board 
has come together quickly.
Read more pages 54 to 62
Culture and values
 • We are working with employees to bring together 
a core set of organisational values and build a 
culture that can be lived throughout the Group
 • This process is drawing on the heritage and 
strengths of our principal operations
 • Six pillars (set out on pages 14-15) underpin our 
values that will be shaped by employees during 
the year ahead
 • Our customer-facing businesses Viridor, South 
West Water and Bournemouth Water are 
established brands that are recognised and 
valued by the public 
 • We are already bringing our businesses closer 
together under new and modern branding.

Strategic report Governance
The Group’s revised framework for governance and 
decision-making introduced in April 2016 is operating 
well and allowing us to pursue synergies across the 
Group. Further details are provided on pages 58 to 
62. Our Senior Independent Director, Gill Rider, 
completed an assessment during the year of the 
new approach. This was conducted alongside an 
independent external evaluation of the Board’s 
structure, operation and performance. Based 
on these appraisals and on my own experience, 
I believe the Group has a robust governance 
structure that is delivering efficient and transparent 
decision-making while preserving the degree of 
regulatory independence that Ofwat requires for 
the water business. I commend the Group’s 
commitment to the new governance framework.
The Group has a robust 
governance structure that 
is delivering efficient and 
transparent decision-making.
Board changes
Ian McAulay stepped down as the Chief Executive 
Officer of Viridor during the year and we thank him 
for his contribution and wish him well in the future. 
Phil Piddington was appointed to the new role of 
Managing Director of Viridor in September 2016. 
The change in the management team and structure 
at Viridor, which mirrors the arrangements in place 
at South West Water, better reflects the objectives 
of the Group and will drive stronger accountability. 
Moreover, the appointment of Phil Piddington 
demonstrates that the Group is adding new skills 
and executing succession planning well. 
Steve Johnson stepped down as a non-executive 
director of South West Water in April 2016 following 
his appointment to a new external executive position.
Rigorous testing is a 
key part of ensuring 
a high quality water 
supply for customers

Pennon Board 
visits  Ardley ERF
Board members regularly visit operational 
sites and take the opportunity to meet 
employees and see a plant at work. In April 
2016 the Board visited Bournemouth Water’s 
headquarters and received a tour of the water 
treatment works.
The Board meeting in February 2017 was held 
at Ardley ERF and included a tour of the plant 
and its award-winning Visitor Centre which 
received 3,483 visitors this year. 
Board members also met the Ardley-based 
Energy trading team that implements the 
Group’s energy risk management strategy 
and has aligned energy contracts to optimise 
cost and carbon benefits. This same team 
also manages the energy trading for both 
output and usage, which has helped the 
Group achieve greater energy efficiency.

Strategic report Market  
overview
With clear market opportunities for both the 
water and waste businesses, the Group is 
well prepared to capitalise on the changing 
regulatory water markets and is in a strong 
position to deliver growth through its 
increasing market share of the UK’s 
energy recovery operations.

16
operators  
in the UK 
The water industry serves 50 million 
household and business customers in 
England and Wales, who are supplied with 
drinking water and have their wastewater 
taken away and treated. These services are 
provided by 16 privately-owned regional 
companies of which 10 are providers of both 
water and wastewater services. 
The UK water industry supplies clean water 
to properties through a mains network that 
is 420,000km long (source: Water UK). 
It manages more than 16 billion litres of 
wastewater a day through 624,200km 
of sewers and 9,000 wastewater 
treatment plants. 
(1) There are six regional companies. In addition 
there are nine other small water providers.

Water regulators 
DEFRA sets the overall water and sewerage 
policy framework in England.  
Ofwat is the economic regulator for the water 
sector in England and Wales. Every five years 
companies submit business plans as part of  
a Price Review process. South West Water’s 
2015-20 plan was awarded ‘enhanced’ status 
as part of the 2014 Price Review. 
The Environment Agency (EA) is the 
principal environmental regulator of the 
water and sewerage sector. 
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) 
is the drinking water quality regulator. 
They check companies supply safe drinking 
water and meet Water Quality Regulations.
The Consumer Council for Water (CCWater) 
represents consumers and takes up 
unresolved complaints.

Non-household 
retail market 
On 1 April 2017, the non-household retail 
market was opened, allowing up to 1.2 million 
businesses and other non-household 
customers across the country to choose 
which retailer they buy water and 
wastewater services from.
The non-household market operates 
through a controlled portal operated by the 
Market Operator Services Limited (MOSL). It 
has required the separation of the wholesale 
and retail arms of water businesses. 
Pennon Water Services (PWS) was 
established to manage the non-household 
retail business for Pennon and has formed a 
retail venture with South Staffordshire plc.

15 million tonnes of municipal household 
waste and 11 million tonnes of commercial 
and industrial waste. All the ERFs in the UK 
processed a combined 12 million tonnes of 
this waste in 2016. Our facilities processed 
two million tonnes in 2016. 
We expect that new ERFs being constructed 
will increase the UK’s energy from waste 
capacity to c.15-16 million tonnes by 2020. 
During the same period Viridor will bring into 
operation ERFs at Glasgow, Beddington, 
Dunbar and Avonmouth, providing a total 
capacity for Viridor ERFs of 3.2 million 
tonnes of waste.

Recycled waste 
materials
4m
tonnes of recyclable 
waste materials 
processed in the  
UK in 2016
Viridor is a market leader in processing 
comingled waste streams (where recyclables 
are mixed in the same bin) collected by 
councils and their contractors. In 2016, we 
processed c.0.7 million tonnes of comingled 
mixed recyclable waste out of an estimated 
total of four million tonnes, indicating a 18% 
market share in comingled recyclate. 
The volume of waste for recycling is 
expected to increase marginally reflecting 
population growth and possibly more so, 
if national and local government policies, 
especially in England, align to encourage 
further recycling. 45% of household waste 
is currently recycled against the existing 
national target to recycle 50% of household 
waste by 2020.

Waste to landfill
The UK mainland disposed of 12.5 million 
tonnes of active waste (i.e. household black 
bag waste and similar unrecyclable waste 
from industrial and commercial sources) into 
landfills in 2016 compared to 13.7 million 
tonnes in 2015. In 2016 our landfill sites 
received 1.7 million tonnes of active waste, 
which comprised 14% market share. 
In addition to this, we received 0.7 million 
tonnes of inert inactive waste for daily cover 
and restoration purposes. 
We expect the volume of waste being sent 
to landfill to continue to reduce as the 
availability of ERFs increase, with an ongoing 
baseline requirement for landfill disposal of 
waste that is not suitable for recycling 
or recovery.

Strategic report
17 Our 
people
The talent, 
professionalism and 
commitment of our 
people is key to 
the delivery of our 
strategic objectives. 
We continue to invest in the 
skills and career progression 
of our staff.
Workplace strategy
Our goal is to attract and retain talented people with 
the knowledge, skills, values and behaviours required 
to deliver the Group’s long term goals and objectives. 
Underpinning this, and in line with human rights 
principles, we have a range of policies covering health 
and safety, equal opportunities, diversity, ethics and 
employee relations. All elements of our workplace 
strategy apply to both our permanent and temporary 
workers and we expect suppliers and contractors 
to comply with relevant legislation and to hold 
similar principles. 
Abdul Warsame carrying out 
maintenance at Ardley ERF 
Our continued investment in our people is a 
cornerstone of the Group’s ability to create shareholder 
value. In support of this, Pennon has started work on 
a new Group-wide people strategy and will roll this 
out before the end of the 2017/18 reporting year.
Health and safety
Our policy is to provide and maintain a safe working 
environment while preventing injury and ill health 
wherever possible. We continue to target 
improvement through training programmes 
focusing on behaviours and attitudes as well as risk 
awareness and risk control and the ability to learn 
from accidents or near misses. As the reporting of 
near misses has increased, RIDDOR* injury incidence 
rates have dropped across the Group. Viridor 
reported an improvement for 2016 and South West 
Water achieved a better performance on a like-for-
like basis (excluding Bournemouth Water).
Earlier this year, Pennon announced a new vision 
and strategy for health and safety, designed to 
raise standards, prevent harm and create a culture 
of safety across its businesses. We call our new 
health and safety programme ‘HomeSafe’ and it 
represents a wide-ranging agenda of consolidation 
and improvement, which focuses on people, process 
and the physical environment.
* Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations.
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017
18 Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct sets out the principles we believe 
should guide our actions. These principles apply equally 
to permanent and temporary employees and we expect 
our suppliers and contractors to comply with equivalent 
guidance. Employee training courses have been 
developed around the Code of Conduct that focus on 
specific aspects relating to legal and ethical behaviour. 
Employee engagement
We believe motivated and engaged people 
value their own health and safety and that of their 
colleagues, drive greater productivity, and aspire 
to deliver higher levels of customer satisfaction. 
Across the Group, over 3,800 of our people (78%) 
completed annual employment engagement surveys, 
in line with previous years. Importantly, for the first 
time, we brought together all of the leaders across 
the Group to discuss the results and agree key 
actions. These actions are focused on engaging our 
people in our strategy, supporting our people better 
as we evolve as an organisation, and providing more 
opportunities to engage in two-way communication.
Employee development
We continue to invest in the skills and career 
progression of our staff through a range of schemes 
and training opportunities, ranging from operational 
upskilling programmes to management training.
In the water business, this included specialist 
training for our call handlers in a range of skills 
including a programme with the mental health 
charity MIND, designed to help call handlers 
recognise if a customer is struggling to pay their 
bills owing to stress or depression. This has helped 
to improve our management of income recovery, 
which during 2016/17 was our best-ever.
In Viridor, we have continued to support 24 individuals 
undertaking a foundation degree specifically designed 
for the business, and launched a management 
development programme which 76 of our senior 
leaders completed during the year.
Community initiatives
Our employees are enthusiastic participants in 
the Group’s volunteering programmes. Viridor 
employees volunteered 99 days, including activities 
with Somerset Wildlife Trust to transform a neglected 
area close to the River Tone in Taunton, Somerset. 
Throughout December, Viridor’s Manchester Trafford 
Park team helped out Key 103’s Cash for Kids Mission 
Christmas appeal, collecting donated toys from 
Greater Manchester residents. 
South West Water staff took part in educational 
outreach programmes alongside the region’s Wildlife 
Trusts and participated in Keep Britain Tidy’s 
BeachCare programme. Since 2010, South West 
Water has supported 830 beach cleans which have 
collected more than 120 tonnes of rubbish. 
Diversity and equal opportunities
The Board continues to promote equality of 
opportunity and diversity across the Group in all 
areas, including gender and ethnicity. Although some 
progress has been made on diversity in certain areas 
across the Group, this still remains a key area of focus 
and diversity specific actions are being reviewed as 
part of the wider sustainability agenda. 
Gender diversity
In South West Water 27% of the workforce is female 
(an increase of 2% from last year). We do have some 
areas of under-representation for example in our craft 
and industrial group where the proportion of women 
is less than 1%. We are committed to focusing on this 
as an area for improvement in line with the industry.
The majority of Viridor’ s employees are male (85%), 
reflecting a traditionally male-dominated industry. 
The ratio is similar across senior management with 
16% female. Of those employed directly by Pennon, 
45% are women. We are committed to improving 
senior management gender ratios in time across the 
Group through initiatives such as informal mentoring 
programmes and family friendly policies.
A working group is ensuring Pennon complies with 
new legislation on gender pay equality that requires 
certain companies to publish information on 
their gender pay gap and report this data to the 
UK Government. 
We believe fully 
engaged staff 
facilitate better 
safety, greater 
productivity and 
higher customer 
satisfaction.

Chris Loughlin
Chief Executive Officer
 Our strategy is to 
lead in the UK’s water 
and waste sectors, 
drive value through 
efficiency and invest for 
sustainable growth. 
Pennon Group achieved a strong performance in 
2016/17. Our strategy is to lead in the UK’s water 
and waste sectors, invest for growth and drive value 
through efficiency. I am pleased to say the Group is 
delivering against each of its strategic objectives 
while achieving a return for shareholders in a 
responsible and sustainable way. 
Health and safety
During the year we were shocked and saddened 
by the death of Viridor worker Rafal Swiadek at 
the Materials Recycling Facility in Milton Keynes. 
No fatality is acceptable and I want to underline 
the Group’s commitment to health and safety. 
In January 2017 we created the new role of director 
of Safety, Health, Quality and Sustainability (SHQS) 
and appointed Steve Holmes, who previously held 
the role of Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
director for Amec Foster Wheeler. He brings many 
years of senior experience in operations, health and 
safety from industries including oil and gas, nuclear, 
power and rail. 
This appointment is an important development for 
Pennon because it reflects our commitment at the 
highest level to improve health and safety by utilising 
concepts and learnings from other high hazard 
industries. Steve has a mandate from the Board to 
implement an enhanced strategy that will raise the 
Group’s performance and reinforce health and safety 
as core to Pennon’s way of working. Our ambition is 
to be the health and safety leader in the UK water 
and waste sectors and, to that end, we have launched 
our HomeSafe programme (see page 18). As we 
pursue our ambition, we can expect to see changes 
to how we evaluate and control risk, how we engage 
with our employees, and how we build greater 
leadership and accountability for health and safety. 
Leadership in water and waste 
We remain committed to delivering high quality 
services for the benefit of our customers, proactively 
seeking to understand their needs and priorities and 
making the most of new technologies and innovation 
to deliver appropriate improvements. 
South West Water once again outperformed its 
regulatory contract to achieve a sector-leading RoRE 
(return on regulated equity) of 12.6%. In addition, 
South West Water once again achieved ODI 
outperformance which has secured a net reward 
of £3.6 million in the year. 
In our waste operations, Viridor continues to be a 
leader following its significant investments in Energy 
Recovery Facilities (ERFs) in recent years. We delivered 
£107 million EBITDA, which is in excess of our target 
of c.£100 million, and now have a clear track record of 
constructing and commissioning ERFs, and delivering 
the operational and financial results. 
We continued to drive returns from recycling through 
broader ‘self-help’ measures that are reducing the 
cost base and improving utilisation of assets. It is 
22
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 encouraging to see these initiatives supporting an 
increasing EBITDA. We are also making progress in 
commodity risk sharing with our recycling clients.
Investing for sustainable growth
Our decision in November 2016 to commit to a 
£252 million ERF at Avonmouth, near Bristol, has 
expanded our future portfolio to 12 plants. We expect 
demand for ERFs to continue to exceed capacity into 
the long term. 
The Group is actively addressing opportunities 
arising from water industry deregulation. 
In preparation for the new non-household retail water 
market, which commenced 1 April 2017, we set up 
Pennon Water Services as a Pennon Group plc 
subsidiary, ringfenced from South West Water’s 
business, to provide retail services to business 
customers. To achieve scale, Pennon Water Services 
formed a non-household retail venture with South 
Staffordshire Plc (incorporating South Staffs and 
Cambridge Water). Pennon Water Services entered 
the market with the fourth largest customer base in 
the deregulated market. 
Driving value through efficiency 
South West Water maintained its strong momentum in 
controlling total expenditure (Totex) with cumulative 
savings of £129 million and financing outperformance 
of £67 million in the first two years of K6 (2015-2020). 
South West Water is targeting to remain at the 
forefront of cost efficiency for the water sector.
During the year, we completed our Shared Services 
Review to drive value through efficiency, synergy and 
best practice. Reflecting the more integrated nature 
of our Group, we are taking advantage of the 
expertise our combined water and waste businesses 
have in terms of managing large asset bases, and in 
engineering, technology and innovation. The review 
resulted in a plan to centralise key corporate services 
and operational functions, including the introduction 
of a shared IT platform. This will achieve estimated 
savings of £17 million per year from 2019, up from 
the £11 million per year that we announced last 
year of which c.£9 million per annum has been 
secured to date.
Other efficiency successes include the Group’s 
energy trading team which has developed a portfolio 
management strategy. This addresses the energy 
demands of the Group and ensures Pennon is buying 
energy at the right price while enhancing profitability 
from the energy we generate. With South West Water 
a net user of electricity, the Group has a natural 
energy hedging opportunity representing one third 
of Viridor’s energy generation. We can now hedge 
our market position for up to five years ahead, further 
helping to protect revenues.
Balanced risk-reward  
profile across the Group
Part of our strategy as we build our ERFs, and in our 
recycling operations, is to ensure there is a balanced 
risk-reward profile that complements our water 
operations as closely as possible.
As a long-term infrastructure provider, we manage 
our risk profile by mitigating volatility through secure, 
long-term cash flows. We have made significant 
progress over the past two years in reducing risk 
and unpredictability across the Group by 
overlaying our long-term assets with long-term 
commercial arrangements, and supporting these 
with long-term financing. 
At Viridor, for example, we have increased contracted 
volumes better aligning with the life cycle of our 
assets. By negotiating long-term 25-year index-linked 
contracts with stated volumes and prices, Viridor is 
building a similar risk-reward profile to the water side 
of the business. Prior to committing to Avonmouth, 
approximately 80% of our ERF portfolio volumes 
(and associated prices) were contracted long term. 
Striking an appropriate balance between operational 
risk and reward is a key part of our strategy. This 
applies to any aspect of the Group’s operations – 
developing our recycling business, our decision 
to build the Avonmouth ERF, or our entry into the 
non-household retail market. The starting point for 
achieving the right risk-reward balance is to ensure 
the Group fully understands the differences between 
its water and waste operations. This has given us 
a strong and effective framework for identifying risk. 
Innovation and 
investment  in Plymouth
South West Water’s largest investment in its 
current five-year plan is the new £60 million 
state of the art Mayflower Water Treatment 
Works in North Plymouth. Due for completion 
by March 2018, Mayflower uses the innovative 
treatment processes of suspended ion 
exchange, inline coagulation and ceramic 
membrane filtration. This is the first time that 
this combined technology has been used in 
the UK. Mayflower will provide a secure, high-
quality drinking water supply for the Plymouth 
area for generations to come.

Strategic report We also ensure senior management are fully aware of 
how we are managing risk and how we can mitigate 
adverse impacts. At the same time, we identify 
appropriate business opportunities, especially as 
our strategy is to invest for growth in both water 
and waste over the longer term.
Sustainability is core to our business 
Sustainability is core to the Group both in terms of 
ensuring its long-term commercial viability and of 
operating in an environmentally and socially 
responsible manner. The Group has a long track 
record in partnership and innovation across a range 
of sustainability issues. Our operations are deeply 
embedded into local communities and we believe this 
is one of the reasons Ofwat responded so positively 
to South West Water’s latest business plan.
Sustainability is carefully integrated into our strategic 
thinking given the nature of our business as a provider 
of key water and waste services and the close 
relationship our operations have with environmental 
issues. Furthermore, we recognise that making 
responsible and sustainable business decisions is 
critical to achieving long-term investor confidence. 
Our decision-making on capital investment integrates 
many sustainability factors including social, community 
and environmental impacts. We use a range of tools 
to ensure we make decisions that involve more than 
purely economic or financial criteria. In the case of 
capital expenditure on our network infrastructure, 
for example, an ideal solution is always one that 
combines not just the lowest cost base but also 
a favourable sustainability score. 
There was clear evidence of the importance of 
sustainability within the Group during the year. 
In early 2017 Pennon completed its first Group 
submission to Business in the Community’s Corporate 
Responsibility Index and received a score of 90% 
(a three-star rating). Pennon is also included in the 
FTSE4Good Index. In addition, we achieved a score 
of B (Management) for the annual CDP submission 
(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for Climate 
Change and Water, and we continue to take steps to 
effectively reduce our impacts.
Our gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 
14%, primarily as a result of Viridor’s newly 
commissioned ERFs reaching full operating capacity. 
The ERFs burn waste that would otherwise have 
gone to landfill. This has the double benefit of 
extracting more of the energy embedded in the 
waste and substituting energy generated from other, 
predominantly fossil fuel, sources. 
Our environmental performance is an area of 
focus and further progress is needed in aspects 
such as reducing the risk of pollutions and flooding. 
In recognition of the shared importance of our 
environmental responsibilities across the Group, we 
have created the new role of director of Environment 
and, in April 2017, appointed Ed Mitchell to the role. 
Ed brings with him a wealth of experience, having 
spent eight years at the Environment Agency. Prior to 
this Ed held senior positions at Thames Water and the 
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Our people 
Across the Group we look to attract, develop and 
retain a highly skilled and customer-centric workforce. 
At the end of the year, Pennon had a workforce of 
around 5,000 people and we continue to be a 
large employer in the south west of England. 
Our multi-award winning apprenticeship programme, 
which started in 2011, continues to go from strength 
to strength. This year South West Water recruited 
its 100th apprentice since the programme began. 
Viridor is actively committed to expanding 
the number of apprentices it employs. 
The Group also contributes to local efforts to 
develop skills for the future, an example being 
South West Water’s role as a leading partner in a 
University Technical College for South Devon, which 
places a unique focus on engineering, water and 
the environment.
Our employees supported communities through 
359 days of volunteering during the year and both 
South West Water and Viridor continue with a broad 
community education programme. Viridor has been 
shortlisted for The UBS Award for Education as part 
of Business in the Community’s Responsible Business 
Awards 2017. 
At executive level, the creation of the position of Group 
director of Human Resources is an important step in 
the Group’s evolution. The responsibilities of the role 
include developing and implementing the Group’s 
people strategy and assessing how we evolve the 
human resources model across the Group.
The success we achieved in 2016/17 owes much to 
our employees and I would like to thank all of them 
for their hard work, loyalty and dedication.
Outlook
The Group’s outlook is encouraging. In our waste 
business, our ERF portfolio is a significant investment 
in the UK’s environmental infrastructure and key to 
Pennon’s growth agenda. Construction of our ERFs 
at Dunbar and South London is progressing well 
and construction on Avonmouth is now underway. 
In November 2016 we announced that we had taken 
positive action to terminate Interserve Construction 
Limited as EPC contractor for our ERF in Glasgow 
following their continued underperformance on the 
project. Good progress has been made since this 
date in engaging sub-contractors and progressing 
construction which is expected to be complete 
within a revised timetable agreed with our customer, 
Glasgow City Council.
Once all facilities are fully operational, we 
are confident they will add to the already strong 
contribution these assets are making to the Group’s 
financial performance. We continue to work hard to 
create a balanced risk profile across our waste and 
recovery operations.
New branding
As we begin to work more closely as an 
integrated business, it is important that 
the Pennon, South West Water and 
Viridor brands also work together 
visually. The new branding underlines 
our commitment to environmental 
infrastructure, unifying us as a group 
but still reflecting the strengths of each 
business. A cost effective three-year 
programme for roll-out of the new 
branding for vehicles, sites and 
uniforms was in progress by year end.

.
The Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority 
(GMWDA) has confirmed that it is seeking to exit and 
re-negotiate the Greater Manchester Waste private 
finance initiative (PFI) contract with Viridor Laing 
Greater Manchester. The PFI contract, which was 
entered into in 2009, was the UK’s largest waste and 
energy project. Diversion of waste from landfill 
remains ahead of contractual commitments and we 
are keen to ensure this progress is able to continue. 
Viridor and its joint venture partner John Laing have 
been actively engaging with GMWDA as they 
consider their options. There are provisions in the PFI 
contract for compensation to be paid to Viridor and 
John Laing on termination.
Our water business is well prepared for the future. 
South West Water is fully engaged in Ofwat’s 
programme for future water and wastewater services 
regulation as the Group prepares for the PR19 
five-year review of pricing and investment 
requirements. We remain well positioned to play 
our part in the development of future regulatory 
reform and are working to ensure our voice is 
heard in shaping the industry’s future. 
South West Water will publish its 25-year strategic 
plan during 2017/18, setting out our evolving strategic 
priorities and our path to continued strong 
operational performance. We will make every effort to 
maintain a first-class, innovative and efficient service 
that is characterised by reliability, responsiveness 
and resilience. At the same time, we will ensure our 
operations and investments enhance the communities 
we serve and that we continue our commitment to 
understanding the needs of vulnerable customers 
and offering appropriate support.
Looking ahead, our strong operational and financial 
performance shows we are delivering on our strategy 
and providing a firm foundation for further growth. 
Our immediate priority is to optimise our current 
assets and operations so that we can continue 
fulfilling our strategic objectives. In the longer term, 
we believe there is additional opportunity for 
consolidation in wholesale water. 
Meanwhile, we have a clearly articulated core strategy 
focusing on water and waste operations in the UK and 
we believe both business streams provide excellent 
opportunities. With our sector-leading dividend policy, 
our growth profile and our strong balance sheet, 
Pennon Group is well positioned to deliver further 
value to customers, communities and shareholders.

Avonmouth ERF:  
investing for growth 
Viridor, with its joint venture partners, is 
already one of the largest independent power 
generators from waste. When Avonmouth 
begins operation early in the next decade, 
it will place us in the leading position in UK 
energy recovery with 20% market share. 
Avonmouth will serve around 3.5 million people 
in the West of England and supply the national 
grid with enough electricity to power over 
30,000 homes.
The waste supply in the Avonmouth ERF 
catchment area substantially exceeds the 
plant’s own capacity as well as available 
capacity nearby. Supporting contracts 
we already have, an additional volume of 
some 800,000 tonnes is available from 
local municipal, commercial and industrial 
sources. Combustible waste market under-
capacity in the west of England extends to 
2030 and beyond, matching the UK trend. 
Viridor’s market projections are supported by 
independent third party analysis.

Continuing outperformance
The merged water business of South West Water and 
Bournemouth Water performed well during the year. 
South West Water’s Return on Regulated Equity 
(RoRE) performance continues to be sector leading 
and is outperforming its business plan with a RoRE 
of 12.6%. This arises from base, financing and 
operational returns with 6% as the base return, 3.2% 
reflecting total expenditure savings and efficiencies, 
0.3% reflecting a net reward on Outcome Delivery 
Incentives (ODIs) and 3.1% reflecting the difference 
between actual and assumed financing costs. This is 
consistent with the approach to our WaterShare 
mechanism. 
A key highlight for the year is our significant capital 
investment of £191 million in our drinking water and 
wastewater operations. This reflects our focus on 
enhancing our environmental performance and we 
are pleased with the progress seen during the year. 
During the year Ofwat updated its guidance to 
companies which requires financing outperformance 
to be calculated using an in-year average RPI rate. 
This approach reflects a financing outperformance of 
2.4% and a total RoRE of 11.9% for 2016/17 (10.1% for 
2015/16). South West Water’s RoRE would remain 
sector leading and by the end of K6 period overall 
performance will converge.
Total expenditure savings
South West Water continued to focus on driving 
value through efficiency. It achieved cumulative 
total expenditure (Totex) savings of £129 million and 
financing outperformance of £67 million in the first 
two years of K6 (2015-2020). 
The business expects to remain at the forefront 
of cost efficiency for the water sector.

These savings were driven by continuing advantages 
from our strategic alliances, including a new water 
distribution framework and the H
5
0 capital alliance, 
which is now delivering efficient schemes within the 
Bournemouth region. 
We are also ensuring efficient capital investment, 
promoting off-site build techniques and changing the 
way we work through our iOPS programme focussed 
on innovation and new technology to deliver cost 
efficiency and customer service improvements. 
We continued to deliver synergies from our 
acquisition of and merger with Bournemouth Water, 
focusing on front-line functions, having completed 
integration of back-office and support services at the 
end of the prior year. The targeted c.£27 million of net 
synergies over K6 are on track. 
ODI rewards
South West Water had 22 ODIs and Bournemouth 
Water 10 ODIs, which have potential financial rewards 
or penalties. These ODIs include the Service 
Incentive Mechanism (SIM). 
Operational performance for the year continued to 
improve and there was a net ODI reward of £3.6 
million (£5.5 million cumulatively over two years) 
reflecting 0.3% RoRE outperformance to date. 
South West Water maintained good reliability and 
serviceability across all four areas of operations and 
bathing water quality, water restrictions, interruptions 
to supply and leakage all resulted in rewards for the 
year. Disappointingly, performance in wastewater 
pollutions and external flooding fell below our 
targeted commitment and resulted in a penalty, 
however, performance did improve overall compared 
with the prior year. 
The cumulative net reward of £5.5 million comprises 
£7.5 million of net rewards recognised at the end of 
the regulatory period and £2.0 million of net penalty 
which could be adjusted during the regulatory period. 
Drinking water
Drinking water quality is a key priority and we 
maintained the high standards set previously. South 
West Water achieved 99.96% and Bournemouth 
Water achieved 99.98%.
The improved performance in managing our network 
led to our best ever leakage result of 82ML per day, 
exceeding our original target and delivering an 
ODI reward. This reflects innovative approaches 
to network management including investment in 
real-time pressure management, detection, repairs 
and network monitoring. 
This was our 20th consecutive year of unrestricted 
water supplies and the Bournemouth water region 
maintained its record of zero water restrictions 
since privatisation.
The average duration of supply interruptions per 
property was lower in both regions compared with 
the previous year. In the South West Water region this 
performance delivered a small reward compared to 
the penalty incurred in 2015/16. 
28
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Investment and innovation
We continued to invest in our assets to deliver 
drinking water improvements. The new £60 million 
state-of-the-art Mayflower Water Treatment Works 
in Plymouth is the largest single item of capital 
expenditure in our current five-year plan. 
Serving Plymouth and South Devon, this is a major 
construction and engineering project with the facility 
scheduled to open in 2018. During the year, we reached 
the halfway point in the build on time and on budget. 
Mayflower will be one of only two plants in the 
world to use transformational ceramic membrane 
filter technology.
Construction is also progressing well at three other 
modern drinking water treatment works – at Tamar 
Lakes, Tottiford and Northcombe. Each will use 
Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC), a sophisticated 
filter technology for improved water treatment. 
There was continued investment in our award-
winning Upstream Thinking programme of catchment 
management involving a range of stakeholders 
including wildlife trusts and river authorities. 
During the year we worked with 1,056 farms 
and improved 7,568 acres of upstream land. 
Wastewater 
South West Water aims to ensure the safe and 
efficient removal and disposal of wastewater, while 
minimising the possibility of sewer flooding and 
pollution. We continued to implement a programme 
of wastewater treatment improvements and 
increased monitoring to prevent potential failure. 
This delivered a significant improvement in numeric 
compliance (the percentage of wastewater treatment 
works deemed compliant). Performance for works 
with numeric consents was 98.4% compared to 95.8% 
in the previous year. Our performance at our smaller 
(descriptive) sites was 99.4% compared to 99.1% 
last year. 
We delivered record bathing 
water quality results
Protecting the environment
Significant incidents (Categories 1 to 2) continued to 
fall, however the number of minor incidents increased 
marginally to 246 (2015 222). Unfortunately, the 
number of significant incidents at four is higher than 
target and, although lower than the seven reported last 
year, will result in a penalty for the year. We are 
prioritising further improvement in this area of our 
wastewater operations.
We delivered record bathing water quality results 
against more stringent EU standards during the year. 
Of the 143 bathing waters tested in the South West 
Water Region, 141 (98.6%) were classified as ‘sufficient’ 
or better. 116 beaches (81.1%) were classified as 
‘excellent’. All of Cornwall’s beaches passed and only 
two beaches in Devon failed with neither of these due 
to any failure on the part of South West Water’s own 
assets. These bathing water results are critically 
important given the importance of the coastal 
environment to the region’s economy.
Upstream Thinking for 
sustainable solutions
Upstream Thinking is a good example of our 
aim to examine long-term costs as well as 
environmental factors when assessing capital 
expenditure on our network infrastructure. 
By delivering landscape-based solutions 
sympathetic to the environment rather than 
harder engineering solutions, we are addressing 
water quality and flooding risk in the most 
sustainable manner. Our strategy is to improve 
the quality of drinking water before it reaches 
treatment works, making it more cost effective 
to treat water. We also look to reduce flooding 
risk and retain water in catchments.
We could look solely at costly end-of-pipe 
solutions that might have had less preferable 
environmental impacts. But by co-operating 
with farmers and other stakeholders, we 
avoid the financial costs of hard engineering 
solutions and deliver solutions with a 
favourable sustainability score.
Mayflower will be 
one of only two plants 
in the world to use 
transformational 
ceramic membrane 
filter technology.

Customer service and engagement
There was a significant improvement in our customer 
service performance during the year. 
South West Water scored 81.6 under the SIM used by 
Ofwat to compare water company performance. 
The score for 2016/17 continues the improving trend 
of recent years and compares well with the previous 
year’s score of 78.6. This reflects good progress in 
how we deal with service issues as well as call centre 
investments in data analytics.
Bournemouth Water’s SIM score was 86.3 in 2016/17, 
one of the highest in the industry.
The improved SIM score owes much to the 
approximately 30% reduction in written complaints 
received at South West Water and Bournemouth 
Water. The customer experience quality scores also 
improved across both regions during the year. In 
addition, our overall customer satisfaction was 89%, 
in line with last year, with value-for-money satisfaction 
at an all-time high, with customer bills reducing in real 
terms over 2015-2020 regulatory period.
Support for those who need it 
There was also good progress in helping vulnerable 
customers, including developing affordability 
schemes. South West Water was one of the first 
companies to introduce a social tariff to help 
customers experiencing temporary or long-term 
problems in paying their water bills. 
We implemented a new employee training and 
development programme during the year that extends 
the support for vulnerable customers. We have also 
brought Bournemouth Water in line with South West 
Water’s approach by rolling out a social tariff for the 
first time in 2017/18.
WaterShare 
Our unique WaterShare scheme identified  
£4.0 million of benefits to customers during the 
year under review. 
This is in addition to the £3.1 million shared in 2015/16. 
Following discussions with the independent 
WaterShare panel, it was decided to invest the 
£3.1 million in key areas of customer service. 
How the benefit in 2016/17 is to be applied will again 
be considered by the WaterShare panel.
Non-household market opening 
Since 1 April 2017, up to 1.2 million businesses and 
other non-household customers across the country 
have been able to choose which retailer they buy water 
and wastewater services from. Wholesale services, 
providing water to premises and taking wastewater 
away, are unaffected, but business customers can 
choose who provides their retail service.
During the year, the Group established Pennon Water 
Services, which will operate independently of South 
West Water and can secure services from any 
wholesaler in the United Kingdom. Equally, South 
West Water has the freedom to supply other business 
retailers around the UK. 
Wastewater investment
Highlights of our investments and activity in wastewater 
during the year include process improvements and 
upgrades at four key sites and improvements in the 
sewage network to reduce the impact of saline 
infiltration (the impact of salt water). We also invested 
in increased capacity at our wastewater treatment 
works at Fluxton in Devon and Hayle in Cornwall. 
Our continued investment in sustainability includes 
£5 million as part of our Downstream Thinking 
programme, which seeks to reduce sewer flooding 
by improving urban drainage, and £20 million for 
improvements in bathing waters and shellfish waters 
around Plymouth. 
We also invested over £1 million to support the 
Exeter Flood Defence Scheme at Countess Wear 
Wastewater Treatment works. This is a welcome 
opportunity to work with partners in the region 
to enhance sustainability and deliver more 
resilient services. 
Think Sink! 
We continue to target a reduction in sewer flooding and pollution through the 
promotion of responsible sewer usage with our customers. 
Following the success of our award-winning ‘Love Y our Loo’ campaign, which 
targeted communities in areas with a history of sewer blockages, we launched 
a new ‘Think Sink’ campaign in December 2016. 
This encourages customers to ‘take the pledge’ and avoid disposing of fat, oil 
and grease (among the major contributors to blockages) down the drain. 
30
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 From September 2016 South West Water fully 
engaged in a period of ‘shadow operation’ to ensure 
that systems and processes were ready for market 
opening, operating as closely as possible to the 
market conditions and requirements whilst ensuring 
customer service levels were maintained. 
Future market opportunities
Ofwat is promoting the development of a market for 
bio-resources (also referred to as sludge; a product 
from sewage which can be used for energy or as a 
fertiliser substitute) and a market for water resources. 
We conducted preliminary work on these potential 
opportunities during the year and are actively 
engaged with Ofwat in developing the potential 
frameworks for these markets. 
Ahead of PR19 we are also engaging with customers 
and stakeholders around their priorities for water and

The initial findings have helped inform our updated 
25-year strategic plan which is being published 
during the summer. 
Our community
Regional economy 
South West Water is one of the largest companies in 
its region. The services it provides are essential for 
the area’s economic sustainability and the company 
supports the employment of around 5000 staff 
directly and indirectly through the supply chain.
The company works closely with Local Enterprise 
Partnerships (LEPs), the Environment Agency and 
other stakeholders and regulators on projects and 
initiatives to ensure a sustainable and resilient future 
for the region. 
Charitable partnerships
In 2016/17 South West Water provided almost 
£75,000 of community sponsorship as part of its 
business plan. Using the Business in the Community 
framework as a guide, which marries core business 
purpose with identified community and social needs, 
South West Water’s main sponsorships were with:
 • Devon and Cornwall Wildlife Trusts – in support 
of their community engagement and educational 
outreach programmes. Activities included a 2-day 
Wildlife Celebration at Trebah Gardens in Cornwall 
and 55 school visits to Wembury Marine Centre 
in Devon
 • Surf Life Saving GB – in support of the Nippers & 
Youth Championships and a three-year Graduate 
Lifeguard Project programme for young people 
who will be able to gain a National Vocational 
Qualification and become a Level 1 Coach at 
age 16
 • The South West Coast Path Association, which 
takes care of the 630-mile coast path, one of the 
region’s main tourist attractions
 • British elite windsurfer and Olympic hopeful Izzy 
Hamilton, from Bude, who learned to windsurf at 
Roadford Lake.
Access and recreation 
The South West Lakes Trust, an independent charity, 
manages over 14,000 acres of land on South West 
Water’s behalf. The Trust is the region’s largest 
combined environmental and recreational charity, 
taking care of 50 inland water sites which attracted 
more than 1.9 million visits during 2016/17. 
Conservation, access and recreation activities in the 
Bournemouth Water area, including management 
of fisheries and moorings, are now also being 
managed by South West Lakes Trust on South West 
Water’s behalf. 
MarketReady 
In preparation for the opening of the non-
household retail market on 1 April 2017 , we 
carried out a company-wide training and 
awareness programme entitled MarketReady , 
designed to ensure recognition and compliance 
with the new market codes. A series of 
workshops were delivered to almost 2000 staff 
with messaging subsequently reinforced using 
an innovative web-based knowledge-testing 
application. The MarketReady campaign also 
featured heavily in all internal communications 
throughout the year.

Waste management  
continued
Strong momentum 
Our energy recovery and waste recycling business 
enjoyed strong momentum in 2016/17. Through our 
energy recovery facility (ERF) portfolio we are delivering 
on the Group’s strategy to invest for growth. 
Our announcement of a new ERF at Avonmouth 
near Bristol takes our total portfolio to 12 plants. 
Of the three other ERFs currently under construction, 
Dunbar and South London ERFs are progressing well. 
Following the termination in the year of Interserve as 
our main contractor for Glasgow ERF, the project is 
now progressing to our revised plan with 
commissioning expected in 2017.
To date, the Group has invested more than £1 billion 
into its ERF asset base. This significant investment 
in environmental infrastructure is helping us to 
transform our business model with an increasing 
focus on ERFs and recycling. 
In coming years, we expect our growing ERF business 
to be the largest contributor to Viridor, followed by 
recycling, with these operations together already 
successfully delivering new revenues that can replace 
our legacy landfill business.
‘Self-help’ measures during the year improved 
efficiency in our recycling operations while there was 
continued progress in commodity risk sharing with 
our customers.
We took further steps to evolve our approach to 
health and safety. The Group’s new director of Safety, 
Health, Quality and Sustainability (SHQS) will work 
closely with Viridor to deliver a major transformation 
in our health and safety outlook that will benefit 
personal wellbeing and enhance business performance. 
Viridor’s total energy capacity has continued to 
grow and with our joint venture partners, we are 
already one of the largest independent power 
generators from waste in the UK. We had 280MW of 
operating capacity from ERFs, anaerobic digestion 
(AD), solar and landfill gas (including joint ventures) 
at 31 March 2017 and exported 1.5 terawatt hours 
(TWh) of power during the year. 
Customer experience
During the year, we completed our first customer 
service survey to seek the views of over 1,000 clients. 
Viridor will use the findings to strengthen customer 
relationships and support the Group’s wider growth 
strategy. By improving the quality of our products and 
services we enhance the customer experience, and 
this in turn supports customer retention and creates 
long-term business partnerships.
76% of Viridor customers said 
they were satisfied or very 
satisfied with the service 
The key requirement from the perspective of our 
customers is for a seamless service providing safe, 
reliable collection. We continue to develop a fully 
integrated service of waste management, recycling 
and recovery recognising that customers are keen 
to avoid landfill. Our aim is to maximise the amount 
of waste that goes into recycling and to divert 
the balance to our ERFs or landfill as appropriate. 
By doing this, we are supporting development 
of a circular economy with greater resource 
productivity leading to reduced waste and pollution. 
Energy recovery facilities
Viridor reported a good operational and financial 
performance for 2016/17. 
Our ERF portfolio is a significant asset base 
comprising eight plants in operation with four under 
construction, including Avonmouth. This is the UK’s 
largest network of modern low-carbon energy 
recovery facilities and produces much-needed 
energy. At year end, our ERFs provided 178MW of 
generating capacity. Once the total committed ERF 
portfolio is completed in 2020/21 our ERFs alone will 
provide 276MW of energy generation capacity.
Long-term waste contracts provide a secure fuel 
source for the ERFs and strategically agreed energy 
offtake contracts provide assured earnings from the 
energy generated.

Bringing new solutions to 
plastics recycling 
Viridor is continually working on solutions 
to align next-generation recycling resources 
with the needs of UK industry. Our £12.5m 
advanced plastics recycling facility  
at Rochester is capable of processing  
75,000 tonnes of mixed plastics each year.  
The Rochester team has partnered with 
packaging specialists (Nextek, funded  
by WRAP) to help find a solution to the  
1.3 billion black plastic ready-meal trays  
sold by UK supermarkets that are not  
currently recyclable.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Plant optimisation
We are maintaining a high level of performance in 
these facilities and demonstrating we can deliver 
long-term stable earnings. This helped us exceed our 
target contribution of some £100 million of EBITDA 
from our ERF portfolio for 2016/17.
For the operational plants, our focus was on 
optimisation and during 2016/17 we achieved average 
availability in excess of 90%. Our operational ERFs 
have a design capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of 
waste inputs, including joint ventures. Our forecasts 
are for this to increase to 3.2 million tonnes of waste 
by 2020.
ERF growth
Two of our ERFs under construction, at Dunbar and 
Beddington, are progressing well and to budget. Delays 
at Glasgow’s Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre 
led Viridor to terminate the construction contract with 
Interserve. The project will be finished by an experienced 
team assembled by Viridor while contractual remedies 
will also support completion. The client (Glasgow City 
Council) is supportive and commissioning of the plant is 
now expected in 2017.
We are building a strong operational team using 
power industry best practice. We have demonstrated 
that we can build these facilities safely, on time and 
to budget and during the year we achieved upper 
quartile availability and reliability. Maintaining this 
high level of performance in our ERFs contributed to 
fulfilling our commitment to achieve c.£100 million 
EBITDA during the year.
The £252 million Avonmouth ERF near Bristol is 
scheduled for completion in 2020/21. The plant will 
have a capacity of 320,000 tonnes per annum and will 
deliver 34MW of electricity. Viridor expects to fill the 
plant’s capacity on opening and by year end 50% of 
the fuel had already been agreed. This includes some 
35% of total capacity secured through a long-term 
contract with Somerset Waste Partnership. This aligns 
with our strategy to achieve a balanced risk-reward 
profile across the Group. We are implementing that 
strategy by increasing long-term contracted revenue 
to match the life cycle of our assets. There are further 
contracts for Avonmouth ERF in the pipeline.
Impact on carbon emissions
41% of the Group’s 2016/17 emissions were attributable 
to our ERFs. This part of the business will continue to 
contribute a significant proportion of our carbon 
footprint as more plants come on stream however 
there are clear environmental benefits due to the 
reduction of waste going to landfill. Viridor is in the 
process of establishing energy efficiency projects at 
key sites although, in the long term, we believe our 
energy recovery activities and their related combined 
heat and power schemes will help to deliver a distinct 
improvement over landfill. In addition, the displacement 
of virgin materials in manufacturing with recycled 
material contributes to significant reductions in 
embodied carbon across product life cycles. However, 
this offset falls outside current greenhouse gas 
reporting scopes.
Innovative use of by-products
Viridor’s ERFs are moving closer to becoming a fully 
‘zero waste to landfill’ solution using innovative 
technology to treat the by-products of the energy 
recovery process. Incinerator Bottom Ash (IBA), 
the ash left behind after burning the waste and Air 
Pollution Control Residue (APCr), the by-product of 
the filtering process to clean exhaust gases before 
they exit the facility, are now being transformed into 
valuable construction products. Our IBA is recovered 
for processing from all ERF sites and after the 
removal of metals, is recycled into an aggregate that 
is used as capping layers, sub-bases, trenches and 
binding concrete to structures. The aggregate is now 
widely recognised and used in nationally important 
construction projects such as the M25 widening. 
Contracts are also in place for recycling APCr that 
includes an innovative technology that transforms 
the APCr into a carbon negative aggregate. The 
Environment Agency considers the aggregate to be a 
product in its own right, having been assessed as an 
‘end of waste’ material that can be used in exactly the 
same way as virgin aggregates and with no worse 
environmental impact than virgin aggregate.
Viridor plays a vital 
part in the displacement 
of virgin materials 
in manufacturing 
supply chains, with 
recycled material 
that significantly 
reduces embodied 
carbon across 
product lifecycles.
Ardley ERF achieves  
best-in-class delivery 
Viridor’s ERF at Ardley, north of Oxford, 
delivered world-class safety performance 
in construction and was built on-time and 
on-budget. It completed its first year of 
operations in 2016/17 and achieved upper 
quartile availability (between 90% and 96%). 
This high level of performance is normally 
associated with a mature asset and it would be 
reasonable to expect a lower level of 80%-90% 
availability from a new plant. The achievement 
at Ardley of upper quartile performance in 
the first year with a completely new team is 
the result of Viridor’s record of investing in 
quality people, training and development 
and its commitment to effective operational 
processes and procedures.

Strategic report Our operations 
Energy recovery  
and waste recycling  
continued
Recycling
Our recycling operations had a satisfactory year with 
Viridor retaining its position as one of the largest 
recycling businesses in the UK. Recycling volumes 
traded in 2016/17 were slightly lower than previous 
years at 1.6 million tonnes. We were active in many 
areas, including mixed material recycling, glass and 
plastics recycling, paper recycling, transforming food 
waste into organic and energy resources. As one of 
the UK’s largest glass-recycling companies, our 
recycling plants in Sheffield and Glasgow processed 
over 245,000 tonnes of glass in 2016/17. 
Self-help measures
Recyclate prices were mainly flat but under pressure, 
with fluctuations across different commodities. While 
the outlook for recyclate prices is relatively stable 
over the short term, we are not relying on a near-term 
recovery. In addition, local authority austerity in the 
face of central government cuts has made the market 
environment more difficult. We therefore focused in 
2016/17 on ‘self-help’ optimisation measures. These 
initiatives drove improved margins with EBITDA 
increasing by £6 per tonne, from £8 per tonne in 
2015/16 to £14 per tonne in 2016/17.
As part of the ‘self-help’ initiative, Viridor intensified its 
optimisation programme and, combined with other 
ongoing efficiency initiatives, this saw costs reduced by 
£1 per tonne for the year despite an increase in 
shipping costs.
Sharing commodity risk and opportunity
In line with the Group’s strategy of achieving a 
balanced risk profile, we continue to work with 
stakeholders where we can share commodity risk 
and opportunity. There are further opportunities 
for risk sharing arrangements as contracts expire 
and are renegotiated.
Local authority contracts
Performance in 2016/17 across our key local authority 
contracts, including Greater Manchester, Glasgow, 
Lancashire, Somerset and West Sussex, as well as 
the Thames Water contract, remains broadly in line 
with 2015/16. We began operating our 25-year 
contracted service for Tomorrow’s Valley in Wales 
(where four local authorities are collaborating in a 
£190 million residual waste contract) that is securing 
fuel for Trident Park ERF. In May 2016, we announced 
a significant multi-authority recycling project in 
Scotland’s Clyde Valley. This is expected to be worth 
around £700 million over the 25-year contract period 
and will secure fuel for the Dunbar ERF.
Joint ventures
The Lakeside ERF (a 50/50 joint venture with Grundon 
Waste Management) continued to operate efficiently 
while Viridor Laing Greater Manchester (a joint venture 
between Viridor and John Laing Infrastructure) is 
delivering the 25-year Greater Manchester Waste 
private finance initiative (PFI) contract, which was the 
UK’s largest waste and energy project entered into in 
2009. Solid recovered fuel produced from Greater 
Manchester’s residual waste is used to generate heat 
and power at Runcorn 1 ERF (TPSCo, a joint venture 
between Viridor, John Laing Infrastructure and Inovyn).
The Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority 
(GMWDA) continues to face financial challenges 
and in April 2017 confirmed it is seeking an exit and 
re-negotiation of the PFI contract. Diversion of 
waste from landfill remains ahead of contractual 
commitments and Viridor and its partners are keen 
to ensure this progress is able to continue. Viridor 
and John Laing have been actively engaging with 
GMWDA as they consider their options. 
There are provisions in the PFI Contract for 
compensation to be paid to Viridor and John Laing 
on termination.
Investment in dust control 
A key facet of our operations is managing the dust caused by 
our activities, to minimise the impact on our staff as well as on 
the external environment. The primary focus for dust control is 
elimination at source, through localised extraction and dust filtration 
systems at key locations within the process. Water suppression (the 
dampening down of yard areas or haul roads) is also used and we 
have invested in vacuum suction systems at a number of plants for 
use in cleaning and maintenance activities. These measures, as well 
as general standards of good housekeeping within our plants, help 
us to keep dust levels under control.
Crayford MRF underlines benefits  
of ‘self-help’ asset optimisation 
Viridor has one of Europe’s largest mixed-waste recycling facilities 
at Crayford in Kent. Crayford MRF applies advanced technology to 
sort and recover co-mingled recyclable materials from local councils 
and businesses outside London. 
This plant serves as a good example of our boosting productivity 
through asset optimisation and self-help measures that saw 
inputs into Crayford reduce marginally from the previous year, but 
delivered a significantly increased EBITDA.
36
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Along with our JV partners, 
Viridor is already one of the 
largest independent power 
generators from waste in 
the UK. 
Landfill
In 2016/17 we continued to manage our landfill energy 
business to maximise the value of landfill gas power 
generation, optimise opportunities for waste disposal 
where it is not suitable for recycling or sending to ERFs, 
whilst exploring alternative commercial development 
opportunities and other energy uses.
We operate a network of landfill gas power 
generation sites that contributed 99MW of capacity 
in 2016/17. We are continuing our strategy of 
delivering cash flow from landfill sites and anticipate 
continued reduction of capacity. However, we believe 
there will be an ongoing requirement for some landfill 
capacity in the UK as some waste is not suitable 
for recycling nor for sending to ERFs. Careful 
consideration will be given to selecting suitable sites 
for this opportunity, our intention being to retain only 
a small number of strategic sites by 2020. Viridor 
closed four sites during the year, bringing the total 
number of operational sites to 11.
Landfill restoration and biodiversity
Viridor continues to manage 31 closed landfill sites 
across the UK in accordance with biodiversity plans 
and using our experience in restoration. Sites have 
been restored to heathland, grassland, woodland, 
agriculture, amenity parkland or a combination of 
these. Viridor currently has eight sites that have 
achieved The Wildlife Trust’s Biodiversity Benchmark, 
which includes two heathland restorations (T atchells 
and Warmwell in Dorset) and a grassland restoration 
that has national significance for birdlife (Beddingham 
in Sussex). 
Community engagement
Investing in educational programmes and supporting 
initiatives local to our operational facilities is a key 
element of our community engagement. Our 11 
educational facilities have received 19,327 visitors over 
the year and helped deliver 122 outreach events to 
6,848 people.
The education facility at Ardley ERF has been 
shortlisted for the UBS Award for Education, as part of 
Business in the Community’s Responsible Business 
Awards 2017 which recognised our Business Class 
Partnership with The Bicester School, Industrial Cadet 
Programme, Go4Set and Engineering Trust projects. 
During 2016/17 Viridor has provided £8.0 million 
in community support, sponsorship and charitable 
donations, of which £7.7 million was paid to 
Viridor Credits for distribution via the Landfill 
Communities Fund.

Household Waste  
Recycling Centres
Viridor manages a network of Household Waste Recycling Centres 
(HWRCs) in partnership with local authorities across the UK. HWRCs 
complement kerbside collections by giving residents access to safe 
and modern facilities where they can bring along items that are not 
routinely collected from their home to maximise recycling.
Our HWRCs have won awards for site design and excellent 
customer services. In areas serviced by our HWRCs recycling rates 
significantly exceed national averages, often achieving recycling 
rates of more than 75%.
Investment in  
Leachate Management
A number of operational projects have been launched aimed at 
reducing leachate generation including accelerated capping and 
restoration initiatives. A dedicated leachate management team has 
been created to focus on driving down long-term management and 
disposal costs, improving treatment plants and achieving the best 
environmental outcome.

Strategic report Report of the Chief 
Financial Officer
Financial review
Susan Davy
Chief Financial Officer
 Growth in 
Pennon’s profit is 
driven by delivery 
of ERF earnings 
and continued 
outperformance 
in water. 
Overview
Pennon Group achieved a strong financial performance 
in 2016/17. We delivered against our strategic objectives 
to lead in the UK’s water and waste sectors, invest for 
growth and drive value through efficiency. 
The Group had the sector leading water company in 
the UK (as measured by Return on Regulated Equity 
(RoRE)) during the year. South West Water’s RoRE has 
led the sector since the start of the current regulatory 
period and is outperforming with a RoRE 12.6%. 
South West Water continued its significant investment 
programme with the £60 million water treatment works 
in Plymouth, the largest capital expenditure item in its 
current five-year plan. The Group also established 
Pennon Water Services (PWS) to compete in the newly 
opened non-household retail sector. T o build scale, it 
was announced during the year that South Staffordshire 
Plc’s non-household retail business would transfer to 
PWS in return for a 20% shareholding in PWS. 
There was strong momentum in the energy 
recovery and waste recycling business in 2016/17. 
Our energy recovery facility (ERF) portfolio provides an 
excellent example of how the Group is executing its 
strategy to invest for growth. Our announcement during 
the year, of a new ERF at Avonmouth takes our total 
portfolio to 12 plants and our overall investment in 
ERFs to £1.5 billion. This major participation in UK 
environmental infrastructure is helping us transform our 
business model with an increasing focus on ERFs and 
recycling. The high level of performance of our ERFs 
enabled us to exceed our c.£100 million EBITDA target 
from our ERF portfolio in 2016/17, delivering £107 million 
of EBITDA. 
Both our water and waste operations implemented our 
strategy to drive value through efficiency. We completed 
our Shared Services Review during the year, an initiative 
involving planned centralisation of key corporate 
services and operational functions, reflecting the more 
integrated nature of our Group. This initiative will 
increase expected Group cost savings from c.£11 million 
previously announced to c.£17 million p.a. from 2019, of 
which c.£9 million p.a. has been secured to date. South 
West Water maintained its strong record of controlling 
total expenditure and remains at the forefront of cost 
efficiency in the water sector. These efficiency initiatives 
support the Board’s pledge in water to reduce bills in real 
terms over the 2015-2020 regulatory period. 
Other efficiency successes include the Group’s 
energy trading team that is ensuring Pennon is buying 
energy at the right price and enhancing profitability 
from energy we generate. In addition our ‘self-help’ 
measures during the year improved efficiency in our 
recycling operations. 
Part of our strategy as we build our ERFs, and in 
our recycling operations, is to ensure we achieve 
a balanced risk-reward profile. We are successfully 
reducing Group risk by overlaying our long-term 
assets with long-term commercial arrangements, 
and supporting these with long-term financing. 
In February 2017 we unwound a derivative position 
entered into in 2011 that had become uneconomic, 
at a break cost of £44 million. 
One of our key financial objectives is to ensure 
we maintain strong liquidity and have access to the most 
efficient and effective funding to support our capital 
investment programme. During the year our interest 
rate  on average net debt remained low at 3.4% and at 
31 March 2017 the Group continued to have a strong 
funding position with £1,383 million of cash and facilities.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Statutory financial performance
The Group’s statutory results showed growth in both profit before tax to 
£210.5 million (2015/16 £206.3 million) and earnings per share to 39.8p 
(2015/16 37.0p). This reflects strong earnings from both South West 
Water and Viridor, supported by sector leading efficiencies in the water 
business and a full year increase in Viridor’s ERF operational capacity. 
The performance of the underlying business is set out in more detail 
below in the financial performance section.
The statutory results include the impact of non-underlying items totalling 
a charge after tax of £11.1 million (2015/16 £29.1 million credit). The 
Directors believe excluding non-underlying items and deferred tax 
provides a more useful comparison on business trends and performance. 
The net non-underlying charge of £11.1 million is a result of:
 • restructuring costs – £10.7 million charge
 • derivative movements – £28.8 million charge
 • taxation on the non-underlying items above totalling a credit 
of £7.1 million
 • taxation – £21.3 million credit arising from the enacted reduction 
in the UK rate of corporation tax from 18% to 17% in 2020. 
Financial performance  
(before non-underlying items)
Revenue 
Group revenue was marginally ahead of last year at £1,353.1 million 
(2015/16 £1,352.3 million). Revenue from the water business was up 
by 2.6% to £561.0 million (2015/16 £547.0 million) as a result of 2.5% 
higher demand due to drier weather, tariff increases of 1.4% (with RPI of 
1.1%) and increased new connections. This increase in revenue, primarily 
linked to drier weather, is above the regulatory tolerance levels and will 
result in a small penalty of £0.2 million. Viridor’s revenue decreased by 
1.6% to £793.5 million (2015/16 £806.2 million) due to the expected 
decrease in construction spend on service concession arrangements 
as plants come on stream and lower landfill volumes, partly offset by 
the growing contribution of operational ERFs. Excluding the impact of 
construction revenue, Group revenue would have increased in the year 
by £20 million (1.5%).
Adjusted EBITDA
Group underlying EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of 2015/16 up 
8.4% at £486.0 million (2015/16 £448.4 million) and 7.4% to £546.2 million 
(2015/16 £508.4 million) respectively. Underlying operating profit increased 
by 16.3% to £304.6 million (2015/16 £261.8 million) and underlying profit 
before tax increased by 18.3% to £250.0 million (2015/16 £211.3 million). 
This has been achieved through an increase in profits from Viridor, 
together with continuing strong South West Water financial performance 
and efficient ongoing finance costs across the Group.
Following the merger of Bournemouth Water into South West Water the 
water business recorded strong performances against the K6 regulatory 
contracts, outperforming regulatory assumptions. The water business’ 
profit before tax increased by 4.9% to £173.9 million (2015/16 £165.7 million) 
reflecting higher revenue from tariff increases and increased demand, with 
operating costs of £211.9 million (2015/16 £211.8 million) broadly in line with 
last year. With the highest potential returns in the sector for K6, South 
West Water is outperforming its business plan, resulting in a cumulative 
RoRE of 12.6%. More detail on RoRE performance is set out on page 28.
During the year Ofwat updated its guidance for calculating the financing 
outperformance, using an in-year average RPI rate, rather than a forecast 
RPI over the regulatory period. South West Water’s RoRE remains sector 
leading through this approach and the cumulative forecast performance 
over K6 is the same under both approaches.
South West Water’s EBITDA increased during the year due to higher 
revenue and cost efficiencies along with other cost reductions. 
While average RPI has been increasing (2.9% as at March 2017), total 
operating costs in 2016/17 were in line with last year, with savings arising 
from operational maintenance synergies from the company mergers as 
well as targeted efficiencies contributing to cost performance. Operating 
costs also include a fine for £1.8 million issued in April 2017 relating to a 
HSE prosecution following the tragic fatality of an employee at a 
wastewater treatment works in December 2013. In addition, South West 
Water’s bad debt charge continues to fall, down by over a quarter since 
the end of K5, to 1.1% as a percentage of revenues (1.7% at the end of K5). 
This was driven by strong collections as we work with our customers to 
manage their debt with the operations continually updating their 
approaches in targeting those customers with the means to pay whilst 
supporting those who have genuine affordability challenges.
At Viridor, the portfolio of operational ERFs continues to perform well, with 
the six most recently delivered ERFs ramping up as Viridor optimises each 
plant. As a result, Viridor’s EBITDA increased by 18.7% to £138.3 million 
(2015/16 £116.5 million) whilst 2016/17 adjusted EBITDA increased 12.5% to 
£198.5 million (2015/16 £176.5 million). Viridor has four further ERFs under 
construction, including Avonmouth which we committed to during the 
year. Dunbar and Beddington (South London) are progressing well and to 
budget with steps being taken to ensure construction of Glasgow ERF is 
completed successfully.
Viridor’s EBITDA was ahead of last year due to the ramping up of 
the existing ERF portfolio and recycling self-help measures, where significant 
progress has been made in reducing the cost base and improving the 
utilisation of assets, net of anticipated declines in landfill earnings primarily 
due to expected lower volumes. Our ERF activities contributed EBITDA of 
£106.9 million (2015/16 £89.7 million) delivering our target of c.£100 million 
of EBITDA from ERFs by 2016/17 (before IFRIC 12 interest receivable and 
our share of joint venture EBITDA). Joint venture EBITDA increased slightly 
to £44.1 million (2015/16 £43.3 million), with strong EBITDA from all three 
joint ventures. This resulted in a share of joint venture profit after tax of 
£4.2 million (2015/16 £3.6 million). During the year ERF earnings included 
contractual compensation
(1)
 of £12.7 million, a similar level to previous years.
Recycling and resources EBITDA, comprising recycling, collection 
and contracts and other, increased by 14.5% to £56.8 million (2015/16 
£49.6 million). Recycling revenue at £90 per tonne (2015/16 £85 per 
tonne) has increased £5 per tonne reflecting renegotiated input contracts 
and recyclate prices. Average operating costs fell by £2 per tonne to 
£72 per tonne (2015/16 £74 per tonne) as a result of targeted efficiencies. 
This has been offset by an increase in shipping costs of £1 per tonne. As a 
result the recycling EBITDA margin increasing by £6 per tonne to £14 per 
tonne (2015/16 £8 per tonne). We remain cautious about future recyclate 
price growth and are not relying on a near-term recovery. We are instead 
focusing on ‘self-help’ measures to drive margin improvement and to look 
to share commodity risk/opportunity with our clients.
Landfill EBITDA from power generation and waste disposal are down 
compared to last year by £3.7 million. The decrease in earnings is primarily 
due to lower power prices and volumes.
Across the Group we look to efficiently manage and optimise value 
from our estates portfolio, recognising a profit on sale of assets in the year 
of £7.5 million (2015/16 4.3 million).
Net finance costs
Underlying net finance costs of £58.8 million were £4.7 million higher 
than last year, predominantly reflecting higher RPI, higher net debt from 
continuing capital investments and lower finance income following the 
unwind of the 2011 Peninsula MB derivative, which reduces finance income 
by £8 million p.a. going forward.
We have secured funding at a cost that is efficient and effective. 
The Group interest rate on average net debt for 2016/17 has slightly 
increased to 3.4% (2015/16 3.3%) reflecting increases in RPI.
The Group’s interest rate on average net debt for the year to  
31 March 2017 is 3.4% (after adjusting for capitalised interest of  
£12.9 million, notional interest items totalling £5.8 million and interest 
received from shareholder loans to joint ventures of £10.2 million).  
For South West Water this figure was 3.2%.
During the year underlying net finance costs (excluding pensions net 
interest cost £1.2 million, discount unwind on provisions £9.1 million 
and IFRIC 12 contract interest receivable £16.1 million) were £64.6 million 
(2015/16 £59.6 million), covered 4.7 times (2015/16 4.4 times) by Group 
operating profit.
(1) Primarily relates to liquidated damages received/receivable when construction 
completed post the original contractual completion date.

Strategic report Profit before tax 
Group underlying profit before tax was £250.0 million, an increase of 18.3%, 
compared with the prior year (2015/16 £211.3 million). On a statutory basis, 
profit before tax was £210.5 million (2015/16 £206.3 million) reflecting 
non-underlying charges before tax of £39.5 million (2015/16 £5.0 million).
Taxation
The Group’s underlying mainstream UK corporation current tax charge 
for the year (before prior year credits) was £41.3 million, the £7.0 million 
increase on last year is primarily driven by higher profits; reflecting an 
effective tax rate of 16.5% (2015/16 £34.3 million, 16.2%). There was a 
prior year credit of £1.8 million recognised for the year (2015/16 credit 
of £1.4 million). In addition there is a non-underlying £9.4 million current 
tax credit relating to non-underlying items (2015/16 £1.7 million credit).
Underlying deferred tax for the year (before prior year charges) was a 
charge of £17.8 million (2015/16 £23.3 million). The charge for 2016/17 
primarily reflects capital allowances, including on ERFs, in excess of 
depreciation charge. There was a prior year deferred tax charge of £1.1 
million recognised for the year (2015/16 £15.9 million charge). In addition 
there is a non-underlying £21.3 million deferred tax credit relating to the 
enacted reduction in the UK rate of corporation tax to 17% in 2020 and 
a £2.3 million deferred tax charge relating to other non-underlying items. 
This resulted in a total tax charge for the year of £30.0 million (2015/16 
£38.0 million).
We have recently concluded discussions with HMRC resolving the 
treatment of certain uncertain tax items. Provisions for these uncertain 
tax items had been recognised in previous years, no further amounts 
are required to be recognised in relation to these items.
Non-underlying items
The net non-underlying charge of £11.1 million is a result of:
 • restructuring costs – £10.7 million charge relating to restructuring 
costs from the Group wide Shared Services Review and migration to 
a Group IT platform (including a £9.5 million non-cash de-recognition 
of an existing IT asset) 
 • derivative movements – £28.8 million charge reflecting the unwind 
of the 2011 Peninsula MB Limited (PMB) derivative (charge 
£44.8 million) offset by market movements on our long-dated 
floating rate vanilla swaps 
 • taxation on the non-underlying items above totalling a credit  
of £7.1 million
 • taxation – £21.3 million credit arising from the enacted reduction 
in the UK rate of corporation tax from 18% to 17% in 2020. 
Unwind of the 2011 PMB derivative
Since 2011 Pennon has received a fixed interest rate on a £200 million 
financial asset and paid an index-linked interest rate on a £200 million 
loan, designed to improve the Group’s overall interest rate performance. 
The counterparty to both instruments was PMB. In combination, these 
instruments were accounted for by Pennon as a derivative, with a net 
interest income of £8 million p.a., c.£7 million in 2016/17, cash settled.
In periods of index underperformance, losses arose in PMB which were 
group relieved with Pennon. 
Following a change in legislation, which saw the value of the derivative to 
Pennon moving from a liability of £4 million to a liability of c.£40 million, 
Pennon made the decision to exit the transaction.
The break cost due to Nomura in respect of the termination was 
£44 million, with an agreed payment date of June 2018. The impact 
for the Group is a net cost of £35 million post tax.
The group relief claimed by Pennon has been treated as an uncertain 
tax item and has been substantially provided for over recent years. 
Following the conclusion of discussions with HMRC, no further amounts 
are required to be recognised by Pennon. 
Post the unwind of the transaction the Group’s interest will no longer 
include the c.£8 million p.a. income, c£7 million in 2016/17, and the 
underlying tax charge will reduce by a similar amount.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share on both a statutory and underlying basis before 
deferred tax were ahead of last year, up 7.6% at 39.8p (2015/16 37.0p) 
and up 19.0% at 47.0p (2015/16 39.5p) respectively, reflecting 
higher profits. 
Net assets per share at book value at 31 March 2017 were 365p, 
up 1.1% on last year. 
Dividends and retained earnings
The statutory net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 
of £164.3 million has been transferred to reserves.
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 24.87p per 
share for the year ended 31 March 2017. With the interim dividend of 
11.09p per share paid on 4 April 2017 this gives a total dividend for 
the year of 35.96p, an increase of 7.1% over 2015/16 and maintaining our 
long-standing sector-leading dividend policy of RPI + 4% year-on-year 
growth. We set that policy in the 2010-2015 regulatory period and 
confirmed its continuation through to 2020. The net effect of this policy 
is that dividends per share will have almost doubled over the 10 years 
to 2020.
This 4% real growth above RPI per annum is driven by continued 
outperformance of our water business and by the significant investments 
we are making in Viridor which is successfully delivering on its targeted 
contribution to Group earnings. We are actively seeking further 
opportunities for growth beyond 2020 with the aim of sustaining a 
sector-leading dividend policy over the longer term.
Proposed dividends totalling £149.5 million are covered 1.3 times by net 
profit (before non-underlying items and deferred tax) (2015/16 1.1 times). 
Dividends are charged against retained earnings in the year in which they 
are paid.
Operating costs (before non-underlying items)
Operating costs for the year totalled £1,049 million. The most significant 
areas of expenditure were:

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Group capital investment
Group capital investment was £384.7 million in 2016/17 compared to 
£316.9 million in 2015/16. This peak level of investment is expected to 
continue in to 2017/18, reflecting the profile of investment in 
Viridor’s ERFs.
South West Water’s capital expenditure was £190.9 million compared 
to £134.1 million in 2015/16. The beginning of the new regulatory period 
reflects a change in the nature and extent of capital activity and an 
increase in activity in year two. 
As anticipated the largest single project in South West Water’s 
spending is the development of the innovative Mayflower water 
treatment works at North Plymouth. Construction works are well 
advanced and the formation of the process elements is underway 
with over 5km of water pipeline and effluent pipes already installed. 
Advanced techniques have been used to limit the impact on the 
surrounding area including micro tunnelling under a major road 
into Plymouth. In addition investment has been targeted to improve 
wastewater compliance with process upgrades and improvements 
at six sites. 
Viridor’s capital investment of £193.8 million was ahead of 2015/16 
(£182.8 million). The majority of expenditure this year reflects the 
ongoing ERF programme, with significant expenditure at South 
London, Dunbar and Glasgow ERFs. 
The infrastructure at Dunbar is nearing completion with a significant 
element of the process plant having been delivered to site prior to 
installation. The plant is expected to be operational in H2 2017/18. 
Construction at Beddington is progressing to plan with access 
routes to the site being improved and the core infrastructure under 
construction. Operations are expected to commence in H1 2018/19.
Glasgow’s Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre is receiving waste 
and generating energy. New construction contracts with Doosan 
Babcock are progressing well with commissioning expected in 2017. 
The major categories of expenditure were:

Cash flow
The Group’s operational cash inflows in 2016/17 at £456 million were 
£38 million higher than last year (2015/16 £418 million). These funds 
have been put to use in efficiently financing the Group’s capital 
structure and investing in future growth, through our substantial 
continuing capital investment programme. This investment has 
resulted in higher Group net debt.

Liquidity and debt profile
The Group has a strong liquidity and funding position with £1,383 million 
cash and facilities at 31 March 2017. This includes cash and deposits 
of £598 million (including £224 million of restricted funds representing 
deposits with lessors against lease obligations) and undrawn facilities 
of £785 million. At 31 March 2017 the Group’s loans and finance lease 
obligations totalled £3,263 million. After the £598 million held in cash, 
this gives a net debt figure of £2,665 million, an increase of £181 million 
during the year. 
During the year the Group has drawn the South West Water EIB funding 
of £130 million signed in 2015/16.
Since the year end the Group has signed £50 million of new and 
renewed revolving credit facilities to provide pre-funding for future 
cash flows.
43
Strategic report The Group has agreed £110 million of funding from the EIB into 
Pennon Group plc, in relation to the capital investment in Cardiff’s 
Trident Park Energy Recovery Facility. This funding is anticipated to 
be signed later in 2017 when the EIB expects to have clarity over the 
implications of Article 50 being triggered. Negotiations are continuing 
with the EIB to secure additional funding for South West Water, so this 
can be delivered in a timely manner following the clarity noted above.
The investment in Avonmouth ERF will be corporately financed and 
options are being considered, including a new hybrid, to continue the 
Group’s diversified funding position.
The Group has a diversified funding mix of fixed, floating and 
index-linked borrowings. The Group’s debt has a maturity of up to 
40 years with a weighted average maturity of 20 years matching the 
asset base. Much of the Group’s debt is floating rate, with derivatives 
being used to fix the rate on that debt. The Group has fixed, or put 
swaps in place to fix, the interest rate on a substantial portion of the 
existing water business debt for the entire K6 period, in line with the 
Group’s policy to have hedging in place before the start of a regulatory 
period. £486.3 million of South West Water’s debt is index-linked at 
an overall real rate of under 2.0%. As a result of the aforementioned 
initiatives, South West Water’s cost of finance is among the lowest 
in the industry. Two-thirds of South West Water’s net debt is from 
finance leases, providing a long maturity profile to its debt. Interest 
payable on them benefits from the fixed credit margins, which were 
secured at the inception of each lease. Bournemouth Water was 
successfully integrated into South West Water on 1 April 2016 and 
as a result a quarter of the gross funding for the water business is 
RPI linked consistent with Ofwat’s notional level.
At 31 March 2017 the fair value of the Group’s non-current borrowings 
was £28 million more than its book value (2016 less than £114 million) 
as detailed in note 28 to the financial statements. This reflects the 
benefit of securing interest rates below the current market rate, offset 
by volatility in inflation markets.
Capital structure – overall position
The Group’s net debt has increased by £181 million to £2,665 million, 
with the increase reflecting significant capital investment. The Group’s 
gearing ratio at 31 March 2017, being the ratio of net debt to (equity 
plus net debt) was 63.8% (31 March 2016 62.5%), reflecting continuing 
capital investment.
Group net debt includes £1,132 million of investment in wholly-owned 
ERFs (Runcorn II, Oxford, Exeter, Cardiff, Glasgow, Dunbar and South 
London) and £87 million of funding for investments in joint ventures 
through shareholder loans (which together represents 46% of Group 
net debt). In addition the joint ventures have non-recourse net debt 
from third parties (excluding shareholder loans) of which Pennon’s 
share is £194 million. c.85% of ERF and joint venture funding is from 
corporate finance.
In March 2013 the Group issued a £300 million hybrid capital security 
recognised as equity as set out in note 37 to the financial statements. 
During the year the Company continued to benefit from offering 
a scrip dividend alternative. £6.9 million (2015/16 £6.3 million) of 
potential cash dividend was retained in the business and resulted 
in the issuance of 771,563 shares.
The combined South West Water and Bournemouth Water debt to 
RCV ratio is 61.8% (31 March 2016 59.7%), which aligns with Ofwat’s 
K6 target for efficient gearing of 62.5%.

Treasury policies
The role of the Group’s treasury function is to ensure we have the 
funding to meet foreseeable needs, to maintain reasonable headroom 
for future contingencies and to manage interest rate risk. It operates 
only within policies approved by the Board and undertakes no 
speculative trading activity.
The Board regularly monitors expected financing needs for at least the 
following 12 months. These are intended to be met for the coming year 
from existing cash balances, loan facilities and operating cash flows.
The Group has considerable financial resources and a broad spread of 
business activities. The Directors therefore believe that it is well placed 
to manage its business risks.
Internal borrowing
South West Water’s and Bournemouth Water’s funding is treated for 
regulatory purposes as ring-fenced. This means that funds raised by, 
or for, either company are not available as long-term funding for other 
areas of the Group.
Taxation strategy
Our tax strategy is to fulfil our statutory obligations by the application 
of relevant tax legislation in a reasonable way, engaging in tax planning 
only when it is aligned with the commercial and economic activity of 
the Company. This is in line with the principles published by the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in 2013. The Group engages 
with HMRC in an open and transparent way, identifying potential 
areas of uncertainty on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of tax 
legislation, the Group and tax authorities may sometimes have 
differing opinions on the treatment of certain tax items. The Group 
manages this risk and accrues for areas of tax uncertainty in line with 
accounting standards requirements, where appropriate. The Board 
is regularly updated on tax matters, and any tax implications of 
commercial activities are highlighted to the Board with the use of 
a risk matrix to assess the appropriateness of a proposal.

collected/paid
The Group made a net payment of £36.4 million (of UK corporation 
tax) in the year (2015/16 £45.0 million). The main elements of the 
payment were £19.8 million in relation to 2016/17 instalment payments 
and £16.6 million in relation to earlier years. 
The total tax charge for the year of £30.0 million is less than the 
charge that would have arisen had the accounting profit before tax 
been taxed at the statutory rate of 20%. A reconciliation is provided 
in note 9 to the financial statements.
The mainstream tax charge for the year (before deferred tax, 
prior-year and non-underlying items) of £41.3 million results in an 
effective rate of 16.5%, which is lower than the statutory rate of 20.0% 
mainly due to capital allowances received on ERF capital expenditure.

The Group’s total tax contribution extends significantly beyond the 
UK corporation tax payments.
Total taxes amounted to £310 million (2015/16 £342 million) of which 
a net amount of £45 million (2015/16 £47 million) was collected on 
behalf of the authorities for employee payroll taxes and VAT. 
In addition to corporation tax the most significant taxes involved, 
together with their profit impact, were:
Landfill tax of £145 million (2015/16 £166 million) collected and paid 
on waste material deposited at our landfill sites. This amount includes 
£6 million (2015/16 £11 million) paid to local environmental bodies via 
the Landfill Tax Credits Scheme. Landfill tax is an operating cost which 
is recovered from customers and is recognised in revenue. In addition 
the Group incurred landfill tax of £2 million (2015/16 £1 million) on the 
disposal of waste to third parties. This is an operating cost for the 
Group and reduces profit before tax. The net amount of landfill tax 
paid to HMRC by the Group and via third parties represents 13% of 
the total landfill receipts of HMRC in the year.
Value Added T ax (VAT) of £5 million paid (2015/16 £8 million) by the 
Group to HMRC. VAT has no material impact on profit before tax
Business rates of £39 million (2014/15 £42 million) paid to local 
authorities. This is a direct cost to the Group and reduces profit 
before tax. 
Employment taxes of £57 million (2015/16 £54 million) including 
employees’ Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and total National Insurance 
Contributions (NICs). Employer NICs of £16 million (2015/16 £15 million) 
were charged approximately 93% to operating costs with 7% capitalised 
to property, plant and equipment. The total amount of £50 million 
includes PAYE of £3 million (2014/15 £2 million) on pension payments 
made by the Group pension scheme.
Fuel Excise Duty of £7 million, (2015/16 £8 million) related to transport 
costs. This reduces profit before tax
Payments to Environment Agency and other regulatory bodies total 
£11 million, (2015/16 – £11 million) This reduces profit before tax
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) payment for the Group of 
£3 million, (2015/16 £4 million). This reduces profit before tax.
The corporation tax rate for 2016/17 used to calculate the current year’s 
tax is 20% and will reduce to 19% for the year to 31 March 2018 and 17% 
for the year ending 31 March 2021.
Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for certain 
employees of Pennon Group. The main schemes were closed to new 
entrants on or before 1 April 2008.
At 31 March 2017 the Group’s pension schemes showed an aggregate 
deficit (before deferred tax) of £68.0 million (March 2016 £40.9 million). 
The deficit has increased due to the post-Brexit fall in bond yields, 
increasing the valuation of liabilities. However, over half of the increase 
in the valuation of liabilities has been offset by increases in asset values. 
The net aggregate liabilities of £56 million (after deferred tax) 
represented around 2% of the Group’s market capitalisation at 
31 March 2017.
The 31 March 2016 actuarial valuation of the main scheme has been 
finalised, the outcome is in line with the 2013 valuation and schedule 
of contributions, which is consistent with Final Determination (FD) 
allowances for K6 (2015-2020).
Insurance
Pennon Group manages its property and third party liability risks 
through insurance policies that mainly cover property and business 
interruption, motor, public liability, environmental pollution and 
employers’ liability.
The Group uses three tiers of insurance to cover operating risks:
 • self-insurance – Group companies pay a moderate excess on 
most claims
 • cover by the Group’s subsidiary (Peninsula Insurance Limited) of 
the layer of risk between the self-insurance and the cover provided 
by external insurers
 • cover provided by the external insurance market, arranged by our 
brokers with insurance companies that have good credit ratings.

Strategic report Risk 
report
The Board is responsible for identifying principal risks 
and ensuring appropriate risk mitigation is in place to 
manage them effectively. 
Risk management framework 
Successful management of existing and emerging 
risks is essential to the long term success of the 
Group and the achievement of its strategic objectives. 
Pennon has established a fully embedded Group risk 
management framework, to identify significant risks 
and determine whether they are being appropriately 
managed in line with the Group’s agreed risk appetite, 
and mitigated. 
A Group Risk Forum provides a ‘top down’ 
assessment of Group risks, that supplements the 
‘bottom up’ risk assessments by each subsidiary. 
The key stages of the risk process are: 
 • Identification of significant risks by core 
business functions, utilising agreed risk 
criteria based on a combination of likelihood 
over a five-year period, and impact based on 
financial, reputational, management effort and 
impact on stakeholders and customers
 • Principal and other business risks are captured 
in risk registers which are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis as part of a robust assessment of key risks, 
mitigations, controls and assurance activities 
defined by risk owners. The assessment considers 
gross risk, net risk after mitigation, and risk 
appetite, as well as the direction of travel of the 
risk level
 • Quarterly risk and assurance forums are held 
to review and challenge principal risks, where 
management justify their ‘bottom-up’ risk 
assessments through formal reports 
and presentations
 • Principal risks of each subsidiary are reviewed 
and confirmed on a quarterly basis by the 
subsidiary executive management teams, 
following which the Group Risk Forum completes 
a comprehensive ‘top-down’ evaluation of risks 
that could impact on the delivery of Group 
strategic objectives. The Forum consists of senior 
executives and its role is to debate, challenge, 
agree and prioritise the principal risks faced by 
the Group, based on the risk appetite set by the 
Board. The risk assessment is then subjected to 
a thorough appraisal by the Pennon Executive 
before consideration by the Audit Committee and 
then formal presentation to the Board for approval
 • The impact of risks on the three long-term 
strategic priorities is included in the following 
table of principal risks and uncertainties.
Risk appetite 
Risk appetite is defined as the level of risk it is 
considered appropriate to accept in achieving 
Group strategic objectives. The appropriateness 
of the mitigation applied to each principal risk 
is considered by the Board in the context of the 
effectiveness of the overall control environment 
in ensuring compliance with the agreed risk 
appetite of the Board. 
Robust risk assessment 
The Directors confirm that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of risks facing the Group, 
including assessing the impacts on its business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The following table describes the principal risks and 
how they are being managed or mitigated in line with 
the Board’s risk appetite. These principal risks have 
been considered in preparing the viability statement 
on page 51.

Non-compliance could lead to financial 
penalties and other additional costs 
which could undermine our efforts 
to maximise cost base efficiency. 
Damage to reputation could affect 
shareholder value.
Regulatory reform could lead to 
inefficiencies and have a consequential

and are ongoing.
Good progress has been made 
in preparing for regulatory reform and 
we entered the non-household retail 
market on1 April 2017. We are fully 
engaged in the programme for the 
next regulatory price review. External 
reviews support the assurance 
provided by the water business to 
its regulators.
High standards of 
compliance are sought 
with no appetite for legal 
and regulatory breaches.
As regulatory reform is 
progressing, we aim to 
minimise the impact by 
targeting changes which 
are NPV neutral over the 
longer term, to protect 
shareholder value and

put our growth agenda at risk.
Clear treasury and funding policies and 
an effective Group Treasury team.
Funding in place at effective average 
interest rates below many in its sector, 
with prefunding and headroom, 
including revolving credit facilities, to

and procedures, which are currently 
being reviewed and enhanced, 
supported by a programme of 
capital investment.
High standards of

The Group could be called upon to 
increase funding to reduce the deficit, 
impacting our cost base.
Use of professional advisers to manage 
the pension scheme’s investment 
strategy to ensure the scheme can 
pay its obligations as they fall due.
Risk increased post-Brexit vote due 
to market uncertainties. The situation

Non-recovery of 
customer debt
Long-term priorities affected:
1
 
2
Potential impact on customer debt 
collection, particularly with regard to 
vulnerable customers and affordability.
Water business debt collection 
strategies kept under review with 
new initiatives regularly implemented:
 • Targeting previous occupier debt 
after customer moves
 • Specific case management and 
use of court claims and
 • Use of charging orders.
Affordability tariffs (e.g. Restart, 
WaterCare, FreshStart) help to 
reduce bad debt exposure for 
customers struggling to pay.
Viridor’s debt collection risk is lower 
due to the high proportion of public 
sector accounts.
Minimise non-recoverable 
debt. We recognise 
customer affordability 
challenges and that given 
the inability to disconnect 
domestic customers, 
some risk of uncollectable 
debt remains.
Macro-economic 
risks arising 
from the global 
and UK economic 
downturn 
commodity and 
power prices
Long-term priorities affected:
 
3
 
The economic climate and falling 
commodity and energy prices have 
a direct impact on the revenues 
generated by our recycling business.
Viridor is well positioned across 
the waste hierarchy, with long-term 
contracts supporting the ERF 
segment. The recycling self help 
measures focus on performance, 
in mitigating the impact of 
global economic conditions 
on commodity prices.
Energy risk management at a 
Group level acts as a natural hedge 
between South West Water and 
Viridor, offsetting any drop in 
power prices. Existing investments 
that qualified for Renewable Obligation 
Certificates are protected by the 
‘grandfathering’ principle.
Taking well-judged risks 
and having response 
plans in place to mitigate 
external macro-economic 
risk factors down to an 
acceptable level.

Poor operating 
performance due 
to extreme weather 
or climate change
Long-term priorities affected:
1
Failure of our assets to cope with 
extreme weather conditions may lead 
to an inability to meet our customers’ 
needs, environmental damage, 
additional costs and loss of reputation.
Contingency plans, emergency 
resources and investment through a 
planned capital programme mitigates 
the risks of extreme weather incidents.
We prepare a Water Resources 
Management Plan every five years and 
drought plans every three years, which 
are both reviewed annually for a range 
of climate change and demand 
scenarios, with schemes promoted 
to maintain water resources 
(e.g. pumped storage for reservoirs), 
conservation and customer water 
efficiency measures.
While no water restrictions are 
envisaged, the risk is rising due to 
the recent prolonged period of 
dry weather.
Viridor has in place a regional adverse 
weather management strategy, aimed 
at reducing disruption to site 
operations and transport logistics.
Reduce both the 
likelihood and impact 
through long-term 
planning and ensuring 
sufficient measures are 
in place to mitigate risk.
Poor customer 
service/increased 
competition 
leading to loss of 
customer base
Long-term priorities affected:
1
 
3
 
Poor customer service has a direct 
impact on South West Water’s delivery 
of the PR14 business plan and Viridor’s 
ability to retain and grow market share.
The opening up of the non-household 
retail market to competition means 
that we must ensure we understand 
and meet the needs of our business 
customers if we are to deliver growth 
in this area.
Targeted improvements made to 
improve customer service including 
South West Water’s relative industry 
standing during the K6 period.
Viridor’s strategy to diversify into 
energy recovery has offset the 
decline in landfill and current 
challenges in recycling.
Viridor is exploring alternative 
uses for its landfill assets.
Good customer service is 
at the heart of everything 
we do. Continually seek 
to increase customer 
satisfaction.
Minimise the impact 
of market reform by 
defending the existing 
customer base 
whilst developing 
further markets.
Business 
interruption 
or significant 
operational  
failures/ incidents
Long-term priorities affected:
1
Operational failure in our Water 
business could mean that we are not 
able to supply clean water to our 
customers or provide safe wastewater 
services. This has a direct impact on 
successful delivery of the PR14 
business plan.
Business interruption caused by 
defects, outages or fire could impact 
the availability and optimisation of 
our ERFs and recycling facilities. 
Detailed contingency plans and 
incident management procedures.
Equipment failure is managed 
through sophisticated planned 
preventative maintenance regimes. 
Any disruption is alleviated by good 
liaison and communication.
Effective business 
continuity and 
contingency plans in 
place to mitigate the 
risk and accelerate the 
recovery from an incident, 
with residual risk covered 
by insurance.

Failure of our systems due to 
inadequate cyber security could lead 
to significant business interruption. 
Corruption or loss of data could result 
in detriment to our customers, financial 
penalties and reputational damage.
Major systems implementation is 
supported by a formal programme 
governance framework, supplemented 
by specialist consultants. Viridor 
systems are in the process of migrating 
to a Group shared service platform.
Cyber risks are mitigated by a strong 
information security framework, cyber 
security awareness campaigns, plus 
internal and external testing and 
formal ISO accreditation. Ensure all 
possible measures are in place, aligned 
to guidance issued by the National 
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), 
commensurate with the fast changing 
cyber risk landscape.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Britain’s exit from the European Union
As with all major decisions and changes that affect our business, 
Pennon conducted a thorough analysis of the possible implications 
of a vote to leave the European Union. Pennon did not take a public 
stance on the referendum in June 2016 as the Board believed that the 
vote was a personal decision.
It is too early to know the implications of the vote to leave; this will only 
become clear when negotiations following the March 2017 triggering 
of Article 50 are complete. In the meantime, we are tracking Brexit 
implications in assessing every risk.
Ofwat’s principles for holding companies – Board 
leadership, transparency and governance 
Ofwat requires that holding companies manage their risks in such 
a way that the regulated company is protected from risk elsewhere 
in the Group. The principal risks and uncertainties disclosed above 
include the Group-level risks that could materially impact on South 
West Water.
Pennon’s risk management and internal control frameworks ensure 
that it does not take any action that would cause South West Water 
to breach its licence obligations. Further, the Group’s governance and 
management structures mean that there is full understanding and 
consideration of South West Water’s duties and obligations under 
its licence., as well as an appropriate level of information sharing and 
disclosure to give South West Water assurance that it is not exposed 
as a result of activities elsewhere in the Group. 
Viability statement
The Board has assessed the Group’s financial viability and confirms 
that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a 
five-year period. The assessment has been made with reference to 
the Group’s current position and prospects, its longer-term strategy, 
the Board’s risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed on pages 47 to 50 of the risk report.
The Group’s strategic business plan and associated principal risks are 
a foundation of the scenario testing. This assessment has considered 
the potential impact of these risks arising on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period in question. 
In making their assessment, the Directors reviewed the principal risks 
and considered which risks might threaten the Group’s viability. 
Over the course of the year the Audit Committee has considered a 
deep-dive review of the following principal risks to enable a thorough 
assessment of the impact of these risks on ongoing viability:
Principal risk Matters considered by the Audit Committee
Cyber security Review of the cyber security framework

Recycling and commodity 
market volatility
Management and de-risking of recycling 
and commodity market volatility
Recruitment and retention Review of people risks including the ability 
to  attract and retain the right skills to deliver 
the Group strategy
Water resources, flooding and 
resilience
Consider the impact of climate change 
and drought risks on water resources 
and ongoing flood-related resilience
It was determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation 
compromise the Group’s viability, so a number of plausible risk 
combinations were considered to stress test the plan, primarily 
by reducing revenues, increasing costs and impacting cash flows. 
The Board considered the monetary impact of these scenarios over 
a five-year period, to ensure that they did not adversely impact the 
Group’s viability. The five-year period was chosen for consistency 
with the length of the Water business’s regulatory contract and the 
associated business planning cycle, and the longer-term nature of 
the business.
In making the assessment, the Directors have taken account of 
the Group’s robust capital solvency position, its ability to raise new 
finance and a key potential mitigating action of restricting any 
non-contractual payments.
In assessing the prospects of the Group, the Directors note that, as 
the Group operates in a regulatory industry which potentially can 
be subject to non-market influences, such assessment is subject to 
uncertainty, the level of which depends on the proximity of the time 
horizon. Accordingly the future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or 
predicted with certainty.
As set out in the Audit Committee’s report on page 68, the Directors 
reviewed and discussed the process undertaken by management, 
and also reviewed the results of the stress testing performed.
Forward-looking statements
This strategic report, consisting of pages 1 to 51, contains forward-
looking statements regarding the financial position; results of operations; 
cash flows; dividends; financing plans; business strategies; operating 
efficiencies; capital and other expenditures; competitive positions; 
growth opportunities; plans and objectives of management; and other 
matters. These forward-looking statements including, without limitation, 
those relating to the future business prospects, revenues, working 
capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income in relation to 
Pennon Group and its subsidiaries, wherever they occur in this strategic 
report, are necessarily based on assumptions reflecting the views of 
Pennon Group and its subsidiary companies, as appropriate. 
They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the 
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements should, 
therefore, be considered in the light of relevant factors, including 
those set out in this section on principal risks and uncertainties.
The strategic report consisting of pages 1 to 51 was approved by 
the Board on 23 May 2017.

 Good governance 
provides the framework 
for effective delivery of 
our strategy, the 
creation of shareholder 
value and the ongoing 
development of our 
sustainable business. 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the corporate governance 
report for 2017 on behalf of the Board. This is the 
principal method of reporting to our shareholders 
on the Board’s governance policies and the 
practical application of the principles of good 
corporate governance.
Strong governance is central to the successful 
management of any company. At Pennon it provides 
the framework for effective delivery of our strategy, 
the creation of shareholder value and the ongoing 
development of our sustainable business. In my 
second year as Chairman of Pennon I remain 
committed to ensuring that we continue to operate 
to the highest standards of corporate governance.
During the year we monitored the operation of the 
revised governance structures that were put in place 
in April 2016 and a review was carried out by our 
Senior Independent Director, Gill Rider, alongside 
an independent external evaluation of the Board’s 
structure, operation and performance. Based on 
these assessments, the Board has concluded that 
the governance framework, which comprises the 
operation of the Board, its Committees, executive 
management and the board of South West Water, 
as well as the risk management and internal control 
environment described on pages 46 and 62, is robust 
and effective, and is operating smoothly. It provides 
a  strong foundation for efficient and transparent 
decision-making while preserving the degree of 
regulatory independence that Ofwat requires for 
the water business.
Role of the Board and its effectiveness 
My primary role as Chairman is to provide leadership 
to the Board and to provide the right environment 
to enable each of the Directors and the Board as a 
whole to perform effectively to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders. 
In doing so we take account of the interests of our 
customers, employees, suppliers, the communities in 
which we operate and other interested stakeholders 
including Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, the 
UK environment agencies and other regulatory 
bodies in the UK.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 103
meetings and calls in 
our comprehensive 
IR programme
16
city conferences, salesforce 
briefings and roadshows
The revised governance structure implemented 
in April 2016 has reinforced the good governance 
already in place and has helped us to operate 
effectively and cohesively as a Board. It is my 
responsibility to act on the results of the annual 
performance evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees via an action plan approved by the 
Board. The aim is to identify further areas for 
improvement and ensure that our knowledge, 
skills and processes remain relevant as the Group’s 
businesses develop and grow. Further details of the 
review, which was facilitated by an external governance 
consultancy, are set out later in this report. 
The revised Board structure also assists the 
Directors in maintaining up-to-date knowledge 
and understanding of our total business as we 
pursue our strategy described in the strategic report.
Shareholder engagement
We maintain appropriate and regular dialogue 
with our shareholders to ensure that there is a 
good understanding of our rationale for our 
strategy and our performance actions. It also allows 
shareholders to provide feedback on the matters 
they consider to be important and any issues which 
require addressing. 
We have a comprehensive investor relations 
programme. During the year some 103 meetings 
and conference calls were held. Pennon attended 
eight city conferences and sales force briefings and 
eight roadshows, including in the US and mainland 
Europe. This engagement covered both current and 
prospective shareholders, the majority of which are 
institutional, with the remainder being a selection of 
large private client investment managers. In addition, 
this year we held a site visit to Viridor’s Ardley Energy 
Recovery Facility near Oxford.
The Chief Financial Officer continues to report to the 
Board regularly on major shareholders’ views about 
the Group, and every six months the Company’s 
corporate brokers present to the Board on equity 
market developments and shareholder perceptions. 
This ensures that the Board is fully briefed on the 
views and aspirations of shareholders. 
I will actively encourage the participation of our 
shareholders at our AGMs and will welcome 
questions on any business issues affecting the 
Group. As usual, at our 2017 AGM on 6 July all of 
our Directors intend to be present together with a 
number of other senior executives of our businesses 
to meet with shareholders to further explain 
developments at Pennon.
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other 
requirements 
I am pleased to report that throughout the year the 
Company complied with the provisions and applied 
the main principles set out in the UK Code with 
no exceptions to report. The UK Code is published 
on the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) website, 
www.frc.org.uk. In accordance with the FRC’s 
requirements, we have reported against the 
September 2014 version of the Code, which is 
effective for reporting periods commencing on 
or after 1 October 2014 and before 17 June 2016.
In addition, as the holding company of South West 
Water Limited, the Company has complied with 
Ofwat’s principles for holding companies in respect 
of Board leadership, transparency and governance.
My introduction to this corporate governance report 
and the following sections are made in compliance 
with the UK Code, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Listing Rule 9.8.6 and FCA Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 7.1 and 7.2 and cover the 
work of our Board and its Committees, our internal 
control systems and procedures including risk 
management, our corporate governance statements 
relating to share capital and control, our confirmation 
of the Company as a going concern and Directors’ 
responsibility statements. Finally, in accordance with 
reporting requirements, on page 103 the Board 
confirms to shareholders that the Annual Report 
and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

All of the Non-Executive Directors are considered to have the 
appropriate skills, experience in their respective disciplines and 
personality to bring independent and objective judgement to the 
Board’s deliberations. Their biographies on pages 56 and 57 and the 
experience chart above demonstrates collectively a broad range of 
business, financial and other relevant experience.
Directors’ roles
Neil Cooper is chairman of the Audit Committee and in accordance 
with the UK Code and FCA Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1.1 
he has recent and relevant financial experience (as set out in his 
biography on page 57). Martin Angle is also a member of the 
Audit Committee and he has relevant financial experience as set 
out in his biography on page 57. 
There is a clear separation of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the CEO, divided between managing the Board and the business, 
while they of course maintain a close working relationship.

All of the Non-Executive Directors were considered by the Board 
to be independent throughout the year. None of the relationships 
or circumstances set out in provision B.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the UK Code) applied to the Non-Executive 
Directors listed on the following page. In December 2017 Martin Angle 
will reach the ninth anniversary of his appointment. The Board is 
satisfied that Martin continues to demonstrate independence of 
character and judgement in the performance of his role as a Director 
and therefore has determined that he remains independent.
Sir John Parker met the independence criteria set out in provision 
B.1.1 of the UK Code on his appointment as Chairman and there 
have been no significant changes to his external commitments since 
his appointment.

All the Directors are equally accountable for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs but they do have specific roles, which include those 
set out below:
The Board and its 
governance framework 
continued
In 2016 the number of scheduled Board meetings was reduced from 
ten to nine per year (plus an annual strategy day) and the number 
of scheduled Committee meetings was reduced to four per year to 
coincide with Board meetings. Board and Committee meetings are 
arranged over a session lasting a day and a half, which includes a 
working dinner for the Directors. Additional meetings of Committees 
are arranged as and when necessary. This approach allows for longer 
agendas and in depth review and discussion around complex matters.
Managing the Group and its subsidiaries
The Board’s responsibilities include overall leadership of the Group, 
setting the Group’s values, policies and standards, approving Pennon’s 
strategy and objectives and providing oversight of the Group’s 
operations and its performance. The Board makes decisions in relation 
to Group and Viridor business in accordance with its schedule of 
matters reserved. The South West Water board continues to operate 
as a separate independent board in accordance with its own schedule 
of matters reserved to ensure compliance with Ofwat’s principles on 
board leadership, transparency and governance.
60
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Detailed consideration of certain matters is delegated to Board 
Committees, to the Executive Directors and to the Group General 
Counsel & Company Secretary, as appropriate. In addition to the 
matters the Directors are required to decide by statute or regulation, 
the matters reserved to the Board in relation to Pennon Group plc 
and Viridor Limited include: 
 • all acquisitions and disposals 
 • major items of capital expenditure 
 • authority levels for other expenditure 
 • risk management process and monitoring of risks 
 • approval of the strategic plan and annual operating budgets 
 • Group policies, procedures and delegations 
 • appointments to the Board and its Committees. 
The Board also ratifies certain decisions taken by the South West 
Water board, including major capital projects and investments, 
long-term objectives and commercial strategy, the five-year regulatory 
plan, annual budgets and certain decisions relating to financing. This 
approach is compatible with Ofwat’s principles for holding companies 
in respect of Board leadership, transparency and governance.
Operation of the Board
The Board operates by receiving written reports circulated in advance 
of the meetings from the Executive Directors and the Group General 
Counsel & Company Secretary on matters within their respective 
business areas of the Group. When appropriate, the Board also receives 
presentations on key areas of the business and undertakes site visits 
to gain a better understanding of the operation of business initiatives. 
Under the guidance of the Chairman, all matters before the Board are 
discussed openly. Presentations and advice are received frequently 
from other senior executives within the Group and from external 
advisers to facilitate the decision-making of the Board. 
The Pennon Board and the South West Water board usually meet 
sequentially, which allows a more holistic and cohesive approach to 
decision-making and communication across the Group. This is 
facilitated by the dual directorships held by a number of the Directors.
Pennon Executive management
The role of the Pennon Executive is to define and drive the business 
priorities that will achieve delivery of the strategy. It is responsible for 
ensuring, to the extent of the authority delegated by the Board, the 
proper and prudent management of Group resources to create and 
maximise shareholder value. 
Chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, the Pennon Executive meets 
formally on a monthly basis to review and refine recommendations to 
be presented to the Board.

Board support and training 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group General 
Counsel & Company Secretary, and the Board has an established 
procedure whereby Directors, in order to fulfil their duties, may seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
Newly appointed Directors receive a formal induction which includes 
an explanation of the Group structure, regulatory and legal issues, the 
Group governance framework and policies, the Group’s approach to 
risk management and its principal risks (financial and non-financial, 
including environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks), duties 
and obligations (including protocols around conflicts of interest and 
dealing in shares), and the current activities of the Board and its 
Committees. Directors also visit operating facilities across the Group 
and have meetings with staff to receive briefings on key processes 
and systems. 
The training needs of Directors are reviewed as part of the Board’s 
performance evaluation process each year. Training consists of 
attendance at external courses organised by professional advisers 
and also internal presentations from senior management.

Governance Performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its 
performance and that of its Committees and Directors each year. 
This year, Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP, who are independent 
board performance consultants with no other connection with 
the Company, facilitated the evaluation of the Board’s and the 
Committees’ performance. The exercise was conducted in March 
2017 by way of a series of structured interviews with all the Directors, 
various members of the senior executive team, the Internal Audit 
Manager and the External Audit Partner. 
The agenda for these interviews was circulated to each participant 
prior to the meetings and was designed to assess:
 • whether the Directors had thoroughly discussed and agreed the 
use of shareholders’ funds to ensure the Company was successful 
whilst managing the risks inherent in the strategy, plans and the 
operating environment
 • the effectiveness of the Board in ensuring that the executive team 
had implemented the strategy and plans, and had managed all the 
other activities of the Company well.
Armstrong Bonham Carter collated and analysed the results from 
each interview and prepared separate reports on the performance 
of the Board as a whole and one for each Committee, all of which 
were reviewed and discussed by the Board. 
The Senior Independent Director separately conducted a review of 
the individual directors’ performance and the Chairman’s performance 
was evaluated separately by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director.
The review concluded that the Board, its Committees and its 
individual Directors had demonstrated a high degree of effectiveness. 
The new Board structure was viewed most positively and had helped 
the Non-Executive Directors to achieve a broader knowledge of both 
businesses. Consequently, the Board had a good understanding 
of opportunities for growth and the threats facing the business. 
The Board’s commitment to health and safety was widely noted 
and all Directors commented on the need to improve performance 
following three fatalities since 2013. The appointment of a new 
Group director of Safety, Health, Quality and Sustainability, who will 
work to embed a strong health and safety culture throughout the 
Group, was welcomed. In addition, the Board agreed to adopt actions 
relating to the development of Group strategy, the shaping of Pennon’s 
corporate values and increased focus on employee engagement. 
Subsequently the Board agreed and implemented an action plan 
which it will monitor regularly. 
Conclusions and recommendations in respect of the composition of 
the Board were considered by the Nomination Committee and are 
covered on page 70.
Board Committees’ terms of reference 
In accordance with Group policies, a range of key matters are 
delegated to the Board’s Committees as set out on pages 63 to 73 of 
this governance report. 
The terms of reference of each of the Board’s Committees are set out 
on the Company’s website www.pennon-group.co.uk and are also 
available from the Group Company Secretary upon request. 
Dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest 
In accordance with the directors’ interest provision of the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has in 
place a procedure for the consideration and authorisation of Directors’ 
conflicts or possible conflicts with the Company’s interests. This has 
operated effectively during the year.
Risk management and the Group’s 
system of internal control 
The Board is responsible for maintaining the Group’s system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s 
assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. There is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group that has been in place throughout 2016/17 and 
up to the date of the approval of this annual report and accounts. 
The Group’s system of internal control is consistent with the FRC’s 
new ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’ (FRC Internal Control Guidance).
The Board confirms that it applies procedures in accordance with 
the UK Code and the FRC Internal Control Guidance which brings 
together elements of best practice for risk management and internal 
control by companies. The Board’s risk framework described on page 
46 in the strategic report provides for the identification of key risks 
including ESG risks in relation to the achievement of the business 
objectives of the Group, monitoring of such risks and ongoing and 
annual evaluation of the overall process. 
As part of the review of the effectiveness of the system of risk 
management and internal control under the Group risk management 
policy, all Executive Directors and senior managers are required to 
certify on an annual basis that they have effective controls in place 
to manage risks and to operate in compliance with legislation and 
Group procedures. 
The Group also has policies covering suspected fraud, anti-bribery 
and whistleblowing, which were reviewed and refreshed during the 
year. Allegations of misconduct and irregularity are thoroughly 
investigated and follow-up action in respect of the Group’s control 
environment is taken when appropriate. In the normal course of 
business, investigations into irregularities may be ongoing as of 
the date of the approval of the financial statements. 
The Group’s processes and policies serve to ensure that a culture 
of effective control and risk management is embedded throughout 
the Group and that the Group is in a position to react appropriately 
to new risks as they arise. Details of key risks affecting the Group 
are set out in the strategic report on pages 47 to 50.

The Audit Committee report
Neil Cooper
Audit Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee’s report on its activities 
during the year. 
As in previous years, the principal responsibilities of the Committee 
continue to be focused in a number of key areas: firstly, on ensuring 
the appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting; an activity 
which includes the testing of accounting judgements made in 
preparing reporting and in assessing whether the presentation of the 
Group’s activities is fair, balanced and understandable. Secondly, on 
reviewing and challenging the ongoing effectiveness of the internal 
control environment and thirdly, on the scope of risk management 
processes across the Group, including monitoring the Group’s risk 
appetite as well as acting as a forum in which to carry out more 
detailed reviews of higher risk areas of the operation. 
Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the external auditor 
and the internal audit function is an important ongoing element 
of the Committee’s assurance activities. These responsibilities are 
discharged throughout the year in accordance with the calendar of 
business of the Committee, which is designed to allow sufficient time 
for their consideration whilst also permitting time to be spent on 
related key financial matters. In this context, the Committee notes 
that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Audit Quality Review team 
assessed the audit of the Group’s 2016 report and accounts during the 
year and the Committee has received and discussed a report from 
the Company’s external auditor with regards to the findings, as set 
out on page 66. 
Following the establishment last year of a new Group executive risk 
management forum to assess risk appetite and monitor key risks 
and their mitigation, the Committee has received detailed ‘deep dive’ 
presentations from senior management on individual principal risks 
including, for example, drinking water contamination risk, wholesale 
energy market risk, ERF business interruption and continuity 
management, EU/UK regulatory and legislative change, non-
recoverable debt in South West Water and Viridor recycling and 
commodity activities. More detail on our risk management processes, 
principal risks and their associated mitigation can be found on pages 
46 to 51. Aligned with this we continue to assess the Company’s 
viability over a period of five years, which we consider to be aligned 
with key business cycle periods in the water business and the 
longer-term nature of Viridor’s ERF assets, as well as being reasonable 
in terms of our ability to look forward with some certainty in the 
business and regulatory environment in which the Company operates. 
Our viability statement is reported on page 51.
As part of the half-year and year-end reporting review process, we 
reviewed and challenged the key financial reporting judgements of 
management as set out on page 65. Significant matters considered by 
the Committee both during the year and in relation to the year-end 
financial statements are laid out in this report.
Neil Cooper  
Audit Committee Chairman
 The role of the Audit 
Committee is to ensure 
that robust systems are 
in place for financial

All of the Committee members are also members of the Remuneration 
Committee, which allows them to provide input into both Committees 
on any Group performance matters and on the management of any 
risk factors relevant to remuneration matters.
Significant matters considered by the Committee 
The calendar of business of the Committee sets in place a framework 
for ensuring that it manages its affairs efficiently and effectively 
throughout the year and is able to concentrate on the key matters 
that affect the Group. 
The most significant matters that the Committee considered and 
made decisions on during the year and, where appropriate, since the 
year end, are set out below and opposite.

64
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Governance  • Discussed the results of independent performance evaluation of the Committee, conducted by Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP
 • Reviewed new annual report disclosure requirements including the audit report
 • Considered and approved Group accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
 • Reviewed updated Group policies covering treasury and foreign exchange
 • Confirmed compliance with the UK Code 
 • Regularly held separate meetings with the external auditor and the Group Internal Audit Manager without members of management being present
In respect of the monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements, which is a key responsibility of the Committee identified in the UK Code, 
the significant areas of judgement considered in relation to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 are set out in the 
following table, together with details of how each matter was addressed by the Committee. At the Committee’s meetings throughout the year 
the Committee and the external auditor have discussed the significant matters arising in respect of financial reporting during the year and the 
areas of particular audit focus, as reported on in the independent auditor’s report on pages 106 to 113. In addition to the significant matters set 
out in the table below, the Committee considered a range of other matters. These include presentational matters, in particular relating to the 
non-underlying disclosure format and ensuring a fair presentation of statutory and non-statutory performance and financial measures.
During the year, the Group has seen substantial impact from movements in derivatives, both as a result of market movements and as a result of changes 
in our expectations of economic benefits. This has led to the early unwind of a derivative through Peninsula MB Limited, giving rise to a substantial 
non-underlying charge. The Committee and Board have received several updates and reports from the Chief Financial Officer in regard to these 
movements, deeming management’s approach to the accounting recognition and disclosure of these items, as non-underlying, to be appropriate.
Area of focus by 
the Committee 
How the matter was addressed by the Committee 
Revenue 
recognition 
There were a number of judgement areas in respect of revenue recognition relating to income from measured water services, estimates of timing of 
receipt of unmeasured revenue, accounting for revenue from long-term service concession arrangements under IFRIC 12 and calculation of accrued 
income on waste management contracts and powergen. The Committee relied on South West Water’s track record of assessing an appropriate level of 
accrual at previous year ends given actual outturns and Viridor’s internal processes for analysing complex long-term contracts. The Committee also 
closely considered the work in respect of these areas at year end by the external auditor as well as reviewing disclosures around revenue recognition 
accounting policies.
Non-current 
asset 
impairment 
review and 
provisions 
Recognising that the value of certain non-current assets and long-term environmental provisions within Viridor can be sensitive to changes in assumptions 
over future discount rates and cash flow projections which require judgement, the Committee pays careful attention to asset impairment and provisions. 
The Committee noted the substantial headroom in the mandatory review of goodwill for impairment, resulting in this area being deemed less judgemental. 
Following a detailed review of the analysis undertaken, and consideration of management assumptions in relation to both the value of environmental 
provisions and the assessment of indicators for potential impairment of non-current assets, the Committee was satisfied that a robust and consistent 
approach had been followed and that the management’s assertion that the carrying value of these assets and liabilities remained reasonable, and therefore 
the Committee were able to approve the disclosures in the financial statements.
This key area was also closely reviewed as part of the year-end audit by the external auditor. 
South West 
Water bad and 
doubtful debts 
Regular updates on progress against debt collection targets and other contractual payments due are received by the Board. Performance is monitored 
regularly against South West Water’s historical collection record and the track record of other companies in the sector. At the year end the external 
auditor reported on the work it had performed, which together with the detailed analysis reported, enabled the Committee to conclude that 
management’s assessment of the year-end position was reasonable. 
Provisions for 
uncertain tax 
positions 
It remains the general policy of the Group to take a balanced view of its tax position and only release tax provisions when matters under discussion are 
expected to be cleared by HM Revenue & Customs. At the year end the Chief Financial Officer provided a report to the Board setting out the resolution 
of a number of uncertain tax items, the background to which had been considered in detail by the Committee on a regular basis as part of progress 
reports from the Chief Financial Officer. It was noted that on resolution of these matters the level of judgement required in assessing the year end tax 
creditor was consequently reduced. 
Where appropriate expert external legal and accounting advice and other specialist taxation advice had been sought which assisted the Committee in 
forming a view on the appropriateness of the provisions for remaining uncertain tax positions and related tax disclosures in the financial statements. 
Going concern 
basis for the 
preparation of 
the financial 
statements and 
viability 
statement
A report from the Chief Financial Officer on the financial performance of the Group including forward-looking assessments of covenant compliance and 
funding levels under differing scenarios is provided to the Board on a periodic basis. Rolling five-year strategy projections and the resultant headroom 
relative to borrowings is also regularly reviewed by the Board, including scenarios to better enable the committee to understand the potential range of 
outcomes. At the end of each six month period the Chief Financial Officer prepares for consideration by the Committee a report focusing on the Group’s 
liquidity over the 12-month period from the date of signing either the annual report or half-year results. This year the Committee has also considered a report 
from the Chief Financial Officer on the Group’s financial viability over an appropriate period, which the Board considers to be five years, in connection with the 
new UK Corporate Governance Code requirement for a viability statement to be given by the Board. Consideration of these reports and constructive 
challenge on the findings of the reports, including the scenario testing carried out by management, has enabled the Committee to form its assessment and 
satisfy itself that it remains appropriate for the Group to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements and in addition advise the Board on providing the viability statement set out on page 51.
Effectiveness of the external audit process 
Receiving high quality and effective audit services is of paramount importance to the Committee. We continue to monitor carefully the 
effectiveness of our external auditor as well as its independence, bearing in mind that it is recognised there is a need to use our external 
auditor’s firm for certain non-audit services. We have full regard to the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards and ensure that our 
procedures and safeguards meet these standards. 
The current external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, was appointed following a comprehensive audit tender process and approval by shareholders 
at the Company’s 2014 AGM. Their reappointment was approved at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. Debbie O’Hanlon is the audit partner and 
has been in that role since Ernst & Young’s appointment.
65
Governance The Audit  
Committee report 
continued
The external auditor produced a detailed audit planning report in 
preparation for the year-end financial statements, which has assisted 
the auditor in delivering the timely audit of the Group’s annual report 
and financial statements and which was shared with, and discussed by, 
the Committee in advance. 
The effectiveness review of the external auditor is undertaken as part 
of the Committee’s annual performance evaluation, which was carried 
out by independent external consultants, Armstrong Bonham Carter 
LLP. Further details of the performance evaluation are provided on 
page 62. No issues were raised during that review and the Committee 
concluded that the auditor was effective during the year. In addition, 
during the year the FRC’s Audit Quality Review team reviewed the 
audit of the Group’s 31 March 2016 financial statements, focussing on 
the audit of impairment, taxation and revenue. The FRC categorised 
the audit as ‘good or limited improvements required’, with no 
significant areas for improvement identified. Following the review and 
discussion of the findings by the Committee, changes were made to 
the auditor’s approach to the audit of revenue in the waste business. 
The Committee considered that it is appropriate that the external 
auditor be re-appointed and has made this recommendation to the 
Board. The Committee chairman has also met privately with 
the external auditor. 
Auditor independence 
The Committee carefully reviews on an ongoing basis the relationship 
with the external auditor to ensure that the auditor’s independence 
and objectivity is fully safeguarded. 
The external auditor reported on their independence during the year 
and again since the year end, confirming to the Committee that they 
have complied with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
and, based on their assessment, that they were independent of 
the Group.
Provision of non-audit services 
In line with the requirements of the EU Audit Directive and Regulation 
which came into force on 17 June 2016, the Committee continues to 
have a robust policy for the engagement of the external auditor’s firm 
for non-audit work. The Committee receives a regular report covering 
the auditor’s fees including details of non-audit fees incurred. 
Recurrent fees relate to agreed procedures in relation to annual 
regulatory reporting obligations to Ofwat, work most efficiently and 
effectively performed by the statutory auditor. The policy is for 
non-audit fees not to exceed 70% of the audit fee for statutory work. 
The Committee carefully reviews non-audit work proposed for the 
statutory auditor, taking into consideration whether it was necessary 
for the auditor’s firm to carry out such work and would only grant 
approval for the firm’s appointment if it was satisfied that the auditor’s 
independence and objectivity would be fully safeguarded. If there was 
another accounting firm that could provide the required level of 
experience and expertise in respect of the non-audit services, then 
such firm would be chosen in preference to the external auditor.
The level of non-audit fees payable to the external auditor for the past 
year is 11.3% of the audit fee, which is well within the Group’s 70% 
non-audit fee limit. 
The Chief Financial Officer regularly reports to the Committee on the 
extent of services provided to the Company by the external auditor 
and the level of fees paid. The fees paid to the external auditor’s firm 
for non-audit services and for audit services are set out in note 7 to 
the financial statements on page 132. 
Internal audit 
The internal audit activities of the Group are a key part of the internal 
control and risk management framework of the Group. At Group level 
there is a long-standing and effective centralised internal audit service 
led by an experienced head of function who makes a significant 
contribution to the ability of the Committee to deliver its responsibilities. 
A Group internal audit plan is approved in September each year. It 
takes account of the principal risks, the activities to be undertaken 
by the external auditor, and also the Group’s annual and ongoing risk 
management reviews. This approach seeks to ensure that there is a 
programme of internal and external audit reviews focused on identified 
key risk areas throughout the Group. 
The Group Internal Audit Manager reports regularly to the Committee 
on audit reviews undertaken and their findings, and there are regular 
discussions, correspondence and private meetings between the Group 
Internal Audit Manager and the Committee chairman. 
During the year an external assessment of the internal function was 
performed by KPMG LLP, concluding that the Company’s internal 
audit function conforms to IIA standards issued by the Institute of 
Internal Auditors. The review highlighted both areas of good practice 
and some areas for improvement which would improve the delivery of 
the Company’s internal audit function.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
To enable the Committee to advise the Board in making its statement 
that it considered that the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts is 
fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) on page 103, the Committee 
has applied a detailed FBU review framework that takes account of 
the Group’s well-documented verification process undertaken in 
conjunction with the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
This is in addition to the formal process carried out by the external 
auditor to enable the preparation of the independent auditor’s report, 
which is set out on pages 106 to 113. 
In preparing and finalising the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Committee considered a report on the actions taken by 
management in accordance with the FBU process and an FBU 
assessment undertaken by each Group executive management board. 
This assisted the Committee in carrying out its own assessment and 
being able to advise the Board that it considered that the Annual 
Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
Statement of compliance with CMA order 
Having undertaken a competitive audit tender process in 2014, the 
Company is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.

The Sustainability  
Committee report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Sustainability Committee’s report on its 
activities during the year. Sustainability remains an integral part of 
Pennon’s strategy, and the Group continues to take this responsibility 
seriously in all its business and operational practices. Our investment 
and our commitment to high levels of service and performance will 
contribute to meeting our communities’ long-term needs – for water, 
energy and waste management.
The role of the Sustainability Committee is to promote the highest 
standards of corporate responsibility by bringing together and 
reviewing initiatives that drive sustainability, approving targets and 
monitoring the progress made in achieving Pennon’s strategic 
sustainability objectives. Those objectives are set out on page 69. 
We are well equipped to oversee performance from the perspective 
of the Group and that of the individual businesses, with additional 
attendees Lord Matthew Taylor (South West Water non-executive 
director), Stephen Bird (Managing Director, South West Water) and 
Phil Piddington (Managing Director, Viridor) contributing to the 
Committee’s discussions. We are delighted with the strengthening 
of the executive team and envisage that director of Safety, Health, 
Quality and Sustainability, the director of Environment and the interim 
director of Human Resources, all recently recruited to Group-level 
roles, will play a central role in supporting the Committee as we 
continue to guide the business and advise the Board on sustainability 
which we believe is material to delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
Pennon’s business model and its strategic priorities on pages 14 to 17 
show how a thorough approach to sustainability helps us to draw 
together the needs of society with the delivery of commercial success. 
The Group’s long-term strategic priorities are designed to create 
value for all our stakeholders – our customers, our communities and 
our people, as well as our investors – and details of how we are 
implementing this strategy are provided throughout the annual report. 
We are pleased to note the results in both businesses, which confirm 
sustainability is indeed integrated in all we do.
Gill Rider

The Pennon Sustainability Committee and the South West Water 
sustainability committee meet sequentially on the same day. Senior 
executives also attend meetings to support discussions on their 
specific areas of expertise.
Neil Cooper stood down from the Committee on 1 April 2016 and 
Steve Johnson, who was a member of the South West Water 
sustainability committee, resigned on 28 April 2016 as a non-executive 
director of South West Water. Recruitment for a replacement 
is underway.
The responsibilities of the South West Water sustainability committee 
mirror those of the Pennon Sustainability Committee but only in 
respect of South West Water. In addition, the South West Water 
sustainability committee continues to provide oversight of South 
West Water’s performance against its sustainability targets and the 
sustainability activities that are core to the successful delivery of 
South West Water’s K6 Business Plan 2015-2020. This is consistent 
with Ofwat’s requirement for independent governance of our 
regulatory business.
During the year the Committee continued to apply the best 
practice framework published by Business in the Community (BitC), 
a leading business-led charity that promotes responsible business. 
The structure provided through BitC’s key areas of sustainability 
(marketplace, workplace, community and environment) is reflected 
in Pennon’s sustainability objectives and supports the development 
of a range of targets by South West Water and Viridor as part of their 
business planning processes. 
We aim to set stretching targets and as at 31 March 2017 South West 
Water had achieved eight of its 12 targets for the year and Viridor had 
completed eight out of 16 of its targets. Further details will be provided 
in Viridor’s sustainability report and South West Water’s company 
annual performance report, to be published in June 2017 and 
July 2017 respectively. 
The Sustainability Committee balances the requirement to conduct 
business in a responsible manner (in relation to environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) matters) while at the same time delivering 
strong financial performance and lasting value for shareholders and
other stakeholders. The Sustainability Committee reviews and 
approves as appropriate the strategies, policies, management, 
initiatives, targets and performance of the Pennon Group companies 
in the areas of occupational health and safety and security, 
environment, workplace policies, responsible and ethical business 
practice, customer service and engagement, and the role of the 
Group in society.
Since last year’s report, the Committee has considered a wide range of 
matters in the course of fulfilling its duties in accordance with its terms 
of reference: 
 • the Group’s health and safety performance (including a health and 
safety ‘deep dive’) and the effectiveness of health and safety 
policies and procedures 
 • environmental strategy and performance 
 • performance in respect of customer service and engagement 
 • the Group’s approach to community relations and investment 
 • performance against the Group’s workplace policy, including review 
of the results of employee engagement surveys conducted by 
Pennon, South West Water and Viridor 
 • sustainable procurement and practices within the supply chain 
 • sustainability reporting for 2016 and the associated verifier’s 
reports and recommendations 
 • progress against the sustainability targets for 2016/17 and 
sustainability targets for 2017/18. 
In addition, the Committee considered: 
 • the development of Pennon’s new Code of Conduct, which sets out 
the principles that should guide our employees’ actions and 
support everyday decision making
 • the establishment of a Group-wide compliance and 
ethics programme
 • the results of Business in the Community’s 2016 benchmarking 
assessment of South West Water and Viridor, with both 
organisations awarded two and a half stars out of five
 • the results of Committee’s independent performance evaluation 
conducted by Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP 
 • modifications to the Committee’s terms of reference.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Strategic sustainability objectives
The Sustainability Committee has defined the following 
strategic objectives, which drive the sustainability targets 
set by South West Water and Viridor. Commentary on our 
performance against our objectives is integrated throughout 
the strategic report.
 • Manage Pennon Group as a sustainable and successful 
business for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and 
other stakeholders 
 • Aim to ensure that all our business activities have a positive 
economic, social and environmental impact on the 
communities in which we operate 
 • Engage with our customers and other stakeholders and foster 
good relationships with them 
 • Strive for the highest standards of health and safety in the 
workplace so as to minimise accidents, incidents and lost time 
 • Develop and motivate our employees, treat them fairly and 
ensure that they are fully engaged in all aspects of Pennon 
Group’s objectives and follow the highest standards 
of business conduct
 • Aspire to leadership in minimising emissions that  
contribute to climate change, and develop climate  
change adaption strategies 
 • Aspire to leadership in all aspects of waste prevention  
and resource efficiency by delivering solutions for society  
to address the environmental challenge of depleting  
natural resources.
 
Reporting and verification 
In reporting on sustainability, the Company has sought to comply 
with the Investment Association Guidelines on Responsible 
Investment Disclosure. 
Pennon’s sustainability performance and reporting has been 
audited by Strategic Management Consultants Limited (SMC), 
an independent management consultancy specialising in technical 
assurance in the utility sector. Pennon considers that SMC’s method 
of verification – which includes testing the assumptions, methods and 
procedures that are followed in the development of data and auditing 
that data to ensure accuracy and consistency – complements the best 
practice insight gained through South West Water’s and Viridor’s 
membership of Business in the Community. Certain disclosures within 
this annual report that relate to the sustainability performance of 
South West Water and Bournemouth Water have been verified by 
SMC against the output of an independent audit of regulatory data 
conducted by CH2M. 
Benchmarking

Governance The Nomination Committee met four times during the year to fulfil the 
duties set out in its terms of reference. 
Matters considered by the Committee during the year included: 
 • The recruitment for a non-executive director of South West Water, 
to fill the vacancy arising from the resignation of Steve Johnson in 
April 2016
 • The appointment of the Group director of Safety, Health, Quality 
and Sustainability, the interim Group director of Human Resources 
and the Group director of Environment
 • The recruitment of a director of Wastewater Services, 
South West Water
 • A review of succession plans, the leadership needs of the Group 
and the Group’s approach to succession planning, resulting in the 
instigation of a project to be undertaken by the interim Group 
director of Human Resources
 • the structure, size and composition of the Board, including 
the skills, knowledge, independence, diversity and experience 
of the Directors, taking into account the findings of the 
independent performance evaluation conducted by 
Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP
 • a review of the time spent by Non-Executive Directors in 
fulfilling their duties and the other directorships they hold
 • the steps to be taken to bring further skills and experience in 
environmental management into the executive team resulting 
in the appointment of Ed Mitchell to the new role of director of 
Environment, after the year end
 • the Group’s performance against its diversity and equality policies.
It is the practice of the Committee, led by the Chairman, to appoint an 
external search consultancy to assist in Board appointments to ensure 
that an extensive and robust search can be made for suitable 
candidates. Buchannan Harvey & Co, who have no other connection 
with the Company, were engaged to assist with the recruitment of a 
non-executive director for the South West Water board, the process 
for which is still underway.

The Board’s diversity policy confirms that the Board is committed to: 
 • the search for Board candidates being conducted, and appointments 
made, on merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for 
the benefits of gender and ethnic diversity on the Board 
 • satisfying itself that plans are in place for orderly succession of 
appointments to the Board and to senior management to maintain 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Group

Board level. 
We are pleased to report that, at the year end, 36% of Pennon 
Executive members were women compared to the reported 22% at 
31 March 2016. Action is being taken to improve diversity across the 
workforce which will assist in increasing female representation at 
senior management level as described on page 19. 
The Committee and the Board will continue to monitor and promote 
diversity across the Group with the aim of ensuring women are 
appropriately represented on the Pennon Executive. 
As well as its diversity policy, the Group has a number of policies in 
place embracing workplace matters, including non-discrimination and 
equal opportunities policies which are reported on separately on page 
18, together with information regarding the gender breakdown of the 
workforce on page 19.

75 Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017
Annual Statement from 
the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder 
Introduction 
I am pleased to present, on behalf of our Board, the Remuneration 
Committee’s Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 March 2017. 
We are submitting a revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy) 
for a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM, following the 
expiration of a three year period. As explained below, the revised 
Policy follows the first comprehensive review of our executive 
remuneration arrangements for 10 years and reflects the major 
changes Pennon has made to its strategy, management structure 
and governance in the last year. This includes the appointment of 
Chris Loughlin to the newly created role of Group CEO, leading a new, 
restructured Pennon Executive team. It also reflects the challenges 
we face in the recruitment and retention of executive talent.
We have always sought to take a responsible approach to executive 
remuneration and are mindful of the views of shareholders and wider 
stakeholders. We have therefore consulted with the shareholder base 
and, taking on board feedback, have aligned our proposals accordingly.
On pages 88 to 99 we set out our annual report on remuneration 
which contains the remuneration of the Directors for the year 2016/17 
including the ‘single remuneration figure’ table. It also provides details 
on how our policy will be applied for 2017/18. This section of the report 
together with this letter is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at 
this year’s AGM. 
Last year the Remuneration Committee was pleased to note that 
97% of shareholders who voted approved the annual report on 
remuneration. The Committee appreciates the support of 
its shareholders.
Policy review
Over the last year we have undertaken a comprehensive review of all 
aspects of our executive remuneration arrangements. A particular 
focus was given to looking at our performance measurement 
framework afresh against our new Group structure, and to ensure its 
continued relevance and alignment with strategy and consistency with 
best practice. Throughout the process, the Committee has received 
advice from its remuneration advisers, Deloitte LLP, and from the 
Board Chairman.
This has been the first review of incentive levels for 10 years and, while 
a number of best practice features have been adopted in recent years, 
our review has also sought to address recent challenges that Pennon 
has faced in recruiting talent in a changing talent pool and business 
environment. Over the last ten years, the complexity of our business 
has increased, and we are now one of the largest environmental 
infrastructure groups in the UK.
Our objective continues to be to have remuneration arrangements 
that ensure the commitment of our Executive Directors to our 
long-term strategic objectives and to the creation of shareholder 
value, whilst ensuring their behaviours reflect the values of the 
organisation and actions are taken in accordance with our high 
standards of governance. 
 Our remuneration 
arrangements ensure 
the commitment of our 
Executive Directors  
to our long-term strategic 
objectives and to the creation 
of shareholder value. 
Read more about our strategic objectives on page 16
76 Governance
Proposed modifications
As a result of our review, and following input and feedback from 
shareholders, we are proposing some modifications to our 
remuneration policy, including a refreshed approach to our 
performance measurement framework, with metrics which are 
strongly aligned to our Group strategy and targets which are 
regarded as stretching. 
 • Long-term incentive plan (L TIP) performance measures 
– introduction of new performance metrics under our LTIP, 
aligned with our key strategic objectives. It is proposed, for 2017/18, 
that LTIP awards will be based on a combination of EPS growth, 
dividend growth/dividend cover, and return on capital employed 
(ROCE). These metrics align executives with the delivery of 
sustainable earnings and related cash flows, as well as our 
sector-leading dividend policy. We also took account of shareholder 
feedback and included a portion of the award linked to the 
long-term capital returns generated by our business. This moves 
away from our historic approach of using only Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR). Our review highlighted that it has become 
increasingly difficult to formulate a robust sector comparator group, 
and a FTSE 250 group is often counter cyclical to our sector.
 • L TIP opportunity – a proposed increase to our LTIP opportunity 
– the first increase to incentive quantum we have made for 10 
years. Under the proposed new policy, the maximum opportunity 
for executive directors will be increased from 100% to 150% of 
salary. Our recent experience in recruitment has led us to believe 
that we are not sufficiently competitive in the market. While careful 
consideration was given to the current climate, the Committee 
strongly believes that it is in shareholders’ interests to enable 
Pennon to compete for talent on a level playing field, securing 
an executive team who can deliver long-term business success. 
Our incentive levels will continue to be positioned conservatively 
against the market. As a Committee we also recognise the 
importance of stretching performance metrics in circumstances 
where we are seeking a higher maximum award.
 • L TIP simplification and performance alignment – simplification 
of our long-term incentive framework with the removal of the 
co-investment element under the new LTIP. In addition, vesting 
for threshold performance will be reduced from 30% to 25%.
 • Annual bonus performance measures – an increase in the 
combined weighting on Group financial metrics and the key 
operational measures on which performance is assessed by our 
regulator, customers, communities and wider stakeholders. We are 
not proposing any change to the existing maximum award or policy 
that 50% of any bonus is deferred into shares which are normally 
released after three years.
 • Shareholding guidelines and long-term stewardship – the size 
of the shareholding expected to be held by the Executive Directors 
will be significantly increased from 100% of salary to 200% of 
salary for both the CEO and CFO. This is to enhance the focus 
on long-term stewardship and to provide stronger alignment 
with shareholders.
 • Holding periods – we introduced two-year holding periods in 2015. 
We are retaining this feature and are formalising it as part of our policy.
Further details on the remuneration policy are set out on pages 79 
to 87.
Overall performance achieved during the year
The Group achieved a strong performance in 2016/17 across its water 
and waste businesses, delivering against its strategic objectives. Group 
underlying profit before tax was £250.0 million, an increase of 18.3% 
compared to 2015/16. Earnings per share (before deferred tax and 
non-underlying items) was up 19.0% at 47.0p reflecting higher profits.
South West Water’s return on regulated equity (RoRE) at 12.6% 
continues to lead the sector and Viridor generated EBITDA of £107 
million during the year, ahead of the target of c.£100 million. 
Key remuneration decisions 
For 2017/18, salaries for executive directors were increased by 1.5%, 
consistent with increases awarded to the wider employee population. 
The bonus outturns for the Executive Directors for 2016/17 reflect 
the strong achievements of the Group businesses in the year, the 
Company’s performance against corporate financial targets and the 
Executive Directors’ performance against individual targets. Half of the 
bonus is deferred into shares. Further details of targets, measures and 
performance are set out on pages 90 and 91. 
As regards the Company’s long-term incentive plan, the overall 
estimated outturn for awards vesting in 2017 at the end of the three 
year period is 43.7% of the maximum 100%. This reflects that the 
Company’s total shareholder return is estimated to exceed both the 
comparator index performance and the FTSE 250 group.
Board changes 
Ian McAulay (CEO of Viridor) stepped down from the Board on 
31 August 2016 and left the Group on 31 December 2016. Details of 
his leaving arrangements are set out on page 92. 
Looking forward 
We will continue to review our remuneration arrangements and 
performance measures to ensure they are aligned with our strategy. 
In conclusion, I hope you find our report this year informative and that 
we can rely on your vote in favour of the remuneration policy and our 
annual report on remuneration.

Directors’ 
remuneration policy
Introduction
The remuneration policy described in this part of the report is intended to apply to the Company, subject to a binding shareholder vote, following the date 
of the Company’s 2017 AGM which is scheduled to be held on 6 July 2017.
Shareholders will also be asked to approve a revised long-term incentive plan (LTIP). This will replace the current Performance and Co-investment Plan 
(PCP), which will expire in July 2017.
The Directors’ remuneration policy will be displayed on the Company’s website at www.pennon-group.co.uk/about-us/governance-and-remuneration, 
immediately after the 2017 AGM and will be available upon request from the Group Company Secretary.

Changes to the remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the remuneration policy following the end of a three year period, as well as the expiry 
of our long-term incentive plan (the existing PCP will expire in July 2017). Following this review, which included a consultation process with our largest 
shareholders, the key changes to the policy include:
 • Re-shaping our performance measurement framework to align with the strategic priorities of the Group
 • A proposed increase to our LTIP opportunity to align it better with the market, aiding retention and recruitment – the first increase to incentive quantum 
we have made for 10 years
 • Formalising our existing two year holding period
 • Significant increase in our shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.

Description of framework  
used to assess performance
Base salary
Set at a competitive level 
to attract and retain high 
calibre candidates to meet 
the Company’s strategic 
objectives in an increasingly 
complex business 
environment.
Base salary reflects the 
scope and responsibility of 
the role as well as the skills 
and experience of 
the individual.
Salaries are generally reviewed annually and any 
changes are normally effective from 1 April each 
year. In normal circumstances, salary increases 
will not be materially different to general 
employee pay increases.
However, the Committee reserves the right to 
make increases above those made to general 
employees, for example in circumstances 
including (but not limited to) an increase in the 
scope of the role.
When reviewing salaries the 
Committee has regard to the 
following factors:
 • Salary increases generally 
for all employees in the 
Company and the Group
 • Market rates
 • Performance of individual 
and the Company
 • Other factors it 
considers relevant.
There is no overall maximum.
None, although individual and Company 
performance are factors considered when 
reviewing salaries.
Benefits
Benefits provided are 
consistent with the market 
and level of seniority to 
aid retention of key skills 
to assist in meeting 
strategic objectives.
Benefits currently include the provision of 
a company vehicle, fuel, health insurance and life 
assurance. Other benefits may be provided if the 
Committee considers it appropriate.
In the event that an Executive Director is 
required to relocate, relocation benefits 
may be provided.
The cost of insurance 
benefits may vary from 
year to year depending on 
the individual’s circumstances.
There is no overall maximum 
benefit value but the Committee 
aims to ensure that the total value 
of benefits remain proportionate.
None.
Annual bonus
Incentivises the achievement 
of key performance 
objectives aligned to the 
strategy of the Company.
Annual bonuses are calculated following 
finalisation of the financial results for the year to 
which they relate and are usually paid three 
months after the end of the financial year.
A portion of any bonus is deferred into shares in 
the Company which are normally released after 
three years. Normally 50% is deferred.
Any dividends on the shares during this period 
are paid to the Directors.
Malus and clawback provisions apply which 
permit net cash bonuses and/or deferred bonus 
shares to be forfeited, repaid or made subject to 
further conditions where the Committee 
considers it appropriate in the event of any 
significant adverse circumstances, including (but 
not limited to) a material failure of risk 
management, serious reputational damage, a 
financial misstatement or misconduct. Clawback 
may be applied for the period of three years 
following determination of the cash bonus.
The maximum bonus potential 
for each Director is 100% of 
base salary.
Performance targets relate to corporate and 
personal objectives which are reviewed each year. 
For 2017/18, in relation to the financial and 
operational measures of the annual bonus 
framework there will be an 80% overall weighting 
of which 50% will be profit before tax, 10% return 
on regulated equity and 20% operational 
measures. All of these measures will be subject to 
defined quantitative targets.
The measures, weighting and threshold levels 
may be adjusted for future years.
Following the financial year end the Committee, 
with advice from the Chairman of the Board and 
following consideration of the outturn against target 
by the chairman of the Audit Committee, assesses 
to what extent the targets are met and determines 
bonus levels accordingly. In doing so the Committee 
takes into account overall Company performance 
and in exceptional circumstances may exercise its 
discretion and adjust the bonus to reflect any 
specific factors.

Long-term incentive plan (L TIP)
Provides alignment to 
the achievement of the 
Company’s strategic 
objectives and the delivery 
of sustainable long-term 
value to shareholders.
Annual grant of conditional shares (or 
equivalent). Share awards vest subject to the 
achievement of specific performance conditions 
measured over a performance period of no less 
than three years.
Dividend equivalents (including dividend 
reinvestment) may be paid on vested awards.
An ‘underpin’ applies which allows the 
Committee to reduce or withhold vesting 
if the Committee is not satisfied with the 
underlying operational and economic 
performance of the Company.
For grants made in 2015 and 2016 onwards 
under the PCP, as well as all grants made from 
2017 under the LTIP, malus and clawback 
provisions apply which permit shares to be 
forfeited, repaid or made subject to further 
conditions where the Committee considers 
it appropriate in certain circumstances. 
The circumstances in which malus may 
be applied include (but are not limited to) 
material misstatement, serious reputational 
damage, or the participant’s misconduct. 
The circumstances in which clawback may 
be applied are material misstatement or 
serious misconduct. 
In addition a two year holding period will apply in 
respect of any shares which vest at the end of 
the three year performance period. 
Malus may be applied during the three year 
performance period and clawback may be 
applied up until the end of the holding period.
The maximum annual award is 
150% of base salary. 
The current performance measures for the 
LTIP are based on a combination of growth in 
earnings per share (EPS), sustainable dividend 
growth and dividend cover, and return on capital. 
For 2017/18 awards, performance measures will be 
weighted as follows:
 • 40% based on EPS growth
 • 40% based on a combination of dividend 
growth and a dividend cover metric
 • 20% based on return on capital employed.
The ‘underpin’ evaluation includes consideration 
of safety, environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors as well as financial performance.
No more than 25% of maximum vests for 
minimum performance.
The Committee will keep the performance 
measures and weightings under review and may 
change the performance condition for future 
awards if this were considered to be aligned with 
the Company’s interests and strategic objectives, 
as well as the impact of regulatory changes.
However, the Committee would consult with major 
shareholders in advance of any proposed material 
change in performance measures.
Commitments made under the 2014 policy
Performance conditions set under the previous 
remuneration policy (approved at the 2014 AGM) 
will continue to apply to awards granted in 2014, 
2015 and 2016. These awards are due to vest in 
2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Previous 
performance conditions were based on total 
shareholder return (TSR) against the performance 
of a water/waste peer group index and 
constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding 
investment trusts). 
For awards granted under the 2014 remuneration 
policy, no more than 30% of the maximum vests 
for minimum performance.

Notes to the policy table
Operation of executive share plans
The long-term incentive plan will be operated in accordance with the 
rules of the plan as approved by shareholders. The deferred bonus 
awards will be governed by the rules adopted by the Board from time 
to time. Awards under any of the Company’s share plans referred to in 
this report may: 
 • Be granted as conditional share awards, nil-cost options or in 
such other form that the Committee determines has the same 
economic effect
 • Have any performance conditions applicable to them amended or 
substituted by the Committee if an event occurs which causes the 
Committee to determine an amended or substituted performance 
condition would be more appropriate and not materially less 
difficult to satisfy
 • Incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional 
shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been paid 
on the shares under an award that vest up to the time of vesting 
(or where the award is subject to a holding period, release). 
This amount may be calculated assuming that the dividends have 
been reinvested in the Company’s shares on a cumulative basis
 • Be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion.
Pre-existing commitments
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments 
and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretion 
available in connection with such payments) outside the policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the 2014 
AGM (the date the Company’s first shareholder-approved directors’ 
remuneration policy came into effect); (ii) before the policy set out 
above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were 
consistent with the shareholder-approved directors’ remuneration policy 
in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ 
includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, 
in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ 
at the time the award is granted. 
The Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) which, under the 2014 
remuneration policy, operated in conjunction with the deferred 
element of the annual bonus, has been removed. No ESOS options 
have been offered to Executive Directors since 2013.
Early vesting events
On a change of control or voluntary wind up of the Company, LTIP 
awards may vest to the extent determined by the Committee having 
regard to the performance of the Company and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed since grant. 
Deferred bonus awards may vest in full. Alternatively, participants may 
have the opportunity, or be required, to exchange their awards for 
equivalent awards in another company, although the Committee may 
decide in these circumstances to amend the performance conditions. 
The Committee also has the discretion to treat any variation of the 
Company’s share capital or any demerger, special dividend or other 
transaction that may affect the current or future value of awards as 
an early vesting event on the same basis as a change of control.
Amendments to the remuneration policy
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy (for 
example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Performance measures and targets
The performance conditions for the annual bonus plan are selected by 
the Committee each year to reflect key performance indicators for the 
Company and key metrics used by the Board to oversee the operation 
of the businesses. 
In respect of the LTIP, performance conditions for 2017/18 awards will 
be EPS growth, a sustainable dividend metric (comprising dividend 
growth and dividend cover) and return on capital employed (ROCE). 
The Committee chose these measures as they are closely aligned with 
Pennon’s strategic focus on the delivery of sustained earnings and 
related cash flows, as well as our sector-leading dividend policy. ROCE 
also measures the long-term capital returns generated by our 
businesses. The performance targets are set in the context of the 
Company’s forecasts and market expectations, and are regarded as 
stretching targets.
The Committee may amend performance measures, weightings and 
targets, in the context of the Company’s strategy, the impact of 
changes to the regulatory framework, accounting standards and any 
other relevant factors.
The measurement of performance against performance targets is at 
the Committee’s discretion, which may include appropriate 
adjustments to financial or non-financial elements and/or 
consideration of overall performance in the round. 
Performance conditions may also be replaced or varied if an event 
occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee to 
determine that the performance conditions have ceased to be 
appropriate. If the performance conditions are varied or replaced, the 
amended conditions must, in the opinion of the Committee, be fair, 
reasonable and materially no less difficult than the original condition 
when set.
The Committee would consult with major shareholders in advance of 
any proposed material change in performance measures.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
When setting remuneration for Executive Directors the Committee 
considers relevant information about pay and conditions in the Group. 
Senior executives and Executive Directors generally receive a higher 
proportion of their total pay in the form of variable remuneration and 
share awards. All administrative employees of the Group are entitled to 
base salary and pension provision including life assurance. In addition 
all administrative staff in Pennon Group and South West Water and all 
senior and middle management staff in the operations functions in 
Viridor are entitled to participate in annual bonus arrangements, the 
levels of which are based on the seniority and level of responsibility. 
Long-term incentive share awards are only available to senior 
executives and Executive Directors, and certain benefits are generally 
available only to more senior employees at management level 
and above.

Fees
Set at a market level to attract Non-Executive Directors 
who have appropriate experience and skills to assist in 
determining the Group’s strategy.
Fees are set by the Board with the Chairman’s fees 
being set by the Committee. The relevant Directors 
are not present at the meetings when their fees are 
being determined.
Non-Executive Directors normally receive a basic fee 
and an additional fee for any specific Board 
responsibility such as membership or chairmanship of 
a Committee or occupying the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
In reviewing the fees the Board, or Committee as 
appropriate, consider the level of fees payable to 
Non-Executive Directors in other companies of similar 
scale and complexity.
Total fees paid to Non-executive Directors will remain 
within the limits stated in the Articles of Association.
Benefits
The benefits provided for the Chairman are consistent 
with the market and level of seniority.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-
executive duties for the Company may be reimbursed 
or paid for directly by the Company (including any tax 
due on the expenses).
The Chairman’s benefits include the provision of a 
driver and vehicle, when appropriate for the efficient 
carrying out of his duties.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
When considering the appointment of Executive Directors the 
Committee seeks to balance the need to offer remuneration to attract 
candidates of sufficient calibre to deliver the Company’s strategy 
whilst remaining mindful of the need to pay no more than is necessary.
The Committee will appoint new Executive Directors with a package 
that is in line with the remuneration policy that has been agreed by 
shareholders and is in place at the time. Base salary may be set at a 
higher or lower level than the previous incumbent.
Other elements of remuneration would be in line with the Company’s 
policy set out in the in the future policy. 
The maximum variable pay opportunity on recruitment (excluding 
‘buyouts’) would be in line with the future policy table, being a 
maximum annual bonus award of 100% of salary and maximum award 
under the LTIP of 150% of salary. 
The Committee may determine for the first year of appointment that 
any annual bonus will be subject to different weightings or objectives.
To facilitate recruitment it may be necessary to recompense a new 
Executive Director for the expected value of incentive rewards 
foregone with their previous employer (‘buyout’ awards). The 
Committee may make buyout awards in accordance with LR9.4.2 of 
the Listing Rules. The Committee will ensure that any such award 
would at a maximum match the value of the awards granted by the 
previous employer and be made only where a Director is able to 
demonstrate that a loss has been incurred from leaving his or her 
previous employment. Any buyout would take into account the terms 
of the arrangement forfeited, including in particular any performance 
conditions and the time over which they vest. The award would have 
time horizons which are in line with or greater than the awards 
forfeited.
For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than 
salary (for example a Non-executive Director taking on an executive 
function on a short-term basis).
Where an employee is promoted to the position of Executive Director 
(including if an Executive Director is appointed following an 
acquisition or merger), pre-existing awards and contractual 
commitments would be honoured in accordance with their 
established terms.
Non-executive Directors fees would be in line with the policy set out in 
the future policy table on page 83.

Copies of Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
85 Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017
Policy on termination of service agreements 
and payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service agreements 
normally continue until the Director’s agreed retirement date or such 
other date as the parties agree. Otherwise they are terminable on one 
year’s notice.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation on 
termination within Executive Directors’ service agreements. Taking 
into account the circumstances of any termination, the Committee 
may determine that a payment in lieu of notice should be made. Any 
such payments would be restricted to salary and benefits. In these 
circumstances consideration would be given to phasing of payments 
and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate losses.
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in 
connection with a director’s cessation of office or employment where 
the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or 
by way of compromise or settlement of any claim arising in connection 
with the cessation of a director’s office or employment. Any such 
payments may include but are not limited to paying any fees for 
outplacement assistance and/or the director’s legal and/or 
professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office or 
employment.
The Company may meet ancillary costs, such as outplacement 
consultancy and/or reasonable legal costs if the Company terminates 
the Executive Director’s service contract.
Any compensation payable will be determined by reference to the 
terms of the service contract between the Company and the 
employee, as well as the rules of the various incentive plans as set out 
in the table below.
Annual bonus Normally no bonus is payable unless an Executive Director is employed on the date of payment.
In certain good leaver circumstances (death, disability, redundancy, retirement and any other circumstance at the 
Committee’s discretion) a bonus may be payable. Any such bonus would be based on performance and pro-rated 
to reflect the period of service with performance normally assessed at the same time as other employees. The 
Committee retains discretion to adjust the timing and pro-rating of any award to take account of any prevailing 
exceptional circumstances which they consider would be fair to the Company and to the employee. Share 
deferral would not normally apply.
Deferred shares Unvested awards would normally lapse upon cessation. In certain good leaver circumstances, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, the restricted period is not automatically terminated on cessation of 
employment; rather, the restricted period continues to apply as if the leaver was still in employment. However, 
awards may be released to participants on cessation of employment at the discretion of the Committee.
Good leaver circumstances are death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the 
individual’s employing business or company out of the Group and any other circumstance at the Committee’s 
discretion.
Long-term incentive plan Any unvested awards would normally lapse upon cessation of the individual’s employment within the Group. In 
certain good leaver circumstances, awards vest to the extent determined by the Committee taking into account 
the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied, the period of time elapsed between grant 
and the cessation of employment and such other factors as the Committee may deem relevant. Awards would 
normally vest on the original normal vesting date and be released at the end of the two-year holding period 
(unless the Committee determines awards should be subject to earlier vesting and release dates).
If a participant dies, an award will, unless the Committee determines otherwise, vest and be released at the time 
of the participant’s death, taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied 
and the period of time elapsed since grant.
Good leaver circumstances are death, ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, where the participant’s 
employer is no longer a member of the Group, where the participant is employed in an undertaking which is 
transferred out of the Group, or for any other reason that the Committee determines. 
All awards would lapse if a participant was summarily dismissed.
All-employee awards Leavers will be treated in accordance with the HMRC approved rules.
Other awards Where a buyout award is made on recruitment, leaver provisions would be determined at the time of award.

Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Company
In setting executive remuneration the Committee takes account of 
employment market conditions and the pay and benefits differentials 
across the Group. The Committee considers annual summary reports 
of employee remuneration and the terms and conditions of 
employment within each operating company and has regard to these 
in setting salary and other benefits for the Executive Directors and 
senior management. The reports of employee remuneration do not 
include comparison metrics.
The Committee does not consult with employees when drawing 
up the Directors’ remuneration policy but does take account of 
the Group-wide policy as described above. 
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has taken into account general good governance, 
best practice and shareholder views when formulating the 
remuneration policy. As part of our recent remuneration review, we 
carried out an extensive consultation process and consulted our Top 
30 shareholders, comprising 63% of the shareholder base. As a result 
of this process, a number of changes were made to our proposals, 
including the use of a ROCE metric under our new LTIP and a 
significant increase in our shareholding guideline, from 100% to 200%, 
for both the CEO and the CFO.
87 Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017
Introduction 
This section sets out how the Company has applied its remuneration policy in the 2016/17 year, and details how the new policy will be implemented for the 
year 2017/18. In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act, this section will be put to an advisory vote at the Company’s AGM which is scheduled 
to be held on 6 July 2017.
Operation of the remuneration policy for 2017 /18 
A summary of the specific remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors in 2017/18 is described below:
Base salary 2017/18 salaries are: 
 • Chris Loughlin: £517,650 
 • Susan Davy: £395,850
Salaries were increased by 1.5% in line with increases for all employees.
Pension and 
benefits 
No changes. Salary supplement cash allowance of 30% for Chris Loughlin and 25% for Susan Davy, from which is deducted the employer’s contribution 
to the defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes for the Directors. 
Annual bonus No change to maximum opportunity of 100% of salary. No change to operation of deferral, with 50% of the bonus to be deferred into shares for three years. 
For 2017/18, the annual bonus will be based on the following performance measures:
60% based on Group financial metrics (50% PBT, 10% RoRE).
20% based on operational metrics, weighted equally between Waste and Water. These measures will be quantitative and measurable, and are key to 
meeting the needs of our customers, our regulator, and wider stakeholders.
Water metrics Waste metrics
 • Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM)
 • Bathing quality
 • Leakage
 • Waste water pollution incidents
 • Duration of interruptions to supply
 • Waste water and waste asset reliability.
 • ERF availability
 • Delivery against recycling action plan
 • Growth in customer base.
20% based on personal strategic measures. These will be relevant to the individual, and will include health and safety, environmental performance, 
development and delivery of commercial priorities for the Group, PR19, and leveraging of synergies. 
For bonuses from 2014/15 both malus and clawback apply as described in the remuneration policy. 
Long-term  
incentive plan
Maximum award of 150% of base salary for both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
For 2017/18, performance measures will be EPS growth, a sustainable dividend measure and ROCE, with targets set as follows: 
EPS growth – 40% weighting
EPS growth pa Vesting
Threshold
6% 25%
Maximum
10% 100%
Straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum.
Sustainable dividend measure (dividend growth and dividend cover) – 40% weighting
The performance measure comprises two performance targets, both of which need to be achieved. There is a ‘gateway’ dividend growth target of 
RPI+4% per annum.
There is then an EBITDA dividend cover target which operates as follows:
EBITDA dividend cover Vesting
Threshold
2.6 25%
Maximum
3.6 100%
Straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum.
As an additional underpin the board must also be satisfied with the level of EPS dividend cover. EBITDA dividend cover will be based on adjusted 
EBITDA calculated as (underlying EBITDA + share of JV dividends & interest receivable + IFRIC12 interest receivable).
For the purpose of the calculation, dividend cover would be based on the policy of 4% pa above RPI.

Performance and Co-investment Plan outturn for 2016/17 
The PCP awards made on 14 July 2014, which are due to vest on 14 July 2017, are the awards included in the single figure table. The extent to 
which the awards will vest is subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions that were in place at the time the awards were made:
 • 50% of the award vests subject to the Company’s TSR performance measured against an index made up of the following six listed 
comparator  companies:
 – National Grid Plc
 – Séché Environnement
 – Severn Trent 
 – Shanks Group
 – Suez Environnement
 – United Utilities 
 • The remaining 50% of the award vests subject to the Company’s ranked TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts). 
Currently it is estimated that the outturn will result in a 43.7% vesting as set out in the table below. 
The calculation of TSR performance from the start of the performance period on 1 April 2014 to 10 May 2017 was undertaken by Deloitte LLP for 
the Committee.

At or above 
75th percentile 52.0% 17.3%
TOTAL 43.7%
Straight-line vesting between points. 
For below threshold performance, 0% vests. 
*  As the calculation requires averaging TSR performance over the first three months of the performance period and comparing it to the average over the three months following the 
end of the performance period (1 April 2017 to 30 June 2017) the achievement and the outturn is an estimate at the date of calculation (11 May 2017)
Vesting of an award is also subject to the ‘underpin’ described on page 80 which the Committee has determined to the date of this report would 
be satisfied.

(iii) Continued to receive pension benefits until cessation of employment on 31 December 2016.
Chris Loughlin is not a member of any of the Pennon Group’s pension schemes and receives a sum in lieu of pension entitlement equivalent to 30% 
of salary. 
Susan Davy receives an overall pension benefit from the Company equivalent to 25% of her salary which, in 2016/17 comprised an employer’s contribution 
of £13,554 and a cash sum of £83,946. She is a member of Pennon Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements and is entitled to normal retirement 
pension payable from age 65 of broadly 1/80th of pensionable remuneration for each year of pensionable service completed. 
The employer’s contribution to the pension for Susan Davy is deducted from the overall pension allowance. 
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 5% p.a. or RPI if lower for service accrued in the period up to 30 June 2014 and at a rate of 2.5% 
pa or CPI if lower for service accrued in the period after this date. If a Director dies within five years of retiring, a lump sum equal to the balance of five years’ 
pension payments is paid plus a spouse’s pension of one half of the member’s pension. Pensions may also be payable to dependants and children. 
Ian McAulay was a member of Pennon Group’s defined contribution arrangement and received an overall pension benefit from the Company equivalent to 
20% of his salary until the cessation of his employment on 31 December 2016. 
No additional benefits will become receivable by a Director in the event that the Director retires early.

Payments in connection with leaving arrangements – Ian McAulay (audited information)
Ian McAulay, stepped down from the Board on 31 August 2016. He left the employment of Viridor Waste Management Limited, on 31 December 2016, 
at which point salary and benefits ceased to be paid. Mr McAulay did not receive an annual bonus award in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017.
The treatment of Ian McAulay’s share awards was in line with the Company’s remuneration policy (approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM):
 • Awards made to Mr McAulay in 2014, 2015 and 2016 under the Performance and Co-investment Plan were forfeited in accordance with the Rules 
of the Plan
 • Deferred shares allocated to Mr McAulay in 2014, 2015 and 2016 pursuant to the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, which related to previous performance 
periods, were released to him following cessation of his employment on 31 December 2016 at an aggregate value of £269,784. The 3,651 ESOS options 
granted in 2014 in association with Mr McAulay’s 2014 deferred bonus share award lapsed upon his stepping down from the Board
 • Deferred shares allocated to Mr McAulay as a buyout award upon his appointment as Chief Executive, Viridor, were released to him on 30 September 2016 
(being the end of the three-year restricted period) together with additional shares in lieu of shares that could have been acquired with the amount of each 
cash dividend on the released shares during the restricted period. The total value was £149,579.
Outside appointments 
Executive Directors may accept one board appointment in another company. Board approval must be sought before accepting an appointment. Fees may 
be retained by the Director. Currently, no Executive Directors hold outside company appointments other than with industry bodies or governmental or

was 1.5%.
The Chairman’s benefits comprise provision of a driver and vehicle, when appropriate for the efficient carrying out of his duties. He is entitled to expenses

Directors’ shareholding and interest in shares 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the interests of Executive Directors and senior management should be closely aligned with the interests of 
shareholders. 
To support this, the Committee operates shareholding guidelines. For 2016/17, this guideline was 100% of salary for Executive Directors. From 2017/18 the 
Committee has significantly increased these guidelines to 200% of salary for both the CEO and CFO.

The Remuneration Committee and its advisers
Martin Angle (Committee chairman), Neil Cooper and Gill Rider were members of the Committee throughout the year and at any time when the Committee 
considered any matter relating to Directors’ remuneration during the year.
During the year the Committee received advice or services which materially assisted the Committee in the consideration of remuneration matters from Sir 
John Parker (Chairman of the Board), Helen Barrett-Hague (Group General Counsel and Company Secretary), Adele Barker (interim Group director of 
Human Resources), and from Deloitte LLP. Deloitte LLP was appointed directly by the Committee. 
Deloitte LLP assisted in the remuneration policy review for Executive Directors and in calculating the Company’s total shareholder return compared with 
two comparator groups for the Company’s long-term incentive plan, as well as providing advice on remuneration trends and market practice. Deloitte LLP’s 
fees in respect of advice which materially assisted the Committee during 2016/17 were £88,330 (arrived at from an hourly rate basis of charging). During 
the year, Deloitte LLP also provided tax, corporate finance and risk advisory services to the Group. Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee 
is satisfied that the advice it has received from Deloitte LLP has been objective and independent.

99 Directors’ report – 
other statutory disclosures
Introduction 
This Directors’ report is prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 and regulations made thereunder. 
It comprises pages 54 to 73 and 100 to 103 as well as the following 
matters which the Board considers are of strategic importance and, 
as permitted by legislation, has chosen to include in the strategic 
report rather than the Directors’ report: 
 • risk management systems (page 46 of the strategic report) 
 • likely future developments of the Company (pages 24 and 25 
of the strategic report) 
 • important post-balance sheet events (page 25 of the 
strategic report) 
 • certain employee matters (page 18 and 19 of the strategic report), 
as well as the disclosures below. 
In addition, there are a number of disclosures which are included in 
the Directors’ report by reference, including:
 • financial risk management (note 3 of the notes to the 
financial statements) 
 • financial instruments (page 42 of the strategic report and 
notes 2(o) and 18 of the notes to the financial statements). 
Board of Directors 
The Directors in office as at the date of this report (all of whom 
served during the year) are named on pages 56 and 57. In addition, 
Ian McAulay, who was Chief Executive, Viridor, and an Executive 
Director of Pennon Group plc, served during the year until his 
resignation from the Board on 31 August 2016. 
Financial results and dividend 
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 24.87 pence per ordinary 
share to be paid on 1 September 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 7 July 2017, making a total dividend for the year of 35.96 pence, 
the cost of which will be £149.5 million, resulting in a transfer to 
reserves of £14.8 million. The strategic report on pages 38 to 45 
analyses the Group’s financial results in more detail and sets out 
other financial information. 
Directors’ insurance and indemnities 
The Directors have the benefit of the indemnity provisions contained 
in the Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’), and the Company 
has maintained throughout the year Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance for the benefit of the Company, the Directors and its officers. 
The Company has entered into qualifying third party indemnity 
arrangements for the benefit of all its Directors in a form and scope 
which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and which were in force throughout the year and remain in force. 
Employment policies and employee involvement 
The Group has a culture of continuous improvement through 
investment in people at all levels within the Group. The Group is 
committed to pursuing equality and diversity in all its employment 
activities including recruitment, training, career development and 
promotion and ensuring there is no bias or discrimination in the 
treatment of people. In particular, applications for employment are 
welcomed from persons with disabilities, and special arrangements 
and adjustments as necessary are made to ensure that applicants 
are treated fairly when attending for interview or for pre-employment 
aptitude tests. Wherever possible the opportunity is taken to retrain 
people who become disabled during their employment in order to 
maintain their employment within the Group. Information regarding 
the Group’s workplace policies is provided on page 18. 
The Board has a diversity policy and encourages gender diversity in 
particular. Further details of the Board’s diversity policy are set out in 
the report of the Nomination Committee on page 71, and information 
regarding the diversity of the workforce is provided on page 19. 
Employees are consulted regularly about changes which may affect 
them either through their trade union-appointed representatives, 
through consultation groups or by means of the elected staff council 
which operates in South West Water for staff employees. 
These forums, together with regular meetings with particular groups 
of employees, are used to ensure that employees are kept up to date 
with the business performance of their employer and the financial and 
economic factors affecting the performance of the Group. The Group 
also cascades information monthly to all employees to provide them 
with important and up to date information about key events and to 
obtain feedback from them. Further information about employment 
matters relating to the Group is set out on pages 18 and 19 of the 
strategic report. 
The Group encourages share ownership among its employees by 
operating an HM Revenue & Customs approved Sharesave scheme 
and Share Incentive Plan. Following shareholder approval at the 2014 
AGM, these were amended to provide for the increased savings limits 
approved by government. At 31 March 2017 around 41% of the Group’s 
employees were participating in these plans. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
Change in emissions
Gross greenhouse gas emissions for the Group this year increased by 
14%, primarily as a result of Viridor’s newly commissioned energy 
recovery facilities reaching their full operating capacity. 
100
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Viridor’s energy recovery facilities burn waste that would otherwise 
have gone to landfill. This has the double benefit of extracting more of 
the energy embedded in the waste and substituting energy generated 
from other, predominantly fossil fuel, sources. There has been a 4% 
reduction year-on-year in emissions from the Group’s landfill sites and 
a similar percentage increase in renewable energy generation across 
the Group. 
All Group companies benefitted from a reduction in the UK’s average 
electricity grid emissions conversion factor which fell sharply by 11% 
between 2015/16 and 2016/17. This resulted in an overall reduction in 
the Group’s Scope 2 emissions over the year and saw both South West 
Water and Bournemouth Water record lower overall emissions than in 
the previous year.
South West Water recorded an increase in emissions from energy 
usage associated with the provision of drinking water services driven 
by an unusually dry year. The company’s water resources models 
signalled the need to protect water resources that would normally be 
topped-up naturally from rainfall. As a result additional raw water was 
pumped into reservoirs over the winter period to ensure sufficient 
water supplies would be available for the subsequent summer period. 
A corresponding reduction in emissions from energy usage was seen 
in the waste water side of the business as the lack of rainfall meant 
less surface water run-off ended up in the sewer system and needed 
to be pumped. 
For the second year in succession the Group’s gross Scope 1 and 2 
emissions are growing at a faster rate than our revenue. 
This is reflected in the emissions intensity measure we use of 
tCO
2 e/£100,000 revenue. This indicator has increased this 
year from 112tCO2 e/£100,000 to 127tCO2 e/£100,000. 
Methodology and approach
We have adopted the ‘equity share’ approach for Viridor companies. 
This means that emissions from joint venture operations can be 
accurately attributed to the company in proportion to the percentage 
of Viridor’s holding. The remaining companies in the Group continue 
to use the ‘financial control’ approach. This is the conventional method 
for parent companies and subsidiaries within a group that have the 
ability to direct financial and operating policies and retain the majority 
of the organisation’s risk and rewards.
Quantification and reporting
We have followed the Government’s guidelines for mandatory 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting published by DEFRA in June 
2013 (and updated in October 2013). In calculating our emissions we 
have used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and the web based conversion 
factors provided by DEFRA.
‘Market’ and ‘Location’ based methodology
In 2015 the Greenhouse Gas Protocol introduced the ‘market-based’ 
and ‘location-based’ methodologies for reporting Scope 2 emissions 
from imported energy. This change of reporting guidance allows 
organisations that contractually purchase electricity from generators 
where the supply is backed by appropriate certificates or other 
instruments to use an emission factor that is specific to the electricity 
being purchased. No such qualifying supply was procured by Pennon 
Group companies for 2016/17 and therefore we have decided to 
continue to report using only the location-based methodology this 
year, we intend to review this approach again next year. 
Organisational boundary
The emissions listed here cover the Pennon Group of companies, each 
of which uses the financial control approach, except where Viridor use 
an equity share approach where a joint venture exists. 
Operational Scopes
We have measured our Scope 1, 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions 
where information is available.
Intensity measurement
We have chosen an intensity measure of Scope 1 and 2 gross 
emissions in tCO
2 e per £100,000 revenue 
External assurance statement
Our greenhouse gas emissions data has been independently verified 
by Strategic Management Consultants. Certain aspects that relate 
to the disclosures of South West Water and Bournemouth Water’s 
emissions have been subject to an independent audit of regulatory 
data conducted by CH2M. The assumptions methods and procedures 
that are followed in the development of the reported data have been 
tested and the data audited for accuracy and consistency.
Carbon offsets
We rely on self-generated renewable energy to reduce our overall 
Scope 2 emissions and supplement this with power purchase 
contracts with third parties for renewable energy through private wire 
where it is available near our sites.
Renewable energy export
Pennon Group self-generates more electricity than it uses and much 
of its renewable electricity generation is exported to the grid. We 
account for this exported renewable electricity in our net emissions 
measure where we subtract ‘emissions credits’ up to the limit of our 
gross volume of Scope 2 emissions.

company-owned and controlled stationary equipment and transportation, emissions from 
site based processes and site-based fugitive emissions.
Scope 2 (indirect emissions) Emissions released into the atmosphere associated with 
our consumption of purchased electricity, heat, steam and cooling. These are indirect 
emissions that are a consequence of our activities but which occur at sources we do not 
own or control.
Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) Emissions that are a consequence of our actions, 
which occur at sources which we do not own or control and which are not classed as 
Scope 2 emissions.

Governance Human rights and anti-slavery 
The Group is fully supportive of the principles set out in the UN 
Declaration of Human Rights, and the Group Ethics Policy outlines

protection and safety of workforces wherever they may be throughout 
the Group. 
The Group’s commitment to ensuring the human rights of its 
employees are not infringed extends to those of its suppliers. Supplier 
codes of conduct are in place to ensure that people are treated fairly 
and with respect and dignity.
In addition, we have in place policies and procedures to assess, 
monitor and reduce the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking 
occurring in our businesses and supply chains. Risk assessments 
of any high risk supply partners have been completed by Viridor, 
South West Water and Bournemouth Water to ensure compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act across the Group and our anti-slavery 
and human trafficking web-based statement for the year is available 
at www.pennon-group.co.uk.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 f)  There are a number of agreements which take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, such as bank loan agreements, eurobond 
documentation, hybrid capital securities documentation, private 
placement debt and employees’ share plans. This may result in 
certain funding agreements being altered or repaid early. The 
impact on employees’ share plans is not considered significant; 
and 
g)  There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Going concern 
Having considered the Group’s funding position and financial 
projections the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resource to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for the year. 
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to: 
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently 
 • make judgements and accounting estimates which are 
reasonable and prudent 
 • state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the Company; and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the International Accounting

Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £12.5 million which represents approximately 5% of Profit before taxation before  
non-underlying items.
 • the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below 
as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy; 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and direction of the efforts 
of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas. 
Risk Risk direction Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Valuation of non-current assets (Viridor)
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 63); 
accounting policies (page 119); and note 17 of the 
consolidated financial statements (page 139)
The net book value of Viridor’s property, plant and 
equipment is £1,121 million (2016: £1,012 million), 
as included in note 17. The Group is required to 
review the carrying value of assets when 
impairment indicators are identified. There is 
risk that assumptions and judgements used by 
management in determining whether there are any 
impairment indicators, or in performing impairment 
reviews when required, could be susceptible to 
management bias. 
During the year, as part of the Group-wide Shared 
Services Review, a decision to rationalise systems 
resulted in the derecognition of system related 
assets and a related charge to the income 
statement of £9.5 million.
There is a risk that judgements used to calculate 
the derecognition charge could include 
management bias.
Our procedures include:
 • We read management’s paper on impairment indicators 
for other non-current assets, and evaluated whether 
indicators have been appropriately considered and 
assessed judgements for evidence of management bias
 • We compared the current year performance of Viridor 
with the forecasts produced in the prior year to 
corroborate management’s assessment in relation to 
indicators of impairment
 • We inspected other external publicly available 
information on sector developments, such as EU led 
recycling targets, to corroborate management’s 
assessment relating to indicators of impairment
 • We obtained management’s analysis of the 
asset derecognition costs and discussed with 
management the methods applied to allocate costs and 
assess enduring values of the assets
 • We tested a sample of supporting information, including 
breakdowns of costs incurred, and documentation 
relating to process design and specification, to evidence 
the key judgements made by management in calculating 
the asset derecognition charge
 • We reperformed management’s calculation of the 
derecognition charge to test for arithmetical accuracy
 • We tested whether the amounts retained in non-current 
assets reflected items that have a continuing use in the 
business by agreeing to supporting documentation, on a 
sample basis
 • We agreed whether disclosures made, both in the 
respect of the consideration of impairment and of the 
derecognition charge, are in accordance with IFRS.
We concluded that the 
assessment performed by 
management to identify any 
impairment indicators is 
appropriate. We concur with 
management’s conclusion that 
no indicators exist at the balance 
sheet date.
We concluded that, based on 
the evidence obtained we concur 
with the approach adopted and 
the charge recorded in the 
income statement.
Valuation of landfill related provisions 
(Viridor)
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 63); 
accounting policies (page 119); and note 32 of the 
consolidated financial statements (page 157)
Landfill related provisions of £183.8 million (2016: 
£182.1 million) are disclosed in note 32 and consist 
of aftercare, restoration and remediation provisions. 
Calculation of the aftercare provision involves 
significant judgement in respect of the expected 
period of aftercare, the level of costs to be incurred 
and the discount rate to be used.
Key areas of estimation for the restoration provision 
include the expected restoration costs, the void 
space to be filled and timing of site closure.
Judgement over the remedial action required to 
comply with current environmental legislation is a 
key estimate for the remediation provision. 
There is a risk that provisions could be misstated 
due to the complexity of factors to be assessed 
and if assumptions applied by management are 
inappropriate, including the impact of any 
management bias.
Our procedures include:
 • We evaluated the forecast costs in the models, agreeing 
these to supporting evidence such as budgets and 
current performance 
 • We assessed the material estimates made for evidence  
of management bias, including agreeing anticipated  
cost savings to detailed plans and current performance 
 • We benchmarked the discount and inflation rates 
applied, using our internal valuation experts to assist in 
our review of whether management’s assumptions are 
within an acceptable range based on comparative 
market data
 • We performed sensitivity analysis on these 
key assumptions 
 • We tested the aftercare, restoration and remediation 
provision models, and verified that the models are 
arithmetically accurate
 • We compared the key assumptions used in the current 
models to those used in the prior year, and obtained 
evidence to corroborate that changes were appropriate. 
This included obtaining evidence to support the impact 
of future planned technological changes
 • We tested the appropriateness of journal entries 
impacting landfill related provisions, particularly those 
raised close to the balance sheet date.
We concluded that the 
assumptions supporting the 
landfill related provisions reflect 
management’s best estimates, 
informed by latest external and 
internal data, and consider that 
the provisions are within an 
acceptable range.

Risk Risk direction Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition across the  
Group’s operations
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 63); 
accounting policies (page 119); and note 2 of the 
consolidated financial statements (page 120)
The Group’s material revenue streams relate to the 
provision of water and sewerage services by South 
West Water and revenue generated from 
the renewable energy, recycling and 
waste management services provided by Viridor. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud 
relating to revenue recognition. For the Group, 
given targets associated to financial performance 
and pressures to meet market expectations, there 
is an incentive to overstate revenue. This risk over 
revenue recognition specifically arises in the 
following judgemental areas, where there is 
opportunity to overstate revenue:
South West Water 
 • Income from measured water services requires 
an estimation of the amount of unbilled charges 
at the year end. This is calculated using a 
combination of system generated information, 
based on previous customer volume usage, 
together with management judgements as to 
the likely impact on usage of factors such as 
recent weather patterns. The accrued 
income balance at 31 March 2017 is £72.2 million 
(2016: £67.8 million)
 • For unmeasured revenue, the bills for each 
calendar year are raised in advance for the next 
financial year. There is a risk that revenues are 
recorded in the incorrect period, if the advance 
billing element is not properly excluded and 
carried forward in the balance sheet.
Our procedures include:
South West Water 
 • We obtained an understanding of the process for the 
supply of measured services, meter reading and related 
billing in order to challenge the completeness of 
adjustments to reflect the accrual or deferral of revenue
 • We tested key controls linked to system generated 
information relating to the estimation process for 
measured revenue
 • We compared the accrued income to bills raised post 
year end for a sample of customers, and compared 
management’s history of estimating the accrued income 
balance to bills raised in the subsequent year
 • We performed a walkthrough of the process for 
unmeasured revenue and the annual billing cycle
 • We performed controls testing related to the calculation 
of system generated billing for unmeasured revenue 
 • We obtained details of the billing runs in February and 
March and assessed whether there were any other billing 
runs for unmeasured revenue that should be excluded 
from 2016/17 total revenue
 • We corroborated the key assumptions and estimates 
made by management in recognising revenue, by 
obtaining internal and external data on factors that 
influence demand from customers 
 • We tested whether revenue was recognised at the 
correct time in accordance with IFRS 
 • We performed analytical procedures by comparing 
revenue balances for the year against expectation and 
obtaining support for significant variances
 • We tested a sample of transactions to underlying bills for 
both types of revenue
 • In performing our journal testing, we paid increased 
attention to entries impacting revenue, focusing on 
non-system postings and those raised in the last two 
weeks of the year.
South West Water 
We concluded that the basis 
of calculation of the measured 
income accrual is appropriate. 
Management assumptions in 
respect of customer demand 
are within an acceptable range. 
Amounts identified as 
advance billing have been 
correctly recorded.
108
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Risk Risk direction Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Viridor
 • Calculations of accrued income on waste 
management contracts and powergen 
revenue to be received involve estimation 
by management 
 • Accounting for revenue from long-term service 
concession arrangements under IFRIC12 
requires revenue to be recognised based on 
appropriate assessment of the margin earned 
during the construction period and during the 
operational period. The determination of the 
margin allocated during the different phases 
of each service concession may involve 
management judgement 
 • Recognising revenue in the correct period for 
invoices raised close to the balance sheet date 
may involve management judgement.
Viridor
 • We compared the key assumptions and estimates to 
those made by management in recognising revenue 
in the prior year. We analysed revenue trends and 
corroborated unusual movements. We obtained 
customer confirmations for a sample of revenue
 • For material items within accrued income we 
reperformed the calculation of the income that had been 
earned on waste management contracts and powergen 
revenue to confirm the accuracy of the accrued income 
recorded by management
 • We tested the application of IFRIC12 in respect of 
construction revenue recognised and whether margins 
used to recognise revenue are reasonable based on the 
models used for each contract and comparing the 
margins to those generated in prior years and to latest 
projections for future years
 • We agreed whether the revenue recognition policies 
adopted comply with IFRSs
 • We performed cut off testing of invoices raised prior to 
and after the balance sheet date to ensure revenue has 
been recognised in the correct period
 • In performing our journal testing, we paid increased 
attention to entries impacting revenue, particularly 
those raised close to the balance sheet date.
Viridor
We concluded that revenue has 
been recorded in the correct 
accounting period, accrued 
income has been appropriately 
recognised, and IFRIC 12 
appropriately applied. 
Valuation of the provision for doubtful 
debts (South West Water)
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 63); 
accounting policies (page 119); and note 22 of the 
consolidated financial statements (page 145)
As shown in note 22, there is a provision of 
£102.6 million (2016: £95.6 million) at the year 
end against gross trade debtors of £326.1 million 
(2016: £303.6 million).
The South West Water provision is calculated 
using a combination of system generated 
information on historic debt recovery rates and 
management’s judgement of the future likely 
recovery rates.
During the year management has performed 
a data mining exercise to refresh the detailed 
collection data by category of debt.
There is a risk that the assumptions used by 
management in calculating the bad debt provision 
may be susceptible to management bias and the 
valuation of the provision against trade receivables 
may be misstated.
Our procedures include:
 • We performed a walkthrough of the process for 
calculating the bad debt provision and assessed the 
design effectiveness of key controls. 
 • We tested the operating effectiveness of key controls 
over the integrity of data and the report utilised to 
generate the ageing and categorisation of debt within 
South West Water’s billing system
 • We tested historic data on collection rates and evaluated 
how this data was used in the preparation of the bad 
debt provision
 • We corroborated the assumptions used by management 
in determining the amounts provided against the 
different categories and age of debt, by comparing these 
assumptions to historic collection rates and by 
considering the impact of changes in the methods 
adopted operationally by management to collect debt, 
and in the external environment
 • We utilised collection information over the past three 
years, to determine a range of the likely ultimate 
collection of debts existing at the balance sheet date and 
compared this to the provision recorded by management, 
including assessing assumptions for evidence of 
management bias
 • We tested the appropriateness of journal entries and 
adjustments impacting the doubtful debt provision, 
particularly those raised close to the balance sheet date.
We concluded that the doubtful 
debt provision is within an 
acceptable range and reflects 
recent history of collection of 
outstanding debts.

Financial statements Risk Risk direction Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Completeness of provisions for uncertain 
tax positions and related tax disclosures 
(Group, including SWW & Viridor)
Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 63); 
accounting policies (page 119); and note 27 of the 
consolidated financial statements (page 148)
The Group’s current tax liability of £26.8 million 
(2016: £37.1 million) shown in note 27, includes 
£18.6 million (2016: £37.1 million) in respect of open 
tax computations relating to prior years, where 
liabilities are yet to be agreed with HM Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC).
Pennon has a number of open periods with HMRC 
as a result of on-going enquiries into the 
interpretation of tax legislation regarding 
transactions undertaken by the Group. 
In prior periods, significant management 
judgement has been required in estimating tax 
expected to be paid in respect of these open 
periods. However, during the year, the Group has 
reached resolution with HMRC on a number of 
areas. This has reduced the level of uncertainty 
over the year end tax liability and therefore the risk 
of material misstatement has reduced.
Our procedures include:
 • We inspected the latest correspondence between the 
Group and HMRC
 • We read legal advice or opinions management was 
obtained in the period in relation to uncertain tax 
positions, in order to verify whether the level of provision 
is based on up to date legal advice in response to 
HMRC’s challenges
 • We obtained an updated view from our internal 
tax specialists as to HMRC’s current position on 
open matters
 • We assessed the level of provision maintained for 
uncertain tax positions, in light of the settlement proposal 
agreed with HMRC and consideration of other open 
uncertain tax positions
 • We tested whether the tax accounting and disclosures 
in note 9 and 27 complied with the requirements of 
IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’
 • We read the tax disclosures in the Annual Report and 
Accounts and evaluated the adequacy of these.
We concluded that the 
Group has recorded an 
appropriate provision for 
uncertain tax positions. 
We concluded that the tax 
amounts and disclosures 
in the Annual Report and 
Accounts for the year ended 
31 March 2017 are appropriate.
Independent auditor’s report to 
the members of Pennon Group plc 
continued
110
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a risk of material 
misstatement in relation to valuation of goodwill. In the current year, 
we concluded the likelihood of material misstatement has reduced 
as a further year of experience has provided management with more 
confidence that the business plan will be met, and the impairment 
test is less sensitive to changes in assumptions.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables 
us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group 
and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results 
when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the five reporting 
components of the Group, we performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of three components (‘full scope components’) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. 
These components include Pennon Group plc, Viridor and South West 
Water, and represent the principal business units within the Group.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 
100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items, 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue 
and 96% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s Total assets. 
The remaining two components, individually and in aggregate, 
represent less than 1% of the Group’s profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items. For these components, which include Peninsula 
Insurance and Peninsula Leasing, we performed other procedures, 
including analytical review procedures, testing of consolidation 
journals and intercompany eliminations for each component to 
respond to potential risks of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements.
Changes from the prior year 
There were two changes in scope from the prior year. The first was 
that Bournemouth Water, which was acquired by Pennon Group plc in 
April 2015, has merged with South West Water and therefore balances 
are included within the South West Water component, which was 
designated as full scope for the current year audit. The second change 
was that the scope determined for Peninsula Insurance was changed 
from review scope to other procedures, reflecting the fact that, with 
the growth in Group activities, including profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items, this component is less than 1% of the Group.
Involvement with component teams 
We perform audit procedures for the Group and its components at the 
South West Water and Viridor locations. The audit teams of Pennon 
Group plc and South West Water are led by the same audit partner. 
A separate team audits Viridor and is led by a separate audit partner. 
The Group team interacted regularly with all teams during various 
stages of the audit, including review of key working papers, review 
of work performed to address the risks of material misstatement 
and attendance at key meetings with management. 
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on 
the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £12.5 million (2016: 
£10 million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items. We believe that profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items provides us with an appropriate measure of the 
underlying performance of the Group. We excluded non-underlying 
items on the basis that these are infrequent in occurrence and profit 
before taxation after non-underlying items is not indicative of the 
underlying performance of the Group. We also note that market 
and analyst commentary on the performance of the Group uses the 
same measure. We therefore, considered profit before taxation before 
non-underlying items to be the most relevant performance metric on 
which to base our materiality calculation. 
Starting basis Reported profit before taxation £210.5 million 
(2016: £206.3 million).
Adjustments Non-underlying items – increase basis by 
£39.5 million (2016: £5.0 million).
Materiality Totals £250.0 million (2016: £211.3 million) profit 
before taxation before non-underlying items. 
Materiality of £12.5 million (5% of profit before 
taxation before non-underlying items).
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning 
materiality, namely £9.4 million (2016: £7.5 million). This is based on 
our assessment of the Group’s internal control environment and the 
extent and nature of audit findings identified in the prior period and 
is consistent with the prior year.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and 
risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment 
of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, 
the range of performance materiality allocated to components was 
£4.4 million to £8.4 million (2016: £1.5 million to £7.1 million).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.6 million (2016: 
£0.5 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
111
Financial statements consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 103, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.

ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report is: 
 • materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 • apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
 • otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired in the course of performing the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the annual report and accounts taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model and strategy; 
and whether the annual report appropriately addresses those matters that we 
communicated to the audit committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report or Directors’ Report.
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 • the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review requirements
We are required to review:
 • the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 103, and 
longer-term viability, set out on page 51; and
 • the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review.
We have no exceptions to report.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything 
material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 • the directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
entity, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 • the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 • the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
 • the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Notes to the 
financial statements
1. General information
Pennon Group plc is a company registered in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on page 
115. During 2016/17 Pennon Group’s business was operated through two main subsidiaries. South West Water Limited includes the merged water 
companies of South West Water and Bournemouth Water, providing water and wastewater services in Devon, Cornwall and parts of Dorset and Somerset 
and water only services in parts of Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire. Viridor Limited’s business is recycling, energy recovery and waste management.
2. Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to the years presented.
(a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost accounting basis (except for fair value items, principally acquisitions, transfers of 
assets from customers and certain financial instruments as described in accounting policy notes (b), (w) and (o) respectively) and in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union, and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below, 
together with an explanation where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations 
in the year.
The going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these financial statements as stated by the Directors on page 103.
The new standards or interpretations which were mandatory for the first time in the year beginning 1 April 2016 did not have a material impact on the net 
assets or results of the Group.
It is anticipated that adoption of the following standard could impact the Group’s future results as set out below:
 • IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ no longer distinguishes between an on the balance sheet finance lease and an off the balance sheet operating lease. Instead, for 
virtually all lease contracts, the lessee recognises a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use’ asset. The standard is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and is subject to EU endorsement.
  The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019 will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases. As at the 
reporting date, the group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £143 million, see note 41. The Group is assessing the extent to which 
these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for future payments and how this will affect the group’s profit and classification 
of cash flows. Existing borrowing covenants are not impacted by changes in accounting standards.
Other new standards or interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, including IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ and IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
instruments’ are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s net assets or results. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of Pennon Group plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date 
of disposal. The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of joint ventures and associate undertakings are accounted for on 
an equity basis.
Intra-group trading, loan balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries. The excess of the value transferred to the seller in return for 
control of the acquired business, together with the fair value of any previously held equity interest in that business over the Group’s share of the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets, is recorded as goodwill.

(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable in the ordinary course of business for the provision of goods and services to customers, and is 
recognised to the extent that it can be reliably measured and that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue excludes value added tax, trade discounts and revenue arising from transactions between Group companies. Revenue includes landfill tax.
In respect of ongoing, continuous services to customers, such as the provision of drinking water and wastewater services, revenue is recognised in line with the 
customer using those services. Where applicable, this includes both billed amounts for estimated usage and an estimation of the amount of unbilled usage at 
the period end.
Revenue in respect of construction services on long-term contracts, including the provision of service concession arrangements, is recognised based on the 
fair value of work performed during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of those services.
Where a contract with a customer includes more than one service, such as a long-term service concession arrangement, revenue for each service is recognised 
in proportion to a fair value assessment of the total contract value split across the services provided.
Revenue in respect of goods, such as recyclate, is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.  
For other services, encompassing waste management services, revenue is recognised once the services have been provided to the customer.
Revenue from the sale of electricity from our generating assets is measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms  
or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Payments received in advance of services provided are held within liabilities.
(d) Landfill tax
Landfill tax is recognised in both revenue and operating costs at the point waste is disposed of at a licensed landfill site.
(e) Segmental reporting
Each of the Group’s business segments provides services which are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of the other business 
segments. The Group’s internal organisation and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting are based primarily on business 
segments. The reportable business segments comprise the water business which includes the regulated water and wastewater services undertaken  
by South West Water, and the waste management business of Viridor. Segmental revenue and results include transactions between businesses.  
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
(f) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation from the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of 
net assets acquired, less any subsequent impairment charges.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is 
not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating 
units or group of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill is allocated and 
monitored at the reportable operating segment level. Further details are contained in accounting policy (j).
When a subsidiary undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill.
(g) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are recognised in relation to long-term service concessions contracts to the extent that future amounts to be received are 
not contracted.
Other intangible assets include assets acquired in a business combination and are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial 
recognition, finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with the expense charged to the income 
statement through operating costs.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
i) Infrastructure assets (being water mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and sea outfalls)
Infrastructure assets were included at fair value on transition to IFRS, and subsequent additions are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment charges. Expenditure to increase capacity or enhance infrastructure assets is capitalised where it can be reliably measured, and it is probable 
that incremental future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The cost of day-to-day servicing of infrastructure components is recognised in the income 
statement as it arises.
120
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Infrastructure assets are depreciated evenly over their useful economic lives, and are principally:
Dams and impounding reservoirs 200 years
Water mains 40 – 120 years
Sewers 40 – 120 years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
ii) Landfill sites
Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes acquisition and development expenses. The cost 
of a landfill site is depreciated to its residual value (which is linked to gas production at the site post-closure) over its estimated operational life taking 
account of the usage of void space.
iii) Landfill restoration
Where the obligation to restore a landfill site is an integral part of its future economic benefits, a non-current asset within property, plant and equipment is 
recognised. The asset recognised is depreciated based on the usage of void space.
iv) Other assets (including energy recovery facilities, property, overground plant and equipment)
Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated evenly to their residual value over their estimated economic lives, and are principally:
Land and buildings – freehold buildings 30 – 60 years
Land and buildings – leasehold buildings Over the estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter
Operational properties 40 – 80 years
Energy recovery facilities (including major refurbishments) 25 – 40 years
Fixed plant 20 – 40 years
Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 – 10 years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs which are incremental to the Group. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
construction of a qualifying asset (an asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use) are capitalised as part of the 
asset. Assets transferred from customers are recognised at fair value as set out in accounting policy (v).
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually. 
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the income statement.
(i) Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are included as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at commencement or the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter. The 
corresponding liability is recorded as borrowings. The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits using the actuarial method over the 
period of the lease. Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
(j) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstance 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Value in use represents the present value of projected future cash flows 
expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects an assessment of the market cost of capital 
of the cash generating unit. Impairments are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Where a previously impaired asset or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount is in excess of its carrying amount, previous impairments are reversed to 
the carrying value that would have expected to be recognised had the original impairment not occurred.
(k) Investment in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid. Subsequently investments are reviewed 
for impairment on an individual basis annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
(l) Investment in joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the joint venture at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the investment in the joint venture.
121
Financial statements Notes to the  
financial statements 
continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
The carrying value of the Group’s investment is adjusted for the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses recognised in the income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest are not recognised unless the Group has a legal or 
constructive obligation to fund those losses.
(m) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes raw materials and the cost of 
bringing stocks to their present location and condition. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to sell.
(n) Cash and cash deposits
Cash and cash deposits comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits held at banks. Bank overdrafts are shown within current borrowings.
(o) Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:
i) Loans and receivables
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Following initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when instruments are derecognised or impaired. Premia, discounts and other costs and fees are 
recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
balance sheet date.
ii) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest receivable and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the receivables.
iii) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
iv) Financial assets arising from service concession arrangements
Where the provision of waste management services is performed through a contract with a public sector entity which controls a significant residual interest 
in asset infrastructure at the end of the contract, then consideration is treated as contract receivables, split between profit on the construction of assets, 
operation of the service and the provision of finance which is recognised in notional interest within finance income.
v) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps 
to hedge risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either:
 • a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or
 • a hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (a fair value hedge).
The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised in the income statement except for cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, 
when the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the 
ineffective portion in the income statement. The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the 
same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging 
instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is reperformed at the end of each reporting 
period to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Where a non-derivative transaction or series of transactions with the same counterparty has the aggregate effect in substance of a derivative instrument, 
the transaction or series of transactions shall be recognised as a single derivative instrument at fair value with associated movements recorded in the 
income statement.
122
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 The full fair value of a hedging derivative is apportioned on a straight-line basis between non-current and current assets and liabilities based on the 
remaining maturity of the hedging derivative.
Derivative financial instruments deemed held for trading, which are not subject to hedge accounting, are classified as a current asset or liability with any 
change in fair value recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group uses cross-currency swaps for some of its foreign currency denominated private placement borrowings. The swaps either have the effect of 
(i) converting variable rate foreign currency borrowings into fixed rate sterling borrowings, (ii) converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings into fixed 
rate sterling borrowings, or (iii) converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings into floating rate sterling borrowings.
vi) Financial instruments at fair value through profit 
Financial instruments at fair value through profit reflect the fair value movement of the hedged risk on a hedged item which has been designated in a fair 
value hedging relationship. The fair values of these financial instruments are initially recognised on the date the hedging relationship is entered into and 
thereafter remeasured at each subsequent balance sheet date. The gain or loss on remeasurement for the period is recognised in the income statement.
(p) Taxation including deferred tax
The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income or directly in equity as appropriate.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Management periodically evaluates tax items 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions on individual tax items, where in the judgement of management, the position is uncertain.
The Group includes a number of companies, including the parent company, which are part of a tax group for certain aspects of the tax legislation. One of 
these aspects relates to group relief whereby current tax liabilities can be offset by current tax losses arising in other companies within the same tax group. 
Payments for group relief are included within the current tax disclosures.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the tax base, 
except where they arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will 
be available against which the assets can be realised. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.
(q) Provisions
Provisions are made where there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be an outflow of 
economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made. Where the effect of the time value of money is material the 
current amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations. The unwinding of the discount to 
present value is included as notional interest within finance costs.
The Group’s policies on specific provisions are:
i) Landfill restoration costs
Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites are made when the obligation arises. Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future 
economic benefits, an asset in property, plant and equipment is recognised. Provisions are otherwise charged against profits based on the usage of void space.
ii) Environmental control and aftercare costs
Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter. Provision for 
all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis of the usage of void space at the site. Further 
provisions required after the operational life of a site are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii) Underperforming contracts
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting a contract’s obligations exceed the economic benefits derived from that contract, the unavoidable costs, less 
revenue anticipated under the terms of the contract, are recognised as a provision and charged to the income statement. An impairment loss on any assets 
dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy (j).
(r) Share capital and treasury shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is 
deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, is included in equity.
The Group balance sheet includes the shares held by the Pennon Employee Share Trust, relating to employee share-based payments, which have not 
vested at the balance sheet date. These are shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until such time as they vest.
(s) Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid; final dividends when approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
(t) Employee benefits
i) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
123
Financial statements Notes to the  
financial statements 
continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
Defined benefit pension schemes
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of 
the year less the fair value of plan assets. If the value of a plan’s assets exceeds the present value of its obligations, the resulting surplus is only recognised 
if the Group has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries who advise on the selection of Directors’ best estimates, using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high quality corporate bonds, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The increase in liabilities of the 
Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, expected to arise from employee service in the year, is charged against operating profit.
Changes in benefits granted by the employer are recognised immediately as past service cost in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Defined contribution scheme
Costs of the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
ii) Share-based payment
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for employees. The fair value of the employee services required in exchange 
for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Fair values are calculated using an appropriate pricing model. Non-market-based vesting conditions are adjusted for in assumptions as to the number of 
shares which are expected to vest.
(u) Pre-contract and development costs
Pre-contract and development costs, including bid costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is probable that the contract will be awarded or the 
development completed, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is amortised to the income statement over the life of the contract.
(v) Fair values
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price to transfer the asset or liability at the balance sheet date in an ordinary transaction 
between market participants.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values. In the 
case of non-current bank loans and other loans, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future 
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
(w) Transfers of assets from customers
Where an item of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect customers to the network is received from a customer, or where cash is 
received from a customer for the acquisition or construction of such an item, that asset is recorded and measured on initial recognition at its fair value. 
The credit created by the recognition of the asset is recognised in the income statement. The period over which the credit is recognised depends upon 
the nature of the service provided, as determined by the agreement with the customer. Where the service provided is solely a connection to the network, 
the credit is recognised at the point of connection. If the agreement does not specify a period, revenue is recognised over a period no longer than the 
economic life of the transferred asset used to provide the ongoing service.
The fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation.
(x) Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
(y) Perpetual capital securities
Perpetual capital securities are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and 
recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time the Company becomes obligated to pay the periodic return. This reflects the nature of the 
periodic returns and repayment of principal being only made at the Company’s discretion. Any associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.
(z) Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are those that in the Directors’ view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
124
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 3. Financial risk management
(a) Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign currency risk) and credit risk.
The Group’s treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs and to maintain reasonable headroom for 
contingencies, and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity, interest rate and credit counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Chief Financial Officer in accordance with policies established by the Board. Major transactions 
are individually approved by the Board. Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk, optimise the use of surplus funds and manage overall interest rate performance. The Group 
does not engage in speculative activity.
i) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available 
funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one year’s forecast requirements at all times. Details of undrawn committed facilities 
and short-term facilities are provided in note 28.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy that requires that no more than 20% of Group net borrowings should mature in any financial year.
The Group and Water Business have entered into covenants with lenders. While terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing (primarily based on 
the Water Business’s Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limited’s EBITDA plus interest receivable on service concession arrangements) and interest 
cover. Existing covenants are not impacted by subsequent changes to accounting standards.

Financial statements Notes to the

3. Financial risk management continued
ii) Market risk
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates. The Group uses a combination of fixed rate and index-linked 
borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy. At the year-end 69% (2016 67%) of 
Group net borrowings were at fixed rates (including at least 50% of South West Water’s borrowings) after the impact of financial derivatives. The notional 
principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not therefore an exposure for the Group. These 
instruments are analysed in note 23.
20% (2016 22%) of the Group’s net borrowings are RPI index-linked. The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure, which is also 
used in determining the amount of income from customers in South West Water. 
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk. Deposit interest receivable is expected to 
fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings. Consequently the Group’s income and cash generated from operations (note 38) are 
independent of changes in market interest rates.
For 2017 if interest rates on variable net borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the 
year and equity would have increased/decreased by £0.3 million (2016 £0.1 million), for the equity sensitivity fair value, with derivative impacts excluded.
For 2017 if RPI on index-linked borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and 
equity would have decreased/increased by £1.9 million (2016 £1.9 million).
Foreign currency risk occurs at transactional and translation level from borrowings and transactions in foreign currencies. These risks are managed 
through forward contracts, which provide certainty over foreign currency risk.
iii) Credit risk
Credit counterparty risk arises from cash and cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables. 
Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in notes 19 and 22.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments. The Board has agreed a policy for 
managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by the Group’s treasury function and are usually 
placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets. Deposit counterparties must meet board approved minimum criteria based on 
their short-term credit ratings and therefore of good credit quality.
(b) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group’s policy is to have a minimum of 12 months pre-funding of projected capital expenditure. At 31 March 2017 the Group had cash and facilities, 
including restricted funds, of £1.4 billion, meeting this objective.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and an appropriate 
capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital. Net borrowings are analysed 
in note 39 and calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits. Total capital is calculated as total shareholders’ equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were:

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 The Water segment is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value (RCV). Ofwat’s optimum gearing for the K6

The Group has entered into covenants with lenders and, while terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing and interest cover. The Group has 
been in compliance with its covenants during the year.
(c) Determination of fair values
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 • quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
 • inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly 
(that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
 • inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
The Group’s financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation 
techniques. A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or 
dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair 
value for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values, less impairment provision, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair value of financial 
liabilities, principally environmental provisions, is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in note 2. Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make use of estimates and 
assumptions in the application of these policies. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that 
management believe to be reasonable. However, given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the assumptions used.
Estimates
Environmental and landfill restoration provisions
Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter. The period of 
aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site. Key factors are the type of waste, the speed 
at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements specific to the site. The amounts expected to be incurred 
are based on landfill site operating lives, taking account of the anticipated decline in landfill activity.
The provisions are based on latest assumptions reflecting recent historic data and future cost estimates.
The aftercare provision is particularly sensitive to the estimated volumes of leachate and their associated cost, together with the discount rate used to 
establish the provision.
The provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Group’s 
obligations. A discount rate is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision. This is included in the income 
statement as a financial item within finance costs.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group’s environmental and landfill restoration provisions were £183.8 million (2016 £182.1 million) (note 32).
Where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the Group’s 
depreciation policy. As at 31 March 2017 these assets had a net book value of £14.3 million (2016 £11.7 million) (note 17).
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more 
than three years. The last such valuation of the main scheme was as at 31 March 2016.
The pension cost and liabilities under IAS 19 are assessed in accordance with Directors’ best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified 
actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation. The assumptions are based on member data supplied to the actuary and market observations for 
interest rates and inflation, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management. The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific 
calculation based on CMI 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement. The principal assumptions used to measure schemes’ 
liabilities, sensitivities to changes in those assumptions and future funding obligations are set out in note 30.

Estimates continued 
Taxation
The Group’s current tax provision of £26.8 million, reduced from £37.1 million in 2015/16, includes £18.6 million related to prior year tax items 
(2016 £37.1 million). 
In 2015/16 the Group reported significant judgement around uncertain tax items related to the interpretation of tax legislation regarding financial 
arrangements entered into in the normal course of business, which could have resulted in a range of outcomes of additional liabilities of c£20 million, to a 
reduction in liabilities of £52 million. Following engagement and subsequently resolution with HMRC across a number of areas, achieved through a process 
designed to expedite outstanding tax matters, these items are no longer an area of significant judgement and there is no such range related to ongoing 
uncertain tax items. 
The Group has a small number of ongoing uncertain tax items related to capital allowances for expenditure incurred in the normal course of business, 
where the Group has paid in full the tax HMRC interpret as due, and therefore would receive up to £20 million (2015/16 £70 million) should these tax items 
be concluded in the Group’s favour.
Service concession arrangements
Consideration from public sector entities for the operation of waste management service concessions is treated as contract receivables or other intangible 
assets, depending upon the right to receive cash from the asset. At the balance sheet date the Group recognised contract receivables of £217.6 million 
(2016 £201.9 million) and other intangible assets of £61.3 million (2016 £55.0 million) in relation to its service concession arrangements. 
Consideration relating to contract receivables is split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and provision of finance 
recognised as interest receivable. Management’s judgement is used in the allocation between these three elements, this assessment reflects external 
market conditions according to the type of service provided and project specific cash flow expectations, including the recovery of costs from the original 
contractor on our Glasgow concession.
Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services. Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as liabilities.
South West Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the 
Periodic Review price-setting process. For water and wastewater customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied 
including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end. Estimated usage is based on historic 
data, judgement and assumptions. The accrued income balance in this area at the balance sheet date was £77.7 million (2016 £67.8 million).
Viridor estimates income from certain contractual revenue streams based on tonnages, cost and historic data which are dependent on agreement with the 
customer after the delivery of the service. Revenue is accrued from the sale of electricity from our generating assets based upon metered output delivered 
at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. The total accrued income balance in relation to these areas at the balance 
sheet date was £42.8 million (2016 £37.8 million).
Provision for doubtful debts
At the balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience 
including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery. As at 31 March 2017 the Group’s current trade receivables were 
£321.6 million (2016 £303.6 million), against which £98.1 million (2016 £95.6 million) had been provided for impairment (note 22).
Judgements
Impairment of non-financial assets
In order to determine whether impairments, or reversals of previous impairments, are required for non-financial assets, the Group assesses whether there 
are any indicators for further impairment or reversal during the year. The assessment includes a review of changes in markets and discount rates over the 
year, together with a review of CGU business performance against expectations. The 2016/17 review concluded there were no indicators of further 
impairment or reversal.
Non-underlying items
In establishing which items are disclosed separately as non-underlying, to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance, the Directors 
exercise their judgement in assessing the size, nature or incidence of specific items. See note 6 for further details.

(a)  During the year a one-off charge of £10.7 million was made relating to restructuring costs associated with the Group-wide Shared Services Review. 
The £10.7 million charge consists of a £9.5 million non-cash charge to other operating expenses relating to a rationalisation of systems leading to an 
asset de-recognition, and a £1.1 million charge to manpower costs and a £0.1 million charge to other operating costs in relation to restructuring 
provisions. The charge is considered non-underlying due to its size and non-recurring nature.
 Last year a one-off charge of £10.2 million was made to the restructuring provision reflecting announced reorganisations across the Group.
(b)  In the year a credit of £16.0 million was recognised relating to non-cash derivative fair value movements associated with derivatives that are not 
designated as being party to an accounting hedge relationship. These movements are non-underlying due to the nature of the item being market 
dependant and potentially can be significant in value (size).
(c)  Since 2011 the Group has received a fixed interest rate on a £200 million financial asset and paid an index-linked interest rate on a £200 million loan, 
designed to improve the Group’s overall interest rate performance. The counterparty to both instruments was Peninsula MB Limited (PMB). In 
combination, these instruments were accounted for as a derivative, with a net interest income of £8 million p.a., c£7 million in 2016/17, cash settled.
  In periods of index underperformance, losses arose in PMB which were group relieved with the Group. Following a change in legislation, which saw the 
value of the derivative to the Group moving from a liability of £4 million to a liability of c.£40 million, the Group made the decision to exit the transaction.
  On 10 February 2017 the Company unwound this transaction. The derivative had been due to end in 2027, however, following a change in the 
economic benefit of this derivative due to a change in legislation which impacted the derivative’s future cash flows, the Company exercised its option 
to unwind the transaction early.
  The process for unwinding the derivative resulted in the Group acquiring a financial asset for £283 million and a financial liability for £239 million from 
Nomura Structured Holdings plc. The counterparty to both these transactions was PMB. Simultaneously, the Company also acquired the remaining 
25% of PMB’s share capital from Nomura Structured Holdings plc, for a consideration of £36,000, with all PMB’s liabilities being due to the Company 
from that point. The Company has since settled these liabilities through intercompany transactions with PMB. PMB has ceased all operating activities 
and will be liquidated in due course. The net consideration due to Nomura Structured Holdings plc in respect of these transactions is £44 million with 
an agreed payment date of June 2018. The impact for the Group is a net cost of £35 million post tax. 
  PMB is a private limited company, incorporated in England and Wales on 5 December 2011 as a subsidiary of Nomura Structured Holdings plc, part of 
the ‘Nomura Group’. Prior to the transaction on 10 February 2017, PMB’s share capital was 75% owned by the Company and 25% owned by Nomura 
Structured Holdings plc, who had control of PMB for accounting purposes. 
  The group relief claimed by the Group has been treated as an uncertain tax item and has been substantially provided for over recent years. 
Following the conclusion of discussions with HMRC, no further amounts are required to be recognised by the Group. A tax credit of £8 million relates 
to the overall cost to unwind this derivative transaction.
  Post the unwind of the transaction the Group’s interest will no longer include the c£8 million p.a. income, c£7 million in 2016/17, and the underlying tax 
charge will reduce by a similar amount.
   The liability recognised is non-underlying by its size and nature.
(d)  Following the enactment during the year the rate of corporation tax reduced from 18% to 17% from April 2020, resulting in a one-off credit of £21.3 
million being recognised in the income statement. In addition a charge of £1.7 million has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
and a credit of £0.1 million was recognised directly in equity.
  Last year the rate of corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% from April 2017, reducing further to 18% from April 2020, resulting in a one-off credit of 
£33.1 million recognised in the income statement. In addition, a charge of £3.8 million was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and a 
charge of £0.1 million was recognised directly in equity.
 These movements are non-underlying as are dependent on changes in UK tax law and are non-underlying due to their size.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust (note 36), which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The 
Group has two types of dilutive potential ordinary shares – those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average 
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year; and the contingently issuable shares under the Group’s Performance and Co-investment 
Plan and the deferred shares element of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are 
expected to be met.
The weighted average number of shares and earnings used in the calculations were:

Number of shares (millions)
For basic earnings per share 413.0 410.9
Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares from share options 1.9 1.8

Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share before non-underlying items and deferred tax are presented as the Directors believe that this measure provides a more useful 
comparison on business trends and performance, since deferred tax reflects distortive effects of changes in corporation tax rates and the level of long-term 
capital investment. Earnings per share have been calculated:

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 15. Goodwill

At 1 April 2015 339.3
Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 45.7

At 31 March 2017 385.0
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) expected to benefit from that business 
combination. £342.7 million of the goodwill balance is allocated to the waste management business, with the remaining £42.3 million allocated to the water 
business, representing the lowest levels at which goodwill is monitored and tested.
The acquisition of Peninsula MB Limited, as detailed in note 6, did not give rise to the recognition of goodwill.
Impairment testing of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of the water business segment, for which goodwill was recognised on acquisition of Bournemouth Water in 2016, is assessed using 
level 2 fair value hierarchy techniques, with reference to the market value of the merged water business, using a market based observable premium to 
Regulated Capital Value.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment, to which the majority of goodwill is allocated, is determined based on value-in-use 
calculations which, under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, require the use of base cash flow projections that reflect reasonable and supportable assumptions 
with specific restrictions on the estimates to be used. These include limitations on reflecting cash flows to take account of future cost restructuring, or 
improvement or enhancement of asset performance. Uncommitted projects are excluded. Discount rates are required to be derived independently of the 
Group’s capital structure and those used reflect management’s prudent estimate of a rate that investors would require if they were to choose a similar 
investment ranging from 6-9% across the CGUs business activities.
The base cash flow projections have been derived from the Group’s detailed budget and strategic plan projections. These cover a period of seven years 
and are prepared as part of the annual planning cycle. This period is believed to lead to a more realistic estimate of future cash flows than five years. 
Long-term growth rates of 3%, based on forecast of growth in waste management markets and the UK economy, are applied to cash flows beyond the 
seven year period, with overheads expected to grow at 1% based on ongoing efficiency expectations of 2% per annum.
These plans are based on detailed market-by-market forecasts of projected volumes, prices and costs for each business activity. These forecasts reflect, on 
an individual operational site basis, numerous assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions include anticipated changes in market size and volumes; 
recyclate prices; energy selling prices; gate fees; the level of future landfill tax; and cost inflation. Management has determined the value assigned to each 
assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry analysis and current legislation. For business activities with an indefinite life a terminal 
growth rate has been used.
The results of tests performed during the year demonstrate significant headroom in all CGUs, and it is judged that no reasonable change in the key 
assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.

(2016 4.2%).

(2016 £1.0 million) has been offset by deferred income and £178.2 million (2016 £182.9 million) has been charged against profits. Asset lives and residual 
values are reviewed annually. During the year borrowing costs of £10.8 million (2016 £7.3 million) have been capitalised on qualifying assets, at an average 
borrowing rate of 3.5% (2016 4.1%).
Groups of assets forming cash generating units are reviewed for indicators of impairment. No indicators of impairment were identified during the year.
In 2016 an impairment of non-strategic landfill sites of £60.9 million and a £60.9 million reversal of assets was recognised. 
Asset lives are reviewed annually. No significant changes were required in 2016/17. In 2015/16 the annual review, encompassing internal assessments and 
external benchmarking, resulted in upper end of the range of useful lives for water mains and sewers increasing from 100 to 120 years and for Energy 
Recovery Facilities from 30 to 40 years.

The Group has a number of service concession arrangements with local authority clients in the waste management sector to build and operate recycling 
assets and energy recovery facilities. The terms of the contracts, including pricing and performance obligations, are established at the outset and the 
contracts are typically for a duration of 25 years. The assets revert to the local authority at the end of the contract. At 31 March 2017 the average remaining 
duration of the service concession arrangements was 22 years.
The fair value of amounts owed by related parties is based on cash flows using a rate based on the borrowings rate of 2.25% (2016 2.50%). The discount 
rate is equal to London Interbank Offered Rate plus an allowance to reflect an appropriate credit margin.
The effective interest rate on amounts owed by related parties was 12.5% (2016 12.3%).
Other receivables include site development and pre-contract costs of £4.1 million (2016 £9.6 million).
There is no concentration of risk in non-current receivables. A significant proportion of the debt is due from local government authorities or joint venture 
companies which principally operate under long-term local government authority contracts.

Trade receivables include accrued income relating to customers with water budget plans.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
There is no concentration of credit risk in trade receivables. The Group has a large number of customers who are dispersed and there is no significant loss 
on trade receivables expected that has not been provided for. The Group has created IAS 39 portfolio provisions, but cannot practicably identify which 
receivables specifically are the ones impaired. It is Group policy to consider a receivable in a portfolio to which an impairment has been allocated on a 
collective basis as not being impaired for the purposes of IFRS 7 disclosures until the loss can be specifically identified with the receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables which are past due but not specifically impaired was:

The aged trade receivables above are taken directly from aged sales ledger records before deduction of credit balances and other adjustments.
The Group’s operating businesses specifically review separate categories of debt to identify an appropriate provision for impairment. South West Water 
Limited has a duty under legislation to continue to provide domestic customers with services regardless of payment.

The fair value of derivatives is split between current and non-current assets or liabilities based on the maturity of the cash flows. The ineffective portion 
recognised in the income statement arising from hedging relationships was £nil (2016 £nil).
During the year a £10.8 million charge (2016 £7.9 million) was recognised in profit and loss relating to cash flow hedges previously recognised through other 
comprehensive income and recorded in the hedging reserve.
Interest rate swaps, primarily cash flow hedges, and fixed rate borrowings are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure at least 50% of 
Group net borrowings are at fixed rate. At 31 March 2017 69% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rate (2016 67%).
At 31 March 2017 the Group had interest rate swaps to swap from floating to fixed rate and hedge financial liabilities with a notional value of £1,078.0 million 
and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years (2016 £1,078.0 million, with 3.9 years). The weighted average interest rate of the swaps for their nominal 
amount was 2.0% (2016 2.0%).
Derivatives deemed held for trading at 31 March 2016 included a derivative with a fair value of £4.2 million which did not qualify for hedge accounting 
under IAS 39, but was designed to improve the Group’s overall interest rate performance. During the year this derivative position was unwound as set out 
in note 6.
The periods for which cash flow hedges are expected to affect future profit or loss are as follows:

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 Valuation hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 • quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
 • inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, 
derived from prices) (level 2)
 • inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (level 2, for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation 
techniques. A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or 
dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair 
value for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The Group’s financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures:

and revised payments due. The accumulated deposits, £79.3 million at 31 March 2017 (2016 £71.7 million), are currently being held to settle the lease 
liability, subject to rights to release by negotiation with the lessor. The deposits are subject to a registered charge given as security to the lessor for the 
balance outstanding.
The period for repayment of certain other existing leases includes an agreement to deposit with the lessor group amounts equal to the difference between

Included in other payables are amounts provided by the Group in relation to claims received which are considered by the Directors and the management 
of the Group to be the best estimate of the amounts that might be finally settled. Further disclosures have not been provided in accordance with IAS 37 
paragraph 92.
30. Retirement benefit obligations
During the year the Group operated a number of defined benefit pension schemes and also a defined contribution section within the main scheme. The 
principal plan within the Group is the Pennon Group Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit, final salary pension scheme in the UK. The Group’s 
pension schemes are established under trust law and comply with all relevant UK legislation.
The assets of the Group’s pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best 
interest of the funds’ beneficiaries. The appointment of schemes’ trustees is determined by the schemes’ trust documentation. The Group has a policy for 
the main fund that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the schemes, including pensioners.
Defined contribution schemes
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were £5.3 million (2016 £7.5 million).
Defined benefit schemes
Assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 March were:
2017
%
2016
%
2015
%
Rate of increase in pensionable pay 3.2 2.9 2.9
Rate of increase for current and future pensions 2.0 2.9 2.9
Rate used to discount schemes’ liabilities and expected return on schemes’ assets 2.55 3.30 3.35
Inflation 3.2 2.9 2.9
Mortality
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience. The mortality 
assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2015 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement.
The average life expectancy in years of a member having retired at age 62 on the balance sheet date is projected as:
2017 2016 2015
Male 24.8 25.1 25.0
Female 27.2 27.3 27.2
The average life expectancy in years of a future pensioner retiring at age 62, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is projected as:
2017 2016 2015
Male 26.2 26.5 26.4
Female 29.5 29.6 29.5
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes’ liabilities are:
Change in
assumption
Impact on 
schemes’ 
liabilities
Rate of increase in pensionable pay +/– 0.5% +/– 0.6%
Rate of increase in current and future pensions +/– 0.5% +/– 6.2%
Rate used to discount schemes’ liabilities +/– 0.5% +/– 9.3%
Inflation +/– 0.5% +/– 6.4%
Life expectancy +/– 1 year +/– 4.5%
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect of changes in the principal assumptions used for the measurement of the pension liability. The method used to 
calculate the sensitivities is approximate and has been determined taking into account the duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of each scheme’s 
membership. This is the same approach as has been adopted in previous years.

Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets 
(equities and diversified growth funds) which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, 
but can give rise to volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored such that 
it is suitable with the schemes’ long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes’ liabilities, although this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the value of the schemes’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher 
liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against 
extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, 
meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes’ investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and 
levels of risk. The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements:
 • holding of cash funds and bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects market movements in the schemes’ 
liabilities
 • a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns
 • investment of a proportion of the schemes’ assets in alternative asset classes which give the potential for diversification (currently property and 
diversified growth).
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in 
which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected increases in pensionable pay.
The future cash flows arising from the payment of the defined benefits are expected to be settled primarily in the period between 15 and 40 years from the 
balance sheet date.
The 2016 triennial actuarial valuation of the principal defined benefit scheme has been agreed, with the actuarial valuation deficit and schedule of 
contributions being in line with the 2013 triennial actuarial valuation, requiring deficit recovery contributions of c.£12 million per annum from 2019 to 2022. 
The Group has made a deficit recovery contribution of £0.5 million to the main scheme during the year (2016 £23.7 million). The Group monitors funding 
levels on an annual basis and expects to pay total contributions of around £10 million during the year ended 31 March 2018.

Environmental and landfill restoration provisions are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter. The 
period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site. Key factors are the type of waste, 
the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements specific to the site. Environmental and landfill 
restoration provisions are expected to be substantially utilised throughout the operational life of a site and for landfill sites within 60 years of closure. The 
provisions have been established assuming current waste management technology based upon estimated costs at future prices which have been 
discounted to present value. The Group has applied a discount rate of 4.75% (2016 4.75%) and an inflation rate of 2.5% (2016 2.5%).
The restructuring provision relates principally to severance costs and will be utilised within one year.
Other provisions include underperforming contracts of £11.1 million (2016 £15.6 million), which are provided for at the net present value of the operating 
losses of the underperforming contracts and are to be utilised over the remaining period of the contract to which they relate. The weighted average 
contract life of underperforming contracts is 3 years.

Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share plans for the benefit of employees. Details of each plan are:
i) Sharesave Scheme
An all-employee savings related plan is operated that enables employees, including Executive Directors, to invest up to a maximum of £500 per month for 
three or five years. These savings can then be used to buy ordinary shares, at a price set at a 17% discount to the market value at the start of the savings 
period, at the third, fifth or seventh year anniversary of the option being granted. Options expire six months following the exercise date and, except for 
certain specific circumstances such as redundancy, lapse if the employee leaves the Group before the option exercise period commences.
Outstanding options to subscribe for ordinary shares of 40.7p each under the Company’s share option schemes are:

On 8 March 2013 the Company issued £300 million perpetual capital securities. Costs directly associated with the issue of £5.2 million are set off against

their principal amount on 8 March 2018 or any subsequent periodic return payment date after this.
The Company has the option to defer periodic returns on any relevant payment date, as long as a dividend on the ordinary shares has not been paid or 
declared in the previous 12 months. Deferred periodic returns shall be satisfied only on redemption or payment of dividend on ordinary shares, all of which 
only occur at the sole discretion of the Company.
As the Company paid a dividend in the 12 months prior to the periodic return date of 8 March 2017, a periodic return of £20.3 million was paid during 
the year.

187.5 163.7 743.4 584.8
Guarantees in respect of performance bonds are entered into in the normal course of business. No liability is expected to arise in respect of the guarantees.
Other contingent liabilities relate to a possible obligation last year to pay further consideration in respect of a previously acquired business when the 
outcome of planning applications was known.
In connection with the application of the audit exemption under Section 479A of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has guaranteed all the 
outstanding liabilities as at 31 March 2017 of certain subsidiaries: Peninsula Leasing Limited and Viridor Waste 2 Limited since these companies qualify for 
the exemption.
Other contractual and litigation uncertainties 
The Group establishes provisions in connection with contracts and litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past 
events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Matters where it is uncertain that these conditions are met are: 
 • The Group’s joint venture Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) Ltd is party to a PFI contract with the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority (the 
Authority). The authority has announced its intention to terminate this contract. The Group is in negotiation with the Authority with the aim of delivering 
an orderly exit from the contract. 
 • The Group is subject to litigation from time to time as a result of its activities, including a prosecution from the Health and Safety Executive in relation to 
the fatality of a Viridor employee at Derriford, Plymouth in 2015. 
Uncertain tax items
Management judgement is required to estimate the tax provisions relating to uncertain tax items that remain to be agreed with HMRC. 
In 2015/16 the Group reported significant judgement around uncertain tax items related to the interpretation of tax legislation regarding financial 
arrangements entered into in the normal course of business, which could have resulted in a range of outcomes of additional liabilities of c£20 million, to a 
reduction in liabilities of £52 million. Following engagement and subsequently resolution with HMRC across a number of areas, achieved through a process 
designed to expedite outstanding tax matters, these items are no longer an area of significant judgement and there is no such range related to ongoing 
uncertain tax items. The Group has a small number of ongoing uncertain tax items related to capital allowances for expenditure incurred in the normal 
course of business, where the Group has paid in full the tax HMRC interpret as due, and therefore would receive up to £20 million (2015/16 £70 million) 
should these tax items be concluded in the Group’s favour.

Beware of share fraud
The following is taken from the ScamSmart section of the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s website (www.scamsmart.fca.org.uk). 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for 
an upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this 
way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud
1.  Keep in mind that firms authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) are unlikely to contact you out of the blue 
with an offer to buy or sell shares.
2.  Do not get into a conversation; note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
3.  Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
4.  Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
5.  Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you 
want to call it back.
6.  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have 
contact details on the Register or you are told they are out 
of date.
7.  Search the FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms at  
www.scamsmart.fca.org.uk. Consider that if you buy or sell 
shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access 
to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. Seek impartial advice from a 
financial adviser before you make an investment.
8.  Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share 
fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams where you can 
find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters, you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
