Strategic report
Chairman’s introduction
Outstanding progress against 
our strategic objectives and 
further expansion of our 
global footprint.”
Colin Smith OBE
Non-Executive Chairman Strategic progress
I am pleased to report outstanding 
progress in 2017 against our strategic 
objectives and further expansion  
of our global footprint. 
In January we signed a joint venture 
agreement with Sonae Modelo Continente, 
Portugal’s leading food retailer, to form 
Sohi Meat Solutions which supplies a 
wide range of packaged beef, lamb, veal 
and pork products. In May we invested 
in Foods Connected Limited, a market 
intelligence data management company 
focused on the fresh food supply chain. 
In August we announced expansion in 
Central Europe to produce fresh foods 
including sandwiches, pizza, ready meals 
and soups. In October we announced 
we will expand into New Zealand by 
constructing a new meat processing 
facility to supply Countdown Supermarkets 
which is due to open in 2020. In November 
we completed the £81m acquisition of 
Seachill, a leading chilled UK based fish 
processor and since the year end we have 
agreed to restructure the Australia joint 
venture and take full operational control  
of its two existing plants. Given the growth 
in business categories and geographies, 
planning of future resource implications  
is well in hand.
The Seachill acquisition was funded 
through an equity placing which raised 
over £55m and a new bank refinancing 
putting in place a syndicated facility.
This expansion into a new protein, fresh 
foods and into new geographical markets 
provides Hilton with broader foundations 
to its business. This, together with the 
benefit of a new bank refinancing, means 
Hilton is well positioned for further growth.
Group performance
We grew our volume in 2017 maintaining 
a trend of continuous growth achieved 
in every year since Hilton’s flotation in 
2007. There was strong pre-exceptional 
operating profit growth of nearly 12% 
including the benefits of the Seachill 
acquisition and favourable exchange 
rate movements (over 2% up after 
exceptionals) which was achieved despite 
considerable investment in people 
and infrastructure to support growth. 
Pre-exceptional basic earnings per share 
were 11% above last year (down 1.5% 
after exceptionals).
Hilton continued to generate significant 
operating cash flow during 2017. 
This enabled the Group to end the year 
with net cash of £25.4m, compared with 
£32.3m at the end of last year, despite the 
significant investment made in the Seachill 
acquisition, net of the equity raised to part 
fund it. 
Our continued investment in our facilities 
includes new technology to increase 
capacity, improve operational efficiency 
and offer innovative solutions to our 
retailer partners.
There is a continuing climate of local, 
global and geopolitical uncertainties 
including the UK’s decision to leave 
the European Union. Although the final 
terms of Brexit are unknown, Hilton’s 
predominantly local sourcing and operating 
model leaves us well placed and we 
are confident that the Hilton business is 
resilient to weather these uncertainties.
Dividend policy
The Board considers that the Group’s 
progressive dividend policy maintained 
since flotation remains appropriate, given 
both the strategic progress achieved in 
2017 and Hilton’s continuing strong level  
of cash generation. With the proposed final 
dividend of 14.0p per ordinary share, total 
dividends in respect of 2017 will be 19.0p 
per ordinary share, an increase of 11.1% 
compared to last year. 
Our Board and governance
The Hilton Board is responsible for the long 
term success of the Group and, to achieve 
this, it contains an appropriate mix of skills, 
depth and diversity and a range of practical 
business experience, which is available to 
support and guide our management teams 
across a wide range of countries. I would 
like to thank my colleagues on the Board 
for their support, counsel and expertise 
during the year.
We remain committed to achieving good 
governance and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code including 
succession planning and maintaining a 
talent pipeline.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will be held at the Old 
Bridge Hotel, 1 High Street, Huntingdon, 
Cambridgeshire PE29 3TQ on 23 May 
2018 at noon and my colleagues and I very 
much look forward to seeing those of you 
who are able to attend.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
2017 was a transformational 
year through the acquisition of 
Seachill and expansion in New 
Zealand and Central Europe.”
Robert Watson OBE
Chief Executive Strategic objectives
Our strategy continues to be to support our 
customers’ brands and their development 
in local markets, whilst achieving attractive 
and sustainable growth in shareholder 
value. This straightforward approach has 
generated growth over an extended period 
of time and with a strong reputation, well 
invested modern facilities and a robust 
balance sheet, the Group remains well 
positioned to achieve continuing progress.
Hilton seeks to build long term customer 
and shareholder value by focusing on:
 – Growing volumes and extending 
product ranges supplied and services 
provided to its existing customers;
 – Optimising the use of its assets and 
investing in new technology and 
capacity expansion as required;
 – Maintaining a vigilant focus on food 
safety and integrity and reducing unit 
costs, while improving product quality 
and service provision; and
 – Entering new territories and markets 
either with new customers or in 
partnership with our existing customers.
We will continue to pursue measured 
geographical expansion and range 
extension, whilst at the same time 
actively developing, enriching, deepening 
and expanding the scope of our existing 
business partnerships, playing a full and 
proactive role in supporting our customers 
and the successful development of their 
brands. We have successfully expanded 
our product range into new proteins such 
as fish as well as fresh foods including 
pizzas and soups.
Business model
Our business model is the means by which 
we deliver on our strategic objectives. 
The Hilton business model is proven 
and sustainable, whilst being relatively 
simple and straightforward. We operate 
large scale, extensively automated and 
robotised meat and fish processing and 
packing facilities for major international 
multiple retailers on a dedicated basis. 
Central Europe is an exception where our 
facility in Poland supplies multiple retailers 
in order to achieve critical mass in terms of 
volumes supplied and, as a consequence, 
gives us the ability to achieve competitive 
unit packing costs. 
Raw material meat and fish is sourced, in 
conjunction with our retail partners, from 
a combination of local sources and a wide 
international base of proven suppliers.  
It is then processed, packed and delivered 
to the retailers’ distribution centres or 
stores. Our plants are highly automated 
and use advanced robotics for the storage 
of raw materials and finished products. 
Developing robotics technology has been 
extended in recent years both in the 
production environment and to the sorting 
of finished products by retailer store order, 
achieving material supply chain efficiencies 
for our customers.
We seek to keep ourselves at the forefront 
of the meat and fish packing industry, 
which helps ensure our continued 
competitiveness. We constantly look to 
drive efficiencies, always maintaining a 
pipeline of clear identifiable cost reduction 
initiatives and an open minded approach 
designed to continually challenge the 
status quo. We consider our modern, very 
well-invested facilities to be a key factor 
in keeping unit packing costs as low as 
possible. Over the past thirteen years 
we have invested continuously across 
all areas of our business, including the 
sourcing of raw materials, the design of 
packaging materials, increased efficiency 
in processing and storage solutions 
and updating our IT infrastructure. 
Group capital expenditure over the period 
2004-2017 has totalled £238m. 
We have facilities in six countries in 
Europe, each run by a local management 
team enhanced by specialist central 
leadership, expertise, advice and 
support. These businesses operate 
under the terms of five to ten year 
long term supply agreements with our 
retailer partners, either on a cost plus, 
packing rate or volume based reward 
basis. These contractual arrangements, 
combined with our customer dedication, 
serve to maximise achievable volume 
throughput whilst minimising unit packing 
costs thereby delivering value to our 
customers. In Australia and Portugal, 
together with our retailer partners, 
facilities are operated under joint venture 
companies who receive volume related 
management fees.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Under the long term supply agreements 
we have in place with our customers, 
the parameters of our revenue are clearly 
defined. As well as income derived from 
the supply of retail packed meat and 
fish products, there are also provisions 
whereby our income can be increased 
or decreased subject to achievement 
of certain pre-agreed and pre-defined 
key performance measures and targets 
designed to align our objectives with  
those of our customers.
We are a committed and loyal partner with a 
continuing record of delivering value through 
quality products with the highest levels of 
food safety, traceability and integrity, whilst 
providing a range of services which enable 
our customers to evolve and improve their 
meat and fish supply chain management. 
Our customer base comprises high 
quality multiple retailers and our in depth 
understanding of our customers’ needs, 
together with those of their consumers, 
enables us to play an active role in managing 
their meat and fish supply chains whilst 
providing agile solutions to supply chain 
challenges as they arise. As our customers’ 
markets change and competition increases, 
we need to keep a constant focus on 
the challenges they face so we can put 
forward flexible solutions, together with 
continuing increases in efficiency and cost 
competitiveness. This flexible approach and 
understanding of our local markets remains 
one of our core strengths.
The strength of our long term partnerships 
with our retail customers has been a key 
driver of our growth since the Group was 
formed and will continue to underpin the 
Group’s strategy. Hilton’s business model 
has proved successful across a range 
of European countries and in Australia, 
appropriately adapted in each case by 
working in close collaboration with its 
local customers to meet their specific 
requirements. Our experience to date 
continues to indicate that our business 
model, appropriately adapted, can be 
successfully transferred to a number  
of new countries.
As well as our ability to provide excellent 
execution locally, we also have at our 
disposal a wide and deep expertise on  
a number of areas of specialism, such as 
engineering, food related IT applications, 
category management support and market 
intelligence. We are able to apply these 
skills to a number of markets to support our 
customers where required, and to do so  
in a cost-effective way.
Business development
The Group’s rapid expansion has been 
based on its established and proven 
track record, together with its growing 
international reputation and experience 
and the recognised success of the close 
partnerships it has forged and maintained 
with successful retail partners. We are 
an international business and operate 
production facilities in six countries across 
Europe and work with joint venture partners 
in two further countries. Products from 
these facilities are sold in fourteen European 
countries and Australia.
Our first facility opened in Huntingdon in 
1994 supplying Tesco UK. In 2000 we took 
over an existing facility in Zaandam, Holland 
supplying Albert Heijn which also has stores 
in Belgium. In 2004 new factories were 
built in Drogheda, Ireland supplying Tesco 
Ireland and in Vasteras, Sweden supplying 
ICA Gruppen. Our facility in Tychy, Poland 
opened in 2006 and supplies Ahold stores  
in Czech Republic and Slovakia, Tesco stores 
in Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and 
Slovakia and Rimi stores in Latvia, Lithuania 
and Estonia. Our Danish factory near Aarhus 
opened in 2011 and supplies Coop Danmark.
We formed a joint venture company with 
Woolworths in Australia in 2013 which 
manages their meat processing and packing 
facilities at Bunbury in Western Australia 
and a state of the art meat packing facility 
near Melbourne, Victoria which opened 
in 2015. 
Progress in 2017
Seachill was acquired during the year for 
£81m. The business was founded in 1998 
and has grown to become one of the 
largest chilled fish processors in the UK, 
with well-invested facilities and a well-
established supply chain based in Grimsby, 
Lincolnshire. It operates from three sites 
and supplies a number of UK leading food 
retail customers. Seachill has successfully 
innovated and developed new products 
including The Saucy Fish Co. brand which 
is the largest chilled wet fish brand in the 
UK. This extension into a new protein is 
an exciting development for Hilton which 
creates the following opportunities:
 – Investing to increase Seachill’s capacity 
and use our experience in robotics and 
automated processes to deliver higher 
quality and better value to the customer;
 – Expanding into overseas territories 
alongside our existing key customers 
and other new business opportunities;
 – Developing innovative new products 
in the fish category broadening the 
range of products offered to new and 
existing customers; and
 – Expanding The Saucy Fish Co. 
brand into other categories both 
in the UK and overseas.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
continued At the beginning of the year we signed 
a joint venture agreement with Sonae to 
manage their existing meat processing  
and packing facility in Santarem, Portugal.
We also signed an agreement to construct 
a new facility in Auckland, New Zealand 
to supply Progressive Enterprises, a 
subsidiary of Woolworths, which operates 
under the Countdown brand. This facility 
will supply beef, lamb, pork, chicken and 
added value products and production is 
expected to commence in 2020.
Our facility in Poland will expand following 
agreement with Tesco to supply fresh 
foods into Central Europe including 
sandwiches, pizzas, ready meals 
and soups.
Since the year end we have reached 
agreement with Woolworths to restructure 
the Australia joint venture and take full 
operational control of these existing 
plants from 1 July 2018. After a two year 
transitional period we will purchase the 
relevant plant assets. We are currently 
constructing a new facility in Brisbane, 
Queensland which Hilton will finance and 
operate through its Australian subsidiary 
and progress is on track. 
In 2017 some 75% of the Group’s  
volumes were produced in countries 
outside the UK.
Currency translation
The wide geographical spread of the Group 
increases its resilience by minimising its 
reliance on any one individual economy. 
This means that Hilton’s results, as 
reported in Sterling, are sensitive to 
changes in the value of Sterling compared 
to the range of overseas currencies in 
which the Group trades. During 2017, 
the average exchange rates for the various 
overseas currencies in which the Group 
trades have all appreciated significantly 
against Sterling, compared with the 
corresponding period in 2016, specifically, 
the Euro by 7.2%, the Danish Krone by 
7.3%, the Polish Zloty by 10.0%, the 
Swedish Krona by 5.2% and the Australian 
Dollar by 8.5%.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Resourcing for growth: 
culture and people
Successful businesses are principally 
about having the right people in the 
right positions at the right time working 
together as ‘one team’, with local 
management teams empowered, 
encouraged and advised in specialist 
areas enabling them to support their 
local customers. The Group benefits 
from each of its businesses being part 
of a larger organisation, which enables 
them to share best practice solutions, 
including equipment selection, IT solutions 
and ways of working along with the 
collaborative sharing of new learnings, 
ideas and techniques.
We are committed to providing an inclusive 
working environment where everyone 
feels valued, respected and able to fulfil 
their potential. We recognise that people 
from different backgrounds, countries 
and experiences can bring benefits to 
our business. We fully recognise the 
benefits of gender diversity and details 
of the gender composition of our staff 
are set out in our Corporate and social 
responsibility report.
The Group currently employs over 
3,600 employees across Europe and 
Australia. Our business model is largely 
decentralised, with capable, largely self-
sufficient management teams running 
our businesses in each local country. 
We consider this devolved structure to be 
a critical success factor, achieving close 
working relationships with our customers, 
who benefit from personal, dedicated, 
flexible and rapid local support.
The Board fully understands and 
appreciates just how much our progress 
relies on the effort, personal commitment, 
enthusiasm, enterprise and initiative of 
our employees. I would like to take this 
opportunity, on behalf of the Board, to 
personally thank all of them both for their 
dedicated efforts during 2017 and their 
continuing commitment to the Group’s 
ongoing growth and development.
Performance overview
The overall performance of our business 
was stable across its three separate 
operating segments boosted by the 
new acquisition and joint venture as 
outlined below.
Western Europe
Operating profit before exceptional 
items of £41.5m (2016: £36.1m) on 
turnover of £1,267.9m (2016: £1,147.5m)
This operating segment covers the 
Group’s businesses in the UK, Ireland, 
Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. 
Volumes were 14.4% driven higher by new 
Portugal and Seachill businesses offset 
by lower consumer demand in Holland. 
Sales on a constant currency basis grew 
by 6.5%. Operating margins improved 
slightly to 3.3% (2016: 3.1%) boosted 
by new contributions from Seachill and 
Portugal. Seachill trading in the post-
acquisition period was good with profit 
of £1.8m before charging amortisation. 
Portuguese income in the year was 
generated from managing the refurbishing 
and re-equipping phase activity. 
Central Europe
Operating profit of £1.2m (2016: £2.1m) 
on turnover of £91.6m (2016: £87.0m)
In Central Europe the Group’s meat 
packing business, based at Tychy in 
Poland, supplies customers across 
Central Europe, from Hungary to the 
Baltics. Volumes decreased by 13.7% 
with constant currency sales 4.1% 
lower and operating margins fell to 1.3% 
(2016: 2.4%) as we continue to adapt our 
business model to the local environment 
with performance improving in the second 
half of the year.
A five year agreement was reached during 
the year with Tesco to build a state of the 
art factory in Poland to produce fresh foods 
including sandwiches, pizza, ready meals 
and soups. It is expected that production 
will begin in the first quarter of 2019.
Central costs and other
Net operating cost before exceptional 
items £4.4m (2016: £3.9m)
This segment includes our share of the 
management fee earned by our joint 
venture with Woolworths of £4.3m 
(2016: £3.1m), start-up and support costs 
of £1.5m (2016: £0.6m) and central costs 
of £7.2m (2016: £6.4m). These figures 
exclude the exceptional one-off acquisition 
costs of £2.8m. Hilton’s share of post-tax 
joint venture service fees in Australia grew 
by 42% in the year across the facilities  
in Melbourne and Western Australia.  
Start-up and support costs increased as 
we designed and commenced construction  
of our new facility in Brisbane, 
Queensland. Central costs were higher  
as we progressively increase resources  
to manage our growth successfully.
Past and future trends
Over recent decades as major retail 
chains have progressively gained a 
greater share of the grocery markets in 
most countries, they have increasingly 
turned to large scale, centralised packing 
solutions capable of producing private 
label packed food products more safely 
and cost effectively. In doing so, they have 
rationalised their supply base, achieving 
lower costs with higher food safety, food 
integrity, traceability and quality standards. 
This has allowed supermarket groups to 
focus on their core business and maximise 
their return on available retail space 
whilst addressing consumers’ continuing 
requirement for quality and value.
Grocery retail markets are expected 
to remain extremely competitive, with 
continuing pressure on consumer 
expenditure. The trend towards increased 
use of centralised packing solutions is 
likely to continue albeit at different speeds 
across the world. This gives rise to a wide 
range of potential future geographical 
expansion opportunities for Hilton, but 
inevitably in a range of different timescales 
as markets develop and change over time.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
continued Within the wider retail market, consumer 
patterns are continuing to change with 
increased internet based ordering and 
delivery together with growth in the 
number of ‘click and collect’ facilities. 
Following pressures on consumer 
expenditure over a number of years, there 
has been increased use by cost conscious 
consumers of local convenience stores and 
discount outlets to shop more frequently 
for a reduced overall basket cost per visit 
and at a wider range of retail outlets. 
These developments which appear to be 
structural rather than cyclical reinforce the 
overall trend towards retail packed meat 
and fish, as this is the offering in all these 
growth areas. 
Outlook and current trading
Hilton’s operating performance in the 
early months of 2018 has been in line 
with the Board’s expectations. The Group 
will implement the transfer of operational 
control of the two existing Australian joint 
venture facilities during the year. We will 
continue to explore opportunities for 
further geographical expansion in both 
domestic and overseas markets and are 
well placed to capture those opportunities 
as they arise.
The medium term outlook for Hilton is 
positive with the integration of the Seachill 
business together with new factories in 
Queensland, Australia and New Zealand 
as well as business extension in Central 
Europe. These projects and continued 
focus on product development and range 
extension lay foundations for strong 
growth over the next five years.

Performance and financial review
A strong financial performance 
including a £55.9m equity 
placing and new syndicated 
banking facilities.”
Nigel Majewski
Chief Financial Officer Summary of Group performance
Hilton’s financial performance was strong 
in 2017 with operating profits up 2.3% 
and 11.6% before exceptional items 
reflecting constant currency growth of 
7.0% boosted by favourable currency 
movements. Basic earnings per share 
were 1.5% lower but 11.0% higher before 
exceptional items (5.9% on a constant 
currency basis). Cash flow generation was 
strong offset by the cost of the acquisition. 
This performance and financial review 
covers the main highlights of the Group’s 
financial performance and position in 2017. 
Basis of preparation
The Group is presenting its results for  
the 52 week period ended 31 December  
2017, with comparative information for  
the 52 week period ended 1 January 2017. 
The financial statements of the Group are 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
as adopted by the European Union (EU).
2017 Financial performance
Volume and revenue
Volumes grew by 10.4% in the year 
including contributions from the Seachill 
acquisition and the Portugal joint venture 
as well as in Australia offset by lower 
volumes in Holland and Central Europe. 
Additional details of volume growth by 
business segment are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s summary. Revenue increased 
10.1% and by 5.7% on a constant 
currency basis boosted by higher raw 
material prices.
Operating profit and margin
Operating profit was £35.1m and £38.3m 
before exceptional items which was 
2.3% and 11.6% respectively above the 
previous year’s level (2016: £34.3m) 
and 7.0% higher on a constant currency 
basis. The operating profit margin in 2017 
was unchanged at 2.8% (2016: 2.8%), 
and the operating profit per kilogram of 
packed food sold was unchanged at 12.5p 
(2016: 12.5p).
Exceptional items and profits 
before exceptional items
Costs of £2.8m were incurred during 
the year in connection with the Seachill 
acquisition and amortisation of £0.4m 
was charged on acquired intangible assets. 
The Board uses profit before exceptional 
items to measure performance and 
considers this metric better reflects the 
performance of the business.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased to £0.9m 
(2016: £1.1m) reflecting lower borrowings 
prior to the Seachill acquisition with interest 
rates remaining at historically low levels. 
Interest cover in 2017 remained high 
increasing to 39 times (2016: 31 times).
Taxation
The taxation charge for the period was 
£7.2m (2016: £6.6m) representing 
an effective taxation rate of 21.0%. 
Excluding the exceptional items the 
effective rate was 19.3% compared 
with 19.7% in 2016 with the reduction 
mainly due to lower UK tax rates.
Net income
Net income, representing profit for the 
year attributable to owners of the parent, 
before exceptional items, of £28.0m 
(2016 £24.6m) was 13.7% higher than 
last year and 8.7% higher on a constant 
currency basis. Reported net income 
after exceptional items was £24.9m 
(2016: £24.6m). 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share before 
exceptional items of 37.4p (2016: 33.7p) 
was 11.0% higher than last year and 
5.9% higher on a constant currency basis. 
Reported basic earnings per share were 
33.2p (2016: 33.7p). Diluted earnings per 
share were 32.8p (2016: 33.2p).
Earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation
EBITDA, which is used by the Group as 
an indicator of cash generation, increased 
to £56.7m and £59.5m excluding the 
exceptional items which was 5.7% 
above last year at constant currency 
(2016: £54.0m) mainly reflecting the 
increase in operating profits together 
with higher depreciation charges.
Free cash flow and net cash position
Cash flow was strong in 2017 generating 
free cash flow before exceptional items, 
dividends, financing and cost of acquisition 
of £36.3m (2016: £26.7m) after capital 
expenditure of £11.9m. Free cash 
outflow was £47.3m after acquisition 
costs and exceptional items of £83.6m. 
Additionally £55.9m was raised through 
an equity placing. 
Group borrowings were £53.4m at the 
end of 2017 and, with net cash balances of 
£78.8m including the other financial asset 
comprising a treasury deposit, resulted in 
a closing net cash position of £25.4m, as 
compared with a net cash level of £32.3m 
at the end of 2016. At the end of 2017 
the Group had undrawn committed loan 
facilities under its new syndicated banking 
facilities of £160.0m (2016: £99.2m). 
Dividends
The Board aims to maintain a dividend 
policy that provides a dividend level 
that grows broadly in line with the 
underlying earnings of the Group and has 
recommended a final dividend of 14.0p 
per ordinary share in respect of 2017. 
This, together with the interim dividend of 
5.0p per ordinary share paid in December 
2017, represents an 11.1% increase in the 
full year dividend, as compared with last 
year. The final dividend, if approved by 
shareholders, will be paid on 29 June 2018 
to shareholders on the register on 1 June 
2018 and the shares will be ex dividend on 
31 May 2018.
Treasury management
Hilton does not engage in any speculative 
trading in financial instruments and 
transacts only in relation to its underlying 
business requirements. The Group’s 
policy is designed to ensure adequate 
financial resources are made available as 
required for the continuing development 
and growth of its businesses, whilst taking 
practical steps to reduce exposures to 
foreign exchange, interest rate fluctuation, 
credit, pricing and liquidity risks, as 
described below.
Foreign exchange rate movements 
and country specific risks
Whilst the presentational currency of the 
Group is Sterling, most of its earnings are 
generated in other currencies, principally 
the Euro, Swedish Krona, Danish Krone 
and Australian Dollar. The earnings of 
the Group’s overseas subsidiaries are 
translated into Sterling at the average 
exchange rates for the year and their 
assets and liabilities at the year end 
closing rates. Changes in relevant currency 
parities are monitored on a continuing 
basis, with the timing of the repatriation 
of overseas profits by dividend payments 
and the repayment of any intra group 
loans to UK holding companies paying due 
regard to actual and forecast exchange 
rate movements.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Treasury management continued
The Group has to date decided not to 
hedge its foreign exchange rate exposures, 
but this policy is kept under continuing 
review and may be reappraised over 
time as the Group’s geographic spread 
continues to widen. The Group’s overseas 
subsidiaries all have natural hedges in 
place as they, for the most part, buy raw 
materials, employ people, source services, 
sell products and arrange funding in their 
local currencies. As a result the Group’s 
exposure is in the main limited to its equity 
investment in each overseas subsidiary 
and its joint venture, and in the translation 
of overseas earnings.
The level of country specific risk currently 
remains material for many businesses,  
in terms of the impact of macroeconomic 
developments, including the impact of 
austerity programmes and commodity 
price movements in some countries. 
The Group sells high quality basic food 
products, for which there will always 
be continuing demand, to successful 
blue chip multiple retailers in developed 
countries. Hilton has not to date been 
materially adversely affected by the 
lengthy recessionary environments seen 
in some countries, but will keep any future 
identified country specific risks under 
continuing review.
Interest rate fluctuation risk
This risk stems from the fact that the 
interest rates on the Group’s borrowings 
are variable, being at set margins over 
LIBOR and other interbank rates which 
fluctuate over time. The Board’s policy is 
to have an interest rate cap on a proportion 
of this borrowing. The Board will review 
hedging costs and options should the 
current low interest rate environment 
change materially.
Customer credit and pricing risks
As Hilton’s customers comprise a small 
number of successful and credit worthy 
major multiple retailers, the level of credit 
risk is considered to be insignificant. 
Historically the incidence of bad debts 
has been immaterial. Hilton’s pricing is 
based predominately either on cost plus 
agreements or agreed packing rates with 
its customers.
Liquidity risk
This has for many businesses represented 
an area of concern over recent years, 
given the continuing difficult and uncertain 
economic environment in some countries. 
Hilton Food Group remains strongly cash 
generative, has a robust balance sheet 
and has committed banking facilities for 
the medium term, sufficient to support 
its existing business. All bank positions 
are monitored on a daily basis and capital 
expenditure above set levels, together with 
decisions on intra group dividends, are all 
approved at Board meetings. All long term 
debt is arranged centrally and is subject  
to Board approval.
Going concern statement
The Directors have performed a detailed 
assessment, including a review of the 
Group’s budget for the 2018 financial 
year and its longer term plans, including 
consideration of the principal risks faced 
by the Group. Following this review, the 
Directors are satisfied that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue to operate and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due for the foreseeable 
future, a period considered to be at least 
12 months from the date of signing these 
financial statements. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
for preparing the financial statements. 
The Group’s bank borrowings are detailed 
in the financial statements and the 
principal banking facilities, which support 
the Group’s existing and contracted new 
business, are committed. The Group 
is in full compliance with all its banking 
covenants and based on forecasts is 
expected to remain in compliance. 
Future geographical expansion which is 
not yet contracted, and which is not built 
into our internal budgets and forecasts, 
may require additional or extended banking 
facilities and such future geographical 
expansion will depend on our ability 
to negotiate appropriate additional or 
extended facilities, as and when they 
are required.
The Group’s internal budgets and 
forward forecasts, which incorporate all 
reasonably foreseeable changes in trading 
performance, are regularly reviewed in 
detail by the Board and show that it will be 
able to operate within its current banking 
facilities, taking into account available cash 
balances, for the foreseeable future. 
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for 
the three years ending in December 2020. 
A period of three years has been chosen 
for the purpose of this viability statement 
as it is aligned with the Group’s three year 
plan, which is based on the Group’s current 
customers and does not incorporate the 
benefits from any potential new contract 
gains over this period.
The Directors’ assessment has been made 
with reference to the Group’s current 
position and strategy taking into account 
the Group’s principal risks and how these 
are managed. The strategy and associated 
principal risks, which the Directors review 
at least annually, are incorporated in the 
three year plan and such related scenario 
testing as is required. The three year plan 
makes reasoned assumptions in relation  
to volume growth based on the position  
of our customers and expected changes in 
the macroeconomic environment and retail 
market conditions, expected changes in 
raw material meat and fish, packaging and 
other costs, together with the anticipated 
level of capital investment required to 
maintain our facilities at state of the art 
levels. The achievement of the three  
year plan is not dependent on any new  
or expanded financing facilities.
Forward looking statements
This Strategic report contains forward 
looking statements that are inevitably 
subject to risk factors associated with, 
amongst other things, economic, political 
and business developments which 
may occur from time to time across the 
countries in which the Group operates. It is 
believed that the expectations reflected in 
these statements are reasonable based on 
current knowledge, but all forward looking 
statements and forecasts are inherently 
predictive, speculative and involve risk and 
uncertainty, simply because they relate to 
events and depend on circumstances that 
will occur in the future.

Strategic report
Performance and financial review
continued Not all the risks listed are within the 
Group’s control and others may be 
unknown or currently considered 
immaterial, but could turn out to be 
material in the future. These risks, together 
with our risk mitigation strategies, should 
be considered in the context of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
framework, details of which are set out 
in the Corporate governance statement. 
It must be recognised that systems of 
internal control are designed to manage 
rather than completely eliminate any 
identified risks.
The most significant risks 
the Group faces
The most significant business risks that 
the Group faces have changed little as 
might be expected with an unchanged and 
relatively straightforward business model. 
These risks, which will continue to affect 
the Group’s businesses, together with the 
measures we have adopted to mitigate 
these risks, are outlined in the table on 
pages 22 to 24. This is not intended to 
constitute an exhaustive analysis of all risks 
faced by the Group, but rather to highlight 
those which are the most significant, as 
viewed from the standpoint of the Group 
as a whole.
Risks and risk management
In accordance with provision C.2.1 of 
the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code the Directors confirm 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the risks facing the Group 
that might impede the achievement of 
its strategic and operational objectives 
as well as might affect performance or 
cash position As a leading food processor 
in a fast moving environment it is critical 
that the Group identifies, assesses 
and prioritises its risks. The result of 
this assessment is a statement of the 
principal risks facing the Group together 
with a description of the main controls 
and mitigations that reduce the effect of 
those risks were they to crystalise. This, 
together with the adoption of appropriate 
mitigation actions, enables us to monitor, 
minimise and control both the probability 
and potential impact of these risks.
How we manage risk
Responsibility for risk management across 
the Group, including the appropriate 
identification of risks and the effective 
application of actions designed to mitigate 
those risks, resides with the Board 
which believes that a successful risk 
management framework carefully balances 
risk and reward, and applies reasoned 
judgement and consideration of potential 
likelihood and impact in determining 
its principal risks. The Group takes a 
proactive approach to risk management 
with well-developed structures and 
a range of processes for identifying, 
assessing, prioritising and mitigating its 
key risks, as the delivery of our strategy 
depends on our ability to make sound risk 
informed decisions. 
Risk management process 
and risk appetite
The Board believes that in carrying out the 
Group’s businesses it is vital to strike the 
right balance between an appropriate and 
comprehensive control environment and 
encouraging the level of entrepreneurial 
freedom of action required to seek out and 
develop new business opportunities; but, 
however skilfully this balance between 
risk and reward is struck, the business will 
always be subject to a number of risks and 
uncertainties, as outlined below.
All types of risk applicable to the business 
are regularly reviewed and a formal risk 
assessment is carried out to highlight key 
risks to the business and to determine 
actions that can reasonably and cost 
effectively be taken to mitigate them. 
The Group’s Risk Register is compiled 
through combining the set of business 
unit risk registers supplemented by 
formal interviews with senior executives 
and Directors of the Group. The Group 
has a Risk Management Committee 
which reports regularly to the Board on 
the substance of the risk assessment 
and any changes to the nature of those 
risks or changes to the likelihood or 
materiality of the risk in question. The Risk 
Management Committee also reviews 
progress in control development and 
implementation of those key controls 
related to principal risks listed in this 
section of the report. Group Internal 
Audit derives its risk based assurance 
plan on the controls after considering 
the Risk Assessment and reports its 
findings to the Audit Committee. The Risk 
Management Committee also oversees 
the scenario based business continuity 
management exercises.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Risk management and principal risks Description of risk The Group is dependent on a small number of customers who can exercise 
significant buying power and influence when it comes to contractual renewal 
terms at 5 to 10 year intervals.
Its potential impact The Group has a relatively narrow, but expanding, customer base, with sales to 
subsidiary or associated companies of the Tesco and Ahold groups still comprising 
the larger part of Hilton’s revenue. The larger retail chains have over many years 
increased their market share of meat products in many countries, as customers 
continue to move away from high street butchers towards one stop convenience 
shopping in supermarkets. This has increased the buying power of the Group’s 
customers which in turn increases their negotiating power with the Group, which 
could enable them to seek better terms over time.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group is progressively widening its customer base and its maintained high level 
of investment in state of the art facilities, which together with management’s continuous 
focus on reducing costs, allow it to operate very efficiently at very high throughputs 
and price its products competitively. Hilton operates a decentralised, entrepreneurial 
business structure, which enables it to work very closely and flexibly with its retail 
partners in each country, in order to achieve high service levels in terms of orders 
delivered, delivery times, compliance with product specifications and accuracy of 
documentation, all backed by an uncompromising focus on food safety, product 
integrity and traceability assurance. Hilton has long term supply agreements in place 
with its major customers, with pricing either on a cost plus or agreed packing rate basis.
Description of risk The Group’s growth potential is dependent on the success of its customers 
and the growth of their packed meat and fish sales.
Its potential impact The Group’s products predominantly carry the brand labels of the customer to whom 
packed meat and fish is supplied and it is accordingly dependent on its customers’ 
success in maintaining or improving consumer perception of their own brand names 
and packed meat and fish offerings.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group plays a very proactive role in enhancing its customers’ brand values, 
through providing high quality, competitively priced products, high service levels, 
continuing product and packaging innovation and category management support. 
It recognises that quality and traceability assurance are integral to its customers’ 
brands and works closely with its customers to ensure rigorous quality assurance 
standards are met. It is continuously measured by its customers across a very 
wide range of parameters, including delivery time, product specification, product 
traceability and accuracy of documentation and targets demanding service levels 
across all these parameters. The Group works closely with its customers to identify 
continuing improvement opportunities across the supply chain, including enhancing 
product presentation, extending shelf life and reducing wastage at every stage in 
the supply chain.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Strategic report
Risk management and principal risks
continued Description of risk The progress of the Group’s business is dependent on the macroeconomic 
environment and levels of consumer spending in the countries in which it operates.
Its potential impact No business is immune to difficult economic climates and the consequent pressure 
on levels of consumer spending, such as those seen over recent years across Europe.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
With a sound business model, strong retail partners and a single minded focus on 
minimising unit packing costs, whilst maintaining high levels of product quality and 
integrity, the Group has made continued progress over recent difficult economic 
periods. It expects to be able to continue to make progress.
Description of risk Under growth conditions the Group’s business is reliant on a small number of key 
personnel and its ability to manage growth and change successfully. This risk has 
increased with the Group’s continued expansion with new customers and into 
new territories with potentially greater reliance on skilled resource and execution 
of simultaneous growth projects.
Its potential impact The Group is critically dependent on the skills and experience of a small number of 
senior managers and specialists and as the business develops and expands, the Group’s 
success will inevitably depend on its ability to attract and retain the necessary calibre 
of personnel for key positions, both for managing and growing its existing businesses 
and setting up new ones.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
To continue to manage an increased rate of growth successfully, the Group carefully 
manages its skilled resources including succession planning and maintaining a talent 
pipeline. The Group is evolving its people capability in line with the geographical 
expansion and product range. In particular it recognises that the span of management 
responsibility needs to be balanced with an appropriate management structure within 
the overall organisation. Hilton continues to invest in on-the-job training and career 
development, together with the cost effective management of quality information and 
control systems, whilst recruiting high quality new employees, as required, to facilitate 
the Group’s ongoing growth and in deploying resource to support the growth projects 
appropriately. The continuing growth of Hilton’s business, together with its growing 
reputation, is facilitating the recruitment of more top class specialists with the key 
skill sets required both to support our existing individual country business units and 
manage the Group’s future geographical expansion. Resources are being put in place 
and structures reviewed to enhance project management control and oversight. Control 
systems embedded in project management enable the risks of growth to be appropriately 
highlighted and managed.
Description of risk The Group’s business is dependent on maintaining a wide and flexible global 
food supply base operating at standards that can continuously achieve the 
specifications set by Hilton and its customers.
Its potential impact The Group is reliant on its suppliers to provide sufficient volume of products, to 
the agreed specifications, in the very short lead times required by its customers, 
with efficient supply chain management being a key business attribute. The Group 
sources certain of its meat and fish requirements globally. Tariffs, quotas or trade 
barriers imposed by countries where the Group procures meat, or which they may 
impose in the future, together with the progress of World Trade Organisation talks 
and other global trade developments, could materially affect the Group’s international 
procurement ability but has not done so in recent years.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group maintains a flexible global food supply base, which is progressively 
widening as it expands and is continuously audited to ensure standards are maintained, 
so as to have in place a wide range of options should supply disruptions occur.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Description of risk Outbreaks of disease and feed contamination affecting livestock and fish and 
media concerns relating to these and instances of product adulteration can 
impact the Group’s sales.
Its potential impact Reports in the public domain concerning the risks of consuming certain foods can  
cause consumer demand to drop significantly in the short to medium term. A food scare 
similar to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”) scare that took place in 1996 
or the much more recent concerns with regard to meat substitution can affect public 
confidence in our products.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group sources its meat and fish from a trusted raw material supply base, all 
components of which meet stringent national, international and customer standards. 
The Group is subject to demanding standards which are independently monitored in 
every country and reliable product traceability and high welfare standards from the 
farm to the consumer are integral to the Group’s business model. The Group ensures 
full traceability from source to packed product across all suppliers.
Description of risk Significant incidents such as fire, flood or interruption of supply of key utilities 
could impact the Group’s business continuity.
Its potential impact Such incidents could result in systems or manufacturing process stoppages with 
consequent disruption and loss of efficiency which could impact the Group’s sales.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group has robust business continuity plans in place including sister site support 
protocols enabling other sites to step in with manufacturing and distribution of key 
product lines where necessary. Continuity management systems and plans are suitably 
maintained and adequately tested including building risk assessments and emergency 
power solutions. There are appropriate insurance arrangements in place to mitigate 
against any associated financial loss.
Description of risk The Group’s IT systems could be subject to cyber attacks including fraudulent 
external email activity. These kinds of attacks are generally increasing in 
frequency and sophistication.
Its potential impact The Group’s operations are underpinned by a variety of IT systems. Loss or disruption 
to those IT systems or extended times to recover data or functionality could impact 
the Group’s ability to effectively operate its facilities and affect its sales and reputation.
Risk mitigation measures 
and strategies adopted
The Group has a robust IT control framework which is tested frequently by internal 
staff and by specialist external bodies. This framework is established as the key control 
to mitigate cyber risk and is applied consistently throughout the Group. The increased 
prominence of IT risk is mitigated by investments in IT infrastructure and now forms a 
regular part of the Group Risk Management Committee agenda and presentations to 
the Board. In accordance with Group strategy IT risk is considered when looking at new 
ventures and control measures implemented in new sites follow the Group common 
standards. There is internal training and resources available with emphasis on prevention, 
user awareness and recovery. Increasingly, IT forms part of site business continuity 
exercises which test and help develop the capacity to respond to possible crises or 
incidents. The technical infrastructure to prevent attacks and the resilience to recover 
are continuously developed to meet emerging threats. IT systems including financial 
and banking systems are configured to prevent fraudulent payments.

compliance to microbiological standards 
and compliance to agreed quality

DNA testing. Results are used to assess 
the performance of suppliers and achieve 
continuous improvement.
Retail packing at Hilton
The key factors in ensuring that our 
retail partners receive products that 
consistently achieve agreed shelf lives 
and meet customer expectations are top 
quality ingredients from our suppliers, 
temperature control and high class 
standards of hygiene. We are proud of 
our modern specialised processing and 
packing facilities which use state of the 
art production equipment, including a high 
degree of automation and use of robotic 
equipment which minimises handling. 
Our well trained production operatives are 
responsible for the quality of Hilton’s retail 
partners’ products and they are supported 
by highly qualified and experienced quality 
assurance and technical teams at each 
site. Hilton maintains annual third party 
accreditation through FSSC (Food Safety 
System Certification) using ISO 22000 
and ISO/TS 22002-1 or the latest BRC 
Global Standard for Food Safety and 
additionally our retail customers make 
frequent visits to our sites, some of which 
are unannounced. This level of attention 
is a valuable part of our partnership with 
our retail customers and gives consumers 
confidence that Hilton can consistently 
meet their expectations.
Temperature control throughout our 
storage and production departments is 
fundamental to the quality of our products 
and this is centrally controlled with 
alarm alerts if there is any deviation from 
specified temperature requirements.
Specialised highly trained hygiene teams 
deep clean our factories every day using 
the latest technology and these clearly 
specified procedures are verified using 
not only trained auditors but also the latest 
monitoring equipment. All staff and visitors 
can only enter Hilton production facilities 
wearing specified personal protective 
clothing and by passing through barrier 
protected hand washing and sanitising 
facilities. The effectiveness of these 
entrance procedures is routinely verified 
using hand swabbing checks.
We maintain strong links with academia 
and technological advances, working 
Hilton Food Group recognises its social, 
ethical and environmental responsibilities 
arising from its operations and to the 
welfare of employees, customers, 
suppliers and the communities in which 
we operate. The Group is committed to 
working in an ethical, open and honest 
manner to produce products of the highest 
quality responsibly and sustainably. 
The philosophies which underpin our 
policies for the environment, regulatory 
compliance, health and safety, product 
quality and integrity and ethical conduct 
are summarised below.
Complete food assurance 
from farm to fork
It is essential that consumers have 
complete confidence in the products 
they purchase. It is necessary that all 
parties in the supply chain work together 
collaboratively to ensure high welfare 
standards for animals from breeding and 
rearing to transportation and slaughter. 
This teamwork including oversight of farm, 
fishing and abattoir standards ensures 
that the products we produce are of the 
highest quality. We recognise that correct 
product label information is key to gaining 
consumer trust and that the label correctly 
describes the provenance of the product 
including its species and country of origin.
Hilton strives, in partnership with our retail 
customers, to successfully deliver safe, 
consistently high quality, convenient and 
ready to use products that ensure the 
highest level of consumer satisfaction. 
Our products are governed by EU and 
international legislation and food safety 
standards throughout the supply chain. 
Additionally our retail partners, who 
support the Global Food Safety Initiative, 
demand the best animal welfare standards, 
food factory standards and quality systems 
to enhance their levels of brand integrity.
A short and transparent supply 
chain with full traceability
Hilton is committed to ensuring that the 
supply chain in which we play a significant 
part is as short as possible. Our quality 
systems provide full traceability of all the 
raw materials that we use.
Flexible local and global sourcing
As a specialist food business, Hilton 
sources its meat and fish from the 
most advanced suppliers to exacting 
specifications, ensuring quality and 
cost effectiveness. 
Science and technology play a large part 
in the consistent achievement of product 
quality and influence Hilton’s procurement 
from large and small suppliers. Together 
with our retail partners we ensure that 
consumers have the best choice and can 
select on the basis of provenance, quality 
and price. 
Supplier standards
The standards in our supply base 
contribute significantly to the achievement 
of consistent quality and Hilton works 
closely with our retail partners to set 
best in class specifications for our 
products. Meat is matured and boned 
according to clear and enforced primal 
specifications that are agreed between 
Hilton, its retail customers and abattoir 
suppliers. Hilton develops long term 
trading partnerships with our suppliers 
by facilitating achievement of our retail 
customer requirements through auditing 
by third party experts and development of 
sustainable corrective action plans where 
any non-conformances are identified. 
We support our suppliers in applying 
standards covering factory structure, 
animal welfare standards, control of 
contamination through cleaning and 
disinfection, temperature controls, product 
and packing standards and traceability. 
Auditing as a means of challenging 
standards is now expected by consumers 
together with well established procedures 
throughout the food chain.
In our fish processing business we run a 
Quality Naturally programme which has as 
its framework three pillars: Sustainability – 
ensuring there are enough fish in the sea 
for future generations; Ethics – respecting 
people who work in our supply chains 
and factories and ensuring good welfare 
and working conditions; Authenticity – 
transparency and trust in our supply chain 
to assure to our customers that we sell 
what it says on the label.
Where possible wild catch species are 
independently certified to the Marine 
Stewardship Council’s standard for a well-
managed and sustainable fishery. We are 
members of the Sustainable Seafood 
Coalition and Sustainable Fisheries 
Partnership. Aquaculture species are 
independently certified to the Global GAP 
standard for good aquaculture practice or 
to the Aquaculture Stewardship Council’s 
standard for responsibly farmed seafood.

Partnerships for growth
We forge partnerships across all aspects 
of our supply chain to enable us to 
strengthen our position as one of the 
leading global Business to Business 
food companies. Our core competency 
has always been building strong and 
productive partnerships with our retail 
customers in each geographical zone 
we are active in to supply high quality 
products at the right price to meet their 
demands. However, in an ever-changing 
business environment, the requirements 
of a true partnership go beyond the supply 
and demand approach. Our focus is to 
provide a unique, unrivalled service to our 
customers to support their market growth 
aspirations. We work closely with each 
of our customers to identify, both global 
and local, market trends which will help 
us create the next generation of products 
that will meet the everyday needs of their 
consumers. We have established two 
culinary innovation centres fully equipped 
with state of the art culinary equipment 
and staffed by some of the leading 
industry chefs and food technologists. 
The ambience of our culinary innovation 
centres has been designed to create an 
open and stimulating environment in  
which creativity can flourish.
There is nothing like good food to bring 
people together so it is in our culinary 
innovation centres that we discuss and 
share concepts with our customers. 
Cooking, tasting and then making those 
all-important final tweaks to create the 
perfect concept. Our skilled chefs and 
technologists then set to work on the 
scale-up process taking the concepts 
from the kitchen pan to industrial products 
that can be consistently produced, on an 
industrial scale, maintaining organoleptic 
quality, product integrity and operational 
efficiency throughout the supply chain to 
meet all of our customers’ expectations. 
With these facilities we deliver exciting, 
innovative and delicious product range 
extensions, seasonal product ranges and 
market leading innovative new products.
We have established partnerships with 
key suppliers whose core capability is the 
development of innovative ingredients. 
By working closely in partnership with 
our suppliers we can combine our 
extensive, in-depth understanding of food 
production on an industrial scale with their 
expertise to develop a delicious portfolio 
of innovative products designed to match 
consumer expectations. 
In parallel to our ingredient partnerships 
we also realise the value of building 
stronger alliances with key suppliers of 
the processing equipment that is required 
to deliver the large volumes of products 
that leave our manufacturing sites every 
day. Technology is changing at an ever 
increasing rate across the food industry 
resulting in new and exciting equipment 
entering the market which can improve 
the efficiency of operations and deliver 
new and innovative products whilst 
continuing to enhance the stability and 
security of the products offered to the 
consumer. Rather than waiting for new 
technologies to arrive on the market we 
are working in close partnership with 
key equipment suppliers to develop 
equipment that specifically meets the 
needs of our operations. To facilitate this, 
we are creating a number of product 
focused centres of excellence which are 
the custodians of our internal technology 
know-how where we focus development 
programmes carried out in conjunction 
with our key partners. As well as being 
technology custodians the centres of 
excellence are responsible for the rapid 
roll out of successful innovations and 
developments across our businesses  
to ensure we consistently deliver 
operational excellence at each of  
our manufacturing sites.
Awards and innovation
Hilton takes great pride in its products 
and we are delighted when the quality 
and innovation of these products is 
recognised. During 2017 we received a 
number of national food and taste awards. 
New products launched included beef 
wellington, mini pizzas and bubbly batter 
cod fillets.
Environment
The Group takes all practicable steps 
to manage carefully its impact on the 
natural environment. Improvements to 
our environmental performance can 
make a difference to society and we are 
committed to assessing the impacts of 
our operations on land, water, air and 
biodiversity, and to managing our waste, 
in all its forms, by reusing or recycling it, 
where practicable.
In the context of the total carbon footprint 
of retail packed meat the proportion which 
can be influenced by Group’s packing 
activity is very small indeed as the Group 
is not involved in the breeding, growing 
and slaughtering of animals and the 
packaging formats used for its products 
are selected by our customers. The Group 
is nevertheless committed, working 
closely with its customers, to minimising 
its environmental impact.
Regulatory compliance
The Group is in full compliance with 
all environmental regulations, permits 
and consent limits which apply to each 
of its packing plants in each country of 
operation and views such compliance 
as a high priority, looking to make 
continuing improvements with respect 
to the environment in all its operations 
whilst ensuring that we manage our 
environmental performance in accordance 
with evolving legal and regulatory 
requirements and international standards.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Strategic report
Corporate and social responsibility report
continued Through the extensive use of state  
of the art packaging including skinpack 
technology our products benefit 
from an extended shelf life thereby 
reducing food waste. This benefit 
offsets the environmental impact of the 
packaging materials and energy used in 
its manufacture. 
Hilton is also closely aligned with our 
customers in our desire to minimise the 
environmental impact of our operations. 
We are therefore developing partnerships 
with our key suppliers of packaging 
materials as part of our sustainability 
agenda. We are conscious of the 
potential impact the use of plastic has 
on the environment. We are therefore 
working with our key suppliers in three 
work streams. Firstly we are striving to 
maximise the use of recyclable trays 
across the Group and have started to 
move to the use of recyclable trays in our 
production. The second work stream is 
focusing on the use of recycled plastic 
in product trays that we purchase uses 
significantly lower energy consumption 
in their manufacture. Finally we are 
continuously setting the industry standard 
for lighter product trays which therefore 
require less plastic. These trays are 
jointly developed and tested with our 
key packaging suppliers to ensure that 
although lighter they are still robust enough 
to maintain the required functionality and 
stability attributes.
Carbon footprint and 
greenhouse gases
The Group has complied with all the 
mandatory reporting requirements under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
The Group’s scope 1 and scope 2 carbon 
footprint has been calculated using data 
gathered through standardised reporting 
channels and Defra conversion factors. 
An appropriate ratio to express the Group’s 
annual emissions in relation to its activities 
by way of product volumes produced is 
given below.

Energy usage
Our processing and packing operations 
consume electricity, gas, water and 
industrial gases at all our sites and our 
management teams work to identify areas 
for further efficiency gains in terms of 
energy usage. The Group invests heavily 
in maintaining state of the art high speed 
packing facilities which progressively 
reduce energy costs per unit packed. 
Over time the development of packing 
technology means that any given volume 
of meat can be packed with fewer high 
speed lines. Performance on water usage 
is shown below:

Waste and packaging
It is estimated that 15 million tonnes of 
food is wasted each year in the UK of 
which 9 million tonnes is avoidable and 
we agree this is economically, socially 
and environmentally unacceptable. 
Although Hilton’s products are perishable 
having limited shelf life we continuously 
strive, working with our retail partners 
to ensure that waste is minimised and 
products are available for purchase and 
consumption for as long as possible  
before the end of their shelf life.
A degree of wastage is unavoidable in our 
businesses, as we have to ensure that 
our products continually meet stringent 
standards for quality and presentation. 
We work actively to reduce our usage 
of materials and the reduction of product 
and packaging waste has a very high 
priority across the Group. The yield losses 
incurred in processing and packing meat 
and packaging wastage are monitored 
continuously throughout each day across 
the entire product range, at every Hilton 
site. Performance on yields, being the 
percentage by which the weight of 
purchased raw material compares with 
that incorporated in finished packed 
products, is minimised by using cut-offs 
where possible.
We are delighted to be working with 
Tesco to tackle global food waste. 
This Champions 12.3 initiative is dedicated 
to accelerating progress towards achieving 
the UN Sustainable Development Target 
12.3 by 2030. This target aims to halve 
per capita global food waste at the retail 
and consumer level, and reduce food 
losses along production and supply chains 
by 2030.

Health and safety
One of Hilton’s top priorities is to achieve 
continual improvements in health 
and safety. The Group requires all its 
subsidiaries to achieve high health and 
safety standards within their individual 
operations. All subsidiaries conduct 
regular formal health and safety reviews. 
Managers and employees review policies, 
processes and procedures in order to 
ensure that risks are properly assessed, 
with appropriate actions taken in order to 
protect the safety of employees. At Board 
level Philip Heffer, Chief Operating Officer, 
has been assigned responsibility for health 
and safety and environmental matters 
across the Group’s operational sites. 
We monitor and review all incidents and 
accidents in the workplace so that we can 
take appropriate action to improve working 
conditions whilst remaining focused on 
reducing both the absolute number of 
accidents and the number of serious 
accidents. Formal reporting procedures 
are in place at every site so that the Group 
can monitor safety performance at a local 
level. There is a full time safety officer at 
each site who monitors the key measures 
for safety performance which include 
the number of serious and non-serious 
accidents and the number of working days 
lost through injury, together with short and 
long term sickness levels, key statistics 
in relation to which for 2017 are shown

Our people
We recognise that driving our future 
growth and development will continue to 
depend on our ability to attract, grow, train 
and retain the very best managers and staff 
and to build progressively stronger teams 
at each location. We believe that a key to 
our future success lies in the promotion 
of properly trained, knowledgeable and 
capable management from within our 
organisation together with the ongoing 
motivation of our teams in each country.
The Group provides equal opportunity 
for employment, training and career 
development and promotion regardless 
of age, sex, colour, race, religion, ethnic 
origin or other minority groupings. 
The Group encourages the employment 
of disabled people when suitable 
vacancies are available and wherever 
possible retrains employees who become 
disabled to enable them to do work 
consistent with their aptitudes and abilities. 
Where practicable a flexible approach is 
adopted to assist employees to manage a 
successful work/life balance.
Hilton operates to high standards of 
employment practice with policies to 
ensure that training, career development 
and promotion opportunities are available 
to all employees. The Group’s recruitment 
practices involve, where possible, 
internal promotions. Where there is not 
a suitable internal candidate, selection of 
suitable individuals for vacant positions 
is made using a combination of industry 
knowledge and contacts and the use of 
external recruitment agencies. All new 
senior employees including Directors are 
given tailored induction programmes. 
The Group’s succession planning is 
designed to highlight any forthcoming 
vacancies well in advance. Employees are 
able to participate directly in the success of 
the business by contributing to the Group’s 
Sharesave scheme.
The Group has ethnically diverse 
workforces who at each location receive 
the same terms and conditions for 
comparable jobs. Given the geographical 
spread of the Group’s operations it is 
both inappropriate and impractical to 
apply standard employee consultation 
and communication procedures 
across the Group. Each subsidiary is 
accordingly responsible for achieving 
and maintaining appropriate consultation 
and communication with its employees 
which include at all production sites joint 
management and employee committee 
meetings on health and safety and 
meetings with employees and union 
representatives to discuss issues 
affecting them.

Trading relationships with 
partners and suppliers
Strong and fair long term relationships with 
partners and suppliers are very important 
for Hilton. The Group’s approach to 
corporate social responsibility is reflected 
in the way we behave with our suppliers 
which is open, consistent and honest. 
In the UK the Group follows the Better 
Payment Practice Code which requires a 
company to agree the terms of payment 
with its suppliers, to ensure its suppliers 
are aware of those terms and to abide by 
them. The Group policy is also to apply  
the requirements of the Code in each  
of its subsidiaries.
Ethical standards
Hilton is committed to integrity. 
Ethical standards are very important 
in relation to the way we conduct our 
businesses and all the Group’s employees 
are expected to behave ethically in their 
work and adhere to the Group’s ethical 
standards. As an international group of 
companies we are fully aware of the 
broad spread of our responsibilities in all 
the countries in which we operate from 
protecting the environment to safeguarding 
the health and safety of our employees, 
respecting human rights, ensuring honesty, 
integrity and fairness in all our business 
dealings and operating our businesses  
in a safe and responsible manner.
Anti-bribery and corruption
A whistle-blowing policy is in place 
in accordance with which staff can in 
confidence raise any concerns about any 
actual or potential improprieties in relation 
to matters of financial reporting or any 
other aspect of the Group’s businesses. 
The Group has also implemented an  
anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy  
to comply with the Bribery Act 2010.
Modern slavery
We aim to ensure that the way we run  
our business prevents and deters any form 
of modern slavery and human trafficking 
from occurring anywhere in our business 
and supply chain. Hilton is dedicated to 
maintaining a fair and ethical workplace 
for all of our staff, and prohibits the use 
of all forms of forced labour and human 
trafficking. We have introduced a Modern 
Slavery Policy within the Group to ensure 
that slavery and human trafficking is not 
taking place in any part of our business  
or our supply chains.
We work to identify, assess and monitor 
any potential areas of risk in relation to our 
business and supply chains, and carry out 
regular quality audits of our meat suppliers. 
We also train relevant employees in the 
steps to be taken in the event of any 
modern slavery specific concerns.
Tax strategy
Hilton is committed to paying the right 
amount of tax at the right time and 
complying with all relevant laws and 
regulations. With a low risk appetite we 
have a simple corporate structure based 
around our commercial operations. 
We do not engage in planning schemes 
or arrangements that could be considered 
aggressive or artificial in nature. Tax forms 
part of Hilton’s policy whereby risks are 
assessed and appropriately managed.
Community
Supporting our local communities
Hilton’s policy is to recruit locally based 
employees wherever possible in order 
to benefit the communities within which 
our plants are located. Hilton aims to 
play a positive role in all the communities 
in which it operates and we encourage 
employees to become involved with and 
support the local communities around our 
sites. We recognise the social impacts of 
our business and believe in consultation 
with local communities about our activities 
and about the safety and environmental 
impact of our operations. 
During 2017, Hilton made charitable 
donations amounting to £60,000 
(2016: £67,000) comprising small but 
regular donations made to local institutions 
and sponsorship of personal charitable 
initiatives and to cultural and healthy 
lifestyle events. Additionally we donate 
surplus meat to food banks.
We established the Hilton Food Group 
Charitable Trust during the year to support 
nominated charitable causes through 
corporate events and also held our first 
charitable golf day raising funds of £67,000 
for East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices and 
The Cure Parkinson’s Trust.
The Group seeks to be a good neighbour 
in all its locations. We are committed to 
social responsibility and believe that the 
success of our businesses will reflect the 
quality of the relationships we build with 
our communities and legitimate public 
interest groups.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board has prepared this report with 
reference to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in April 2016 which applies to 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
17 June 2016. The provisions of this Code 
can be obtained from www.frc.org.uk/
corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
This statement including the Board 
Committee reports and the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 42 to 
54 detail how the Board applies the 
principles of good governance and best 
practice as set out in this UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Directors consider that the 
Company has during 2017 complied 
with the ten requirements of this Code, 
taking into account the provisions for 
smaller companies. 
The Board
Membership
At the date of this report the Board 
consists of three Executive Directors and 
three Non-Executive Directors whose 
names, responsibilities, brief biographies 
and membership of Board Committees are 
set out on pages 32 and 33. The Directors 
bring strong judgement and expertise to 
the Board’s deliberations and the Board is 
of sufficient size and diversity to achieve 
the balance of skills and experience 
appropriate for the requirements of 
the business. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors include the 
Non-Executive Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director. With the exception 
of the Non-Executive Chairman, who 
is presumed under the Code not to be 
independent following his appointment, 
the Board considers the Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent.  
The Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Group’s pension 
arrangements or in any of the Group’s 
bonus or share option schemes. There is 
a clear written division of responsibilities 
between the Non-Executive Chairman 
and the Chief Executive which has been 
agreed by the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors met 
once during the year to scrutinise 
the performance of the Executive 
management. A further meeting was 
held without the Non-Executive Chairman 
present to assess his performance.
Senior Independent Director
John Worby, the Senior Independent 
Director, is available to shareholders as an 
alternative to the Non-Executive Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
He ensures that he is available to meet 
shareholders, as required, and reports  
any relevant findings to the Board.
Rotation of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association 
provide that one third of the Directors retire 
by rotation at each Annual General Meeting 
and that all new Directors are subject to 
reappointment by shareholders at the first 
opportunity following their appointment. 
Accordingly, Philip Heffer and John Worby 
retire in accordance with the Articles of 
Association at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting and, being eligible,  
each offers himself for re-election.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, the 
Group’s Directors have an obligation to 
avoid any situation where they have a 
conflict of interests. The Group has in 
place procedures that require all Directors 
to notify the Group of any conflicts of 
interest and, for any such conflicts of 
interest to be authorised by non-interested 
Directors, provided the Company’s Articles 
allow for this. During the current financial 
year the Group were not advised of, nor 
did the Group identify, any such conflicts 
of interest.
Information and support provided 
to Board members
Members of the Board and its Committees 
are given appropriate documentation in 
advance of each Board and Committee 
meeting. For regular Board meetings these 
include a detailed period report on current 
and forecast trading, with comparisons 
against both budget and prior years. For all 
meetings appropriate explanatory papers 
are circulated well in advance on matters 
which the Board or Committee will be 
required to approve or provide responses.
The Board operates both formally through 
Board and Committee meetings and 
informally through regular contact between 
Directors. To assist them in carrying out 
their responsibilities the Directors have, 
in addition to full and timely access to all 
relevant information from management in 
advance of Board meetings, the right to 
obtain independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense and the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary 
to enable them to perform their duties 
as Directors. The Company Secretary 
is responsible to the Board, through the 
Chairman, for all governance matters. 
The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is determined by  
the Board as a whole.
Board responsibilities
The Board is collectively responsible for 
promoting the success of the Group, 
within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls that enable risk to be 
assessed and appropriately managed. 
It is responsible for setting and approving 
the strategy and key policies of the Group 
and monitoring the progress towards 
achieving these objectives. The Board 
aims to enhance shareholder value by 
providing entrepreneurial leadership for 
the Group, whilst simultaneously ensuring 
the appropriate framework of checks and 
balances are maintained in place.
The Board has specific powers reserved 
to it contained in a schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board 
which include:
 – acquisitions and disposals;
 – major trading agreements;
 – major capital expenditure projects;
 – dividends;
 – treasury and risk management policies;
 – approval of budgets, half-yearly 
and annual accounts and interim 
management statements; and
 – the giving of any guarantees or letters 
of comfort.
The Board meets not less than eight 
times a year to direct and control the 
strategy and operating performance of the 
Group. The Board also has responsibility 
for setting policy and monitoring from 
time to time such matters as financial 
and risk control, health and safety policy,

the Executive Directors responsibility for 
the execution of the agreed strategy and 
budget and the day-to-day management

Governance
Corporate governance statement Risk management 
and internal control
The Board of Directors has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s systems 
of internal control including financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and risk management which operate to 
safeguard the shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets and for reviewing 
their continuing effectiveness. Such an 
internal control system can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss 
as it is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk and failure to meet 
business objectives. 
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity, which 
are summarised in the Risk management 
section on pages 21 to 24.
The Group operates within a clearly 
defined organisational structure with 
established responsibilities, authorities 
and reporting lines to the Board. 
The organisational structure is designed 
to plan, execute, monitor and control the 
Group’s objectives effectively and ensure 
internal control becomes integral to all the 
Group’s operations. The Board confirms 
that the Group’s internal risk based control 
systems have been fully operative up 
to the date of the Annual report being 
approved, key ongoing processes and 
features of which are set out below:
 – appropriate mechanisms to identify  
and evaluate business risk;
 – a Group internal audit function which is 
involved in the review and testing of the 
internal control systems and of key risks 
across the Group in accordance with  
an annual programme agreed with  
the Audit Committee;
 – a strong control environment;
 – an information and communication 
process; and
 – a monitoring system and regular Board 
reviews for effectiveness.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to the following 
Board Committees:
 – Audit Committee;
 – Remuneration Committee;
 – Nomination Committee; and
 – Risk Management Committee.
Each Board Committee operates under 
clearly defined terms of reference and 
report regularly to the Board. These terms 
of reference are reviewed on a regular 
basis with any revisions proposed to the 
Board for its approval. The Board ensures 
that each Committee has sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties 
including access to the Company Secretary 
and external advisors as appropriate.
Reports for the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees are included on 
pages 39 to 54. 
The Risk Management Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Financial Officer 
and includes representatives from across 
the business. The Committee meets 
at least six times per year and seeks to 
focus and co-ordinate risk management 
activities throughout the Group in order 
to facilitate the identification, evaluation 
and management of key business 
risks. Its work is overseen by the Audit 
Committee and reports to the Board.

Performance evaluation
The Non-Executive Chairman leads a 
formal annual performance evaluation of 
the Board and its standing Committees 
and meets with the Non-Executive 
Directors at least once a year to convey 
his conclusions. During 2017 an internal 
evaluation process involved each Director 
completing a detailed written questionnaire 
including the opportunity to comment 
on any issue not directly covered by 
the questionnaire. The responses were 
analysed and considered by the Board 
who have concluded that the Directors, 
the Board and its standing Committees 
continue to perform effectively. The Non-
Executive Directors met once during 
the year without the Non-Executive 
Chairman present in order to evaluate 
his performance. An external evaluation 
process was last conducted in 2011/12.
Shareholder communications
The Board promotes open communication 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly 
and have dialogue with institutional 
shareholders both to discuss the Group’s 
performance and prospects and to develop 
an understanding of their views which are 
relayed back to the Board. The Board’s 
current assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects are set out in the Strategic 
report on pages 6 to 29. Twice a year 
general presentations are given to analysts 
covering the annual and half year results. 
Additionally other reports and forecasts, 
together with relevant articles in the 
financial press, are circulated to the Board.
The other Executive Directors are available 
to meet the Company’s major shareholders 
if required and the Senior Independent 
Director is available to listen to the 
views of shareholders, should they have 
concerns which have not been previously 
resolved or which it was inappropriate to 
voice at prior meetings. All shareholders 
have the opportunity to ask questions at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting, 
which all Directors and the Chairmen of 
every Board Committee attend. In addition 
the Group’s website containing published 
information and press releases can be

Governance
Corporate governance statement
continued Monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements including 
significant judgements
The Committee reviewed the half and 
full year financial reports including 
the application of accounting policies, 
estimates and judgements in their 
preparation and, the clarity and 
completeness of the disclosures. 
The Committee also held discussions 
with management and the external 
auditors and reviewed supporting papers 
in respect of these matters.
The key areas of focus during the 
year were:
 – an assessment of the Group’s cost 
plus contracts in relation to IFRIC 4 to 
determine whether they contain a lease. 
As in previous years the Committee 
remains comfortable that there are no 
such implied lease arrangements.
 – a review of revenue recognised on the 
Group’s major contracts. The external 
auditors identified complex supplier 
arrangements as an area of audit focus 
and the Committee fully considered 
these issues, including a review of 
accruals in relation to these contracts at 
the year end. The Committee concurred 
with the accruals made. As Hilton’s 
contracts with its customers include 
pre-agreed and pre-defined revenue 
parameters, performance measures and 
targets there were no other significant 
estimates or judgements involved in 
relation to these contracts.
 – a review of the Seachill acquisition 
balance sheet fair value. The Committee 
paid particular attention to adjustments 
made to the balance sheet at the date of 
acquisition including the brand, customer 
relationship and other intangible assets. 
The Committee was satisfied that the 
adjustments made were reasonable, 
whilst recognising that they remained 
subject to further review within one year 
of the date of acquisition.
 – a review of accounting developments. 
The Committee considered the expected 
impact of new IFRS standards in relation 
to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and 
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition which 
are effective from 1 January 2018 and 
was satisfied with the assessment that 
there is no material change ahead of their 
implementation next year.

Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Report of the Audit Committee The Annual report and financial statements 
were, taken as a whole, considered to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group and Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee reviewed a paper prepared 
by the Chief Financial Officer relating to 
going concern and the Group’s longer term 
viability and concluded that the Group 
should be considered as a going concern. 
Thereafter the Committee recommended 
that the Board approve these financial 
reports for publication and that the letter 
of representation to the external auditors 
be signed.
Risk management and 
internal controls
During the year the Internal Auditor 
reported to the Committee on the internal 
audit work performed and on key focus 
areas for future work. The Committee 
noted the findings from the work done 
and agreed the internal audit plan for the 
year ahead.
The Committee reviewed the work 
done by the Risk Committee and the 
updated Risk Register and in the light 
of the work done, the Committee 
concluded that the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems were 
operating effectively.
A review of whistle-blowing showed 
that no concerns had been raised about 
possible wrongdoing in financial reporting 
or other matters.
External audit
The Committee oversees the relationship 
with, and the performance of, the 
external auditors. It is the Committee’s 
responsibility under its terms of reference 
to make recommendations to the Board 
on the appointment, reappointment or 
removal of external auditors.
Article 17 of EU Regulation 537/2014 
enacted into UK law sets the maximum 
duration for an audit firm to conduct 
the statutory audit of a public interest 
entity as 10 years although can be 
extended to up to 20 years where a public 
tendering process is conducted every 
10 years. The current external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), 
were appointed in 2007 and reappointed 
in 2016 following a public audit tender 
process. Their lead partner is rotated every 
five years to ensure continued objectivity 
and independence with the next rotation 
due in 2019. The engagement partners 
on key components are required to rotate 
every five years. An extension of a year 
was requested for one partner in 2017 and 
two of the component partners are due to 
rotate in 2018.
Meetings were held with the external 
auditors before the audit to agree their 
audit plan and after their audit work to 
discuss their key audit findings.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP annually 
confirm their compliance with UK 
regulatory and professional requirements 
including ethical standards and that their 
objectivity is not compromised. Their audit 
work is subject to independent partner 
and periodic quality control reviews. 
Potential independence threats through 
the provision of non-audit services are 
mitigated through various safeguards.
The Committee continues to be satisfied 
with the independence and performance 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and have 
therefore recommended to the Board 
that they should be reappointed as the 
Group’s auditors at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Non-audit services and fees
Hilton has implemented a policy on the use 
of external auditors for non-audit services 
designed to preserve the independence 
of the external auditors. This policy 
categorises non-audit services into (i) 
continuing services which the Committee 
permits external auditors to undertake 
subject to a price cap; (ii) irregular or 
significant services requiring Committee 
approval on a case by case basis; and (iii) 
non-permitted services. 
During the year the Committee approved 
certain non-audit services in connection 
with the Seachill acquisition process to 
be undertaken by PwC. These services 
comprised a Class 1 Circular working 
capital review and three year top up audit 
work on the target and fees paid to PwC 
for these services totalled £485,000. 
The Committee noted that these services 
are often provided by the external auditor 
given their knowledge of the Group and 
regulatory requirements, that the PwC 
services were irregular and that as a result 
their independence was not affected.
The level of non-audit fees was reviewed 
which in 2017 at £517,000 represents 
149% of audit fees in the year and 
an average of 84% over three years. 
Excluding items required by national or 
EU legislation, these percentages reduce 
to 21% and 30% respectively and so 
would fall within the 70% EU cap even 
though such cap does not apply until 2020. 
Further details of these costs can be found 
in note 6 on page 77. The Committee 
considers that this level of non-audit fees 
does not affect the independence of the 
external auditors.
Other
The Committee updated its terms 
of reference.
Conclusion
The Committee considers that the work 
performed as detailed above demonstrates 
that the Committee continues to 
operate effectively and discharges 
its responsibilities.
I will be available to shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting to 
respond to any questions relating to the 
work of the Committee.

Report of the Audit Committee
continued Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to report on the activities  
of the Nomination Committee for the  
52 weeks ended 31 December 2017.
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee is 
established by the Board of Directors. 
Terms of reference formalise the 
roles, tasks and responsibilities of the 
Committee to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and to 
achieve best practice. The Committee 
terms of reference are available and can 
be found on the Company’s website 
at www.hiltonfoodgroupplc.com. 
The Nomination Committee leads the 
process for Board appointments.
The Committee meets on  
an as required basis.
Membership of the Committee
Members of the Committee comprise 
all the Non-Executive Directors. 
Responsibilities of the Committee
The main responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee which are contained in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and also in 
the Committee’s terms of reference are:
 – to review the structure, size and 
composition of the Board including 
skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity (including gender) and make 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes;
 – to give consideration to succession 
planning for Directors and other senior 
executives and identify appropriate 
candidates for the approval of the Board; 
 – to oversee new appointments to 
the Board;
 – to review the results of the Board 
performance evaluation relating to  
the composition of the Board; and
 – to review the time requirements

How the Committee has discharged 
its responsibilities
During 2017 the Committee met once 
and considered a range of topics including 
resource and succession planning.
Hilton continues to develop management 
structures to promote its talent pipeline 
as part of a succession planning process 
covering the Directors and senior 
management positions to enable, 
where possible, recruitment of vacant 
positions from internal candidates. 
Accordingly processes are in place 
to assess the current management 
population against criteria for larger 
management roles they could potentially 
fill in the future and put in place individual 
development plans. Given the growth in 
business categories and geographies, 
the Committee continues to monitor the 
planning of resource implications which  
is well in hand.
The Chairman has discussions with each 
Director to review and agree their training 
and development needs.
Conclusion
The Committee considers that the work 
performed as detailed above demonstrates 
that the Committee continues to 
operate effectively and discharges 
its responsibilities.
I will be available to shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting to 
respond to any questions relating to the

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Report of the Nomination Committee Chair’s introduction
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the 52 weeks 
ended 31 December 2017. This report sets 
out the Company’s policy on Directors’ 
remuneration as well as information on 
remuneration paid to Directors during 
the year. The report complies with the 
requirements of The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 and has been prepared in line with 
the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the UK Listing 
Authority Listing Rules (the ‘Listing Rules’).
Directors’ remuneration major 
decisions and substantial changes
Following the comprehensive review 
of executive remuneration conducted 
last year the new remuneration policy 
was overwhelmingly supported by the 
Company’s shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
The objective of the policy continues to 
be to ensure that executive remuneration 
is in line with good practice, that it is 
competitive but not excessive by market 
standards and it is aligned with our 
strategic objectives and the interests of our 
shareholders and wider stakeholders.
Implementation of policy in 2018
Basic salaries
In reviewing salaries for 2018, the 
Committee considered Company 
and individual Director performance, 
changes in responsibility and levels of 
increase in the sector for the broader UK 
employee population. The Committee has 
undertaken that increases in Executive 
Directors salaries over the three years 
covering the current remuneration policy 
will be capped at no more than the 
increase of the general workforce except 
in the case of a promotion or substantive 
business expansion where a larger 
increase may be considered. 
Accordingly the Committee agreed basic 
salary increases of 2% for Robert Watson, 
Chief Executive, Philip Heffer, Chief 
Operating Officer and for Nigel Majewski, 
Chief Financial Officer effective from 
1 January 2018 in line with the increase  
of the general workforce.
The Committee is mindful of the need 
to nurture a strong talent pipeline 
and therefore assist with the Board’s 
succession planning which is even more 
essential at Hilton where Directors 
have had considerable longevity. 
Given the growth in business categories 
and geographies, planning of resource 
implications is well in hand. 
Variable pay 
No changes to variable pay are proposed. 
The annual bonus opportunity shall 
continue to be 125% of base salary and the 
normal LTIP grant level remains at 100%  
of salary for all Directors. 
The 2018 Executive Director bonus 
scheme financial element shall be 
measured against profit before tax 
removing any tax implications which are 
largely out of management’s control. 
There will be a 20% of salary award for 
threshold performance equalling the 2017 
actual profit before tax level increasing on 
a straight line basis to a 105% of salary 
payout for performance of at least 110% of 
2018 budgeted profit before tax or higher. 
A further strategic element of up to 20% 
of salary is available based on individual 
performance against personal and strategic 
targets aggregating to a 125% of salary 
maximum bonus opportunity for the 
Executive Directors.
No changes are proposed to awards under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan which will 
continue to be based on a sliding scale  
of stretching EPS targets.
Performance and reward for 2017
Hilton’s performance has been strong, 
outperforming its comparator indices. 
The Company continues to successfully 
implement its strategy with a wide spread 
of the Group’s operations across Europe 
and a growing Asia Pacific region which 
represents a material long term strength.
The Committee noted that the significant 
acquisition costs during the year would 
inappropriately impact on bonus and long 
term incentive outcomes and therefore 
concluded that such acquisition costs 
should be excluded when determining 
variable pay outcomes. In this way the 
bonus and long term incentive outcomes 
are on the basis of the underlying 
performance of the Group.
Annual bonus
The Group’s profit before exceptional 
acquisition costs and tax exceeded 
the target by 5.4%. This resulted in 
performance above threshold but below 
maximum resulting in a bonus of 79.9% 
of salary out of a maximum of 105% 
of salary.
The Committee determined that there was 
significant over performance against the 
business development objective including 
expansion into fresh foods in Central 
Europe a new factory in New Zealand 
and a new protein with the acquisition of 
Seachill. There was also good progress 
in developing the strategic plan and 
succession planning. Accordingly the 
Committee recommended that 20% of 
salary became payable out of a maximum 
of 20%.
In aggregate a total bonus of 99.9% 
of salary is payable in respect of 2017 
performance out of a maximum of 125% 
of salary.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP award granted in 2015 was 
subject to performance against stretching 
EPS targets. Threshold performance was 
set at EPS growth of 6% per annum where 
25% of the options would vest, rising to 
EPS growth of at least 18% per annum 
where 100% of the options would vest. 
Following the three year performance 
period ending 31 December 2017 EPS 
compound annual growth of 14.0% was 
achieved and it is expected that there will 
be vesting of 69.8% out of a maximum 
of 100%.
The Committee believes the annual  
bonus and LTIP outcomes are reflective  
of performance over the relevant one  
and three year performance periods.
Conclusion
As our Remuneration Policy was only 
approved last year, we do not propose 
to make any significant changes to 
our remuneration arrangements at 
present. However, the Remuneration 
Committee is committed to ensuring 
that the Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation remains compliant with 
all legislative requirements as they come 
into force, and is aligned with evolving best 
practice, while continuing to take account 
of our overarching remuneration philosophy 
and delivering value to shareholders.

Directors’ remuneration report Consequently during 2018 the 
Remuneration Committee will pay close 
attention to any reforms implemented by 
the Government in the coming months 
and will also review our general approach 
following publication of the revised 
Corporate Governance Code which is 
expected later this year.
In addition the transparency and equality 
of pay across all grades, gender and 
geographies remains a key focus of the 
business and is a regular item on the 
Remuneration Committee agenda.
I hope we continue to receive your support 
in respect of our Annual Report at our 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Directors’ 
remuneration policy
The Committee considers that the Group’s 
remuneration policies should encourage a 
strong performance culture and emphasise 
long term shareholder value creation in 
order to be aligned with its shareholders’ 
interests. 
The current remuneration policy was 
passed by a binding shareholder vote 
at the Company’s 2017 Annual General 
Meeting and takes into account the 
provisions contained within the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and other 
good practice guidelines from institutional 
shareholders and shareholder bodies. 
The policy became effective from the 
date of that meeting and will be subject 
to further binding votes every three years 
or sooner where any changes are made. 
All payments to Directors during the policy 
period will be consistent with the approved 
policy which is reproduced below for 
completeness and transparency.
Overview of remuneration policy
The policy, developed following a 
comprehensive remuneration review,  
has the following objectives:
 – To develop a remuneration structure 
which supports the Company’s 
strong performance culture and our 
key objective of creating long term 
shareholder value;
 – To enable the Company to recruit and 
retain Executives with the capability 
to lead the Company on its ambitious 
growth path;
 – To reflect principles of best practice; and
 – To ensure our remuneration structures 
are transparent and easily understood 
both internally and externally.
Remuneration policy table
The following table summarises all elements of pay which make up the total remuneration opportunity for Directors, and details how 
each element is operated and links to the Company’s strategy.
Element 
Purpose and 
link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity 
Basic salary To recruit and 
reward executives 
of a suitable calibre 
for the role and 
duties required 
Normally reviewed annually by the Committee with effect 
from 1 January, taking account of Company performance, 
individual performance, changes in responsibility and 
levels of increase for the broader UK employee population 
(or their local market where relevant). 
Reference is also made to levels within relevant FTSE 
and industry comparators on a periodic basis although 
this is only one factor that is taken into account when 
determining pay levels and increases.
The Committee considers the impact of any basic 
salary increase on the total remuneration package.
Pay levels throughout the organisation are also taken  
into account in order to ensure adequate provision  
for timely succession.
For Messrs Watson, Heffer 
and Majewski, following 
the implementation of the 
2017 increases as set out 
in last year’s Remuneration 
report, increases in 2018 
and 2019 will be capped by 
the increases made to the 
general workforce (except 
in cases of promotion or if 
there has been a substantive 
business expansion).
For future directors this cap 
does not apply. On occasion it 
may be appropriate for a new 
director to be positioned on a 
below market base salary but 
then to provide above market 
increases as the executive 
gains experience in the role.

Benefits To provide market 
competitive 
benefits to ensure 
the retention 
of employees
The Company typically provides:
 – Company car and fuel;
 – Private healthcare; and
 – Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses 
(as required).
Any reasonable business related expenses (including tax 
thereon) may be reimbursed.
Executive Directors are eligible for other benefits which are 
introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
The value of traditional 
benefits is based on the 
cost to the Company and 
is not pre-determined.
Relocation expenses or 
benefits will take into account 
the nature of the relocation 
and will be provided on a 
fair and reasonable basis.
Pension To provide adequate 
retirement benefits
Employer contributions are made to money purchase 
pension schemes or in certain circumstances a 
salary supplement may be paid in lieu of such 
pension contributions.
Up to 15% of basic salary.
Annual bonus To encourage and 
reward delivery 
of the Company’s 
short term 
financial and/or 
strategic objectives 
The Committee will review performance metrics at the 
start of the year. Performance criteria will be aligned to 
the Company’s strategic objectives at that time. 
The majority of the bonus will be linked to challenging 
financial metrics, which will typically include a measure 
of profit. Strategic or other individual targets may be used  
to determine a minority of the bonus outcome.
For financial measures, typically a sliding scale of targets 
will be set. Where operated, no more than 20% of that 
element shall be payable for threshold performance. It may 
not be possible to set sliding scale targets for individual 
or strategic measures but full disclosure on the objectives 
and performance against these will be provided on a 
retrospective basis.
At the start of the performance year, the Committee 
may determine that a proportion of the bonus is deferred 
in shares.
If a proportion of bonus is deferred in shares, the value 
of any dividends payable on those shared during the 
vesting period may be payable.
Bonuses are subject to claw-back in circumstances 
of misstatement, error or gross misconduct.
Up to 125% of basic salary.

To provide a 
way of building 
up a meaningful 
shareholding in 
the Company 
and providing 
alignment with 
shareholders’ 
interests
Under its Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Hilton makes 
annual awards of conditional shares or nil cost options 
to selected senior executives.
Awards vest subject to continued employment and 
satisfaction of challenging performance conditions 
measured over three years to be satisfied by the issue of 
new shares or through purchasing shares in the market.
The performance measures shall normally be weighted 
towards EPS with performance targets determined at 
the date of grant with up to 25% vesting at threshold 
performance. The Committee may introduce new or 
reweight existing performance measures so that they 
are aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives at 
the start of each performance period. The Committee 
will consult with leading shareholders before introducing 
a new measure.
Awards are subject to claw-back for three years following 
vesting in circumstances of material misstatement, error 
or misconduct.
Dividend equivalents may be paid on the value of 
dividends paid during the vesting period or any holding 
period (if applicable). The payment may be in the form of 
additional shares or cash and may assume reinvestment.
The Committee has the discretion in certain circumstances 
to grant and/or settle an award in cash.
100% of salary for all Executive 
Directors, but in exceptional 
circumstances such as 
recruitment or retention, 
the limit may be increased 
to 200% of salary.
All employee 
share schemes 
To encourage 
employee share 
ownership and 
thereby increase 
their alignment 
with shareholders
All employees are eligible to join any permissible 
all employee scheme. Executive Directors will be 
eligible to participate in any all employee share plan 
operated by the Company on the same terms as 
other eligible employees. 
Under Hilton’s current Sharesave Scheme 
(HMRC approved for the UK and Ireland) regular 
savings over three years is followed by a six 
month period to exercise the options granted.
No performance conditions attach to options 
granted under the Scheme.
The maximum level of 
participation is subject to the 
limits imposed by HMRC 
from time to time (or a lower 
cap set by the Company).
Shareholding 
guidelines
To further align 
Executive Directors’ 
interests with 
those of long term 
shareholders and 
other stakeholders
Executive Directors are expected to build a holding in the 
Company’s shares equal to a minimum value of 300% of 
base salary for the Chief Executive and Chief Operating 
Officer and 100% of base salary for all other Directors.
To the extent that this guideline has not been achieved, 
executives are normally required to retain 50% of any 
vested share awards (after the sale to meet tax obligations).
Half of the guideline requirement will apply for 12 months 
post-employment.

The Non-Executive Directors receive fees for carrying 
out their duties.
Fees are reviewed periodically. A base fee is augmented 
for Committee Chairmanship or membership to take 
into account the additional time commitment and 
responsibilities associated with those committees. 
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-Executive Directors 
are eligible for any performance related remuneration.
Non-Executive Director remuneration is determined 
by the Non-Executive Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Chairman’s remuneration 
is determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
If there is a temporary yet material increase in the time 
commitments for Non-Executive Directors, the Board 
may pay extra fees on a pro-rata basis to recognise 
the additional workload.
Additional fees may be payable in relation to extra 
responsibilities undertaken such as chairing a Board 
Committee and/or Senior Independent Director role 
or being a member of a committee.
Any reasonable business-related expenses (including 
tax thereon) can be reimbursed if determined to be 
a taxable benefit.
As for the Executive Directors, 
there is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase.
Any increases to fee levels will 
take into account the general 
salary increase for the broader 
UK employee population, the 
level of time commitment 
required to undertake the role 
and the level of fees paid in 
the general market.
Notes
1. As Hilton operate in a number of geographies remuneration practices vary across the Group. However, employee remuneration policies are based on the 
same broad principles and the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees as a whole. For example, 
the Committee takes into account the general base salary increase for the broader UK employee population when determining the annual salary review for 
the Executive Directors. There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and other senior employees, which 
the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility of employees across the Company. The key differences 
in remuneration policy between the Executive Directors and employees across the Group are the increased emphasis on performance related pay and the 
inclusion of a share based long term incentive plan for Executive Directors. There is a lower aggregate incentive quantum at below executive level with levels 
driven by market comparatives and the impact of the role. Long term incentives are not provided outside of the most senior executives as they are reserved  
for those viewed as having the greatest potential to influence Group levels of performance.
2. The choice of the annual bonus financial element shall be determined at the start of each year based on the key business priorities for the year. The majority  
is likely to be based on clear financial targets including a significant weighting on profit since this is the primary financial measure and a driver of company  
value and dividend.
3. The long term incentive metrics are determined at the time of grant. Performance metrics may include a measure of profitability such as EPS and any other 
metric which aligns the incentive with long term returns to shareholders. EPS growth is a key financial metric and a driver of company value dividend.
4. Long term incentive and Sharesave schemes are operated in accordance with their respective Scheme and other rules under which the Committee  
has some discretion relating to their administration which is consistent with market practice. Under the LTIP such discretion covers:
 – participation;
 – the timing of the grant of award and/or payment;
 – treatment of awards in the event of good leavers (including determination of good leaver status), death and intervening events (including variations in capital  
and change of control) which address vesting date, exercise period and reduction in number of vesting options;
 – in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment or retention the grant limit may be increased to 200% of salary;
 – minor alterations to benefit the plan administration, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or 
regulatory treatment; and
 – where an event has occurred such that it would be appropriate to amend the performance condition so long as the altered performance condition is not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
5. The Committee retains discretion to adjust the long term incentive vesting outcome if it feels that the level of vesting is not commensurate with performance 
over the period. The Committee, in using its discretion, would act fairly and reasonably and would seek to consult with shareholders prior to the use of any 
upwards discretion.

Directors’ remuneration report
continued Other policy information
Element Description
Non-UK based 
Directors and foreign 
currency translation
Directors may be employed who are based outside of the UK and therefore subject to the employment laws 
and accepted practice for that country which may be different to those in the UK. The Committee will ensure 
that any future overseas based Directors are remunerated on an equivalent basis as in the UK albeit that it may 
be necessary to satisfy local statutory requirements.
Remuneration to overseas Directors paid in foreign currencies is, for disclosure purposes, translated into 
Sterling at the average exchange rate for the relevant year.
Approach to 
recruitment
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the 
Company’s approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. For the appointment of a new 
Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time. 
The salary for a new Executive Director shall take into account the experience and calibre of the individual and 
the market rate required for recruiting him or her. The initial salary may be set below the normal market rate, 
with phased increases over the first few years as the Executive Director gains experience in their new role.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual 
bonus performance criteria for the remainder of the first performance year of appointment. The bonus would 
be pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year in employment. In addition, an LTIP award can be made shortly 
following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in a closed period). The maximum bonus and LTIP 
grant level will be in accordance with the maxima outlined in the policy table.
If an individual is forfeiting remuneration from his or her previous employer, the Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders. Such payments would reflect and be limited to remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer and would reflect (as far as possible) the nature and time horizons attaching to that 
remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. The aim of any such award would be to ensure 
that so far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the 
amount being forfeited. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments in the remuneration report.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role 
will be allowed to pay out according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal Executive Director appointments the Committee has the discretion to pay ongoing 
relocation costs for a reasonable period, as well as one-off payments (assuming they are fair and reasonable).
Any share-based awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing 
share plans. If necessary, awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Payment for loss of 
office 
Payments for loss of office are made in accordance with the terms of the Directors’ service contracts as below. 
On termination no bonus is payable unless the Committee determines good leaver circumstances apply where, 
subject to performance conditions, a pro-rata bonus may be payable at the Company’s discretion.
LTIP awards will generally lapse on cessation although they may be capable of vesting in certain good leaver 
situations. For good leavers, outstanding share awards may vest at the original vesting date, or on the date of 
cessation if the Committee decides, subject to time pro-rating and the performance conditions being satisfied. 
The Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating or apply it to a lesser extent if it feels it is 
appropriate to do so.
In accordance with its terms of reference the Committee ensures that contractual terms on termination, and 
any payments made, are fair to the individual, and the Company, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty 
to mitigate loss is fully recognised. The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement and legal fees where 
considered appropriate. In addition, the Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle or compromise 
claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best interests of the Company.
Consideration of 
shareholder views
The Committee is always interested in shareholder views and is committed to an open dialogue. Accordingly, 
the Committee will seek to engage with major shareholders on any proposed significant changes to its 
remuneration policies or in the event of a significant exercise of discretion. The Committee considers 
shareholder feedback received in relation to each AGM alongside views expressed during the year. In addition, 
we engage actively with our largest shareholders and consider the range of views expressed.
Consideration 
of employment 
conditions elsewhere 
in the Group
The Committee takes into account the general employment reward packages of employees across the Group 
when setting policy for Executive Director remuneration and is kept informed of changes in pay across the 
Group. Employees have not previously been actively consulted on Director remuneration policies but this may 
be considered in future where appropriate.

1.Salary and fees
2017 salaries reflect a 10% increase for Robert Watson and Philip Heffer and 7% increase for Nigel Majewski on 2016. The salary disclosed in respect  
of Theo Bergman includes an 8% holiday allowance.
In 2016 there were a number of Non-Executive Director changes including the Chairman which are reflected in their fees.
2.Benefits
Benefits provided included company car and fuel and private healthcare.
3.Annual bonus
The 2017 annual bonus has two elements. The financial element bonus was based on profit before tax performance against a sliding scale of targets. A strategic 
element bonus was available based on achievement of personal objectives. The bonus outcome for 2017 for all Executive Directors is summarised below.

The strategic bonus element achievement related to key objectives around new business development and strategy plan together with management development 
and succession planning. There was a significant over performance against the business development objective and good progress was made in developing the 
strategic plan and succession planning.
In 2016 net income exceeded the threshold achieving 107% of 2016 budgeted net income which resulted in a financial element bonus of 66.31% of salary.  
A 20% of salary bonus was paid to each Executive Director in respect of the strategic metric for excellent progress made on the strategic objectives.  
Accordingly a total bonus of 86.31% of salary was paid during the year to all Executive Directors.

The Committee will disclose targets on a retrospective basis.
2018 long term incentive awards

Governance
Directors’ remuneration report
continued Directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual report 
and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are 
required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
the Company’s transactions and which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors’ are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the Annual 
report and financial statements
Each of the current Directors whose names and functions are 
set out on pages 32 and 33, confirm that to the best of their 
knowledge and belief:
 – the Group and parent company financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with applicable law and in 
conformity with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and the Company; and
 – the management reports, which comprise the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report, include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group and the Company, together with a description

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Statements of Directors’ responsibilities Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Hilton Food Group plc’s Group financial statements 
and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the 
year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the annual report, which comprise: the consolidated and 
Company income statements, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated and Company statement of changes in 
equity and the consolidated and Company cash flow statements; 
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we  
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  
for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that  
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard  
were not provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 6 to the financial  
statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the  
Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017  
to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas 
of focus
 – Overall Group materiality: £1,853,000 
(2016: £1,660,000), based on 5%  
of profit before tax, adjusted for  
non-recurring acquisition costs.
 – Overall Company materiality: £1,574,000 
(2016: £1,032,000), based on 1%  
of Total Assets.
 – All eight trading subsidiaries, together 
with four intermediary holding 
companies require local statutory audits 
and were in scope for group reporting.
 – An Australian joint venture company was 
subjected to specific audit procedures.
 – Customer supply arrangements (Group).
 – Acquisition accounting (Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework 
applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to 
applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group and significant component level to 
respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and 
regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the 
Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited 
to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation 
and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant 
component teams. Our procedures included, but were not limited 
to, reading financial statement disclosures and agreeing those 
disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, reading and 
consideration of the implications of: i) correspondence with the 
regulators; ii) correspondence with legal advisors; iii) significant 
component auditors’ work; and iv) internal audit reports in so 
far as they related to the financial statements and enquiries of 
management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures 
described above and the further removed non-compliance with 
laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected 
in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware 
of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, 
including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals 
and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Hilton Food Group plc Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.  
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Customer supply arrangements – Group (page 39 of the Audit 
Committee Report)
The group has entered into a number of rebate and incentive 
arrangements with its customers.
Rebates and incentives are calculated based on agreed 
contracted rates and volumes of sales to customers over the term 
of the contracts.
As the arrangements are based on contracted rates and known 
sales volumes, there is limited judgement required around the 
accurate recognition of these amounts and in the appropriate 
accounting period.
However, owing to the number of agreements in place and the 
range of contractual terms included within those agreements 
there is a heightened risk that the application of those terms 
might be calculated inaccurately, omitted from the calculation  
or included in the incorrect accounting period.
Furthermore, the Group occasionally agrees variations to these 
arrangements with its customers during the term of the contract. 
This can result in a change in agreed rates applied in the calculation 
of the rebate and incentive amounts, resulting in an increased risk  
of errors in the calculations.
We obtained and read copies of open customer 
supply agreements in order to understand the impact of these 
arrangements on the financial statements.
We held discussions with the Directors and inspected minutes 
of Board discussions and to determine, in conjunction with the 
fact that we did not identify any omitted agreements through 
our audit procedures in other areas, whether the list of contracts 
management had provided was complete.
We selected a sample of rebate and incentive accruals and 
agreed the inputs to the calculations to the contracts and the 
sales to sales amounts in the accounting ledgers (which we had 
audited) to test the accuracy and timing of recognition of the 
rebates. Our testing did not identify any errors. We also selected 
rebate and incentive payments made after the period end and 
checked that they were appropriately accrued in the correct 
period. The payments we had selected for testing were accrued 
for in the correct period.
Acquisition accounting – Group (page 39 of the Audit Committee 
Report and note 17 to the financial statements)
During the year the Group acquired Seachill UK Ltd.
Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, a fair value exercise 
needs to be undertaken on the acquired assets and liabilities. 
This includes the identification of intangible assets and fair valuing 
those intangible assets.
The assessment of those fair values for intangible assets and 
property are very sensitive to changes in assumptions.
We carried out audit procedures on the balance sheet of the 
acquired company as at the acquisition date of 7 November 2017 
as part of our audit work. 
In respect of intangible and property fair value adjustments, we 
agreed those adjustments to reports produced by management’s 
valuation experts, assessed the competency of those experts and 
audited the key assumptions and judgements (which included 
the identification of the intangible assets and the various discount 
rates, royalty rates and forecasted sales cash flows used in 
the calculations). 
We were supported by our specialist valuations department  
in respect of the intangibles fair value adjustment.
Our testing did not identify any material errors in the 
acquisition accounting. 
There were no key audit matters for the Company.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured as a parent company with 18 subsidiary 
undertakings. There are eight trading subsidiaries located in the 
United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, 
Denmark and Sweden; all of these entities are required to have 
statutory audits under local legislation. The four intermediary 
holding companies, all located in the United Kingdom, are also  
all required to have statutory audits. All of these entities are 
audited by PwC network firms. The remaining six entities are 
either dormant or newly incorporated entities and were not 
considered to be significant to the Group, though specific 
procedures were carried out on certain balances and transactions. 
In addition to these 18 entities the Group has a 50% interest in 
joint venture companies located in Australia, Portugal and the 
United Kingdom. We did not consider the Portuguese and United 
Kingdom joint venture company to be significant to the Group and 
it was not therefore subject to audit procedures. The Australian 
joint venture was material to the Group and was subject to 
specific audit procedures. The key protocols we adopted 
in respect of working with all component auditors were: i) 
issuing formal Group reporting instructions, which set out our 
requirements for the component auditors, together with our 
assessment of audit risks in the Group; ii) holding planning 
discussions with all component auditors in order to agree those 
requirements, discuss the Group audit risks and to identify any 
component specific risks; iii) high level analysis of the financial 
information of the component by the Group engagement team to 
identify any unusual transactions or balances for discussion with 
component auditors; iv) attending, with Group management, the 
component clearance meetings held between the component 
auditors and local management; and v) obtaining signed audit 
opinions that the component financial information was properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The only significant component in the Group whose 
statutory audit opinion is not signed by the Group engagement 
partner is located in the Netherlands. The Group engagement 
partner visited the component auditors to review their working 
papers that support their audit procedures on the three significant 
risk areas: i) management override of controls; ii) the risk of fraud 
in revenue recognition; and iii) complex supply arrangements.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us 
to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing 
and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial 
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial  
statements
Company financial 
statements
Overall 
materiality
£1,853,000 (2016: 
£1,660,000).
£1,574,000  
(2016: £1,032,000).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before tax, 
adjusted for non-recurring 
acquisition costs.
1% of Total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks 
used in the annual 
report, profit before tax, 
adjusted for non-recurring 
acquisition costs is the 
primary measure used 
by the shareholders in 
assessing the performance 
of the Group, and is 
a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark for 
a profit-oriented entity. It 
is appropriate to exclude 
acquisition costs as 
these are exceptional 
non-recurring expenses 
arising on the acquisition 
of Seachill UK Ltd during 
the year. In 2016, there 
were no exceptional non-
recurring costs.
We believe that total 
assets is the primary 
measure used by 
the shareholders 
in assessing the 
performance of 
the entity, and is a 
generally accepted 
auditing benchmark 
for an intermediate 
holding company 
with no trading 
operations.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we 
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components 
was £100,000 to £1,700,000. Certain components were audited 
to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall 
Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £100,000 
(Group audit) (2016: £100,000) and £100,000 (Company audit) 
(2016: £100,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we 
have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of the Directors’ statement 
in the financial statements 
about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the 
Directors’ identification of any 
material uncertainties to the 
Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at 
least 12 months from the date 
of approval of the financial 
statements.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the 
directors’ statement relating to 
Going Concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on 
these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic report, Directors’ report and Corporate 
governance statement, we also considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006,  
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters 
as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with 
the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic report and Directors’ report (CA06).
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit, the information given in the Corporate governance 
statement (as set out on pages 36 to 38) about internal controls 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures in compliance with 
rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this 
information (CA06).
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit, the information given in the Corporate governance 
statement (as set out on pages 36 to 38) with respect to the 
Company’s corporate governance code and practices and about 
its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their 
committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR 
(CA06).
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report 
if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by 
the Company (CA06).

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group 
and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 – The Directors’ confirmation on page 21, of the Annual report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
 – The disclosures in the Annual report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 – The Directors’ explanation on page 20 of the Annual report as 
to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement 
in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility  
to report when: 
 – The statement given by the Directors, on page 55, that they 
consider the Annual report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for 
the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.
 – The section of the Annual report on pages 39 and 40 describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
 – The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing 
Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (CA06).
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors 
for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 55, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with 
the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Consolidated cash flow statement 1 General information
Hilton Food Group plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) is a specialist retail meat packing business 
supplying major international food retailers in fourteen European countries and Australia. The Company’s subsidiaries are listed  
in note 16.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered office is 2–8  
The Interchange, Latham Road, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PE29 6YE. The registered number of the Company is 06165540.
The Company maintains a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 31 December 2017 (prior financial year 52 weeks to 1 January 2017).
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue on 27 March 2018.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income 
statement, statement of comprehensive income and related notes. Profit for the year dealt with in the income statement  
of Hilton Food Group plc amounted to £13,200,000 (2016: £9,624,000). 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Hilton Food Group plc have been prepared under the historical cost convention and  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), IFRIC interpretations  
and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The reasons why the Directors consider  
this basis to be appropriate are set out in the Performance and financial review on page 20.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are disclosed in note 4.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Hilton Food Group plc (“the Company”), its subsidiaries 
and its share of profit in joint ventures, together, (“the Group”) drawn up to 31 December 2017. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial  
and operating policies of the entity.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated 
on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition  
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value  
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Joint ventures are all entities which the Group exercises joint control and has an interest in the net assets of that entity. Investments  
in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially 
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the 
investee after the date of acquisition. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment  
to the carrying amount of the investment.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge 
accounting model and the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment. The Group conducted an impact assessment 
which did not identify any differences in the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the 
principle that revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Group has assessed the 
potential impact of this new standard on its existing policies and no material differences were identified in the recognition of revenue 
from the current recognition policy.
IFRS 16 Leases
The Group expects a number of operating leases to become “on-balance sheet”, with the biggest impact being on the Group’s 
operating leases for property.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact  
on the Group or Company.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the 
Group. Revenue may be increased and/or decreased by reference to a range of pre-agreed and pre-defined performance measures. 
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits  
will flow to the Group and the criteria set out in the following paragraph have been met.
The Group sells meat and fish in the wholesale market. Sales of goods are recognised when a Group entity has delivered products 
to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Delivery is not 
considered to occur until the products have been shipped to the location specified by the customer, the risks of obsolescence and loss 
have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the 
acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments, 
has been identified as the Group’s Executive Directors.

Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year 
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 – assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 – income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
 – all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and disclosed as a separate component 
of equity in a foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary or business comprises the fair value of the assets transferred, 
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes any contingent 
consideration arrangement and any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
The excess of (a) the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the (b) fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual values 
over their estimated useful economic lives, as follows:
Annual rate
Leasehold buildings and improvements 4% – 14%
Plant and machinery 14% – 33%
Fixtures and fittings 14% – 33%
Motor vehicles 25%
Land is not depreciated. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The residual value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount. These impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Following the recognition of 
an impairment loss, the depreciation charge applicable to the asset is adjusted prospectively in order to systematically allocate the 
revised carrying amount, net of any residual value, over the remaining useful economic life.

Annual report and financial statements 2017
Financial statements Intangible assets 
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and purchase of non-controlling interests is included in ‘intangible assets’, tested annually for 
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition or 
purchase over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or non-controlling interest at 
the date of acquisition. 
(b) Computer software
Acquired software licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to 
acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives of 
three to seven years. 
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
(c) Product licences
The costs of acquiring product licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful economic  
lives of five to ten years.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually 
for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets
(a) Classification
The Group classifies all of its financial assets as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and 
receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’, ‘cash and cash equivalents’ and ‘other financial assets’ in the balance sheet. 
(b) Recognition and measurement
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Financial assets are derecognised when (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or (b) 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or (c) despite having retained 
some significant risks and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred to another party who has the practical 
ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing additional restrictions.
(c) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is 
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss 
event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial 
assets that can be reliably estimated. For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have 
not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is either determined on the first in first out basis or by the 
‘retail method’ depending on the subsidiary. The ‘retail method’ computes cost on the basis of selling price less the appropriate 
trading margin. Cost comprises material costs, direct wages and other direct production costs together with a proportion of production 
overheads relevant to the stage of completion of work in progress and finished goods and excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less costs to completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, 
where necessary, for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventories.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables represent amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. 
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months  
or less. Bank overdrafts are shown on the balance sheet within borrowings in current liabilities.
Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium and employee share schemes reserve represents the premium on new shares issued in connection with  
and the fair value of share options outstanding under the Group’s share schemes respectively.
The foreign currency translation reserve represents the cumulative currency differences arising on the translation of the Group’s 
overseas subsidiaries.
The merger and reverse acquisition reserves arose during 2007 following the restructuring of the Group.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables represent obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year. If not, they are presented as non-
current liabilities.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings
All borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is 
no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the 
cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases
Assets acquired under a lease which transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, are capitalised 
as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments and are 
depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives and their lease term with any impairment being recognised in accumulated 
depreciation. Amounts payable under such leases (finance leases), net of transaction costs, are classified as current and non-current 
liabilities based on the lease payment dates. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the 
interest is charged to the income statement in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The annual 
rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable profit for the year using tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax 
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which  
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for certain employees in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark and 
contributes to a state administered money purchase scheme in Poland. The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately 
administered pension insurance plans and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. 
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. 
In the Netherlands and Sweden the Group contributes to industry-wide pension schemes for its employees. Although having some 
defined benefit features, the Group’s liability to these schemes is limited to the fixed contributions which are recognised as an 
expense when they are due. Accordingly the Group has accounted for these schemes as defined contribution schemes.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on 
non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with 
a corresponding adjustment to equity. All adjustments to equity are recognised as a separate component of equity in an employee 
share scheme reserve. When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly 
attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period  
in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3 Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including price risk, foreign exchange risk and cash flow 
interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Group by monitoring the foregoing risks. 
(a) Market risk
(i) Price risk 
The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk as it holds no listed or other equity investments. The Group is exposed to 
commodity price risk which is significantly mitigated through its customer agreements which are on a cost plus or agreed packing 
rate basis.
(ii) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of business in its overseas operations, principally on transactions 
in Euros, Swedish Krona, Danish Krone and Polish Zloty, although such risk is mitigated as natural hedges exist in each operation 
through matching local currency cash flows. The Group regularly monitors foreign exchange exposure and to date has deemed it  
not appropriate to hedge its foreign exchange position.
(iii) Cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk. The Group seeks to manage exposure to interest rate risk through interest rate caps over the majority of its long 
term borrowings.

(b) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of credit exposures to its retail customer partners and banking arrangements. 
The Group, whose only customers comprise blue chip international supermarket retailers, has implemented policies that require 
appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made and in relation to its banking partners. The Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk is £207.9m (2016: £171.9m) as stated in note 30.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group monitors regular cash forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient 
headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities and without breaching its banking covenants. The Group held significant 
cash and cash equivalents of £70.9m (2016: £59.3m) and maintains a mix of long term and short term debt finance.

Financial statements Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital  
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated 
as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown on the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash 
equivalents. EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before significant interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. There was gearing 
of nil as at the year end (2016: nil). 
Fair value estimation 
The carrying value of trade receivables (less impairment provisions) and trade payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. 
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current 
market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. The Directors consider that there is a single level  
of fair value measurement hierarchy for disclosure purposes.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Some of Hilton’s long term supply contracts are on a cost plus basis. IFRIC 4 requires that such arrangements are reviewed to 
determine whether they contain a lease. These cost plus agreements typically contain benchmarking clauses which allow our 
customers to obtain competitive pricing or to source its supply from a competitor. Additionally product inputs and packaging are 
traded in active markets which are monitored by our customers and furthermore product selling prices are updated on a frequent basis 
thereby resulting in pricing that is, in substance, a market price. On this basis the criteria in IFRIC 4 for determining whether these 
agreements contain a lease are not met. 
For the business combination the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been valued at fair value. This requires a number of 
estimates and judgements. The critical judgements include assumptions over i) the discount rate used; and ii) customer attrition rate 
including the probability of contract renewal and any different contract terms. There is no sensitivity on overall intangible assets since 
any change in these assumptions affecting brand and customer relationship intangibles would have an equivalent opposite effect 
in the goodwill intangible. The impact on the fair value of brand and customer relationship intangible assets recognised of a change 
in discount rates by 1 percentage point and a change in attrition rates by 10 percentage points is approximately £0.45m and £0.6m 
respectively. Details on the fair valuation being disclosed in note 17.
During 2017 and 2016 there were no critical other accounting estimates or judgements in relation to the application of the Group’s 
accounting policies.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 5 Segment information
Management have determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Directors that are used  
to make strategic decisions. 
The Executive Directors have considered the business from both a geographic and product perspective. 
From a geographic perspective, the Executive Directors consider that the Group has eight operating segments: i) United Kingdom; 
ii) Netherlands; iii) Republic of Ireland; iv) Sweden; v) Denmark; vi) Central Europe including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, 
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia; vii) Portugal and viii) Central costs and other including the share of profit from the joint venture in 
Australia. The United Kingdom, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal have been aggregated into one 
reportable segment Western Europe as they have similar economic characteristics as identified in IFRS 8. Central Europe and Central 
costs and other comprise the other reportable segments.
From a product perspective the Executive Directors consider that the Group has only one identifiable product, wholesaling of food 
protein products including meat and fish. The Executive Directors consider that no further segmentation is appropriate, as all of the 
Group’s operations are subject to similar risks and returns and exhibit similar long term financial performance.
The segment information provided to the Executive Directors for the reportable segments is as follows:

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has share options for which a calculation is done to determine the 
number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s 
shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares 
calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

17 Business combinations 
On 7 November 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of Seachill UK Limited (“Seachill” previously Icelandic Group UK Limited)  
a leading producer and distributor of fresh and frozen seafood products.
The acquisition provides the Group with the opportunity to sell a broader range of protein products which is seen as an attractive 
and sustainable area to develop and grow its business. The Seachill business presents an attractive growth opportunity in the frozen 
seafood space, where Hilton does not have a presence. Hilton hopes to offer adjacent food categories to its existing customer base. 
Changing consumer tastes and preferences for a healthier lifestyle make fish an attractive food category.
The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Seachill UK Limited for consideration of £80.8m in cash.
Fair value of assets acquired £m
Property, plant and equipment 17.5
Brand and customer relationship intangibles 21.9
Inventories 22.9
Trade and other receivables 11.9
Cash and cash equivalents 9.9
Trade and other payables (31.9)
Current income tax liabilities (0.7)
Deferred tax (4.7)
Borrowings (10.0)
Fair value of net assets acquired 36.8
Goodwill 44.0
Consideration 80.8
The above reflects the initial assessment of fair value and remains subject to amendment for one year from the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill has arisen and mainly relates to the strategic benefits for Hilton of diversifying its product portfolio into the seafood market.
The fair value of properties acquired was established from a review carried out by external qualified surveyors. The properties have 
been revalued at their existing use value giving consideration to the highest and best use of the properties. The values of other current 
assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
Brand intangibles have been recognised primarily relating to its Saucy Fish Co brand for which trademarks have been secured over 
a wide geographic area. The brand is sold by our retailer customers and is also directly marketed to consumers. Brand recognition 
is one of the key drivers of success in this market. Customer relationship intangibles have been recognised which relate to the 
supply agreements that the business has in place with its customers. The fair values of brand and customer relationship intangibles 
of £21.9m have been aggregated as it is considered that they are inextricably linked with their value each dependent on the other. 
These intangibles are being amortised over a useful economic life of 9 – 10 years. 
Trade and other receivables acquired includes trade receivables all of which are expected to be collected and therefore the fair value 
recognised is £11.9m.
In the year acquisition related costs of £2.8m have been recognised within exceptional acquisition costs (see note 9).
Since 7 November 2017 Seachill has contributed revenue of £41.9m, operating profit before exceptional items of £1.8m and profit 
before tax and exceptional items of £1.8m.
If the acquisition of Seachill had taken place at the start of the financial period, the enlarged Hilton Food Group would have recognised 
revenue of £1,578.9m, operating profit before exceptional items of £46.3m and profit before tax and exceptional items of £44.9m.

Trade receivables impaired and the amount of the impairment provision was £585,000 (2016: £183,000). The individually impaired 
receivables mainly relate to invoices which are in dispute. It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be 
recovered. The trade receivables that were impaired were all overdue by more than six months. There were no other trade receivables 
which were overdue. The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. The trade receivables which 
are not impaired or overdue are all less than 30 days old.

per share over the period plus 3%. The options have a contractual option term of 10 years. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
All employee sharesave scheme
These schemes are open to all eligible employees of the Group (including the Executive Directors) who make regular savings 
over a three year period. The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of the 
grant. The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and must be exercised within six months thereafter. 
No performance conditions are attached to the options granted under the scheme.
