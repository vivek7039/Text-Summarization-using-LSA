We believe in better
As the need to create financial security in later 
life becomes increasingly important for us all, 
Xafinity is changing the way that we think about 
pensions and the way that they are structured, 
protected and delivered. We believe in better.
Better schemes, information, technology and decisions.  
Better service expectations and ultimately better financial  
outcomes for trustees, businesses, members and our shareholders.

Chairman’s Statement
Overview 
I am pleased to introduce Xafinity’s 2017 
Annual Report and present my first statement 
as Chairman, having been appointed to lead 
the new Board shortly before the Company’s 
listing on the London Main Market in February 
this year. Our successful listing in an IPO 
market dampened by concerns over Brexit was 
testament to Xafinity’s quality of earnings and 
growth potential, with the Offer at 139p per 
ordinary share being fully subscribed by a 
shareholder base of longer-term investors.
The Group achieved a creditable performance 
for the year ended 31 March 2017, continuing 
a strong track record of delivering revenue 
growth, healthy operating margin and strong 
cash generation, while investing in its 
operational capabilities to underpin future 
growth. Strategic Report

Grown revenue to over 
£52m in 2017
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
our colleagues across Xafinity for their 
contribution to meeting the business 
challenges in a significant year of innovation, 
growth and change.
Dividend Policy
The Board are proposing a final dividend of 
0.73p per share, effectively a post-listing 
dividend for the period from Market 
admission to 31 March 2017. This final 
dividend will be payable on 28 September 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 September 2017.
The Board intend to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy, with a two-thirds/
one-third approximate split of the total 
annual dividend for the final and interim 
dividends respectively and, subject to 
prudent financial discipline and future 
Group results, expect to pay as dividends 
each year up to 67 per cent of adjusted 
profits after tax.
Strategy and Culture 
Xafinity combines expertise, insight and 
technology to address the needs of pension 
scheme clients. The Company has a clear 
strategic vision and goals for organic revenue 
growth, a sound financial base, high quality 
employees and the capability for scaling its 
business model through appropriate and 
timely investment and market consolidation. 
In particular, the Board’s near-term strategy 
addresses the potential of an increasing 
market for de-risking services to defined 
benefit pension schemes and the optimal use 
in the defined contribution market of 
Xafinity’s leading NPT master trust platform.
Implementing the Board’s strategy for the 
Group is an experienced and dynamic 
management team, with an agile client-facing 
corporate culture which puts the customer at 
the heart of the Xafinity business, aligned 
with colleagues united and motivated to go 
the extra mile in delivering market leading 
solutions to a diversified client base.
I am confident that our business strategy and 
strong management, allied with the can-do 
culture and commitment of our colleagues, 
will advance Xafinity’s client base and the 
services provided, to deliver growing returns 
for our shareholders.
Current Trading and Prospects 
The Group’s performance since 31 March 
2017 has remained in line with the Board’s 
expectations and, notwithstanding the 
prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties, we 
believe Xafinity’s core markets and pipeline of 
business opportunities continue to offer the 
potential for real growth. Management 
remains focused on implementing the strategy 
for market penetration and organic revenue 
growth across the pensions business, resulting 
in a healthy momentum of new client wins 
and commissioning of de-risking projects, and 
the Board remains confident about the future 
prospects of the Group.
I look forward to participating with colleagues 
in the next phase of sustained growth for 
Xafinity.

The defined benefit market 
remains large and challenging,  
and is not going away
Defined benefit (DB) pension schemes have 
frequently made headlines in the business 
sections of UK newspapers, and more recently 
they have reached the front pages too, with 
high profile problems at companies like BHS 
(where members of the scheme will not 
receive their full benefits after the corporate 
insolvency) and Tata Steel (where the large 
pension scheme presented challenges in the 
restructuring). 
Increasing life expectancy combined with an 
outlook of expected low asset growth mean 
the cost of meeting DB pension promises has 
risen dramatically in recent years. It is against 
this backdrop that DB schemes frequently 
present a very big challenge for company 
sponsors, and for the trustees who shoulder 
the responsibility of looking after the best 
interests of pension scheme members.
The challenges are widespread. There are 
more than 6,000 UK DB schemes with 
aggregate liabilities of approximately  
£2.0 trillion. There are 11m members  
of DB schemes in the UK private sector.
Due to the growing costs and risks of running 
such schemes, most UK DB schemes are now 
closed to new entrants, and the number that 
have closed to the build up of any further 
benefit is increasing. But pension promises 
must be honoured; closing a scheme does not 
remove the liabilities built up in the past, 
often over a period of decades. These 
liabilities are expected to take a long time to 
‘run off’ - based on aggregate data for all DB 
schemes in the UK private sector, benefit 
payments out of schemes to members are 
expected to rise between now until beyond 
2040.
The market for services supporting DB 
schemes is large. Aggregate fees for providing 
advisory services to DB pension scheme 
trustees and corporate sponsors are estimated 
to have been £1.7 bn in 2015.

In recent years, there has been an increased 
appetite among scheme trustees and sponsors 
to implement de-risking strategies to manage 
the costs and risks associated with UK DB 
schemes. Aside from the closure of schemes to 
new entrants and the build up of further 
benefits, initiatives include investment strategies 
to hedge interest rate or inflation risk, and 
member option exercises, whereby members 
can choose alternative ways to access their 
benefits that are preferable to them (versus the 
default pension offered by their scheme), often 
at lower risk to the scheme and its sponsor.
The scale of DB problems referred to above will 
likely drive an increase in de-risking projects as 
companies and trustees seek to proactively 
address the issues for the benefit of all 
stakeholders.
Schemes operate in a complex and highly 
regulated environment. Historically, UK 
governments have made frequent changes to 
pensions legislation and the pensions tax 
environment, generating a need for advice on 
the implications, as well as projects to 
communicate changes to members.
This continues to happen. For example, the 
Department of Work and Pensions recently 
published a Green Paper on DB pension 
schemes. This report covered a wide range of 
topics relating to DB pensions, and it is possible 
that further changes in pensions regulation will 
follow once the consultation process on this 
paper has concluded. As another example, in 
May 2017 the Pensions Regulator published 
their Annual Funding Update, which acts to 
increase the pressure on corporate sponsors by 
making targeted remarks about the balance 
between pension contributions and dividends to 
shareholders. 
In the arena of investment advice for DB 
schemes, in 2016, the FCA looked at the 
activities of consultants as part of a wider review 
of the asset management industry. It expressed 
particular interest in consultants’ involvement in 
fiduciary management, where - instead of the 
traditional model of advising pension scheme 
trustees on investment issues - they make and 
implement investment decisions directly. Key 
issues raised include value for money and a 
variety of conflicts of interest, including where 
investment consultants are advising on their 
in-house fiduciary management services. Data 
from KPMG shows that the fiduciary market has 
grown tenfold since 2007 (see Chart 2) with 
three-quarters of those contracts managed by 
investment consultants. 
Xafinity does not provide any fiduciary 
management services, and so the criticism of 
the FCA does not apply. Rather, there are clear 
opportunities for firms – such as Xafinity – able 
to offer genuinely independent advice about 
fiduciary management, and demand for such 
advice has increased (Chart 3).

The complexity of pension regulation means 
that barriers to entry are high. The market for 
trustee and administrative services to UK DB 
Schemes can be segmented into three 
categories:
• the ‘Big 3’ employee benefits divisions of 
global consultancies Willis Towers Watson, 
Mercer and Aon Hewitt, who typically 
serve the largest corporates and pension 
schemes
• mid-tier firms, largely comprising privately 
owned firms and divisions of larger groups 
who tend to advise smaller pension 
schemes than the Big 3
• smaller regional firms. 
Chart 4, above, compares the revenues of firms 
in these three segments during their 2015 
financial year

. Xafinity competes primarily with 
other mid-tier firms, but also with larger and 
smaller firms, from whom it sees opportunities 
to gain share. Xafinity estimates that its share  
of the market for trustee and administrative 
services to UK DB schemes is between  
3 to 4%.
The defined contribution market 
presents opportunities 
for growth
UK DC schemes are operated either under trust 
or as a contract-based arrangement through an 
insurer such as a stakeholder scheme or a group 
personal pension. Trust based arrangements are 
either individual standalone arrangements set 
up by employers to be their own DC pension 
scheme, or are a ‘Master Trust’ where there is a 
common administration and investment 
platform that multiple employers share. 
Contract-based arrangements are provided by 
insurance companies as platforms for companies 
to offer DC pension provision to their 
employees.
There are currently approximately 35,000  
UK workplace DC schemes with AUM of 
approximately £380bn. Total contributions into 
UK DC schemes during the period of 2012 to 
2016 increased from £2.1bn per annum to  
£3.6bn per annum as a result of the continued 
closure of UK DB schemes, the introduction of 
‘auto enrolment’ requirements and the 
popularity of UK DC schemes among private 
sector employers. The Pensions Policy Institute 
estimates that the value of assets in these UK 
DC schemes could grow to over £600bn  
by 2030. 
Fees for the administration and fund 
management of such arrangements can vary 
but are commonly determined on an AUM  
basis for Master Trusts or contract-based 
arrangements. The average annual 
management charge in the industry is around 
0.5%, which gives an estimated total fee 
market of approximately £2bn per annum.
Historically, DC schemes operated in a simple 
manner. The majority of members invested 
contributions made by them or their employer 
until their retirement, at which point they were 
required to purchase an annuity. In April 2015, 
UK pension regulations were fundamentally 
changed such that pension scheme members 
are no longer required to purchase an annuity

upon retirement, providing additional flexibility 
as to how individuals may use their DC pension 
pots (‘Freedom and Choice’). Members are now 
able to leave their funds invested, to draw on 
them as they wish from time to time. 
In order to provide members with access to the 
flexibilities to which Freedom and Choice gives 
rise, the trustees and sponsoring employers of 
UK DC schemes may either upgrade their 
existing arrangements, which has an up-front 
cost and also an increased ongoing 
administration burden, or they can link or 
transfer their scheme to one that has been 
upgraded to provide Freedom and Choice 
flexibilities. This is leading to an increasing 
popularity of Master Trusts, which provide such 
flexibility, as the preferred solution for UK DC 
Schemes. Of the £380bn invested in UK DC 
Schemes, only around 5% is investment in 
Master Trusts. The majority of UK DC Schemes 
do not offer access to the flexibilities introduced 
by Freedom and Choice.
There are approximately 84 Master Trusts in the 
UK. Of these, only 13 are on the Pensions 
Regulator’s ‘Master Trust Assurance’ list. Only 8 
Master Trusts have received both the Pensions 
Regulator’s Master Trust Assurance accreditation 
and the Pensions and Lifetime Savings 
Association’s PQMReady mark. Currently only 3 
of these 8 Master Trusts have also received the 
Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association’s 
Retirement Quality Mark, of which Xafinity’s 
NPT (with AUM of approximately £250m) is one.
As Xafinity’s NPT offers the full range of 
retirement flexibilities made available by 
Freedom and Choice, the Directors believe that 
NPT is positioned to achieve significant growth 
in the coming years as employers offer it to their 
employees as their ‘employer branded’ 
de-cumulation vehicle. Alternatively, employers 
may seek to use NPT as their main arrangement 
for both accumulation and de-cumulation.
There are consolidation 
opportunities in the SSAS  
and SIPP markets
A SSAS is an occupational pension scheme with 
no more than 11 members at any time and is 
established by an employer for the benefit of 
some or all of its key employees. They are 
typically best suited to limited companies where 
the shares are mainly or wholly owned by 
directors employed in that business. All 
members of the SSAS are required to be 
trustees in the scheme.
A SIPP is a type of personal pension plan which 
allows an individual to make their own 
investment decisions, with or without support 
from a pension adviser. A SIPP allows 
investments in a wide range of instruments, 
including unit trusts, open-ended investment 
companies and investment trusts, stocks and 
shares in the UK and overseas and commercial 
property, and therefore offers greater 
investment flexibility than traditional 
occupational and personal pensions. 
While SSASs have remained a more niche 
product, the SIPP has become a mainstream 
pension product and according to MoretoSIPPs, 
it is estimated that approximately 1.4m SIPPs 
exist with assets of approximately £175bn. The 
SIPP market has grown significantly in the past 
decade, driven by the shift towards defined 
contribution arrangements, a growing 
awareness of pensions generally, advances in 
technology and online financial tools, and the 
desire by individuals to take personal ownership 
over their own retirement provisions. This had 
led to rapid growth in the number of SIPP 
providers that exist in the market, which has in 
turn led to much stronger regulation and, more 
recently, market consolidation.
Xafinity provides SSAS and SIPP products and 
services, including administration of such 
products. Distribution is almost exclusively 
conducted via regulated independent financial 
advisers. Both SSASs and SIPPs allow for the full 
flexibilities brought about by Freedom and 
Choice. Xafinity is primarily positioned at the 
‘full-service’, more bespoke end of SIPP 
products, where product flexibility and personal 
service allow the firm to charge premium fees 
and to build long-term relationships.
There is an on-going trend 
towards using professional 
trustee services
Each UK DB Scheme will typically have a number 
of individual trustees on its trustee board. Given 
the increased requirements and complexity of 
running a UK DB Scheme, there is an increasing 
trend towards pension schemes including at 
least one professional trustee on their trustee 
board. Even where a professional trustee is not 
appointed to the trustee board, some pension 
schemes will use the services of a professional 
trustee in certain situations such as significant ad 
hoc projects. Xafinity provides professional 
trustee services through its HR Trustees business. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

on pensions, operating at scale and yet 
nimbly to provide clients with superior

Ambition and Strategy continued

in our services and people.
Our strategic objectives Progress
Growth through 
improving quality  
and efficiency
We enhanced our approach to marketing, to focus on building relationships and offering clients what they need, 
rather than being product led. 45 of our staff participated in the ‘consultants masterclass’, a programme 
designed to help colleagues build deep relationships so they are better placed to provide clients with the 
solutions they need.
Where tasks are common across clients, we have standardised our templates. This improves customer service, 
reduces risk and increases efficiency, as work can be handled by different offices according to capacity, and more 
easily delegated to the appropriate level within the organisation or specialists in technical analysis.

A better way
Growth through 
expanding our services
We have invested heavily in technology and infrastructure to provide a holistic range of services and solutions to 
help our pension scheme clients manage the challenges and risks they face in the current economic and 
regulatory environment. NPT and trivial commutation are 2 of our more recently added services that gathered 
momentum over the year.
 Read more on page 16
Growth through 
existing clients
Our clients face a very challenging environment, and we are committed to supporting them fully. Much of our 
growth last year arose from us maintaining and developing existing client relationships. Targeting new clients 
became a priority towards the end of the financial year, when our full portfolio of services and Radar software 
were ready to launch. Although our growth was dampened by the loss of the one-off contract with the Pensions 
Protection Fund, our underlying business still drove a 5% increase in Adjusted EBITDA.
Growth through 
increasing our client 
base, including NPT
Towards the end of the financial year we enhanced our efforts to target new long-term annuity clients in our core 
business of actuarial, administration and investment consulting services. Instrumental to this was the ability to 
leverage the benefits of previous investment in our services and technology, and also the appointment in October  
of Paul Cuff. We were awarded work by 8 new long-term clients, several of whom defected from our Big 3 
competitors.
We also gained a number of new clients for our de-risking services. A particular highlight was being engaged to 
run an exercise for an £11bn scheme. Our unique ‘Centre of Excellence’ was instrumental in us being appointed. 
Read more on page 16.
NPT had a strong year, growing in revenue by 49% and adding 28 new employers as participants. The scheme 
received the important Retirement Quality Mark from The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA),  
one of only three Master Trusts to have this accreditation. At the Professional Pensions annual awards, NPT was 
‘Highly Commended’ in the category of Retirement Income Provider of the Year. Read more on page 9.
Growth through 
technology
During the year we developed Radar, our proprietary software that fundamentally changes the interaction 
between actuarial and investment advice, allowing advice to be integrated rather than being provided separately. 
We anticipate Radar will help us serve our clients better bringing greater insight and thus more value-add 
services. We also expect Radar to drive more new client wins.
Growth through market 
consolidation
The mid-tier of the pensions consulting market is highly fragmented and is ripe for consolidation. We have 
previously completed and integrated several strategic acquisitions, and successfully administered and integrated 
books of business that we have acquired.
We did not complete any acquisitions in 2017, but have reviewed prospective acquisition targets and will be looking 
to enter discussions. Our IPO has given us potential access to capital to be the driver of consolidation in our market.

Priorities
We will continue to utilise staff more effectively across our network of offices, for example by centralising 
functions where tasks are common across multiple clients or are not ‘scheme specific’.
We will invest in a wide range of training programs, both technical and more widely to empower our 
people to make a difference to the clients they serve.
We will continue to develop our technology, infrastructure and services, with the aim of becoming a 
recognised leader of pensions consulting and de-risking solutions. We have scale but are nimble; a 
perfect combination in our market.
We will aim to expand on the high quality, longstanding relationships we have established with existing 
clients, the majority of whom access only some of our services.
We see a particular opportunity to provide more de-risking services, an area of demand that provides 
greater ‘value add’ to clients (being good for pension scheme members and sponsoring employers) and 
thus has the potential to generate higher margins.
We aim to expand our DB pension scheme advisory and administration client base by:
• targeting new ‘full services’ or ‘ongoing appointments’ by building relationships with independent 
trustees, intermediaries and directly with pension schemes. We believe that, with the investment in 
our holistic service offering, the quality and efficiency of our delivery, our experience of new business 
activities and competitive pricing, we are well placed to win new appointments
• building on our track record of working on de-risking projects for existing clients, together with the experience 
of our senior management, we will be marketing such expertise to new clients for one-off projects.
In addition, we believe that HR Trustees can continue to win new clients as an increasing number of DB 
Schemes seek to appoint an independent trustee(s). We also aim to continue growing our SIPP business 
through new sales.
We intend to offer NPT as a solution to clients in several ways, including as:
• an employer’s main defined contribution arrangement into which contributions are paid, or a 
‘de-cumulation’ vehicle to sit alongside an employer’s existing arrangement where the employer’s own 
arrangement does not offer the full range of flexibilities
• a vehicle to enable trustees of UK DB Schemes to discharge their duties in relation to additional 
voluntary contributions; and
• a vehicle to receive transfers in respect of individuals who wish to transfer from a client’s DB pension scheme.
Radar will be introduced across our client base during 2017/18. We will continue to enhance it as it is 
adopted and we gather feedback from our people and our clients.
Technology will continue to be a key focus in all areas of our business.
We plan to enter discussions with a select number of prospective acquisition candidates, and - in light of 
our track record in making strategic acquisitions and potential access to capital - believe we are well 
positioned to continue to review the market for further consolidation opportunities.
Acquisitions must be right from the perspective of our people and our clients. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Trivial commutation
Many pension schemes have members with an entitlement to a 
small pension. Maybe someone worked for an employer for 
only a couple of years in the 1980s and might now be entitled 
to a pension of £10 per month or so. Such members have the 
option to swap this pension for a one off cash sum – in this 
example, the pension might be swapped for around £2,500. 
This is known as ‘trivial commutation’.
This might well suit the member, and also makes sense for a 
pension scheme as shrinking the membership reduces the 
administration burden - in some cases, the cost of administering the 
pension can be greater than the pension itself!
At Xafinity, we have invested time and effort to be the very best at 
running bulk exercises to communicate this option to members. We 
developed our “Centre of Excellence”. At the heart of this is the 
idea that a bulk exercise like this is about people, not spreadsheets. 
So we developed a world class approach to communications, and 
trained a dedicated team armed with the best technology to deliver 
these exercises.
We have run over 80 such bulk exercises. Our largest win was in 
January 2017, when we were appointed without a tender process to 
run an exercise on an £11bn scheme, to communicate with 10,000 
members. We have a strong prospect list for future trivial 
commutation exercises.

Winning against the Big 3
We were invited to pitch to provide full services (actuarial, 
administration and investment consulting services) to a 
longstanding client of a Big 3 firm. We engaged the prospect by 
loading their scheme onto our proprietary software, Radar, and 
approached the pitch as if we had been hired and this was our 
first meeting. We were able to bring insight immediately – 
highlighting market opportunities missed through a lack of 
proactive advice in the past, and more importantly even right 
there in the room we were able to identify actions that could 
materially improve the financial position of the pension scheme.
We won the appointment. The client noted that we were like 
nobody else in the way we came across – we were focused on the 
client, not us, we were hungry and have world class technology 
designed to bring insight. Finally, we were materially better value 
than the incumbent. The client remarked that switching had in the 
end been an easy decision.
Radar
Radar is our proprietary pensions modelling software. We 
developed it during the year to meet the needs of our clients – 
to be better at bringing them insight into what is happening and 
why, and crucially to help them make decisions about how to 
improve things.
Historically, and still too often today, pension trustees and sponsors 
do not have up to date information. They are at the mercy of their 
consultants, who have a “black box” that they own that produces 
pension deficit numbers that move around but with precious little 
insight as to why. Some trustees will wait weeks for an update when 
they ask for one, and then get a bill sent with it. It’s a consulting 
model that is past its sell by date, and Radar changes all this, 
answering key questions such as where is my scheme today, how  
did we get here, and what levers can we pull to improve things?
Radar brings 21st Century governance and risk control, and 
unashamedly puts clients in the driving seat. No more “black box”; 
Radar is intuitive, easy to understand and available online to our clients.

19
Q: Why does Xafinity have Co-Chief 
Executives, and how do you divide 
responsibilities?
Ben: There is a clear distinction between our 
roles. I run the business day-to-day, looking 
after big client accounts and making sure we 
implement our best ideas across the business. 
Paul focuses on new business and investment in 
new technology. We both work on strategic 
M&A, although Paul does more of the earlier 
stages of investigating prospective targets.
Paul: We have known each other for twenty 
years since our first days’ training as actuaries, 
and we’ve worked together for most of those. 
We both spend a fair amount of time with 
clients, and having 2 of us gives us the 
bandwidth to do what we need to on this. In 
our market it is not unusual to have 2 CEOs or 
wider partnership structures.
Q: What was the rationale for the IPO?
Paul: This was the logical next step on our 
journey. We are a thriving independent business 
that flourished under private equity ownership. 
We benefited hugely from the investment we 
received from our private equity owners 
following our separation from Equiniti, but we’re 
about long-term relationships with staff and 
clients, so it made sense to have stakeholders 
and a financial structure that also looks to the 
long term.
Ben: Remaining independent was really 
important to us, our people and our clients. 
Transparency, reputation and profile are really 
important in our industry, and we see being a 
PLC as a real edge, as many of our competitors 
are privately owned. It enables us to continue 
investing in our services while still having an 
attractive dividend, and is also a structure that is 
better suited to being able to incentivise our 
people.
Paul: Being a publicly owned company also 
gives us access to capital to pursue our strategic 
vision of becoming the pre-eminent mid-tier 
firm, whether through acquisitions or other 
forms of investment. 
Q: How did the business perform in 
2017?
Paul: Revenue for the year was £52.04m, a  
1% increase compared with the prior year 
(2016: £51.77m). Adjusted EBITDA grew by  
5% to £17.46m (2016: £16.7m) representing a 
margin of 33.5%. We are pleased with the levels 
of new business generation – our wins and 
forward looking pipeline were transformed 
relative to the beginning of the year. Revenue 
growth was disappointing, however, partly 
suppressed by the impact of a contract with the 
Pensions Protection Fund not being renewed. 
Ben: We achieved a great deal to set ourselves 
up for the future. In addition to some great 
momentum in terms of new business wins, NPT 
saw some strong growth, and of course the IPO 
was a significant milestone. We are rolling out 
our new software system, Radar (read more on 
page 17), and some talented people joined the 
business. Having begun to offer trivial 
commutation to existing clients 2 years ago, in 
the last year we took our proposition to new 
clients. We have seen great success, culminating 
in being awarded an exercise on an £11bn 
scheme that made us the market leader in this 
field.
Q: What have been the principal 
developments in the market?
Ben: Last year saw pensions hitting the 
headlines for all the wrong reasons, with 
problems at the likes of BHS and Tata Steel. 
There were serious risks that the members of 
their pension schemes would see material 
reductions in benefits. This has made pensions a 
high profile issue, and kept it very high on the 
agenda for our clients and sponsoring 
employers. Trustees have a harder job than ever 
before. We think this will drive a need for ever 
more support, and we are right by the sides of 
our clients to provide this.
Paul: In DB, there is a move from the Big 3 
providers to mid-tier firms. By way of example, 
Aon Hewitt’s decision, announced in February, 
to withdraw from providing standalone pension 
administration services to keep only clients 
where they provide wider services is a significant 
step. They have resigned the appointments of 
administration only clients. Competitors 
withdrawing from certain areas of the market 
will allow us to gain market share. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Co–Chief Executive Officers' Q&A continued
“ The IPO is the logical next step in our strategy, 
enhancing our public profile and status with 
existing and potential clients and providing 
access to the capital markets to aid future 
growth if required.”
Q: What sets Xafinity apart from rivals?
Ben: The world of pensions is changing 
massively, and the speed at which you can react 
is really important. Relative to our larger rivals 
whose pension arms are parts of much larger 
businesses, our pure focus on pensions is a key 
source of competitive advantage. Versus our 
mid-tier competitors, the fact that we are a PLC 
means we can get investment into the business 
much more readily and quickly than if we were a 
partnership. That drives our focus on 
technology. 
Paul: Also, a number of our mid-tier 
competitors are looking to diversify, and are 
looking to new markets. We think that the 
pensions market for DB in particular is going to 
continue to grow for many years as we rise to 
the challenge of meeting members’ benefit 
promises in full. Our clients’ expectations will 
grow; they’ll want more technology, they’ll want 
more specialism and for some, their problems 
are bigger than ever. We are unashamedly 
focused on helping clients solve those problems. 
This is a market where, if you take your eye off 
the ball, you’ll lose. Some of our competitors are 
in danger of doing that in the unfounded belief 
that because there are no new DB schemes 
being set up, you’d better find something else to 
do. The reality is that these schemes will be 
around for 50+ years, and clients need more 
help than ever.
Ben: In our business we have high levels of 
client loyalty. Partly this is a characteristic of our 
industry. But while clients are loyal to firms, they 
are also loyal to individuals, so our very high 
levels of staff retention are key; more than half 
of our people have been with the firm for more 
than 5 years. Our culture is really important. 
More than anywhere else I’ve worked, our 
people care massively about their clients. People 
are proud to work here, and our clients stay 
because our people stay. Doing the right thing 
for clients has always been the ethos of our firm.
Q: Looking ahead, where do you see the 
greatest opportunities?
Paul: Winning market share is a huge 
opportunity for us. We’ve been doing a lot of 
work to raise our profile among intermediaries, 
which is starting to generate more and more 
opportunities for us to tender. What we’ve 
demonstrated this year is that when we get 
introductions, with our approach to pitches and 
the technology we can show people, we’re 
successful. We’re very optimistic about new 
business levels. Looking at specific services, the 
fact that we were able to win a trivial 
commutation project on one of the UK's biggest 
pension funds has made other prospects view 
us in a different light. We are also starting to do 
a lot to get our message out in relation to NPT. 
We believe that the UK DC market presents 
opportunities for growth given the growing 
popularity of Master Trusts, and the increasing 
desire to offer pension scheme members access 
to the flexibilities introduced by the Government 
in April 2015 under its Freedom and Choice 
agenda.
Ben: In terms of other market drivers, external 
factors such as Brexit or new regulations tend to 
be favourable to our sector, because they 
typically give our clients more challenges. Our 
issue is to make sure we’re developing the right 
solutions for our clients. Providing we keep 
doing that, we see great opportunities. 
Having said this, a general issue with our market 
is that things move quite slowly. It takes people 
quite a long time to make decisions and do 
things; however we are perfectly placed for the 
long-term.
Ben: The recent highly critical FCA report about 
fiduciary management as a model within 
investment advisory services also plays to our 
strengths. The Big 3 do a lot of fiduciary 
management, and there is a real need for better 
governance in this market. Because we don’t 
provide services in that way, we can offer proper 
independent oversight to advise people on 
which fiduciary manager to pick. The market is 
growing, and we’re part of the solution.
Paul: Beyond DB, our view is that the wider 
pensions industry has not stepped up to the 
challenge of the Freedom and Choice reforms 
introduced in April 2015. People in defined 
contribution schemes no longer have to buy an 
annuity, but the industry has not filled the void. 
NPT is a brilliant solution, but we don’t see at 
the moment that the industry, employers or 
trustees are moving quickly enough to make 
sure that DC scheme members, or indeed DB 
scheme members who transfer out of their 
schemes, are properly protected and finding 
cost effective, well governed, fully flexible 
vehicles. NPT is ahead of its time in that regard, 
but the market has been slow to move. We see 
that changing.
Ben: There is also the Department of Work and 
Pensions’ Green Paper on the future of the 
pensions industry, which supported our view 
that standards need to improve. It particularly 
highlighted that smaller schemes are poorly 
served as running costs are too high; they don’t 
have the purchasing power to get the best 
solutions, and the outcomes they get are 
challenged. We’ve launched DB Sense as a 
fantastic solution for small schemes. We were 
already developing this to meet a market need, 
so we’re launching this at the perfect time given 
the DWP’s Green Paper that draws out the 
challenges faced by small schemes.
Q: How would you summarise the 
Group’s primary objective?
Ben: We strive to become the pre-eminent 
mid-tier firm, the best for staff and the best for 
clients. At a simple level, it’s about providing a 
better service, using technology to bring insight, 
at a lower cost than the Big 3. We have scale to 
do things but remain nimble – it’s a powerful 
combination. Strategic Report

Q: Where does corporate responsibility 
fit within your way of working?
Ben: In our quest for Xafinity to be the best 
place for people to work and the best partner 
for our clients, we engage with colleagues, act 
upon feedback from our employee survey, and 
invest in development to ensure that each 
individual can perform to the best of their 
ability. As we touched upon earlier, our culture 
of doing the right thing for clients permeates 
our business, and begins with us doing the 
right thing for our people. We are an equal 
opportunities employer and do not 
differentiate on the grounds of gender, 
ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion or physical 
ability. 46% of our headcount of 429 
colleagues are female. Behaving ethically is an 
essential part of working at Xafinity, 
fundamental to our reputation and success, 
and the foundation of doing the right thing  
for clients.
Paul: In relation to sustainability, given the 
size of our group and the office-based nature 
of what we do, we believe the direct 
environmental impact of our people and 
operations is relatively low. Having said that, 
we strive to work in a responsible and 
sustainable manner, and encourage our 
people to minimise their environmental 
impact in their day-to-day activities.
Ben: On behalf of both of us I wish to thank our 
people for their contribution and dedication. 
Their genuine commitment to clients is at the 
heart of our business, and critical to our future 
success. With our enhanced team, market 
leading technology and portfolio of services that 
are centered on pensions, we are well placed to 
support existing and prospective clients, and we 
look forward with optimism.

Financial Review
Revenue
Revenue for the Group consists of fees 
charged, on a time and materials basis or fixed 
fee arrangement, for pensions actuarial and 
consulting services and administration. 
It also includes the annual management 
charge for NPT clients, and fees and 
commission earned from our SIP, independent 
trustee and healthcare activities.
Revenue increased 1% to £52.04m in 2017 
(2016: £51.77m).
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, 
share based payment costs and exceptional 
costs. Exceptional costs relate to costs of the 
IPO and other exceptional items. 
We consider this measure provides a 
comparable figure to 2016 as it does not 
include the exceptional items and other 
non-cash items which were largely driven by 
the IPO this year.
In the year to 31 March 2017 Adjusted EBITDA 
increased 5% to £17.46m (2016: £16.70m).
Loss before tax
The loss before tax for the year was £13.2m 
(2016: Profit £3.3m) after charging share 
based payment costs of £14.3m (2016: £nil) 
and exceptional costs of £3.0m (2016: £0.5m).
Interest and financing costs
Net interest and financing costs totalled 
£8.6m and included interest £4.5m, swap 
costs of £0.4m, and write-off of previous 
refinancing costs £3.7m. 
The Group’s debt reduced from £82.5m at the 
start of the year to £33m at the end of the 
year, by utilising the proceeds of the IPO. 
As discussed in the Prospectus produced at 
the IPO the margin on the new facility is 
1.75% over LIBOR which has led to 
substantially reduced financing costs
to deliver expectations
We saw underlying growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, 
and paid down debt with proceeds of the IPO.

Financial and Operational Highlights - Key Performance Indicators
Taxation
The tax credit in 2017 of £0.4m arose from 
current tax of £0.3m, offset by a deferred tax 
credit of £0.7m. 
EPS
The EPS for 2017 is a loss per share of 12.5p 
(2016: EPS of 3.1p).
We have shown an adjusted EPS in 2017 of 
8.1p (2016: 7.8p) which removes exceptional 
and other, mainly IPO related, items so as to 
be able to compare the business on a like for 
like basis. The adjusted earnings figure used in 
the calculation of Adjusted EPS is the driver 
for the dividend policy. Full details can be 
found in the notes to the Financial 
Statements. 
Dividend 
A final dividend of 0.73p is being proposed by 
the Board. The dividend covers the period 
from IPO (16 February 2017) to year-end (31 
March 2017). 
The final dividend, if approved, which 
amounts to £1m, will be paid on  
28 September 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register on 1 September 2017.
Balance sheet
At 31 March 2017 the Group had net assets of 
£29m (31 March 2016: Net liabilities £21m). 
The increase in net assets arises from the 
impact of the IPO offset by the loss for the 
year. 
Capital Expenditure 
Capital expenditure remains low and for  
2017 was £1.2m (2016: £0.6m), largely driven 
by software purchases and development. 
Cash flow and cash position
At 31 March 2017 the Group had £4.9m cash 
balances and generated £11.6m of cash from 
its operating activities before tax and after 
capital expenditure. These, combined with a 
£38m committed financing facility until 
February 2022, mean the Group is well placed 
to meet future working capital cash 
requirements.
The Group had net cash outflows from 
financing activities of £8.1m (2016: £16.6m) 
which was the net position of £50.0m 
proceeds from the issue of share capital on 
the IPO and the repayment of bank 
borrowings and associated finance costs of 
£58.1m.
Subsidiary undertakings
The subsidiary undertakings of the Group in 
the year are listed in note 33 to the accounts.

Errors
The Group is dependent on the continued services of its senior 
management team and key employees for the growth and 
success of the business. The loss of, or inability to recruit key 
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Group may suffer damage to its reputation which could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s results of 
operations.
The loss or unintended disclosure of sensitive personal data 
could damage the Group’s reputation and materially and 
adversely affect the Group’s results of operations.
The Group’s information technology systems may be affected 
by failures and breaches of security, which could materially 
and adversely affect the Group’s results of operations.
The Group may be materially adversely affected by mistakes 
and misconduct by its personnel, including non-compliance 
with regulatory procedures or by any errors or omissions in 
any work undertaken previously by the Group.
The Group offers attractive compensation packages that are 
regularly benchmarked. The Group also has a graduate 
recruitment scheme that takes on recent graduates and trains 
them and supports them through professional exams.  
Training and development are provided for all staff with 
regular opportunities for discussion about career progression. 
A performance share plan and sharesave scheme are to be 
rolled out in July 2017. Succession planning is reviewed by the 
Nominations Committee.
Quality control standards and processes are maintained 
throughout the operational activity of the Group. Staff and 
client surveys are carried out on a regular basis, with the Board 
reviewing the consolidated feedback. The executive 
management and wider senior management team constantly 
demonstrate high standards of professional behaviours which 
permeates throughout the organisation.
Procedures and processes are in place to safeguard against 
unintended data breaches and IT security standards are 
regularly reviewed and penetration testing performed 
regularly. Appropriate Professional Indemnity Insurance 
arrangements are in place to cover the business activity of the 
Group along with product, public and employers liability cover 
and other insurances necessary for a corporate Group. The 
levels of cover are reviewed annually. 
The Group sets high standards of professional performance 
and trains employees appropriately for their area of operation. 
Policies and procedures are in place to cover these operations. 
Quality control processes are also in place. Insurance 
arrangements exist to limit the loss should an error lead to a 
claim. Strategic Report

Crime/

market, 
economic,

The Group’s principal market, being the professional services 
market to UK pensions arrangements, is competitive.
The Group’s future success depends on its ability to continue 
to perform and maintain its client contracts. If the Group is 
unable to provide services under its client contracts, if the 
Group has disputes with its clients over the services provided 
or to be provided under the Group’s contracts, or if the 
services to be provided under the Group’s contracts are more 
demanding than anticipated, the Group’s results of operations 
could be materially adversely affected.
The Group is subject to regulation and benefits from 
regulatory approvals. The Group may fail, or be held to have 
failed, to comply with regulations. In addition, such 
regulations and approvals may change, making compliance 
more onerous.
The Group’s clients operate in an evolving regulatory 
environment.
The Group may be susceptible to crime which could materially 
and adversely affect its results of operations.
The Group’s operations could be adversely affected by 
external events and amounts recoverable under its insurance 
policies may be limited.
The Group may be subject to litigation or regulatory claims 
and its insurance arrangements may not be adequate to 
protect the Group.
Certain parts of the Group’s business may be adversely 
affected by economic, political and market factors that are 
beyond the Group’s control.
The Group reviews the competitive landscape on a regular 
basis. As described above the Group has arrangements in 
place to ensure the highest professional standards are 
achieved in providing services to our clients. These services are 
provided at prices that provide a fair reward for the work done 
and which are competitively priced. The Group strives to 
maintain deep relationships with its clients which is manifested 
in the number of clients that have been with the Group for 
more than 20 years. 
The Group has a Compliance department that reviews the 
adherence to regulatory requirements and monitors changes 
in those requirements. The risk arising from regulatory change 
is generally viewed as an opportunity to provide more services 
to our clients.
The Group takes a structured approach to Risk management 
and identifies and manages risks. Appropriate Professional 
Indemnity Insurance arrangements are in place to cover the 
business activity of the Group along with product, public and 
employers liability cover and other insurances necessary for a 
corporate group. The levels of cover are reviewed annually. 
The Directors confirm in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 48 that they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy. This Strategic Report has been approved by the Board and signed by order of the Board:

Tom Cross Brown
Chairman
I am pleased to introduce our first Corporate Governance 
report. As we noted in the IPO Prospectus, the Group Board is 
committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
and maintaining a sound framework for the control and 
management of the business activities of Xafinity plc. 
The Company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
Main Market on 16 February 2017, so it is not 
practicable for the financial year under review to have 
full compliance with certain provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Accordingly, in the 
Governance report to shareholders that follows, we 
have included a description of how the Company has 
applied the principles of the Code since admission to 
listing and how it intends to apply those principles 
throughout the 2017/18 financial year.
In preparing for listing, the Board constituted 
appropriate Committees and adopted relevant policies 
and procedures to support the development of a robust 
governance structure and compliance with the 
obligations under the Code and as a listed Company. 
We believe that the structure we have put in place is 
robust, but recognise that establishing a sound 
corporate governance framework requires further  
work over the medium term to ensure that it embeds 
transparency, accountability and challenge in the  
culture and values of the Company. 
Debates and decisions at our Board meetings since 
listing aim to link the Group’s strategy, its risk appetite 
and the effective application of good governance 
practices to the pursuit of sustainable growth over the 
longer term for the benefit of all stakeholders. As part 
of this approach, the Board, Nomination Committee and 
Management are focusing on addressing the vitally 
important contributions that developing talent, 
succession planning and diversity can bring to the 
effective governance and long-term success of the 
Company.
I look forward to reporting on our progress next year.

Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The Company adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code on 16 
February 2017 on admission of its shares to the UKLA’s Official List and 
listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Code is 
publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. Since admission to listing, the 
Company has applied all of the main principles of the Code as they 
apply to it as a ‘smaller company’ (defined in the Code as being a 
company below the FTSE 350) and has complied with all relevant 
provisions of the Code except as indicated below:

Group Governance Framework
Board Composition and Independence
The Board is composed of seven members, including the Chairman, 
four Executive Directors and two independent Non-executive Directors. 
The Board used Skillcapital to provide external search consultancy 
services in connection with the appointments of the three independent 
Directors; Skillcapital has no other connection with the Company. The 
Board concluded that Tom Cross Brown met the independence criteria 
set out in the Code on his appointment as Chairman.
The Company complies with the provisions of the Code for smaller 
companies below the FTSE 350 which requires the composition of the 
board of directors of a UK listed company to include at least two 
independent non-executive directors (excluding the Chairman). The 
Board considers that the Non-executive Directors Alan Bannatyne and 
Margaret Snowdon OBE are each independent of management in 
character, judgement and opinion and are free from relationships or 
circumstances that could affect their judgement. One of the Non-
executive Directors, Alan Bannatyne, acts as the senior independent 
director (‘SID’).
The Board benefits from the wide experience of its Non-executive 
Directors. Biographical details of all Board members are given on 
pages 26 and 27.

Board Committees
The Board operates in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and has established a Nomination Committee, a 
Remuneration Committee and an Audit and Risk Committee, with 
formally delegated duties, authorities and reporting responsibilities, to 
assist it with the direction and control of the Group. From time to time, 
separate committees may be set up by the Board to consider specific 
issues when the need arises. Written terms of reference for each 
Committee are subject to annual review and periodic updating to 
reflect any changes in legislation, regulation or best practice. The terms 
of reference for the three main Board Committees are available on the 
Company’s website at www.xafinity.com. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017
30
The Company complies with the Code provision that a UK listed 
company’s Remuneration and Audit Committees should comprise at 
least three independent Non-executive Directors (including the 
independent Non-executive Chairman) and that its Nomination 
Committee should comprise a majority of independent directors. The 
Chairman and the independent Non-executive Directors are members 
of the three Board Committees. Tom Cross Brown chairs the 
Nomination Committee, Alan Bannatyne chairs the Audit and Risk 
Committee and Margaret Snowdon OBE chairs the Remuneration 
Committee. Each Chair reports on the business of their previous 
Committee meeting at the next scheduled Board meeting.
The Audit and Risk Committee’s role is to assist the Board in 
discharging its oversight responsibilities by reviewing and monitoring 
the following: the integrity of the financial information provided to 
shareholders; the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal 
controls and risk management; the external audit process and auditors; 
and the processes for compliance with laws, regulations and ethical 
codes of practice. Further details are given in the Audit and Risk 
Committee report on page 33.
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to assist the Board to fulfil 
its responsibility to shareholders to ensure that remuneration policy 
and practices of the Company reward fairly and responsibly, with a 
clear link to corporate and individual performance, having regard to 
statutory and regulatory requirements. The Committee recommends 
the policy the Board should adopt on executive remuneration and will, 
within the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be approved 
by shareholders at the AGM in September 2017, determine and agree 
with the Board the levels of remuneration for each of the Executive 
Directors, the Company Chairman and designated senior management 
below Board level. Further details are given in the Remuneration 
Report on page 35.
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in determining the 
composition and make-up of the Board, including its skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity. It is responsible for developing and 
maintaining a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
identifying appropriate candidates for Board appointments and making 
recommendations to the Board. The Committee is also responsible for 
keeping under review the leadership needs of the Group, both 
executive and non-executive, and for ensuring that succession planning 
focuses on the continued ability of Xafinity to deliver its strategic goals 
and compete effectively.
Governance continued
As the Nomination Committee has only been established for a short 
time, an annual performance evaluation has not been conducted. It is 
intended that a performance evaluation will be conducted in this 
financial year and reported in the Company’s Annual Report for 
2017/18. The Committee plans to meet twice a year, and otherwise as 
required, to fulfil its role. It met once in the period following Admission 
and focused on the way forward regarding succession planning for 
Board and senior management appointments and the Group’s 
approach to gender balance and ethnic diversity.
The Board believes that no individual should be discriminated against, 
whether for reasons of gender, ethnicity or other grounds that restrict 
social inclusion, and this extends to Board appointments which it 
considers should be made on merit and on the basis of ensuring an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Board. The 
Board recognises that greater diversity, in the widest sense of diversity 
of race, experience and approach, can generate a more diverse 
perspective on issues which, in turn, has the ability to benefit Board 
effectiveness through improved discussions and better decisions. As 
the Non-executive Directors were appointed only one month before 
the listing in February 2017, the Board believes that a meaningful 
approach to diversity can only take place after it has been working 
together for a reasonable time, therefore an agreed approach to 
diversity and any imbalance will be developed during the 2017/18 
financial year.
The Nomination Committee has commenced a process for the collation 
and analysis of Group and comparative data on diversity in order to 
obtain a more detailed view of diversity in the context of Xafinity’s 
business, organisation, culture and values. This will provide a more 
meaningful insight into where the particular challenges or 
opportunities may be and will facilitate the consideration of a new 
diversity policy and appropriate targets for subsequent 
recommendation to the Board for approval.
Group Executive Committee
The Co-Chief Executive Officers operate a Group Executive Committee 
to support them in the performance of their duties, including the 
development and implementation of strategy and the day-to-day 
operational management of the business. The Group Executive 
Committee meets weekly and comprises the Executive Directors Ben 
Bramhall, Paul Cuff, Mike Ainslie and Jonathan Bernstein. The Group 
Executive Committee also holds monthly management calls with the 
senior management team comprising the leads of business lines and 
divisions. Strategic Report

Board Responsibilities and Operation
The Board is focused on providing entrepreneurial leadership to the 
Group. It is responsible for directing and controlling the Group and has 
overall authority for the effective and prudent management and 
conduct of the Group’s business and the Group’s strategy and 
development. The Board monitors performance, being responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate financial and human resources are in place 
for the Group to meet its objectives, and takes the lead in setting and 
embedding the Company’s culture, value and standards. The Board is 
also responsible for ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of 
internal control and risk management (including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, and for reviewing the overall effectiveness of 
systems in place), and for the approval of any changes to the capital, 
corporate or management structure of the Group. There is a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for Board approval which is subject to 
annual review and includes:
• the Group’s long term objectives, business strategy and risk 
appetite
• the Company’s policies, values and standards
• annual business plans, budgets and forecasts 
• extension of the Group’s activities into new business or geographic 
areas
• changes in capital structure and any form of fundraising or asset 
securitisation
• major changes to the corporate structure, including material 
acquisitions and disposals
• interim and annual financial statements and dividend policy
• material guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort 
• the Group’s system of internal control and risk management
• contracts which are material strategically or by reason of size or 
duration
• calling of shareholder meetings and related documentation
• changes to the membership of the Board and its Committees 
• remuneration policy for the directors and senior executives
• introduction of new share incentive plans or major changes to 
existing plans
• the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements.
There is a clear division of key responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the two Co-CEOs. The Chairman is responsible for the effective 
leadership and governance of the Board, but takes no part in the 
day-to-day running of the Business. His key responsibilities include:
• leading the Board effectively to ensure it is primarily focused on 
business strategy, performance, value creation and accountability
• ensuring the Board determines the risk appetite it is willing to 
embrace in the implementation of strategy 
• leading the succession planning process and chairing the 
Nomination Committee
• encouraging all Directors to contribute fully to Board discussions 
and ensuring sufficient challenge applies to major proposals 
• fostering relationships within the Board and providing a sounding 
board for the Co-CEOs on important business issues 
• identifying development needs for the Board and Directors 
• leading the process for evaluating the performance of the Board, its 
Committees and individual directors
• ensuring effective communication with shareholders.
The Co-CEO’s report to the Chairman and the Board and are 
responsible for jointly leading the Group’s business and managing it in 
accordance with the business plan approved by the Board, the Board’s 
overall risk appetite, the policies approved by the Board and its 
delegated authorities, and all applicable laws and regulations. They 
also recommend budgets and forecasts for Board approval, lead the 
developing investor relations programme, and maintain a dialogue with 
the Chairman on significant business developments and strategy issues. 
Ben Bramhall is primarily responsible for the operation of the business, 
covering the provision of services to existing clients, revenue 
generation and the Group’s people strategy. Paul Cuff is primarily 
responsible for raising the profile of Xafinity in the market and 
generating new business, both in traditional service areas and in the 
development of new services as the market evolves. He is also 
responsible for the Group’s strategy with regard to acquisitions and 
technology investment.
Decisions on operational matters are delegated by the Board to the 
Executive Directors, consistent with the schedule of matters reserved 
for Board approval. In advance of scheduled Board meetings each 
Director receives documentation providing updates on Group strategy, 
finances, operations and business development. The Board plans to 
meet at least eight times a year and at other times as and when 
necessary. At least once a year, the Board will meet to review business 
strategy. The Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the 
Board and any Committees of which they are members, and to devote 
sufficient time to the Company’s affairs to fulfil their duties as 
Directors. All Directors have attended the four Board meetings and one 
strategy session held since the Company’s admission to listing, with the 
Chairman and two Non-executive Directors attending all seven 
Committee meetings held in the same period (being one Nomination 
Committee, three Remuneration Committee and three Audit & Risk 
Committee).
The Board is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness and 
monitoring of the Group’s system of internal controls. The Audit 
and Risk Committee’s role is to assist the Board with its oversight 
responsibility by reviewing and monitoring the Company’s system 
of internal controls. It met three times in the period following 
Admission and at one meeting considered the internal controls 
assurance framework used during the financial year, concluding 
that it was sound and appropriate for the Business.
Directors are reminded at the commencement of each meeting to 
notify the Board of any conflicts of interest. Any actual or potential 
conflicts of Directors with the interests of the Company that arise must 
be disclosed for consideration and, if appropriate, authorisation by the 
Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The 
Board may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, as long as the 
potentially conflicted Director is not counted in the meeting quorum 
and does not vote on the resolution to authorise. Directors are required 
to notify the Group Chairman when a conflict or potential conflict does 
arise in order that Board authorisation can be considered. If the Board 
determines that a conflict or potential conflict can be authorised, it 
may impose additional conditions on the Director concerned. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017
32
The Board did not consider it appropriate to carry out an annual 
performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and of individual 
Directors prior to publication of the Annual Report for 2016/17, given 
that the Non-executive Directors were appointed only one month 
before the listing in February 2017. The Board believes that a 
meaningful evaluation can only take place after it has been working 
together for a reasonable time, and therefore an agreed approach to 
evaluation will be developed and implemented before the end of the 
2017/18 financial year. This will include consideration as to whether it is 
appropriate to carry out an externally facilitated evaluation process.
In addition to the role of the Non-executive Directors to constructively 
challenge and facilitate the development of the Group’s strategy, they 
will also meet in 2017/18 and annually thereafter (led by the SID and 
excluding the Chairman) to evaluate the performance of the Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the Executive Directors, with the 
results of that process communicated to the Board by the SID. As the 
SID, Alan Bannatyne provides a sounding board for the Chairman and 
will deputise for him in his absence. The Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors are in regular contact and may meet on a number of 
occasions during the year without the Executive Directors being 
present. 
In preparation for listing, all Directors received an induction briefing 
from the Company’s legal advisor, Reed Smith LLP, on their duties and 
responsibilities as directors of a publicly quoted company. A formal 
induction programme will be developed and tailored for any new 
directors joining the Board. The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, will ensure that the development and ongoing 
training needs of individual directors and the Board as a whole are 
reviewed and agreed at least annually.
Directors may seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they consider it appropriate in relation to their duties. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary.
The Board has adopted, with effect from Admission, a code on 
dealings in relation to the securities of the Company which is based on, 
and is at least as rigorous as, the model code formerly contained in the 
Listing Rules updated as appropriate to reflect the EU Market Abuse 
Regulation. The Directors, those employees formally identified as 
insiders, and for one year from Admission, all members of staff, are 
required to comply with the Company’s securities dealing code.
As part of its developing investor relations programme, the Company 
seeks to maintain an ongoing dialogue with major institutional 
shareholders relating to the performance of the Group including 
strategy and new developments. Investor activity is a standing report 
on the Board’s agenda and includes the views communicated by 
shareholders. As the SID, Alan Bannatyne is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, the Co-CEOs or other Executive Directors has failed to 
resolve or for which such channels of communication are 
inappropriate. 
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s first Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) since 
Admission to listing will take place at Noon on Thursday 14 
September 2017 at the Group’s main office in Reading. The AGM 
notice setting out the resolutions to be proposed at the meeting 
and including explanatory notes, together with this Annual Report 
and Accounts, will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days prior to the date of the meeting. All Board members are 
expected to attend the meeting and the Chair of each of the 
Board’s Committees will be present to answer any questions put 
to them by shareholders. Documents relating to the AGM are

Audit and Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the first report of the Audit and Risk 
Committee since the Initial Public Offering (IPO) in February 2017. The 
committee has met 3 times since the IPO and intends to meet at least 3 
times annually.
Membership of the Committee
The members of the committee are myself, Tom Cross Brown and 
Margaret Snowdon.
The Board is satisfied that the committee has recent and relevant 
financial experience as can be seen in their biographies included 
elsewhere in the Annual Report.
The Executive Directors are invited to each meeting as well as the Head 
of Compliance, the Financial Controller and other members of the 
management team as the agenda dictates.
Auditor
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the 
Board regarding the appointment of its external auditors and their 
remuneration. BDO LLP has been the Group’s auditor since 2014.  
The Group Audit Partner is required to rotate after a maximum of  
5 years; the current audit partner, Christopher Pooles, was  
appointed in 2014.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations on the 
independence of the Company’s Auditor, BDO LLP. In addition, the 
Auditor has internal processes, which include peer reviews, to ensure 
that independence is maintained. As a result of the IPO, the Auditor 
now has limitations on the nature and scope of other work that the 
firm is permitted to provide to the Group. The Committee will review 
the level of audit fees and non-audit fees on an ongoing basis. See 
Note 4 to the Financial Statements on page 68.
The Committee has reviewed the approach to the annual audit at a 
meeting that the Auditor attended ahead of the start of fieldwork. The 
Auditor then attended a further Committee meeting at the completion 
stage of the audit to present their findings. There is an open line of 
communication between the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 
and the audit engagement partner. The Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the external audit process by obtaining feedback from 
parties involved in the process, including management and the external 
auditor.
Based on this feedback and its own ongoing assessment, the 
Committee remains satisfied with the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the audit.
After due and careful consideration the Committee remains satisfied 
with the effectiveness and independence of BDO LLP and has 
recommended to the Board that BDO LLP be reappointed as the 
Company’s Auditor. 
Significant accounting issues considered during 
the year
Revenue recognition and accrued income
We reviewed the approach that management take to revenue 
recognition and discussed the treatment of accrued income for services 
not billed and the deferral of income billed in advance of work 
performed. We were satisfied with the processes put in place by 
management for recording revenue.
Professional Indemnity (PI) claims
We reviewed management’s assessments of provisions required to 
meet potential losses arising on PI claims. We considered the 
judgements taken by management and were satisfied that no changes 
were necessary.
IPO transaction reporting
The IPO gave rise to a number of one off items, some of which include 
the need for judgement. Included within that are the allocation of 
costs between share issuance and operating expenses and the 
treatment of share-based payments. No changes in treatment were 
needed.

Impact of future Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the Financial Statements. Some of these new accounting 
standards will apply for the financial year 2018 and the Committee will 
continue to assess the impact on the Group’s Financial Statements. 
Annual Report review
A final draft of the Annual Report is reviewed by the Committee prior 
to consideration by the Board and the Committee considered whether 
the 2017 Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. They 
were satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provided the necessary information.
Risk
An effective Risk Management culture has been embedded throughout 
the organisation with strong leadership and direction from Executive 
Management.
Xafinity is totally committed to actively identifying and mitigating risk 
and demonstrating transparent corporate governance. Our Risk 
Management process seeks to focus on those business and control 
objectives that must be met in order to evidence achievement of client 
needs and relevant statutory compliance. As such, Xafinity looks to 
focus on key inherent risks that may impact on the achievement of 
control objectives and embed control measures into its process to 
render reasonable assurance that they will be achieved in practice.
The Business Process Manager reviews all administrative processes and 
our Actuarial business follows the guidelines for full peer review as set 
out by the Institute of Actuaries. The Audit and Risk Committee also 
reviews the wider internal control processes and will enlist external 
support to review and test when it is deemed necessary.
Our approach to risk management is continually reviewed to ensure 
that it remains fit for purpose and that ownership for Risk 
Management rests with local management. Risks are recorded and 
assessed based on their potential impact on the business and their 
likelihood. The process requires action to mitigate any risk where 
existing controls are considered to be insufficient or where the risk is 
considered beyond tolerable limits.
All local reports are consolidated into a core report for the Board to 
evidence that all risks have been identified and mitigated, and where 
necessary corrective action is planned.
Underpinning the approach to Risk Management is a strong culture of 
control which is supported by:
• Clear and well documented compliance policies available to all staff;
• Fully documented processes which are subject to review;
• Local quality checks; and
• Customer and client surveys.
The process embraces the whole spectrum of activities and measures 
addressing risk (identification, evaluation, treatment, reporting and 
monitoring) which taken together, support the achievement of the 
organisation’s objectives. The underlying processes and control 
procedures are regularly reviewed and amended to reflect the findings 
of the process, including improvements in operational administration, 
regulatory compliance and legislative changes.
Audit and Risk Committee Report continued
At its scheduled meeting in May this year, the Committee considered the 
need for an internal audit function and noted that, given the current 
scale of the Business and the internal controls assurance framework in 
place, a separate function was not necessary. The Committee further 
noted that during the year the CFO would examine the potential within 
the Business to establish an Internal Audit function.
Whistleblowing
The company has a whistleblowing policy in place that allows for 
reports to be made to the Compliance function. All staff are provided 
with a copy of the policy.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Margaret Snowdon OBE
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
The principal objectives of our 
Directors’ Remuneration policy 
are to provide incentives that 
support our strategy as it evolves 
and are aligned to long-term 
shareholder value. 
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to welcome you to the first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report which Xafinity has prepared since its IPO in February 2017.
The Report comprises 2 sections:
• the Directors’ Remuneration Policy; and
• the Directors’ Report on Remuneration.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote of 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, with the Annual Report on 
Remuneration being subject to an advisory vote.
The Group has performed well in 2017 and been through a very 
successful IPO and the pay outcomes in respect of the Executive 
Directors reflect this as the Directors’ Remuneration Report shows. 
The Group achieved a creditable performance for the year ended 31 
March 2017, continuing a strong track record of delivering profitable 
revenue growth, healthy operating margin and strong cash generation, 
while investing in its operational capabilities to underpin future growth.
Summary of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
As part of the IPO process, Xafinity undertook a review of the Group’s 
remuneration policy for its senior management team, including the 
Executive Directors, to ensure that it is appropriate for a UK-listed 
company and took due account of the Company’s particular 
circumstances. Following this review, a new remuneration policy was 
established, some of the features of which were outlined in the IPO 
Prospectus.
The principal objectives of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy are to 
attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors and the Group’s 
senior management, provide incentives that align with, and support, 
the Group’s business strategy as it evolves, and align incentives with 
the creation of long-term shareholder value. We aim to do this in a 
way that is perceived to be fair by all parties and is also value 
for money. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

I have set out below some key points of our approach to the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors which we believe will deliver 
against these objectives.
Component of 
remuneration Summary of approach
Base salary and 
benefits
Appropriate level of base salary and benefits, 
reviewed annually in the light of factors such as 
individual/Group performance, scope of role, 
practice adopted by comparator companies. 
The base salaries of the Executive Directors for 
the forthcoming year are:
Ben Bramhall – £240,000
Paul Cuff – £240,000
Mike Ainslie – £210,000
Jonathan Bernstein – £210,000
Pension Defined contribution/cash supplement of 
between 6% and 8% of salary
Annual bonus Payable subject to the achievement of 
challenging financial/strategic/personal 
performance conditions. Malus and clawback 
provisions apply. Maximum bonus opportunity 
for the Executive Directors potentially payable 
in cash and deferred shares:
Ben Bramhall – 150% of salary
Paul Cuff – 150% of salary
Mike Ainslie – 112.5% of salary
Jonathan Bernstein – 112.5% of salary
Long-term 
incentives
Provided via a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Annual awards over shares made that vest 
subject to stretching performance conditions 
generally measured over a 3-year period. 
Maximum “normal” grant level is 150% of 
salary. Malus and clawback provisions apply.
All-employee 
share plans
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in 
all of the Company’s employee share plans, 
including the Share Save Plan, on the same

The Remuneration Committee’s other activities
In addition to designing the Remuneration Policy and generally dealing 
with the remuneration-related matters arising as a consequence of the 
IPO, the Committee undertook a number of other activities.
These key activities included:
• Agreeing the first awards to be made under the PSP following 
Admission. As set out later in this Report, awards were made to Ben 
Bramhall and Paul Cuff over shares of a value equal to 150% of 
their annual salary and to Mike Ainslie and Jonathan Bernstein with 
a value equal to 125% of salary which vest subject to performance 
against a blend of relative TSR and EPS targets;
• The initiation of a people strategy;
• Overseeing the introduction of a Share Save plan for all employees 
due to launch in July 2017; and
• Determining the annual bonus outturn for 2016/17 for the 
Executive Directors, as follows:
Executive Director
% of 
 salary
% of  
bonus maximum
Ben Bramhall 15.5% 31%
Paul Cuff 8% 31%
1
Mike Ainslie 9% 31%
Jonathan Bernstein 9% 31%
1. Paul Cuff’s bonus was pro-rated for time to reflect his appointment on 1 October 
2016.
These activities were undertaken in the context of a transformational 
year for Xafinity, as evidenced by:
• strong day-to-day financial and operating management of the 
business
• robust underlying financial performance and growth in EBITDA
• an expansion of the services offered to clients
• the restructuring of the business and new business wins
• preparing the business for, and executing, the IPO.
We trust that you find this Report to be informative and transparent, 
and we hope to receive your support for both the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and the Directors’ Report on Remuneration at our 
forthcoming AGM. Indeed, we are very keen to encourage an open 
dialogue with our shareholders on executive remuneration.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This Remuneration Policy, which has been approved by the Board, contains the material required to be set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the purposes of Part 4 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013, which amended The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (“the DRR Regulations”).
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report will take effect for all payments made to Directors 
with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. This policy has been developed with reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
is appropriate to support the long-term success of the Company while ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking.
Executive Directors
Element and 
purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Base salary
The core element 
of pay, reflecting 
the individual’s 
position within the 
Company and 
experience
The base salary of each Executive 
Director takes into account the 
performance of each individual and is 
set at an appropriate level to secure 
and retain the talent needed to deliver 
the Group’s strategic objectives.
Salaries are reviewed annually on 1 
April and are influenced by: 
information from relevant comparator 
groups (referencing the Group’s 
competitors and public companies in 
other industries); the performance of 
each individual Executive Director; and 
average increases for employees across 
the Group as a whole.
Annual increases will not exceed  
7.5% + RPI or the average increase  
of employees across the Group in  
any given year, whichever is higher. 
The level of increase may deviate from 
this maximum in the case of special 
circumstances for example, increases 
in responsibilities or promotion. As an 
example, this may occur if the market 
capitalisation of the Company 
increases as the shares are ‘re-rated’  
by investors such that the comparator 
group changes. In this scenario, other 
elements of remuneration may also 
change. In these cases, any exceptional 
increase will not exceed 20% of salary 
a year.

Benefits in kind
To provide 
market-
competitive 
benefits valued by 
recipients
Benefits currently include permanent 
health insurance, life insurance, private 
medical insurance and car allowance 
and may also include other benefits in 
the future. In certain limited 
circumstances, relocation allowances 
may be necessary. All benefits are 
subject to annual review to ensure 
they remain in line with market 
practice. 
Benefits (excluding any relocation 
allowances) may be provided up to an 
aggregate value of normally £30,000 
for each Executive Director (indexed to 
inflation).
n/a
Pension
To provide 
retirement 
benefits
Executive Directors participating in the 
pension plan benefit from matching 
annual Group contributions worth 
between 6% and 8% of base salary. 
Executive Directors are entitled to take 
all or part of their pension 
contributions as a cash allowance.
The maximum employer’s contribution 
(or cash supplement) is 8% of salary.

purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Annual bonus
To motivate 
Executive Directors 
and support the 
delivery of Group’s 
financial and 
strategic business 
target over a 
one-year 
operating cycle
Annual bonus plan levels and the 
appropriateness of measures are 
reviewed annually to ensure they 
continue to support our strategy.
Once set, performance measures  
and targets will generally remain 
unchanged for the year, except to 
reflect events (e.g. corporate 
acquisitions, other major transactions) 
where the Committee considers it to 
be necessary in its opinion to make 
appropriate adjustments. 
The Remuneration Committee retains 
the flexibility to pay annual bonus 
outcomes in cash and/or deferred 
shares (which may allow for dividend 
roll-up). 
Clawback and malus provision apply as 
explained in more detail in the notes 
to this Policy table.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of base salary.
For 2017/18, the maximum 
opportunity will be 150% of base 
salary for the Co-CEOs and 112.5% of 
salary for the other Executive directors.
Bonuses will be payable subject to  
the achievement of performance 
conditions which will be set by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The targets may be financial and/or 
personal and strategic The intended 
weighting of these measures is not less 
than 60% financial. Where a sliding 
scale of targets is used, attaining the 
threshold level of performance for any 
measure will not typically produce a 
pay-out of more than 20% of the 
maximum portion of overall annual 
bonus attributable to that measure, 
with a sliding scale to full pay-out  
for maximum performance. Bonus 
payments will also be subject to  
the Committee considering that the 
proposed bonus amounts, calculated 
by reference to performance against 
the targets, appropriately reflect the 
Company’s overall performance and 
shareholders’ experience. If the 
Committee does not believe this to  
be the case, it may adjust the bonus 
outturn accordingly.
Performance 
Share Plan
To motivate 
Executive Directors 
and incentivise the

the long term, and 
to promote 
alignment with 
shareholders’ 
interests
Awards under the PSP may be granted 
as nil/nominal cost options which vest 
to the extent performance conditions 
are satisfied over a period normally of 
at least 3 years.
Awards will vest at the end of the 
specified vesting period at the 
discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee and are subject to a further 
holding period of a further 2 years (or 
such shorter period so that the period 
from the date of grant until the end of 
the holding period will be equal to 5 
years).
The PSP rules allow that the number of 
shares (or the cash equivalent) subject 
to vested PSP awards may be increased 
to reflect the value of dividends that 
would have been paid in respect of 
any record dates falling between the 
grant of awards and the expiry of any 
vesting period.
Clawback and malus provisions applied 
are explained in more detail in the 
notes to this Policy table.
The market value of shares to be 
awarded to Executive Directors in 
respect of any year will normally be up 
to 150% of base salary, with awards 
of a maximum of 200% allowable in 
exceptional circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee may 
impose such conditions as it considers 
appropriate which must be satisfied 
before any award will vest.
All awards made to Executive Directors 
will be subject to performance 
conditions which measure 
performance over a period normally  
no less than 3 years.
No more than 25% of awards vest for 
attaining the threshold level of 
performance. Strategic Report

To promote

the interests of 
Executive Directors 
with those of 
shareholders
The share ownership guidelines 
encourage Executive Directors to  
build or maintain (as appropriate)  
a shareholding in the Company. 
If any Executive Director does not 
meet the guideline, they will be 
expected to retain up to 50% of the 
net of tax number of shares vesting 
under any of the Company’s 
discretionary share incentive 
arrangements (including any  
deferred bonus shares) until the

staff, thereby

of the Company 
and align interests 
with those of 
shareholders
The Executive Directors will be entitled 
to participate in all of the Company’s 
employee share plans, including the 
Share Save Plan, on the same terms as 
other employees.
These all-employee share plans are 
established under HMRC tax-
advantaged regimes and follows the 
usual form for such plans.
The maximum participation levels for 
all-employee share plans will be the 
limits for such plans set by HMRC from 
time to time. However the Company 
may impose lower limits on a scheme 
by scheme basis.
Consistent with normal practice,  
such awards would not be subject to 
performance conditions.

The Chairman is paid a single fee for the role, although he will 
be entitled to an additional fee if he is required to perform any 
specific and additional services.
Non-executive Directors receive a base fee for the role. 
Additional fees are paid for acting as Senior Independent 
Director or for Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration of other

Notes to the policy table
1. Stating maxima for each element of the Remuneration Policy
 The Regulations and related investor guidance encourage companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will operate. Where 
maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
2. Travel and hospitality
 While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality, whether paid for by the 
Company or another, and business travel for Directors (and in exceptional circumstances their families) may technically come within the applicable rules, and so the 
Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities.
3. Past obligations
 In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy 
will be honoured.
4. Malus/clawback
 The Committee may apply malus (being the ability to withhold or reduce a payment/vesting) and clawback (the ability to reclaim some or all of a payment/vesting) to an 
award under the annual bonus or PSP where there are circumstances which would justify such action, such as those relating to material misstatement of accounts, errors in 
calculating a payment/vesting and a participant’s misconduct.
5. Performance conditions
 The performance-related elements of remuneration take into account the Group’s risk policies and systems, and are designed to align the senior executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders. The Committee reviews the metrics used and targets set for the Group Executive Team and senior management (not just the Executive Directors) every 
year, in order to ensure that they are aligned with the Group’s strategy and to ensure an appropriate level of consistency.
6. Committee discretions
 The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and the above Remuneration Policy table. The Committee retains discretion, 
consistent with market practice, in a number or respects, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans. This discretion includes, but is not limited to, the 
following:
• The selection of participants;
• The timing of grant of awards;
• The size of an award/bonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the Remuneration Policy table and the rules of the relevant plan;
• The determination of performance against targets and resultant vesting/pay-outs;
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Company;
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the relevant plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issue, corporate restructuring events and special dividends); and
• The annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets from year to year.
In addition, while performance measures and targets used in the annual bonus plan and PSP will generally remain unaltered, if events occur which the Committee determines 
would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance, such amended or different targets can be set provided they are not materially more or less difficult 
to satisfy, having regard to the event in question.
Any use of the above discretion would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration and may, where appropriate and practicable, be the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a 
change in legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is broadly in line with the Remuneration Policy for all Xafinity’s employees and any differences arise from differences in 
responsibilities and market practice.
Remuneration Policy on Recruitment
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of 
high calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to apply the 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors as set out above and structure a package in accordance with that Policy. Consistent with the DRR 
Regulations, any caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage 
exceeding these caps in practice unless absolutely necessary.
The annual bonus plan and PSP, including the maximum award levels, will operate as detailed in the general Remuneration Policy in relation to any 
newly-appointed Executive Director. For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For both external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers 
appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards forfeited by the 
individual on leaving a previous employer. Any recruitment-related awards which are not buy-outs will be subject to the limits of the annual bonus 
plan and PSP as stated in the general policy. Details of any recruitment-related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is necessary in the view of the Committee and will be limited in value to what the 
Committee considers to be a fair estimate of the value of the awards foregone. The Committee will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to 
deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing annual bonus plan and PSP. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out 
awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual bonus plan and PSP. Strategic Report
Company Information
Financial Statements
Governance
41
All buy-outs, whether under the annual bonus plan, PSP or otherwise, will take due account of the service obligations and performance 
requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous employer. The Committee will seek, where it is 
practicable to do so, to make buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and performance. 
However, the Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases, such as where the service and/or performance requirements are 
materially completed, or where such factors are, in the view of the Committee, reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to the 
face value of the awards forfeited, and where the Committee considers it to be in the interests of shareholders.
Service Contracts
Executive Directors
Each of the Executive Directors entered into a service agreement with the Company that was effective upon Admission and dated 
16 February 2017. The policy is that each Executive Director’s service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination by the 
Company or the individual on no more than 12 months’ notice. However, the Committee reserves flexibility to alter these principles if necessary to 
secure the recruitment of an appropriate candidate and if appropriate introduce a longer initial notice period of up to 2 years (reducing over time 
to no more than 12 months).
The service agreements of all Executive Directors, which are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, comply with this policy: 
• The Executive Directors’ service agreements are terminable by either party on not less than 9 months’ written notice (6 months for CFO and 
Head of Pensions) or immediately upon payment in lieu of notice, and contains a garden leave clause.
• In each case any payment in lieu of notice will be calculated by reference to base salary and contractual benefits only and will not include any 
entitlement to bonus. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are subject to the terms of letters of appointment agreed between each of them and 
the Company dated 24 January 2017. They are not entitled to receive any compensation on termination of their appointment (other than payment 
in respect of a notice period where notice is served) and are not entitled to participate in the Company’s share plans, bonus arrangements or 
pension schemes. They are entitled to be reimbursed all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the proper performance of their duties.
Their appointment may be terminated at any time upon 3 months’ written notice by either party and with immediate effect in certain 
circumstances. The appointment may also be terminated pursuant to the Articles or as otherwise required by law. They are subject to retirement 
by rotation every 3 years under the Articles but intend to retire and submit themselves for re-election by shareholders each year at the 
annual general meeting.
Remuneration Policy on Termination
The Committee will consider treatments on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time. This 
policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any treatments that the Committee may choose to apply 
under the discretions available to it under the terms of the annual bonus plan and PSP. The potential treatments on termination under these plans 
are as follows:
Annual Bonus Plan
If an Executive Director resigns or is dismissed for cause before the bonus payment date, the right to receive any bonus normally lapses (unless the 
Committee determines otherwise). If an Executive Director ceases employment before the bonus date because of death, injury, ill health, disability 
or any other reason determined by the Committee, such bonus will be payable as the Committee in its absolute discretion determines taking into 
account the circumstances for leaving, time in employment and performance. Similar treatment will apply in the event of a change in control of 
the Company.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee’s Policy is in accordance with the rules of the Performance Share Plan 2017 and summarised in the Xafinity Prospectus published 
in February 2017. If, during the performance or vesting period, a participant:
• resigns or is dismissed for cause, awards will normally lapse in full; and
• ceases to be employed due to death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement with the agreement of the participant’s employer, redundancy, 
the sale or transfer of the participant’s employing company or business out of the Group (other than on change of control), or for other 
reasons specifically approved by the Committee, the award will vest immediately to the extent that the Committee determines. The Committee 
will determine the extent to which an award will vest taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been met and, 
where appropriate, the period that has expired to the date of cessation.
The all-staff Share Save scheme provides treatments for leavers in line with HMRC rules for such plans.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims. In 
addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, the Company may make a contribution 
towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part 
of the detail of termination arrangements. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
External Appointments
The Company’s policy on external appointments permits an Executive Director, subject to the approval of the Chairman, to serve as a non-
executive director for normally no more than one other organisation where this does not conflict with the individual’s duties to the Company. 
When an Executive Director takes such a role, they may be entitled to retain any fees which they earn from that appointment.
Differences between the Policy in respect of Remuneration for Directors and the Policy on  
Remuneration for Other Staff
Pay and employment conditions generally in the Company will be taken into account when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration. The 
Committee will receive regular updates on overall pay and conditions in the Company, including (but not limited to) changes in base pay and any 
staff bonuses in operation. There is also oversight of the all-employee share plans in which Executive Directors and all other staff can participate 
on the same terms and conditions. Reflecting standard practice, the Company does not currently consult with staff in drawing up the Company’s 
Remuneration Report or when determining the underlying policy, although it will continue to monitor developments in this area.
Statement of Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above. Annual salary reviews across the 
Company take into account Company performance, relevant pay and market conditions and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies.
Other members of senior management participate in similar annual bonus arrangements to the Executive Directors, although award sizes vary by 
organisational level. PSP awards may also be granted to a broader population than the Executive Directors. The Company operates discretionary 
bonus schemes for eligible groups of employees under which a bonus is payable subject to the achievement of appropriate targets. All eligible 
employees may participate in the Company’s Share Save scheme on identical terms.
Statement of Consideration of Shareholders’ Views
The 2017 AGM is the first occasion at which the Company will seek the formal support of its shareholders on matters relating to the remuneration 
of Directors. The Committee will ensure that it considers all of the feedback which it receives from its shareholders during this process.
Illustrations of Application of the Remuneration Policy
The charts below show how the Remuneration Policy set out above will be applied for Executive Directors in the financial year 2017/18 based on 3 
performance scenarios and using the assumptions below. There are no plans to make an award under the Performance Share Plan but the charts 
– in respect of target and maximum performance – illustrate the impact of awards under the Plan.
Minimum • Consists of base salary, benefits and pension
• Base salary is the salary to be paid in the 2017/18 financial year
• Benefits measured as benefits paid in the year ending 31 March 2017
• Pension measured as the defined contribution or cash allowance in lieu of Company contributions of 6-8% of salary
Target Based on what the Executive Director would receive if performance was on-target (excluding share price appreciation and 
dividends):
• Annual Bonus: consists of the on-target bonus (50% of maximum opportunity used for illustrative purposes).
• PSP: consists of the threshold level of vesting (25% vesting) under the PSP 
Maximum Based on the maximum remuneration receivable (excluding share price appreciation and dividends):
• Annual Bonus: consists of maximum bonus of 150% of salary for the Co-CEOs and 112.5% of salary for the other 
maximum Executive Directors
• PSP: consists of the face value of awards (150% of base salary for Co-CEOs and 125% of base salary for the other 
Executive Directors) under the PSP

the Company Chairman and Alan Bannatyne, an Independent Non-Executive Director, are also members of the Committee.
Other individuals, such as the Co-Chief Executive Officers, the Chief Financial Officer, Head of HR and external professional advisers may be 
invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate and necessary.
The purpose of the Committee is to establish a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on remuneration in accordance with the 
Code and to set the remuneration of the Chairman and selected individuals with due account taken of all relevant factors such as individual and 
Group performance, remuneration payable by companies of a comparable size and complexity. The Committee meets at least twice a year and at 
such other times as the Chairman of the Committee shall require or as the Board may direct.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which can be viewed on the Company’s website: www.xafinity.com
Advisers
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (“FIT”), signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, were appointed by the Committee 
towards the end of the year following an invitation to tender. FIT has been retained to provide advice to the Committee on matters relating to executive 
remuneration. FIT provided no other services to the Company and, accordingly, the Committee was satisfied that the advice provided by FIT was 
objective and independent. No work was requested by the Committee of the adviser during the financial year and hence FIT’s fees in respect of the 
2016/17 financial year were nil. FIT’s fees will be charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2016/17 Annual Bonus (audited)
The 2017 amounts relate to the Company bonus scheme under which the targets were set at the beginning of the financial year prior to 
Admission. Pay outs under the scheme were based on the Group’s adjusted EBITDA performance relative to budget.
The Committee has not disclosed the targets for these bonus awards as the targets were set at a time when the Company was private and in 
private equity ownership. The Board considers the underlying targets remain commercially sensitive. In other words we think that there is a risk 
that our competitors may be able to use the information to their advantage. It will, however, be the Committee’s policy going forward to disclose 
annual bonus targets retrospectively, at the same time as the performance outcome is disclosed in the Remuneration Report after the end of each 
financial year provided that they are not considered commercially sensitive.
This performance resulted in recommended annual bonuses of £30,999 (£60,999 with the addition of a one-off payment in lieu of a salary 
increase on his promotion to Joint Managing Director on 1 April 2016) for Ben Bramhall and £15,501 for Paul Cuff, with £14,880 payable to 
Michael Ainslie and £17,670 to Jonathan Bernstein. As a % of salary, the bonuses range from 8% to 15.5%.

These awards comprise nominal cost options with an exercise price of 0.05p per option and vest in 2020 following announcement of annual 
results in 2020 subject to performance relating to (i) adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) (see note 5 to the Financial Statements for calculations)
targets as to 50% of the award, and (ii) Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets as to the remaining 50% of the award. The original 
intention, as disclosed in the Prospectus, was that the EPS target range should be as shown in brackets below. With the agreement of the 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee has raised the level of EPS growth required in the light of the strategic business planning work 
done since February 2017. The details of the new target range is shown in the table below. There has been no change to the operation of the 
relative TSR measure for Executive Directors.

• Michael Ainslie: £210,000

Benefits in kind
Benefits will be paid in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Details of the benefits received by Executive Directors are set out in the single 
figure table on page 44.
There is no intention to introduce additional benefits in 2018.
Pension
Contribution rates will be between 6% and 8% of base salary depending on age. For 2018 there will be no changes except those driven by age 
thresholds. Contributions may be made as cash supplements in full or in part.
Annual Bonus
Bonus maxima of 150% of salary will be applied for the Co-Chief Executive Officers and 112.5% for the other Executive Directors.
70% of the bonus will be payable by reference to performance against Group PBT, with performance against personal/strategic targets 
determining the extent to which the remaining 30% of the overall bonus opportunity is payable.
In addition: 
• no bonus will be payable unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s underlying performance warrants it; and
• as set out in the policy table, bonus payments will also be subject to the Committee considering that the proposed bonus amounts, calculated 
by reference to performance against the targets, appropriately reflect the Company’s overall performance and shareholders’ experience. If the 
Committee does not believe this to be the case, it may adjust the bonus outturn accordingly.
Owing to the Board’s concerns about commercial sensitivity, we do not believe it is in shareholders’ interests to disclose any further details of 
these targets on a prospective basis. However, the Company is committed to adhering to principles of transparency and will, provided disclosure 
of targets is not deemed to be commercially sensitive, make appropriate and relevant levels of disclosure of bonus targets and performance 
against these targets for the 2018 bonus in next year’s report.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group Financial Statements and have elected to prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance;
• Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• Prepare a directors’ report, a strategic report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm that they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. When arriving at this 
position the Board was assisted by a number of processes, including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate senior management with overall coordination by the Chief Financial Officer and Financial 
Controller to ensure consistency across sections;
• an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual accuracy;
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the report are undertaken by members of the Executive Board and senior management team; and
• the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to consideration by the Board.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board:

Capital structure
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital and total voting rights on Admission, at 31 March 2017 and the date of this report were 
136,896,244 ordinary shares (each with a par value of £0.0005 and all fully paid). There were no ordinary shares held in treasury. Further details 
of the Company’s issued share capital are given in note 26 on page 78.
The Company’s ordinary shares rank pari passu in all respects with each other, including for voting purposes and for all dividends. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. Further information on the voting and other rights of shareholders, including 
deadlines for exercising voting rights, are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association and in the explanatory notes that accompany the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting, which are available on the Company’s website at www.xafinity.com
Restrictions on shares
The Company’s ordinary shares are freely transferable and there are no restrictions on the size of a holding. Transfers of shares are governed by 
the provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The ordinary shares are not redeemable; however, the Company may 
purchase any of the ordinary shares, subject to prevailing legislation and the requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights. Awards of shares under the Company’s Performance Share Plan incentive arrangement are subject to restrictions on 
the transfer of shares prior to vesting. As disclosed in the Company’s IPO Prospectus, the executive Directors, senior managers and certain Group 
employees who held ordinary shares directly in the Company at the time of Admission, or who received a beneficial interest in the Company’s 
ordinary shares as a result of the vesting on Admission of share incentive plan awards previously granted to them, have each undertaken, for a 
period of 12 months from the date of Admission without the prior written consent of Zeus Capital, not to offer, lend, mortgage, assign, charge, 
sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any ordinary shares or any interest therein.
The Trustee of the Xafinity Employee Benefit Trust holds 1,836,758 ordinary shares in the Company but does not seek to exercise the voting rights 
on those shares.

Appointment and retirement of Directors
The Board may from time to time appoint one or more additional Directors so long as the total number of Directors does not exceed the limit 
prescribed in the Articles of Association. Any person so appointed will retire at the next Annual General Meeting and then be eligible for 
re-election. The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that all Directors be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Therefore, being 
eligible, all Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Powers of Directors
The business of the Company shall be managed by the Directors, who may exercise all powers of the Company, subject to legislation, the 
provisions of the Articles of Association and any directions given by special resolution. The Articles of Association contain specific provisions 
governing the Company’s power to borrow money and also provide the powers to issue shares and to make purchases of its own shares. As set 
out in the Prospectus for Admission, the Directors are authorised, within certain limits, to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares in the 
Company and to make market purchases of the Company’s own shares representing up to 10% of its share capital at that time. Details of the 
proposed renewal of authorities of the Directors are set out in the Notice of AGM.

Political donations
No political contributions were made, or political expenditure incurred, by the Company and its subsidiaries during the year (2016: £nil).
Employment of disabled persons
The Group continues to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind their aptitudes and 
abilities. In the event of an employee becoming disabled whilst working for the Group, every effort will be made by the Group to ensure their 
continued employment and to provide re-training where practicable and appropriate. The policy of the Group is that training, career development 
and promotion should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees. 
Provisions on change of control
The Company is subject to change of control provisions in the following significant agreements:
The Company’s £38m agreement with HSBC Bank plc for a £15m term loan facility and a £23m multicurrency revolving facility, with a further 
uncommitted facility of up to £10m, includes a customary provision for a lending counterparty to amend, alter or cancel the relevant commitment 
to the Group following a change of control of the Company.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide specific compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s Performance Share Plan incentive arrangement may cause awards 
to vest on a takeover.
Articles of Association
A copy of the full Articles of Association are available upon request from the Company Secretary. The Company’s Articles of Association may only 
be amended by a special resolution of shareholders in a general meeting.
Viability Statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the reports 
referred to in the Overview section on page 49 of this Directors’ report.
The Directors have assessed the long-term prospects of the Group based upon business plans and upon cash flow projections for the three-year 
period ending 31 March 2020. The three-year period was chosen as it is considered the longest timeframe over which any reasonable view can be 
formed. The forecasts and cash flow projections being used to assess going concern have been comprehensively stress-tested by using simulation 
techniques involving sensitivity analysis. It should be noted that the Group has limited forward visibility and consequently there is a high degree of 
uncertainty in respect of future outcomes.
In forming their opinion the Directors have performed a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group as set out on 
pages 24 and 25. In addition, Note 2 on page 67 of the accounts includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives and its exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group had £4.9m of cash at 31 March 2017 and a £38m committed financing facility until February 2022. Further details of the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described within the Financial Statements and notes.
The Group has a strong balance sheet, access to financial resources and long term growth prospects. As a consequence, the Directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
assessment period. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditor and disclosure of information to the Auditor
In accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the Directors who were members of the Board at the date of the approval of 
this report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Director has taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The Company’s auditor, BDO LLP, has expressed its willingness to continue in office and the Board has agreed, based on the recommendation of 
the Audit and Risk Committee, that a resolution for their reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the 
group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by 
the European Union;
• the parent company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of financial 
position, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group and parent company Financial Statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement and overview of the scope of our audit 
A description of the scope of an audit of Financial Statements is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the group’s system of internal control, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements at the group level.
We set out below the risks that had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and scope. The Risk and Audit Committee’s consideration of these 
matters is set out on page 33:

Xafinity plc Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Revenue recognition and accrued income
Risk
The Group generates revenue from pension advisory, 
administration and investment consulting services as well as 
providing independent trustee, SSAS and SIPP services and 
corporate healthcare advice. 
Dependent upon the income stream and nature of the 
engagement, revenue is recognised on either a time costs incurred, 
fixed fee or rateably over the period of providing the service basis. 
Billing occurs on a monthly, quarterly or, in the case of SSAS and 
SIPP services, on an annual basis. Services may be billed in arrears, 
as in the case of pensions advisory work, or in advance as is the 
case with SSAS and SIPP revenues.
Based on the above revenue is accrued or deferred appropriately.
Risks over revenue recognition include:
• Inherent fraud risk in respect of overstatement of revenue and 
accrued income and the understatement of deferred revenue;
• Incorrect calculation of deferred revenue on SSAS services;
• Recoverability of accrued income in respect of pension advisory 
services;
• Completeness of revenue captured within the timecard system 
and subsequently recorded in the accounting system.
Response
We reviewed the Group’s revenue streams and the revenue recognition 
policy applied to each and ensured they are in accordance with IAS18 
‘Revenue’. 
We reviewed revenue transactions which did not appear to arise from 
standard billing arrangements. In doing so we engaged the use of our IT 
audit specialists who performed computer assisted audit testing as part 
of our audit procedures.
We tested revenue for each material income stream using substantive 
procedures to check the existence of revenue and that it was accurately 
recorded. 
We tested the recoverability of accrued income through a review of the 
subsequent billing and cash receipt. We tested deferred income by 
re-calculating all deferrals and reviewing for revenue deferrals not made. 
We reviewed the completeness of timecards recorded within the timecard 
system and the subsequent recognition of related revenue within the 
accounting system.
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the amount of 
revenue recognised.
Professional indemnity claims
Risk
Due to the industry in which the Group operates there is a risk of 
possible professional indemnity claims, leading to potential 
provisions and contingent liabilities which may require disclosure in 
or adjustment to the Financial Statements.
The Group’s exposure is limited to the excess per claim where the 
claim is covered by the Group’s insurance policy.
Response
We made enquiries of management, reviewed management’s records of 
all ongoing claims, reviewed board minutes and correspondence to check 
completeness of that population. We conducted a review of significant 
legal fees incurred to highlight claims in progress.
We obtained confirmation from the Group’s solicitors of the estimated costs 
to settle a sample of claims which are ongoing or recently settled to ensure 
that they are recorded or disclosed in the Financial Statements in accordance 
with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.
We also reviewed the listing of claims for potential understatement and 
selected a sample of other claims to review in more detail.
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the recognition 
or disclosure of provisions.
Listing fees, share issue costs and other exceptional items
Risk
Significant costs were incurred in the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) 
process. There is a risk these fees are not correctly accounted for as 
either a deduction to share premium or a charge to the statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Furthermore, there is a risk that non-IPO related costs may be 
incorrectly included within exceptional costs.
 
Response
We reviewed the IPO related costs incurred and agreed a sample of costs 
to supporting documentation. We considered the appropriateness of the 
treatment of fees in accordance with the accounting standards.
 
We reviewed and agreed management’s basis of apportioning the listing 
costs between a deduction to share premium and a charge to the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
We reviewed other costs categorised as exceptional and agreed their 
treatment. 
 
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the amounts or 
classification of exceptional items.

Audit Scope
The Group comprises the parent company and 4 trading subsidiaries, Xafinity Consulting Limited, Xafinity SIPP Services Limited, HR Trustees 
Limited and Hazell Carr (AT) Services Limited and 3 intermediate holding companies. All subsidiary entities are based in the United Kingdom and 
full scope audits of those components were carried out by BDO LLP. The company also controls a Jersey based trust which contains the group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust. The component was also subject to a full scope audit by us for the purposes of the group audit. There have been no 
significant changes in scope since the prior year.
 
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For planning, we 
consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable 
users that are taken on the basis of the Financial Statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any 
misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. 
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified 
misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the Financial Statements as a whole.
The materiality for the group Financial Statements as a whole was set at £500,000. This was determined with reference to the group’s EBITDA 
prior to exceptional costs and share-based payment costs (of which it represents 3%). EBITDA prior to exceptional costs and share-based payment 
costs is considered the most appropriate measure in assessing the performance of the group given the transition of the business from a highly 
geared Private Equity owned business to a UK Listed plc during the latter part of the year.
Performance materiality was set at 75% of the above materiality levels.
Where financial information from components was audited separately, component materiality levels were set for this purpose at lower levels 
varying from 3% to 95% of group materiality. 
Materiality has reduced by 37.5% from the previous year to reflect the shift from a privately owned group to a UK Listed plc.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the committee all individual audit differences in excess of £25,000. We also agreed 
to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Financial Statements; and
• the strategic report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and
• the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements; and
• information about the company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies 
and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA rules.
Statement regarding the directors’ assessment of principal risks, going concern and longer term viability 
of the company
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the Financial Statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements; or
• the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Report and Accounts is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Report and 
Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Report and Accounts appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its 
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in:
• the strategic report or the directors’ report; and
• the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial 
reporting processes and share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of 
the FCA Rules.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company Financial Statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the company.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority for review by the auditor. The Listing 
Rules also require that we review the directors’ statements set out on pages 51 regarding going 
concern and longer term viability.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.

1 Accounting policies
Xafinity plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in the UK. On 6 February 2017 Xafinity Group Holdings (Reading) Limited 
changed its name to Xafinity plc and the Company re-registered as a public limited company. The principal activity of the Group is employee 
benefit consultancy and related business services. The registered office is Phoenix House, 1 Station Hill, Reading RG1 1NB. The Group Financial 
Statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
Basis of preparation and Statement of compliance with IFRS
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS - IC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the going concern basis. 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed at the end of this section.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently 
applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Functional and presentation currency
The Financial Statements are presented in British Pounds which is the Company’s functional currency. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Measurement convention
The financial information is prepared on the historical cost basis except for the measurement of certain financial instruments.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all 3 of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to 
affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any elements 
of control.
De-facto control exists in situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding 
the majority of the voting rights. In determining whether defacto control exists the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances, 
including:
• The size of the Company’s voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights
• Substantive potential voting rights held by the Company and by other parties
• Other contractual arrangements
• Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial information presents the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘‘the Group’’) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of 
financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. The results of the acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control 
is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives have been used to hedge the Group’s exposure to fair value interest rate risk. The hedged item is remeasured to take into account the 
gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk with the gains or losses arising recognised in profit or loss. This offsets the gain or loss arising on the 
hedging instrument which is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Third party valuations are used to fair value the Group’s derivatives.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. For items acquired as part of a business combination, cost 
comprises the deemed fair value of those items at the date of acquisition. Depreciation on those items is charged over their estimated remaining 
useful lives from that date.
Depreciation is charged to profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Office equipment   3 to 10 years
• Leasehold improvements  5 years
• Fixtures and fittings  3 to 10 years

Going concern
Accounting standards require the Directors to consider the appropriateness of the going concern basis when preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Directors have taken notice of the Financial Reporting Council guidance ‘Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2010’ which requires the reasons for this decision to be explained.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period including 12 months from the date of approval of these Financial Statements which 
show that during that period the Group is expected to generate sufficient cash from its operations to settle its liabilities as they fall due without the 
requirement for additional borrowings. Therefore the Directors conclude that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired on a business combination. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise 
from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment 
testing and is not amortised. It is tested annually for impairment.
Externally acquired intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired software is valued based on replacement cost valuations where identifiable or at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. 
Internally produced software is valued at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Customer relationships are valued based on the net present value of the excess earnings generated by the revenue streams over their estimated 
useful lives.
Brands valuation is based on net present value of estimated royalty returns.
Amortisation is charged to profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive income over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless 
such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are systematically tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Goodwill   Indefinite life
• Customer relationships  10 years, reducing balance method
• Brands    10 years, straight line method
• Software   3 to 4 years, straight line method
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use, are not subject to amortisation and are 
tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes 
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into 1 of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The 
Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives (see “Financial liabilities” section for out-of-money derivatives). They are carried in the 
statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the 
finance income or expense line. Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments, the Group does not 
have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and other receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment 
and are included in non-current assets as their maturity is greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Trade receivables are stated initially at fair value then measured at amortised cost less provisions for impairment. Provisions for impairment are 
recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. The impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the estimated future cash flows 
discounted where appropriate. Any impairment required is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income within administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.

Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into 1 of 2 categories, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired. The Group’s 
accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives (see “Financial assets” for in-the-money derivatives). They are carried in the 
consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes, but for hedging purposes. Other than these derivative 
financial instruments, the Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. When borrowings are extinguished, any difference 
between the cash paid and the carrying value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade payables and other short term monetary liabilities represent liabilities for goods and services received by the Group prior to the end of the 
financial year which are unpaid. The amounts within trade payables are unsecured. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Dilapidations provisions relate to the estimated cost to put leased premises back to the required condition expected under the terms of the lease. 
These include provisions for wear and tear along with provisions where leasehold improvements have been made that would require 
reinstatement back to the original status on exit. These are uncertain in timing as leases may be terminated early or extended. To the extent that 
exits of premises are expected within 12 months of the end of the year they are shown as current.
Professional indemnity provisions relate to complaints against the Group. The amount provided is based on management’s best estimate of the 
likely liability and is capped to the excess on the Group’s professional indemnity insurance on a case by case basis where covered and settled  
on a net basis.
Social security costs provisions represent estimates of the Group’s national insurance contributions liability on the cost of the Group’s Performance 
Share Plan.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.
Retirement benefits: Defined contribution schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year to which 
they relate.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
As the Group is deemed to have control of its EBT, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The EBT’s investment in the Group’s shares is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial position as if it were 
treasury shares. Consideration paid (or received) for the purchase (or sale) of these shares is recognised directly in equity. The cost of shares held is 
presented as a separate reserve (the “investment in own shares”). Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of these shares over the 
weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to retained earnings.
The equity-settled share-based payment expense represents the amount of share awards made by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Company 
as instructed by the Company. Proceeds from the subsequent sale of the share awards were transferred to employees via payroll on their behalf the 
values being based on the share price at IPO.
EBT equity settled awards, which vest immediately on issue, are measured at the fair value of the shares issued on the date of the award, representing 
the bid price of the shares, the share based payment expense is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the 
directors and in the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, represents the invoiced value of employee benefit consultancy and related business services supplied. 
Revenue is derived mainly from sales made in the United Kingdom. Revenue derived from outside the United Kingdom is immaterial. 
 
Amounts recognised as revenue but not yet billed are reflected in the statement of financial position as accrued income. Amounts billed in 
advance of work performed are deferred in the statement of financial position as deferred income. 
 
Revenue in respect of time and materials contracts is recognised as the services are performed. Revenue relating to fixed fee contracts is 
recognised evenly over the contract period. Commission income is recognised on renewal of scheme membership. 
Expenses
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs are items which due to their size, incidence and non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw them to 
the attention of the reader of the Financial Statements and, in management’s judgement, to show more accurately the underlying profits of the 
Group. Such items are included within the statement of comprehensive income caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed in the 
notes to the Financial Statements.
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease 
expense and are spread over the term of the lease.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Foreign exchange policy
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the functional currency (GBP) are recorded at the rates ruling when the 
transactions occur.
Any exchange rate differences are recognised immediately through the statement of comprehensive income.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs comprise interest payable, interest receivable on own funds, gains and/or losses on the Group’s interest rate swaps, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and costs directly related to the raising of loans.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Share-based payment costs - Performance Share Plan
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the entity receives services from the executive directors in 
consideration for equity instruments of the Group. The fair value of the director services received in exchange for the grant of the awards is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted:
• including any market performance conditions (for example, an entity’s share price); and
• including the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability and remaining a director for a 
specified period of time);
• Share-based payment costs in respect of the Performance Share Plan in the year were not material.
Share-based payment costs in respect of the Performance Share Plan in the year were not material.
See the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) policy above for information on the Employee Benefit Trust element of share-based payment costs. 
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive 
income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are not effective for 2017, and therefore have not been applied in 
preparing Xafinity’s Financial Statements.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all 3 aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: 
classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, 
with early application permitted.
IFRS 9 requires the Company to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12-month or 
lifetime basis. The Company expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables. 
The Company plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. The Company is still assessing the impact on its balance sheet or 
equity on applying the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a 5-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, 
revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or 
services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application or a 
modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company plans to adopt the new 
standard on the required effective date. The Company has not yet performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15, but plans to do so by 
December 2017, which will then be subject to changes arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis. Once the analysis is performed, the 
transition method will be chosen. Based on the current sales contracts, both methods are feasible from implementation perspective. Furthermore, 
the Company is considering the clarifications issued by the IASB in April 2016 and will monitor any further developments.
• IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 
Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the 
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single 
on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes 2 recognition exemptions for lessees – 
leases of ‘low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the 
commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the 
right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest 
expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a change in 
future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the 
amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, subject to endorsement by the European Union. Early application is 
permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified 
retrospective approach. The standard’s transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
The Group has entered into a number of long term leases in respect of land and buildings. The Group has assessed the leases under IFRS 16 and 
expects an impact as the right of use assets and lease liabilities will come onto the consolidated statement of financial position for the first time in 
respect of its current operating leases. The Group expects that IFRS 16 will have an impact on the Financial Statements of the Group, however the 
Group are currently assessing the impact. To see the volume of operating leases please see Note 29 to the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 for more information.
Xafinity is currently reviewing the impact of the above-mentioned Standards and Interpretations and is yet to conclude on whether any such 
standards will have a significant impact on the Financial Statements of the Group in the year of initial application.
The other standards, interpretations and amendments issued by the IASB (of which some still subject to endorsement by the European Union), but 
not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Fair values of intangible assets
Goodwill and intangibles are tested for impairment at the cash generating unit level on an annual basis at the year end and between annual tests 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a cash generating unit below its carrying 
value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, 
competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of cash generating units, assignment of assets and 
liabilities to such units, assignment of goodwill to such units and determination of the fair value of a unit. The fair value of each cash generating 
unit or asset is estimated using the income approach, on a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, 
including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the business, 
estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based 
upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Throughout the current and prior 
periods the directors consider that the IAS 12 recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Provisions
Dilapidations provisions have been made for properties which the Group currently lease based upon the cost to make good the property in 
accordance with lease terms where applicable. Provisions are made for claims in respect of complaints against the Group. The amount provided is 
based on management’s best estimate of the likely liability. The cost to the business is capped to the excess on the Group’s professional indemnity 
insurance in respect of each individual claim.
Useful lives of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives with the charge recorded in administrative expenses. Useful lives are based on 
management’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. 
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the consolidated income statement in 
specific periods.
Business combinations
The Directors determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business 
combination date. The purchase price allocation process requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the estimated fair 
value of the acquired intangible assets.
While the Directors use their best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Examples of 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
• future expected Cash flows from customer relationships and brands
• the fair value of the property, plant and equipment; and
• discount rates
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs are recognised to the extent that they meet the definition outlined in the accounting policy above. This requires a certain 
amount of judgement that is applied consistently by management.

2 Financial risk management
The Xafinity Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk and the effects of changes in interest rates 
on debt. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group 
by monitoring levels of debt finance and the related finance costs.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise sterling cash, bank deposits, bank loans, overdrafts and shareholder loans together with 
trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 
• credit risk
• liquidity risk
• market risk
• cash flow interest rate risk
Risk management policies are established for the Xafinity group of companies and the Group Audit Committee oversees how management 
monitors compliance with these policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks 
faced by the Group. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty, including brokers, to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Due to the nature of the business the majority of the trade receivables are with trustees of pension schemes and large institutions and losses have 
occurred infrequently over previous years.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is 
to ensure, as far as possible, that the Group will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates and equity prices will effect the Group’s income or the value of 
its financial instruments. Interest rate risks are discussed in the cash flow interest rate risk below.
The Group’s financial instruments are currently in sterling, hence foreign exchange movements do not have a material effect on the 
Group’s performance.
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rate in its net finance costs and also in a small element of its operating revenue. Senior loans are 
linked to LIBOR. The Group earns income in relation to client and shareholder deposits as well as interest income on its own deposits.
Exposure to interest rate fluctuations are partly managed through the use of interest rate swaps. Objectives are established by the Board so as to 
seek to reduce the impact of variations in interest rates on the Group’s profit and cash flow.
During the majority of the year the Group’s senior bank debt was covered by fixed interest rates, achieved by way of a financial instrument 
(interest rate swap). The balance of bank debt interest is at current market rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present 
value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.
The Group does not hold its own position in trading securities, being involved only in arranging transactions on behalf of its clients.
The Group does not engage in holding speculative financial instruments or derivatives. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Xafinity Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in 2 main respects. Firstly corporate and client bank deposits, which earn interest at a 
variable rate, although not at a material level. Secondly, interest expense arising on bank facilities at a margin over LIBOR. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

3 Capital risk management
The Group is focused on delivering value for its shareholders whilst ensuring the Group is able to continue effectively as a going concern. Value 
adding opportunities to grow the business are continually assessed, although strict and careful criteria are applied.
The policies for managing capital are to increase shareholder value by maximising profits and cash. The policy is to set budgets and forecasts in 
the short and medium term that the Group feels are achievable. The process for managing capital are regular reviews of financial data to ensure 
that the Group is tracking the targets set and to reforecast as necessary based on the most up to date information. This then contributes to the 
Xafinity Group’s forecast which ensures future covenant test points are met. The Group continues to meet these test points and they have been 
achieved over the last year.
Due to the nature of some of the services provided, 2 subsidiaries within the Group are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). They 
are required to hold a minimum level of capital and this is monitored on a monthly basis. Formal compliance returns are submitted to the FCA in 
line with their reporting requirements.

IPO costs comprise the expenses incurred to get the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The professional indemnity related claim is a 
provision for a potential claim in respect of the administration of a particular scheme and is exceptional in nature due to its size. The potential 
liability is capped at £500,000 being the value of the insurance policy excess. The restructuring costs are mainly made up of redundancy costs. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

7 Operating segments
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, an operating segment is defined as a business activity whose operating results are reviewed by 
the chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’) and for which discrete information is available. The Group’s CODM is the Board of Directors.
The Group has several operating segments based on geographical location and revenue streams, but 1 reporting segment due to the nature of 
services provided across the whole business being the same, pension and employee benefit solutions. The Group’s revenues, costs, assets, 
liabilities and cash flows are therefore totally attributable to this reporting segment.

The cash flows in respect of the equity share-based payment expense awarded by the Employee Benefit Trust were operated by the Group on 
behalf of the employees and processed through the Group’s payroll making the necessary tax deductions and delivering the proceeds to the 
relevant individuals. 8,975,000 shares were sold on behalf of staff and directors at a price of £1.39 per share.
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) award expense relates to annual awards over shares that vest subject to certain, stretching performance 
conditions, measured over a 3-year period. Maximum “normal” grant level is 150% of salary, capped at a maximum of 200% in exceptional 
circumstances. Malus and clawback provisions apply. The fair value of awards granted during the year was determined using certain assumptions 
around vesting. More information about the PSP can be found in the Remuneration report section of this Annual Report. Xafinity Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Impairment test
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired on the purchase of the subsidiary companies 
listed in note 33. In accordance with IFRS, this balance is not amortised and is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill has been allocated 
to its cash generating unit which comprises Xafinity Consulting Limited, Xafinity SIPP Services Limited, Xafinity Pensions Consulting Limited and 
their subsidiaries.
The cash generating unit at each year/period end was assessed on the basis of value in use using the following assumptions, which reflect past 
experience of the Group:
2017 2016
Discount rate pre-tax 15% 12.5%
Terminal value after period 8 2.0% 2.0%
Period on which detailed forecasts are based 3 years 3 years
Growth rate during 3 year detailed forecast period (average) 5.5% 4.7%
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period to year 8 5.0% 5.8%
The growth rate beyond the forecast period is based on a blend of average growth rates experienced by the Group and management’s 
assessment of industry and macro-economic outlooks. Such forecast rates have been accurate in the past. Therefore the Directors believe they 
can be used. Strategic Report

Net interest rate swap derivative asset/(liability) – (102)
The Group previously entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising where it had borrowed at 
floating rates.
The Group no longer has any outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 March 2017. The notional principal amounts of the 2 interest rate swap 
contracts at 31 March 2016 were £36,292,000 and £18,129,000. Their net fair value was a liability of £102,000.
The net expense recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income that arises from movements in the fair value of the 
derivatives amounts to £402,000 (2016: £58,000).
The interest rate swap derivatives were valued by the financial institutions that issued the instruments and were calculated at the present value of 
the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield, using level 2 inputs. They were accounted for as fair value through profit and loss.

On 17 February 2017, as part of the IPO related re-financing exercise, the Group replaced its existing £86,000,000 bank loan with new senior 
debt of £15,000,000 and a drawn revolving credit facility of £18,000,000.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had access to a further undrawn rolling facility loan in the amount of £5,000,000 (2016: £3,000,000). The related 
fees for access to the facility are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Capitalised loan related costs are amortised over the life of the loan to which they relate.
Bank debt is secured by way of debentures in the group companies which are obligors to the loans. These are Xafinity (Reading) Limited, Xafinity 
Consulting (Reading) Limited, Xafinity Consulting Limited (and its subsidiaries), Xafinity Pension Consulting Limited (and its subsidiaries) and

The Group is involved in a number of potential professional indemnity claims. The amount provided represents the directors’ best estimate of the 
Group’s liability having taken legal advice. Uncertainties relate to whether claims will be settled out of court or if not whether the Group is 
successful in defending any action. Because of the nature of the disputes, the directors have not disclosed future information on the basis that 
they believe that this would be seriously prejudicial to the Group’s position in defending the cases brought against it.
The increase in professional indemnity provisions made in the period to March 2017 includes an exceptional charge of £0.5m to provide for a 
potential claim in respect of the administration of a particular scheme.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2017
Based on historic performance of these contracts, the Group believes that an impairment allowance of £229,000 (2015: £139,000) is adequate in 
respect of trade receivables. All impaired debts are more than 90 days past due. Those debts which have not been provided against are 
considered recoverable by the Group.
Cash flow risk
The Xafinity Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in 2 main respects. Firstly corporate and client bank deposits, which earn interest at a 
variable rate, although not at a material level. Secondly, interest expense arising on bank facilities at a margin over LIBOR.
Interest rate risk
The interest rate on long-term borrowings is a margin over LIBOR and as such the Company is at risk from LIBOR increases.
In the previous year, this risk has been mitigated by hedging 100% of the bank debt using 3 fixed rate interest rate swap derivatives. The rates 
were fixed at 0.671%, 1.079% and 0.895%. The net loss on the interest rate swap recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £402,000 (2016: £58,000).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk the 
Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
