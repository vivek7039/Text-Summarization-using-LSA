by expanding our network through organic growth and acquisition, 
we look forward to achieving this objective.

OUR HERITAGE AND MAJOR MILESTONES
When Kevin Hollinrake and John Waterhouse established Hunters 
in 1992, their vision was to develop the brand to become the 
largest estate agency group in the UK. 25 years later, they and their 
founding vision remain active within the Company and instrumental 
to its success. Hunters grew organically, offering sales and lettings 
through 10 owned branches. 2005 saw the beginning of a new phase 
with the development of its franchising expansion which, together 
with strategic acquisition, has seen the network grow to its current 
size. The services offered cover residential sales; lettings; buy-to-let 
and investment; residential block management; land and new homes; 
franchising and other property related services.
Hunters has won more than 30 awards; maintained Investor in 
People certification for more than a decade; twice been voted  
Best UK Estate Agent by the Home Sale Network (now the 
Relocation Agent Network) and featured in the Sunday Times  
Best 100 Companies.

Proven  
track record
of organic and acquisitive growth
Opening its first franchising branch in 2006, the Group acquired a 
network in 2011 whose branches have increased their respective 
annual revenue by 84%.
Hunters has driven growth organically, opening 114 branches in 
four years to December 2017 on top of its acquisition of Hunters 
Midlands in 2014, its acquisition in 2015 of the Country Properties 
franchised network and its acquisition in 2017 of the Besley Hill 
franchised network. Gross income of the Group’s Franchisee  
and owned branch network ("Network Income") increased 
between 2008 and 2017 by a compound annual growth rate  
of 27% (2016: 26%).
02 03 HUNTERS PROPERTY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Overview
Chairman’s statement
We are pleased to report that the Group has delivered a strong result in 2017. Network 
Income has increased by 10% despite subdued market conditions. The Group continued 
its expansion towards becoming the nation’s favourite estate agent. Organically, we believe 
we are the fastest growing listed business in our sector having opened 114 branches over 
the last four years and a further 46 branches through acquisition in that period.
In the year we added 37 (2016: 30) new branches to the network, 
including 15 (2016: 20) independent businesses, reaching 213 (2016: 
186) branches by the year end. This included the addition of the Besley 
Hill franchised network, expanding our coverage in the South West. 
We are pleased to report we have already rebranded those branches 
as Hunters, ahead of schedule, and we look forward to helping them to 
grow their business. We continue to attract good quality independent 
businesses who see the benefits of a support network, reduced 
operating costs and opportunities to improve their income. 
Gross income of the Group’s Franchisee and owned branch network 
(“Network Income”) reached £38.9 million in 2017 (2016: £35.4 million) 
a 10% increase on the previous year. Our average branch revenue 
is £182,000 (2016: £190,000). This was a tremendous achievement 
against the background of national sales activity having reduced by 15% 
for the year
1
. We have out-performed the market each year over the 
last three years by on average 10%. Our adjusted EBITDA reached 
£2.23 million (2016: £2.06 million) an increase of 8% on the previous 
year. Adjusted EPS is 5.84p (2016: 5.92p). 
We have out-performed the market each year over 
the last three years by on average 10%. 
Our model is about both the number and the underlying performance 
of our branches. We invest a great deal of time and resource helping 
to improve each branch’s revenue. Our outperformance against the 
market per branch reflects that investment, those improvements and 
then the underlying increased strength of the component parts of our 
network. This is not just a short-term success but a long-term strategy. 
Independent agents that converted to the Hunters brand during the 
three years to December 2015 have produced revenue in 2017 that 
is 29% higher; illustrating that our well known national brand, quality 
and good reputation has delivered improved revenue for our network

partners, even against a challenging backdrop as well as significantly 
reducing their cost of key operating costs, such as portal subscriptions, 
through our economies of scale and purchasing power. 
Customer satisfaction is always a key measure and at 95% customer 
satisfaction rating over the year (2016: 96%) is our sixth year in a row at 
over 90%, which remains significantly higher than the industry average 
of 73%
2
. Our business and our network partners commit to deliver 
for our customers. This underpins our belief that business owners will 
work harder and deliver better results than a network of employees, 
self-employed operatives on short-term contracts or those engaged to 
simply list a home rather than actually selling or letting a property. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone in the network who 
has worked so hard to deliver these excellent results and our customer 
service teams for working with our clients to help us “get them there”.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
We expect the current subdued levels of transactions to continue 
in 2018. Hunters’ performance to date in the year is in line with the 
Board’s expectations, given our more limited London exposure 
we are not expecting to be as affected as other players have 
reported already
3
 although we have built in an increase in churn 
for consolidation within this sector. We would expect this market 
to provide us with an enhanced opportunity to expand our 
branch network further and strengthen our brand. The case to 
encourage independent operators becomes even more persuasive 
in providing a way to be part of a stronger group that can also offer 
significant cost reductions, particularly in terms of portal charges for 
Rightmove, Zoopla and OnTheMarket. 
We are already seeing an improved level of enquiries from high 
quality independent businesses. Our robust balance sheet and 
relatively low level of gearing will enable us to both expand our 
network and reward shareholders with an attractive dividend. 
Our pipeline of new outlets remains healthy and I look forward to 
updating you as the year progresses.
DIVIDEND
The Company is committed to a progressive dividend policy and 
proposes an increased final dividend of 1.50p per share, making 
2.20p for the year, an increase of 16%.

The Directors believe that the Group has a number of key strengths underpinning 
past success and promoting strong prospects for growth.
ESTABLISHED BRAND
Established brand with strong reputation
Since the Company’s inception in 1992, Hunters has established 
a training academy which provides its own national qualification 
endorsed by Propertymark, formerly The Association of Residential 
Letting Agents and The National Association of Estate Agents. 
Hunters has a comprehensive national marketing campaign 
including prime TV advertising and has secured Investors in People 
accreditation for over a decade at Head Office level. This, alongside 
its strong reputation for good customer service, has added stature 
to the brand.
EXPERIENCED TEAM
An experienced management team with a  
long track record
The Group’s executive management has a long track record of 
operating both sales and lettings estate agencies, as owners and 
in developing estate agency franchises. This provides in-depth 
understanding of the skills required to manage an estate agency 
business and the challenges that their Franchisees may encounter.
SALES AND LETTINGS COMBINED
Strength in both sales and lettings 
Senior management has considerable experience running both sales 
and lettings and we believe this puts the Group at the forefront for 
independent businesses looking to expand their business or develop 
additional revenue streams.
POSITIONED FOR GROWTH
Proven track record of organic and acquisitive growth
Having opened its first franchising branch in 2006, the Group 
completed its acquisition of the former franchising arm of 
Countrywide plc in 2011. Hunters has driven growth organically, 
opening 114 branches in four years to December 2017 on top of its 
acquisitions of franchised networks, Country Properties in 2015 and 
Besley Hill this year. Network Income increased between 2008 and 
2017 by a compound annual growth rate of 27% (2016: 26%).
NATIONWIDE FOOTPRINT
A nationwide footprint throughout England
The Group has built a nationwide footprint over much of England. 
The Group is therefore not over-exposed to the performance of 
any one local property market.
ROBUST MODEL 
Proven franchise business model
Start-up costs are borne by Franchisees but the model makes use 
of investment made by Hunters. This generates scalable growth 
without committing significant capital. The franchise agreement(s) 
contains minimum monthly fee(s) due to the Group, regardless of 
the branch’s revenue, guaranteeing a minimum level of revenue.
The Group benefits from having owned branches through which  
it can trial and adapt new concepts before rolling them out across 
the network.
The Group implements a rigorous Franchisee selection process 
so as to ensure, as far as is possible, that new Franchisees are 
committed to the Group’s high standards. Underperforming 
branches can often be reinvigorated through either extended 
training or, if applicable, the sale of a franchise to a new team 
or individual.

Our network has grown to 213 branches 
(2016: 186 branches).
A NATIONAL RECOGNISED SALES AND 
LETTINGS BRAND
In 2017 Hunters has cemented its reputation as a 
recognised national brand. This has been achieved through 
a comprehensive and ongoing national marketing campaign 
that has included targeted and prime time TV advertising 
schedule, a digital marketing campaign and an increase in 
branches throughout the UK. Our TV advert reached 38% 
of the adult population throughout the year and Hunters 
achieved weekly coverage in national media for our 
properties and branches, key industry comments on trade 
platforms and highlights in leading lifestyle title through 
a comprehensive PR campaign. Our digital campaign 
delivered over 4 million impressions, raising the brand 
across social media and driving traffic to our website which sees 
an average of 240,000 visits per month, an increase of over 20% 
from 2016. Over 79% of site traffic in 2017 came from new visits, 
demonstrating our increasing appeal to new audiences.
ECONOMIES OF SCALE
Individual Franchisees and independent businesses benefit from 
centralised support services and improved buying rates, for example 
for portals, as compared to individual branch costs resulting in 
significant savings.
STRONG REPUTATION FOR CUSTOMER 
SERVICE, PUTTING THE CUSTOMER AT  
THE HEART OF OUR BUSINESS
Every sale/let is followed up by a call from our Customer Service 
Team to ensure that we always deliver on our promises. The 
results from the 4,155 customers who responded in 2017, show 
a 95% customer satisfaction rating; the national average for our 
industry is 73%
1
.
LEGISLATION & REGULATION
There are 160 pieces of legislation that lettings agents must comply 
with and over 400 regulations
2
. Being part of the Hunters network 
assists their compliance whilst also helping to alleviate the increasing 
strain of investigation and research that independent agents face in 
order to be compliant.
REVENUE GROWTH
Independent agents that converted to Hunters in the three years 
to December 2015, have now increased their revenue over the  
level that they were running at on average by 29%.
TRAINING
The Hunters Training Academy was established in 2006 and 
provides a combination of classroom training, E-Learning courses 
and video-based training. 
The courses have been written and designed by estate agents 
for estate agents, are suitable for first entrants in to the world of 
estate agency and progress through to specialised skills for career 
progression, including a suite of management training programmes. 
Hunters are now registered trainers for 
RentSmart Wales. 
We offer both classroom courses and E-Learning. The classroom-
based courses are interactive and designed for experienced and 
non-experienced staff alike and become a forum for interaction 
between staff from different branches nationwide, helping to create 
the team culture for which Hunters is renowned. We trained 1,195 
delegates across 114 classroom courses in 2017, which is an 89% 
increase in delegates trained.

Our strategy
Our objective is to become the UK’s favourite estate agency.
To achieve this goal we plan to pursue organic growth by adding franchise branches to our network and by increasing average performance 
of existing branches through a focus on customer and staff satisfaction, resulting in high levels of retention and recommendation. We will 
complement our organic growth initiatives by seeking targeted acquisitions.
Having added 114 branches organically in 
the four years to 2017, we see an attractive 
opportunity to expand further our network 
with new franchised branches. As one of the 
largest estate agency and lettings networks 
in the UK, the Group has developed 
sufficient infrastructure and support 
functions to manage a larger business.  
The Directors believe that a significant 
increase in the franchise network would 
require a materially smaller increase in 
central management resource whilst 
providing enhanced operational leverage.
“We aim to add up to 25 
agency businesses to the 
network each year.”
As well as growth of the Group’s network, 
the Directors target an average of 10% 
annual revenue growth from Franchisees. 
Strategies for increasing revenue at branch 
level include introducing sales services to 
branches with strong lettings businesses 
and vice versa; the improvement of 
operating practices; and on-going training 
of staff. The average revenue per branch 
is £182,000 (2016: £190,000), which was 
disappointing but good against a backdrop 
of the market being down 15%
1
. The top 25 
highest revenue branches average £459,000 
(2016: £458,000).
Our acquisition strategy is designed to 
complement the Group’s network and 
reinforce our geographical and strategic 
reach. Notable acquisitions include 
Countrywide’s former franchise operation 
(acquired in 2011), Hunters in the West 
Midlands (2014), Country Properties, in and 
around Hertfordshire (2015) and Besley 
Hill, in and around the Bristol area (March 
2017). The drive for market consolidation is 
covered by both organic growth conversions 
and the opportunity for acquisition.

THE HUNTERS TRAINING ACADEMY 
The Hunters Training Academy launched its vocational 
qualifications, HVQ endorsed by ARLA and NAEA in 
September 2016. These offer a range of courses suitable for 
agency businesses and are run as a combination of classroom 
and E-Learning courses and video-based training. Since the 
HVQ was launched 71 people and 7 branches have attained 
the qualification.
DRIVING VALUATIONS THROUGH  
OUR WEBSITE
Our automated Online System launched in July 2017 has 
received over 2,000 enquiries and directed over £5 million 
worth of property.  
We’re delighted to report that despite a softer market, our strategy has delivered an 
improved performance with an increase in branch numbers and a strong set of results.
Chief Executive’s statement
The Group has grown its market share of homes sold and let in 
2017. So despite market transaction volumes having reduced by 15% 
turnover, EBITDA and pre-tax profitability have increased. This was 
aided by our limited exposure to the London market and by the 
additional branches added to the network throughout the year as  
well as the acquisition of the Besley Hill network. 
We entered the year with good ongoing customer demand and  
a Government that remains openly very keen to accelerate new 
home-building and ownership. We are therefore looking set to  
deliver another successful year. 
Delivering outstanding customer service is at the heart of our 
operation. At exchange of a property or at the let of a property a 
vendor or landlord is contacted by a member of our customer service 
team. In 2017, 4,155 (2016: 3,648) customers provided feedback 
resulting in a 95% (2016: 96%) customer satisfaction rating. 
Our customer satisfaction ratio has been over 
90% since 2011.
Maintenance in the quality of the network is key to our success. 
We started the year with 186 branch locations. We received 228 
(2016: 268) enquiries resulting in 37 (2016: 30) new openings under 
the Hunters brand. These openings consisted of 15 (2016: 20) 
conversions of existing independent estate agency businesses and 
6 (2016: 10) new “cold start” locations, of which four were current 
Franchisees expanding into new markets. We were delighted that 
we have converted some stronger independents this year with the 
average of their incomes before conversion at £173,000 (2016: 
£153,000) a sign of our increasing success in attracting increasingly 
stronger businesses.
The Group implements a rigorous Franchisee selection process.  
This ensures, as far as is possible, that new Franchisees are committed 
to the Group’s high standards. Approximately 80% are rejected 
at an early stage. Additionally, underperforming branches can be 
reinvigorated through training and support or alternatively the sale  
of a franchise to a new team or individual. 
We were delighted that we have converted 
some stronger independents this year with the 
average of their incomes before conversion at 
£173,000 (2016: £153,000) a sign of our 
increasing success in attracting increasingly 
stronger businesses.
We continue to invest in our people and our technology, marketing 
and networks. We have devoted over £500,000 this year in training 
and now provide 114 courses, a 41% increase through the Hunters 
Vocational Qualification, endorsed by Propertymark. We continued 
to develop our in-house, market leading software to enhance the 
digital side of the business, for example we launched an online 
valuation booking capability in July which has already directed over 
£5m of property to the network. Just as importantly we retain the 
levels of service that our customers require so as to secure and 
safeguard a long-term future. In terms of marketing we augmented 
our national campaign around both our brand promise “Here to 
get you there” and local ownership and local expertise. This will 
continue to be our message in the year ahead. Having been one of 
the first estate agents to launch a national TV advert in 2015, our TV 
advertising campaign has been followed by a number of our larger and 
better funded peers. Hunters’ website traffic has risen by 70% in the 
last three years.
Finishing the year with 213 branches, I am delighted to report how 
since 2014 businesses have been able to improve through working 
with Hunters. Against a market down 15% in 2017 (2016: down 2%) 
the average revenue per branch has beaten the market by 10% on 
average each year. For branches that joined in the three years to 
December 2015 their revenue is up, on average, by 29%. 
Nor is improvement just short-term, those who have been converted 
for 6 years are up, on average, by 84%. Every region we trade in has 
increased over the last four-year period 2013 to 2017 on average at a 
Compound Annualised Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 27%. 
Franchise prospects for 2018 have started well given the tight market 
and uncertainty, with a proceeding pipeline of 27 (2017: 34) new 
branches being processed and enquiry levels on target to exceed 
those of 2017. We have expanded the team further to improve 
the process and allow more ongoing support. Our marketing plan 
is heavily focused on direct marketing to suitable independent 
businesses, increased online presence and existing Franchisee 
expansion are integral elements of this growth. 
It is expected that 2018 will see continued network growth, both 
through conversions of existing businesses and cold starts although 
we expect conversions to account for a more significant portion of 
branch growth. We see the uncertainty and impact of proposed 
tenant fee ban as driving enquiries towards Hunters’ market leading 
conversion package, designed to allow independent agencies to join 
with minimal cost, whilst benefiting from a full estate agency package. 
In addition, we have secured access to all three 
major property portals.
This increases the offering to landlords and vendors now able to 
market their properties to the widest possible audience for buyers 
and tenants. We are delighted to have been one of the first in the 
industry to offer this service.
We have an outstanding and experienced team that are committed 
to Hunters and our quest to become the nation’s favourite estate 
agent. This could not be achieved without their sterling efforts. We 
believe that we have some truly outstanding industry professionals 
associated with the business and are grateful to them for their 
dedication to Hunters.

Financial review 
REVENUE 
Group revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
increased by 3% to £14.2 million (2016: £13.8 million). This was 
driven by the following factors: 
• Management Service Fee (“MSF”) from franchised branches 
increased due to the 30 new Franchisee branches that joined the 
Group in 2016 and a further 37 new Franchisee branches that 
joined the Group in 2017; 
• Nine months of MSF revenue from the acquisition of the Besley 
Hill network in March 2017; 
• Lettings revenue grew as we introduced lettings to new 
Franchisees and continued to grow our existing lettings offices. 
Network Income for Lettings grew 16% (2016: 19%). 
ADJUSTED EBITDA (operating profit before 
depreciation, amortisation, acquisition and  
share-based payments expenses) 
Adjusted EBITDA provides a key measure of progress made. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year to December 2017 was £2.23 million, 
an increase of 8% on the same period last year (2016: £2.06 million). 
Administrative expenses increased by £0.2 million during the year. 
Higher costs in 2017 were in part due to the additional running 
costs associated with the acquisition of Besley Hill. 
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX (adjusted to 
exclude amortisation, amortised finance costs, 
acquisition costs, share-based payments and  
finance income) 
Adjusted profit before tax was £1.94 million, an increase of 5% over the 
prior period (2016: £1.86 million). Amortisation and acquisition costs 
increased significantly during the period, as the Group continued to 
accelerate its growth through the acquisition element of its strategy.

business both organically and through acquisition 
in the coming year. 
DIVIDENDS 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.50p per share for 2017, 
which subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on the 18 May 2018, 
will be paid to shareholders by 23 May 2018 based on the register of 
shareholders as at 27 April 2018. Taking this together with the interim 
dividend of 0.7p paid to shareholders on 20 October 2017, this equates 
to a total dividend for the year of 2.20p an increase of 16%. The 
Company intends to pay a progressive dividend going forwards. 
LIQUIDITY 
The Group had cash balances of £1.6 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £1.2 million). In March 2017, the Group secured an extension 
of £1.0m to its facilities to support the acquisition of Besley Hill. The 
facility continues to be a quarterly rolling facility with repayments of 
£22.5k each quarter. Total bank facilities available to the Group at 31 
December 2017 stood at £5.9 million of which £3.8 million is drawn. 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
The Group has generated strong cashflow from operations of 
£1.6m (2016: £1.7m) which is expected to continue in 2018. These 
cashflows, together with undrawn facilities available, ensure the 
Group is in a strong financial position from which to carry out its 
strategy to grow the franchise business both organically and through 
acquisition in the coming year.

Principal risks
THE HOUSING MARKET 
The Group is exposed to material fluctuations in the housing 
market. In a falling or low-volume market, there is a reduction 
in the number of transactions resulting in increased competition 
which puts additional pressure on fees, leading to lower revenues 
on a smaller number of transactions. The Board is aware that the 
proposed Tenant Fee Ban has been deferred until no earlier than 
Spring 2019. The Group mitigates these effects by: 
• Retaining both sales and lettings disciplines across its network 
• Growing the number of branches in the network 
• Improving the performance of branches across the network.
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT 
General economic conditions, including movements in interest and 
inflation rates in the Group’s markets may have an adverse effect 
on the Group’s activities. The Group may be exposed to risks such 
as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer payment 
cycles, problems in collecting debts, fluctuations in currency rates 
and potentially adverse tax consequences. The Group’s operations, 
business and profitability could be affected by these factors, which 
are beyond the control of the Group, and the property market as 
a whole may also be subject to political uncertainties. The Group 
seeks to mitigate by employing strategies that relate to the market 
whilst focusing on a market leading customer service proposition. 
The Board is aware that Brexit negotiations are continuing, which 
by their nature will clarify the situation further once resolved.
ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SKILLED 
FRANCHISEES 
The ability of the Group to attract new Franchisees with the 
appropriate expertise and skills, in available and suitable locations, 
cannot be guaranteed. The Group retains a robust selection process 
to reduce the risk of failure. The Company conducts checks on 
the suitability of its prospective Franchisees and maintains ongoing 
training and monitoring. The Group may experience difficulties in 
finding appropriate Franchisees and the failure to do so may have a 
detrimental effect upon trading performance. 
REPUTATION 
The Group takes extremely seriously the protection of its 
reputation and its brand. One of the ways it seeks to protect both 
is through the continuous audit programme it operates, which 
tests the financial probity of its Franchisees and periodically audits 
other aspects of the franchise system. However, it is possible 
that a Franchisee may from time to time behave in a way that 
potentially damages the Group, for example, by retaining tenants’ 
deposits outside the government endorsed tenancy deposit 
protection scheme. The Directors believe that the provisions of the 
Company’s franchise agreement ensure the Company can control 
its Franchisees’ activities sufficiently to protect its brand and to take 
swift action against such practices but there can be no guarantee 
that it will always succeed in taking preventative action. 
The Company conducts extensive checks on the suitability of its 
prospective Franchisees but it cannot be entirely certain that a 
Franchisee does not have some potentially embarrassing adverse 
history which may come to light and which risks damaging the 
reputation of the brand. 
The Group’s business and its success is highly dependent on 
both the service it and its Franchisees provide. Failure by either 
the Group of its Franchisees to meet the required levels of 
service or any diminution in client satisfaction and loyalty and/or 
regulatory breaches or alleged breaches, criticisms of its services 
or litigation may damage the Group’s reputation and may have a 
material adverse impact on the Group’s business, operations and 
financial performance.

Corporate governance 
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and comply  
with the QCA Corporate Governance Code to the extent appropriate for a company 
 of its size.
The QCA Corporate Governance Code has been devised by 
the Quoted Companies Alliance and sets out for smaller quoted 
companies and, in particular, AIM companies how they can apply 
the principles of good governance in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code to their own circumstances. 
An alternative code was proposed because the QCA considers 
the UK Corporate Governance Code to be inappropriate to many 
AIM companies, having been written principally for larger listed 
companies. The QCA Code states that: “The objective of good 
corporate governance is to deliver growth in long-term shareholder 
value by maintaining a flexible, efficient and effective management 
framework within an entrepreneurial environment.”
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Currently the Board consists of five Directors (including the 
Chairman). The performance of the Directors is evaluated on an 
ongoing basis. The Board meets at least ten times a year and has  
full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to  
carry out its duties. 
The Board regularly reviews and oversees the Group’s progress 
towards its goals. The Board monitors the implementation of its 
strategy whilst delegating the day-to-day operations to Executive 
Directors and management. 
Processes are in place to ensure the Board has the access it requires 
to advisors and the Company Secretary to keep up to date with 
corporate governance matters and that applicable rules and 
regulations are followed.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. 
The Board considers that all the members of each committee 
have the appropriate experience required of them without having 
conflicts of interest.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises Dean Fielding (Chairman) and 
Harry Hill. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and 
is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Company is properly reported on and monitored, including reviews 
of the annual and interim accounts, results announcements, internal 
control systems and procedures and accounting policies. 
The Audit Committee also has responsibility for recommending 
the appointment of the external auditor. In carrying out this 
responsibility the Audit Committee reviews the cost-effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the current proposed auditors. 
During the period, the Audit Committee reappointed Mazars LLP 
as the auditors for the Group. Mazars LLP have provided non-
audit services to the Group during the period for the review of 
compliance with financing covenants.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Dean Fielding  
and its other members are Kevin Hollinrake and Harry Hill.  
The Remuneration Committee meet at least annually.  
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining, 
within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of senior executives and specific remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors. It is also responsible for 
making recommendations as to the adoption of share options 
schemes and long-term incentive plans for senior executives and for 
grants under such schemes or plans to individual senior executives. 
Details of the Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the notes to 
the accounts.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for ensuring there is an adequate system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is 
designed to mitigate risk to an acceptable level rather than eliminate 
internal control risks completely. These internal controls include 
controls over financial, operational and compliance risk factors. 
The Board is satisfied that the current level of internal control meets 
the needs of the Group and reduces its exposure to risk to an 
appropriate level.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Clear financial reporting procedures have been established which 
ensure the Board have access to reliable and timely financial 
reports on a weekly and monthly basis. Financial reporting includes 
monitoring performance against budget and prior year results as 
well as cashflow forecasts.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Employees 
The Group believes in equal opportunities and people’s 
development. The Group appoints based entirely on merit 
regardless of gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
religion, nationality, ethnicity or disability. Where employees 
become disabled, the Group looks where possible to adjust  
the environment to accommodate the same. 
Communication 
The Group sees communication as key with its customers and that 
philosophy extends from the way we deal with both employees and 
our franchise network. We hold regular meetings and conferences, 
provide regular updates through our intranet underpinning 
developments and encourage the sharing of information and help. 
Anti-bribery policy 
The Group operates a zero tolerance towards bribery.
Legislative compliance
The Group conforms with all relevant legislation and codes 
of best practice and this is monitored regularly by the Board. 
The Group appreciates the social and environmental impact its 
decisions can make and considers these as part of its decision 
making process. The Group takes the overall impact that it has 
long-term very seriously. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains open communications with its 
Shareholders and provides up to date information through 
market announcements and website postings. Copies of all 
results and announcements are available online on the Company 
website, www.hunters.com/other-services/investor-relations. 
Investor presentations are also available for potential and current 
shareholders to attend.

DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY
The Group maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance which

RISKS
The principal risks of the Group are included in the Strategic Report.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report and the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. As required by 
the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and  
of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether IFRS as adopted by the European Union have 
been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and the 
Company to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
AUDITORS
Mazars LLP were appointed auditors of the Company during the 
financial year. In accordance with S489 of the Companies Act 2006, 
a proposal for reappointment of the auditors will be put forward at 
the Company’s AGM.
STATEMENT OF DISCLOSURE TO AUDITORS
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of approving 
this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. Additionally, the Directors 
individually have taken all the necessary steps that they ought to 
have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of all 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. 
On behalf of the Board

Chief Financial Officer

OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Hunters Property Plc 
(the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated and Company 
statement of financial position, Consolidated and Company 
statement of changes in equity, Consolidated statement of cash 
flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year  
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
USE OF THE AUDIT REPORT
This report is made solely to the company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING 
CONCERN
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Area of focus How addressed
Revenue recognition
The Group has several material revenue streams, the 
most significant of which we consider to be residential 
property agency sales through own branches, 
franchising income (through the managed service fee 
(“MSF”) and any sign-up fees) and lettings income 
(whether managed properties or lettings only).
As revenue is a key performance indicator for the 
Group, revenue could be at a higher risk of fraudulent 
reporting.
There is a risk that revenue recognition policies may 
not be appropriate or may not be appropriately 
applied.
We reviewed the consistency of application and appropriateness of disclosure 
of revenue recognition policies year on year.
We undertook testing of the transactions around the year-end to validate the 
cut-off of revenue recognition between periods. This principally focused on the 
risk of overstatement of revenue, starting from the nominal ledger and agreed 
revenue recognition cut-off back to source documentation.
We included within our cut-off procedures sample testing of deferred income 
arising on lettings fees in advance.
We tested a sample of sales credit notes from the nominal ledger to source 
documentation; the sample included items recorded during the year and 
subsequent to the year-end.
Based on the results of our procedures we consider that revenue recognition 
is reasonable and has been appropriately applied, in line with the accounting 
policy described in note 1.4 to the financial statements.
Goodwill impairment reviews
There is a risk that the goodwill arising on current year 
and prior period business combinations may be subject 
to impairment. Goodwill in both the consolidated 
accounts and relevant subsidiaries (as relevant for any 
goodwill generated on acquisitions of assets and trade) 
is required to be assessed for impairment annually as it 
is not amortised.
As required under IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, we assessed management’s 
impairment review methodology. We evaluated management’s cash flow 
forecasts, and the process by which they were drawn up, comparing them to 
the Board approved Group budget for 2018 for consistency. We challenged 
as to whether the cash flow forecasts were prepared at the level of the 
lowest group of cash generating units relevant. We also tested the underlying 
spreadsheet model for mathematical integrity.
We reviewed and challenged the appropriateness of cash flows included and 
excluded within the value-in-use projections and the discount rates used in the 
discounted cash flows relevant to each impairment review.
We reviewed post balance sheet results against the budget, reviewed and 
considered historical accuracy of budgets. 
We considered sensitivity analysis, especially where a reasonably possible 
change in assumptions might give rise to an impairment. We reviewed and 
challenged appropriateness and completeness of disclosures. Taking into 
account the anticipated or potential impact of other market forces with respect 
to growth forecasts beyond 2018 - including but not limited to the impact 
of UK and regional economic outlook (not limited to BREXIT uncertainty), 
housing affordability and consumer confidence, market disruptors and other 
competitors, tenant fee ban and other political and legal and regulatory 
developments - the key sensitivity that we focused on was in relation to long-
term growth rates.
Based on our procedures we concur with management that no impairment is 
required.
Area of focus How addressed
Business combinations
The Group has acquired a new lettings book and the 
trade and assets of another business (Besley Hill) in 
the year. With respect to the lettings book acquisition 
- management judgement is required in assessing 
whether the acquisition constitutes the acquisition of a 
business, in which case IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ 
applies or simply the acquisition of intangible assets, in 
which case IAS 38 would apply.
Under IFRS 3 significant management estimation 
uncertainty also exists, including but not limited to 
the following: assessing the fair value of consideration 
(particularly for the Besley Hill acquisition where 
consideration included non-cash share consideration); 
identification of intangible assets acquired; and 
estimation and allocation of fair values of identified 
assets and liabilities acquired.
We obtained and reviewed purchase agreements and considered the 
consistency, accuracy and completeness of matters taken into account by 
management with these purchase agreements.
Whilst there is some judgement required in assessing whether the lettings 
book acquisition in particular constitutes the acquisition of a business to be in 
scope for IFRS 3, we consider it reasonable that this is treated as an acquisition 
of a business and note the consistency with how the Group has treated other 
similar lettings book acquisitions in prior periods.
We reviewed and challenged management’s calculation of the fair value of 
consideration, specifically with the respect to the fair value of the shares in 
Hunters Property Plc issued as part of the consideration for the Besley Hill 
business combination.
We reviewed and challenged the completeness of identified intangible assets 
acquired identified by management that meet the criteria to be recognised. 
In both business combinations during the year, as disclosed in note 15 to the 
financial statements, the only recognised identified assets were the intangible 
assets classified as customer lists – corresponding to the Franchisee contracts 
(for Besley Hill) and lettings book – and the only identified liabilities were 
deferred tax liabilities arising on the identified intangible assets.
We reviewed and challenged management’s estimations of the fair values of 
assets and liabilities acquired. We considered the reasonableness of the basis of 
estimating fair value as well as the specific assumptions used.
We also reviewed and challenged the reasonableness of any residual goodwill 
balance arising. Goodwill arose only on the Besley Hill business combination as 
disclosed in note 15 to the financial statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we concur that management has 
appropriately applied the principles of IFRS 3, including identification and fair 
valuation of intangible assets excluding goodwill on acquisitions. Management’s 
key assumptions are considered to be within acceptable parameters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We consider that the revenue of the business remains the key focus of users of the financial statements and, as such, we based our Group 
materiality level around this benchmark.
We set a materiality threshold at 1.75% of total revenue for the Group. For the Parent Company, as a holding company, we considered net 
assets to be the most appropriate benchmark; we used 4% of net assets restricted to a threshold lower than Group materiality. Financial 
statement materiality applied for the Group and Parent Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £248,000 and £223,000 
respectively. Performance materiality was set at 75% of the respective financial statement materiality levels.
The range of financial statement materiality across components, all audited to local statutory audit materiality, was between £1,000 and 
£102,000, being all below Group financial statement materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £7,400 (Group 
audit) and £6,700 (Parent Company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Whilst planning, we make judgements about the size of misstatements which we consider to be material and which provides a basis for 
determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and 
determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
We revise materiality for the financial statements as our audit progresses should we become aware of information that would have caused 
us to determine a different amount had we been aware of that information at the planning stage.

An overview of the scope of our audit
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the Group’s accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. We used the outputs of 
a risk assessment, our understanding of the Group, and we also considered qualitative factors in order to ensure that we obtained sufficient 
coverage across all financial statement line items.
Our audit involved obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The risks of material misstatement 
that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are discussed under “Key audit matters” 
within this report.
We audited the entire Group, inclusive of full audit scope procedures on all components (subsidiaries) where the extent of our audit work 
was based on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement and of the materiality of that component.
The components within the scope of our audit work therefore covered: 100% of Group revenue, 100% of Group profit before tax and 
100% of Group net assets.
OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information 
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out in the Directors’ report, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the financial statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Company information
Hunters Property Plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The registered 
office is Apollo House, Eboracum Way, York, North Yorkshire, YO31 7RE. The consolidated financial information (or “financial 
statements”) incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the Company (collectively 
comprising the “Group”).
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of property services to consumers and businesses which include sales, lettings, 
franchising and related services.
1.1 Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent Company. Monetary amounts in 
these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £000s.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As permitted by s408 Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s 
profit for the year was £1.4 million.
1.2 Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial information consolidates those of the Company and the subsidiaries that the Company has control of. Control is 
established when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
Where a subsidiary undertaking, or unincorporated business, is acquired/disposed of during the year, the consolidated profits or losses are 
recognised from/until the effective date of the acquisition/disposal.
All inter-company balances and transactions between group companies have been eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial information of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations enacted after the date of creation of the Group 
following incorporation of Hunters Property Plc, as detailed further below. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control 
of a subsidiary or unincorporated business is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of assets transferred by the Group, 
liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are 
expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have 
been previously recognised in an acquired subsidiary’s (or unincorporated business’s) financial information prior to the acquisition. Assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values.
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the fair value of consideration 
transferred, over the Group’s share of the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable net assets 
exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary or unincorporated business, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an 
equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary or unincorporated business, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, 
non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment 
retained is recognised at fair value.
The Group has applied the principles of merger accounting in consolidating the results, as control was only acquired by Hunters Property 
Plc via a share-for-share exchange on 27 March 2015. Merger accounting requires that the results of the Group are presented as if the 
Group has always been in its present form, and does not require a re-evaluation of fair values as at the point of acquisition. Accordingly, as 
a result of this merger accounting a merger reserve is recognised within equity which represents the difference between the net assets of 
the Group and the retained profits recognised by the Group as at 27 March 2015.

1.3 Going concern
As at the year end the Group has net current assets. The nature of the Group’s trade is that there exist intangibles which generate significant 
cashflows, and are expected to continue doing so. The Group has sufficient unused facility available in its bank financing as disclosed in note 17.
The Directors have considered 12 month cashflow forecasts from the date of approval of the financial statements, and do not foresee 
any cashflow issues arising. Taking these factors into account, as at the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.4 Revenue
Revenue represents the amount receivable for the provision of services during the year, excluding VAT and trade discounts. Revenue is 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from residential, commercial and land sales is recognised on the basis of exchange of contract.
Revenue from commission earned as letting agents is recognised in the month in which the income is received and when there is fulfilment 
of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions.
At inception of a Franchisee contract, revenue is recognised upfront which matches to the profile of estimated incurred costs of time and 
knowledge to create the franchiser-Franchisee contractual arrangement. No amounts are deferred as the Directors are of the opinion that 
virtually all inception costs are incurred at the outset, and hence although contracts run for several years this policy is considered to be the 
fairest presentation to comply with the matching and accruals concepts.
Revenue from Franchisee management service fees are recognised monthly in arrears, calculated by reference to the terms of the contract 
and the value of sales attributable to each Franchisee.
Financial services revenue is recognised at the later of the policy inception date or confirmation of entitlement to the commission.
Deferred income arises where services are invoiced in advance of performance. The amount is released to the profit or loss in subsequent 
periods in reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date.
Where the Group identifies rights to the economic benefits of other sources of income through fulfilment of certain performance criteria, 
the income is recognised in the relevant accounting period when those conditions are fulfilled, net of VAT.
1.5 Intangible fixed assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually 
identifiable and separately recognised. See note 15 for information on how goodwill is initially determined. After initial recognition, goodwill 
is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. See note 1.9 for a description of impairment testing procedures.
1.6 Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill 
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. Where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination, cost is determined 
by reference to a fair value estimation technique as disclosed further in note 15. After initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised at 
cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life. Amortisation 
begins when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed each financial year-end. If the 
expected useful life of the asset is different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalised to 
the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the 
following bases:
Software    3–7 years or over the life of the license 
Franchise development costs  Over the life of the franchise contract (typically 10–15 years) 
Brands    10 years 
Customer lists   2–15 years
1.7 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are recognised as an asset only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
An item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is measured at its cost. Cost of an item of property, 
plant and equipment comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of assets, less estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives 
on the following basis:
Leasehold land and buildings  Straight line over the life of the lease 
Plant and machinery   25% Reducing balance 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% Reducing balance or 10%–33% straight line 
Motor vehicles   25% Straight line
The residual value and the useful life of an asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and if expectations differ from previous 
estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds 
and the carrying value of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss.
1.8 Non-current investments
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities.
Other investments in equity instruments that have a quoted market price in an active market and other equity instruments whose fair value 
can be reliably measured are measured at fair value; otherwise investments in equity instruments are measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
1.9 Impairment of non-current assets
For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash flows. As a 
result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within 
the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or  
cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may  
not be recoverable.
An asset or cash-generating unit is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
measured as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. The value in use is calculated as being net projected cash flows 
based on financial forecasts discounted back to present value.
The impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the asset, first against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  
to the cash-generating unit, and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may  
no longer exist. An impairment loss is reversed if the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.10 Financial instruments
Loans and receivables 
Financial assets are recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
All financial assets excluding investments are classified as loans and receivables; these comprise trade and other receivables and cash and 
cash equivalents. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted 
where the effect of discounting is immaterial.
If there is objective evidence that there is an impairment loss on loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either 
directly or through use of an allowance account.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset 
and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred.
Financial assets held for trading 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling 
in the near term. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39. The Company has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at 
fair value through profit or loss.
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective 
hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in finance revenue or finance expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting 
end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the 
difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is 
reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the 
impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets 
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or when the 
Group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an 
unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised in the statement of financial position when,  
and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for any directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the effective interest 
recognised as an expense in finance costs.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.
1.11 Equity instruments
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium represents the excess consideration received over share capital upon the sale of shares, less any incidental costs of issue.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity 
instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the Group.
The merger reserve has arisen as described in note 1.2.
Within the Company, the share option reserve is recognised in respect of the cumulative fair value of share options recognised, net  
of issues made, where the benefit of the services received under the share option are recognised within subsidiaries of the Company.  
Once the share option is exercised, the element included within this reserve for fair values expensed is transferred to the share premium 
account. Full details on share options existing as at the year end is given in note 25.
1.12 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and 
their tax bases.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit 
nor taxable profit (tax loss). However, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries a deferred tax asset 
is recognised when the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

1.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
end date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation is recognised at 
present value. When a provision in measured at present value the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss 
in the period it arises.
1.14 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as 
part of the cost of stock or non-current assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed to terminate the 
employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.15 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.16 Share-based payments
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest. Full disclosure of the calculation 
models is given in note 25.
1.17 Leases
The economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the leased asset. Where the Group is a lessee in this type of arrangement, the related asset is recognised at the inception of the lease 
at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the lease payments plus incidental payments, if any. A corresponding 
amount is recognised as a finance lease liability.
This liability is reduced by lease payments net of finance charges. The interest element of lease payments represents a constant proportion 
of the outstanding capital balance and is charged to profit or loss, as finance costs over the period of the lease.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term 
of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits 
from the lease asset are consumed.
1.18 Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the year
The current standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the year and have not had a material impact on the 
reported results in the Group and Company’s financial statements:
• IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: amendments in respect of the disclosure initiative.
• IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’: amendment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
• Annual improvements to IFRS’s (2012–2014).
Disclosures have been extended in the current reporting period to reflect the updated requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.
1.19 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective

position, although there is not expected to be any material impact from this standard on the reported results of the Group. The adoption 
of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is not expected to impact on the reported values in the financial statements as the Group does not use 
complex financial instruments, although the standard may require some minor disclosure adjustments.
All other amendments, including the adoption of IFRS 15, are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

2 JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the 
financial statements:
Basis of consolidation
The Group was formed on 27 March 2015 when Hunters Property PLC acquired shares in its subsidiaries through a share-for-share 
exchange. This type of common control transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 and therefore UK GAAP has been referred to for 
best practice guidance. The result is that the Group adopted merger accounting as a basis for the Group consolidation.
Franchisee revenue & intangible assets
Franchisee sign up fees are recognised upfront at the inception of a Franchisee contract, which in the Directors’ opinion matches to the 
estimated cost of time and knowledge to create the franchiser-Franchisee contractual arrangement.
Franchisee Development Grants (“FDG’s”) are recognised at the inception of certain contracts with Franchisees, and are provided in 
order to assist with the transition of Franchisees to the Hunters brand name. These intangibles are amortised over the life of the franchise 
contract, typically 10–15 years.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
are as follows:
Provisions
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date. Each period the Directors assess the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation and review the discount rates applied when 
calculating the present value. When reviewing the discount rates the Directors refer to the Group weighted average cost of capital.  
Further details on the assumptions made for specific provisions are disclosed in note 22.
Business combinations and goodwill
The Group has made acquisitions during the year and comparative year. Judgements and estimations are made in respect of the recognition 
of the acquisition as a separable business, and of measurement of the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and the 
consideration transferred. Furthermore, estimation techniques have been used to value the intangibles acquired.
The Directors test annually for impairment of the Group’s intangible assets and goodwill, details of which are given in note 12.
Accounting for acquired lettings books
The Group has acquired lettings books in the current and comparative year. Although each of these books are subsumed within the 
overall trade of the Group, the originally acquired book is separable and tradable in its own right, although following acquisition is managed 
by existing Group staff and systems. The Directors consider that recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ is the most suitable 
accounting treatment. 
3 REVENUE 
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker of the Group is considered to be the Board  
of Directors.
The Group has operating segments: Residential Sales, Lettings, and Franchising. Due to the specific nature of the Group’s market, each 
component of revenue naturally falls within one of these segments. The operating segments are monitored by the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker and strategic decisions are made on the basis of adjusted segment operating results. All assets, liabilities and revenues are 
located in, or derived in, the United Kingdom.
The Group does not have any major customers which account for 10% or more of revenues.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was enacted in March 2017. These rates have 
therefore been considered when calculating deferred tax at the reporting date. Deferred tax balances at the reporting date are measured 
at 17% (2016: 18%) except when the timing difference is expected to be substantially unwound before 1 April 2020, in which case a rate of 
19% has been used to measure the balance.

The Company had no intangible assets as at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.
Franchise Development Grants (“FDG’s”) and rebrand costs are expenses incurred at the inception of certain contracts with Franchisees 
in order to assist with the transition to using the Hunters brand name. The amounts invested are amortised over the minimum life of the 
underlying franchise contract, typically 10 to 15 years.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be 
impaired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying values with the value-in-use calculation, which is determined by 
calculating the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows arising from the original acquired business.
The NPV of future cash flows is based on budgets and forecasts for the next 5 years to 2022, using growth rates of 0% – 3% based on past 
experience and outlook. Thereafter growth is assumed to be 0% – 3% in to perpetuity based on long-term term housing sector growth 
rates and current housing transaction volumes. A discount rate of between 10% and 12% has been used based on the Group’s estimated 
cost of capital, and varied based on the risk profile of the underlying asset.
The key sensitivities in assessing the value in use of goodwill are forecast cashflows and the discount rate applied as follows:
• A 1% reduction in long-term growth rates would have no impact on carrying values; and
• A 2% increase in the discount applied would have no impact on carrying values.
No reasonably possible change in assumptions has been identified that would lead to a material impairment.
The carrying amounts of goodwill have been assigned to the following cash-generating units:

Acquisition of Besley Hill 
On 24 March 2017 the Group acquired Besley Hill, in a trade acquisition. The consideration paid totalled £2,500,000, being settled by 
£2,250,000 paid in cash, and an issue of £250,000 worth of Ordinary shares in Hunters Property Plc.
As part of the acquisition, the Directors have identified an intangible asset, being the Franchisee contracts, including a renewal expectation, 
being determined by using the average value of the contracts, growing at 2% per annum, and discounted at 12% per annum to determine 
the present value.

Acquisition of a lettings book 
In March 2017 the Group acquired a lettings book. The consideration paid totalled £160,000, being settled in cash.
As part of the acquisition, the Directors have identified an intangible asset, being the lettings book. This was determined to be equal to the 
amount paid for the book, after adjustment for deferred tax. Historical data and forecasts have been used, together with a 10% discount 
rate (reduced to reflect the relatively low risk profile of a lettings book acquisition) and an assumption of a useful life of 12 years for the 
lettings book to estimate the fair value of this intangible.

The Group holds two flexible loan facilities.
The first loan has a maximum facility amounting to £5,550,000; at the year end £3,597,106 had been drawn down and is disclosed as 
payable after one year. The loan has 5 year repayment terms and bears interest at 2.80% above Libor.
The second loan had an amount of £349,329 outstanding at the year end. The loan is repayable at £90,000 per annum and bears interest 
at 2.80% above Libor.
Included within the above are establishment fees of £85,000 (2016: £88,000) which are netted off the total liability presented. The fees are

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Market and liquidity risks 
The Group trades entirely within the UK property market, and accordingly there is a risk relating to the underlying performance of that 
market; this creates an exposure to the risk of large-scale failure in the property trading market which would have a corresponding impact 
on the results of the Group. The Directors monitor this risk closely with the intention to foresee downturns in trade.
Within the Group there exists a sizeable lettings division which generates a fixed percentage income based on the letting and management 
of properties owned by third parties, and the Directors consider this to be a more secure income stream and a suitable diversification 
of the trade and corresponding risk, based on historic performance where typically a downturn in the property trading market creates 
more buoyancy within the lettings market, and vice versa. As such, the Directors believe that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity and 
flexibility to continue trading through a potential downturn in the UK property market.
The Group has a bank loan and loan facility upon which interest is charged at 2.8% over the Bank of England base rate. The outstanding 
value of these bank loans at the year end are £3.945 million (2016: £2.160 million). The Directors do not consider that the Group is 
exposed to a material risk from fluctuations in these interest rates; had the base rate been 2.0% higher throughout the increased interest 
costs would have been approximately £88,000 (2016: £43,000).
The Group makes use of structured loans to finance its acquisitions and ongoing trading activities as an alternative to overdraft financing, due 
to the certainty of repayment timings and predictable lower interest rates which attract to this. Accordingly, the Directors consider that the 
market risks arising from these interest-bearing loans are acceptable and minimal on a risk-reward profile compared to overdraft finance.
Similarly, fixed rate finance lease agreements are used to acquire property, plant and equipment; this ensures that the Group maintains its 
existing working capital and ensures certainty of costs at the point of acquisition of those assets.
The Group does not trade in overseas markets and has no financial instruments denominated in non-Sterling currencies, and accordingly it 
has no exposure to currency risks.
Credit risk
The Group does not make sales under the traditional credit term agreement model, with cash typically being recognised at the completion 
date of property or upon receipt of regular rent from tenants; credit is, however, granted to Franchisees, financial services partners and 
survey and valuation partners.
The highest risk exposure is in relation to loans and Franchisees. The Group closely monitors the performance of its Franchisees, on a 
frequent and ongoing basis. Operationally the Group are actively involved in the running of the franchising businesses, including frequent 
exchange of financial and key performance data, and are able to manage their own credit risk by using this knowledge to minimise exposure 
to potential bad debt. Additionally, Franchisees are encouraged to remit via Direct Debit arrangements, which helps to maintain the 
Group’s working capital whilst mitigating against long-term credit risk exposure.

Only reputable and accredited partners are used, and ledger balances are carefully monitored to minimise exposure to material credit risk. 
The Group’s maximum exposure is represented by the carrying amounts in the financial statements, which are shown in the table below.
Capital management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group manages the capital structure, being cash and cash equivalents, availability of 
longer term bank funding, and reinvestment of a proportion of profits generated, and makes changes in light of movements in economic 
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust its borrowings and investment decisions, as evidenced 
when bank borrowing arrangements were replaced during the comparative year.
