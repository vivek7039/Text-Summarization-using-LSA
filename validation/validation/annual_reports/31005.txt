IBC  Advisers Building sustainable growth
Commercial highlights
• Sustainable growth in profitability in line with expectations:
 – Organic growth, contribution from acquisitions and 
foreign currency translation gains, more than offset  
the expected softening of Nitrile latex margins.
• Europe and North America (ENA) momentum 
underpinned by volume and margin improvement:
 – Underlying operating profit at £117.1m increased 
25.5% (2016: £93.3m) due to volume and margin  
growth, the acquisition of Oxo Belgium (‘Speciality 
Additives’) and foreign currency translation gains.
 – IFRS operating profit at £77.5m increased 2.8% 
(2016: £75.4m). 
• Asia and Rest of the World (ARW) in line with 
expectations in challenging market environment:
 – Underlying operating profit lower by 27.9% at £35.1m 
(2016: £48.7m) mainly driven by expected lower unit 
margin in Nitrile latex.
 – The demand for Nitrile latex continues to grow at 8-10% 
pa, with market demand exceeding 1,000ktes in 2017
 – IFRS operating profit down 61.6% to £31.2m 
(2016: £81.3m) principally reflecting significant 
income from land sales in 2016.
• M&A activity:
 – 2016 PAC (Dispersions) acquisition fully integrated and in line 
to deliver expected $12m run rate synergy savings at the end 
of 2018, and a likely further $2m saving by end of 2019.
 – Acquisition and integration of Speciality Additives, a 
market leading performance additives business serving 
the decorative and industrial coatings industries, for an 
enterprise value of €78m in March 2017.
 – Bolt-on acquisition of the BASF Austrian SBR business 
and assets in Pischelsdorf, Austria (‘BASF Pischelsdorf’). 
The €29.3m acquisition enhances Synthomer’s SBR 
business and production network for paper/packaging 
applications and completed on 31 January 2018.
• Record capital investment growth programme:
 – Capital investment increased to £60.3m (2016: £45.6m)  
in the year in line with guidance.
 – Significant capacity expansion projects underway at Pasir 
Gudang (Malaysia), Worms (Germany) and Roebuck (US)
adding 90ktes of Nitrile latex, and 36ktes and 9ktes of 
Dispersions capacity respectively.
• R&D driving innovation: 
 – Launch of patented SyNovus
®
, the next generation 
Nitrile latex.
 – Products launched in last five years represented 20% 
of sales in line with our target (2016: 20%).
• Another year of strong cash generation:
 – Cash generated from operations grew 3.6% to £162.6m 
(2016: £157.0m).
• Earnings per share: 
 – Underlying earnings per share for the year rose 8.5% 
to 30.7p (2016: 28.3p) and on an IFRS basis earnings 
per share declined 32.9% to 21.8p (2016: 32.5p).
• Dividend: 
 – Full year dividend increased by 8.0% to 12.2p per share 
in line with dividend policy (2016: 11.3p per share).

Underlying Statement 
The Group’s management uses Underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group. Underlying performance differs from the statutory 
IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of Special Items, which are detailed in note 3. The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for 
the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, IFRS performance inclusive of Special Items is also described. 
References to ‘unit margin’ and ‘margin’ are used in the commentary on Underlying performance. Unit margin (or margin) is calculated on selling price less variable raw 
material and logistics costs. Further explanations can be found in notes 4, 5 and 6.

Strategic M&A
Our experienced management team has completed  
three acquisitions over the last two years which  
have expanded Synthomer’s global reach and 
strengthened its leadership in key markets. 
We diligently assess whether each acquisition  
opportunity is a strategic fit for the Group and do not 
pursue the targets where our criteria are not met.
The Group continues to actively assess both 
transformational and bolt-on acquisition opportunities  
in parallel with growing the business organically.

Results 
Following consecutive years of strong profits growth in 2015 and 
2016, I am pleased to report that Synthomer has made further 
progress in 2017. Consistent with our expectations, the improved 
Underlying profitability of the Group has been delivered, with 
incremental profits from our focused M&A activity in 2016 and 2017 
and continued organic growth from our investment in our Europe 
and North America (ENA) segment more than compensating for the 
reduced, but stable, Nitrile latex margins in our Asia and Rest of the 
World (ROW) segment. Volumes were higher by 9% to 1,443.8ktes 
(2016: 1,324.9ktes) with the increase reflecting a combination of 
underlying growth and additional volumes from Oxo Belgium 
(Speciality Additives), which was fully integrated during 2017. 
Acquisitions helped Group revenue to increase by 42% to a record 
£1,480.2m (2016: £1,045.7m), further supported by higher average 
raw material prices and favourable currency translation. 
Underlying profit before tax increased from £122.2m to £130.0m, an 
increase of 6.4% and 3.0% on a constant currency basis. The rise in 
Underlying profit before tax reflects underlying volume and margin 
growth, the contribution made by Speciality Additives and the 
depreciation in Sterling. IFRS profit before tax decreased from 
£136.7m to £86.4m mainly as a result of one-off items of income 
in 2016 including the profits on the Malaysian land sales (£33.2m). 
Our balance sheet is strong with net debt at 1.0 times EBITDA which 
allows us significant flexibility to pursue our growth strategy through 
capital investment and strategic acquisitions.
Neil Johnson
Chairman Ongoing capital investment programme 
We continue to focus on organic growth and see significant 
opportunities to drive growth from our existing businesses. To 
strengthen our platform for future growth, we initiated a step change 
in our capital investment programme in 2016 with significant plant 
expansions at our ARW Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) Nitrile latex plant, 
and our ENA Worms (Germany) Dispersions plant. The Board is 
pleased to see that these investment programmes are progressing 
safely, in line with plans, and will be commissioned and brought up 
to normal operating levels later in 2018 and early 2019 respectively. 
We have made further capital commitments to expand our 
capabilities in Sant’Albano (Italy), Marl (Germany) and Oulu (Finland) 
and these investments will also come online in late 2018 and early 
2019. As well as growth capital investment, the Group has invested 
in sustenance and SHE related capital expenditure to ensure we are 
both operating our plants safely and in accordance with evolving 
legislation.
M&A and integration activity
Acquisitions also remain a key component of our growth strategy. 
During the year, we announced two further bolt-ons: Speciality 
Additives, which became part of the Group in March 2017, and 
BASF Pischelsdorf which was agreed in September 2017 and 
completed in January 2018. These bolt-on acquisitions significantly 
complement our existing business. Speciality Additives has strong 
market positions which we will leverage into our existing coatings 
customer base. The Pischelsdorf site expands our SBR asset and 
customer base, and will provide further options for our network 
optimisation in an SBR market characterised by over-capacity. 
Speciality Additives was successfully integrated into the Group 
during the year and we are executing the well planned integration 
of BASF Pischelsdorf. Following the acquisition of the Pischelsdorf 
site, Synthomer has secured its position as market leader in 
European aqueous polymers, another milestone for our business. 
Our active search continues for a transformational speciality 
chemical company acquisition and we considered a number of 
options in 2017. However, we have stringent criteria and we will 
continue to be disciplined in our approach in terms of quality, 
strategic fit, opportunity and price. 
Following our acquisition of the PAC (Dispersions) business in 2016, 
integration is substantially complete. The actions that we have taken 
during 2017 mean that we will not only deliver the $12m run rate 
of synergies at the end of 2018 but are looking to deliver a further 
$2m in 2019. As part of this integration, we disposed of one plant 
in Leuna (Germany) and are engaged in restructuring our Ribécourt 
site (France).
Governance and Board
We were once again in full compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout 2017. Our 2017 AGM resolutions 
received overwhelming support and we were particularly pleased 
to achieve greater than 99% of votes in favour of our new 
remuneration policy.
The Board composition remained unchanged until the end of the 
year when Jinya Chen retired after five years’ service. I would like to 
thank Jinya for his commitment and contribution over that period. 
The Nomination Committee has initiated a search for a replacement 
independent non-executive director in order to bring the Board 
composition back into balance.
An externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was carried out in 2017 with the feedback recognising good 
progress in the ongoing programme to improve Board effectiveness. 
As we enter 2018, I believe the Board is well positioned to adapt to 
the changes in the corporate governance landscape envisaged by 
the new Code proposals currently under consultation and likely to 
be effective in 2019.
Our people
We now have approximately 2,900 employees in the Group, spread 
across 29 manufacturing sites and offices, with 40 joining as part 
of the Speciality Additives acquisition. As a Board, we have visited 
recently acquired sites over the last year and are delighted to see 
how our new colleagues have adapted to our values and culture, 
as well as bringing new skills into the Group.
The Group has reported record Underlying profitability in a 
challenging and demanding market place and the Board and 
Executive team recognise the contribution made by all employees. 
Our drive for growth remains unchanged and on behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank each and every employee for their 
commitment this year.
Safety, health and environment (SHE)
The nature of our industry involves significant hazards and as 
such our high safety, health and environmental standards are 
fundamental to what we do across the business. We are pleased 
to report that we have recorded our lowest ever level of recordable 
injuries (lower than 2016 by 56%). 
We are committed to reducing our recordable injuries to zero and 
as part of our continuous improvement drive to achieve this we made 
the embedding of the SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules, launched 
in 2016, a priority for 2017. There was a focus on systems linked to 
permit to work and management of change with the aim of eliminating 
work being carried out in a way or in an environment which could 
result in a safety incident. New indicators were developed to track 
and analyse progress, with specific focus on live monitoring of 
permit controlled work and control of high hazard activities. 
Notwithstanding the considerable improvement delivered in 2017, 
we are not complacent, and remain absolutely resolute in our 
campaign for continuous and sustainable improvement.
Dividend
The Board has proposed an increase to the final ordinary dividend 
per share to 8.5p (2016: 7.8p), resulting in a total dividend per share 
for the year of 12.2p (2016: 11.3p). This is in line with the Group’s 
dividend policy of a dividend covered 2.5 times by Underlying 
earnings per share. The final dividend per share is subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 
2018 and will be payable on 6 July 2018 to those shareholders 
registered at the close of business on 8 June 2018.
The Board is committed to generating attractive growth for 
shareholders through investing in the Group’s significant organic 
and inorganic growth plans to secure its future progress and the 
Capital Management Policy of the Group remains unchanged. The 
Board periodically assesses the balance sheet strength in light of 
these growth plans, and will consider returning excess capital to 
shareholders, if appropriate.
Outlook
Looking forward, whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges 
in our Nitrile latex and constructions and coatings Dispersions 
markets, we are confident of making further solid progress in 2018, 
underpinned by underlying growth in both segments, and from 
integrating our recent acquisitions. 
With our significant organic investment in new capacity being 
commissioned in late 2018, we remain confident in continuing 
to deliver growth in profitability and driving further value for 
shareholders in future years.

I am pleased to report that we have delivered solid growth in 
Underlying profitability in 2017, with the strong growth in ENA profits 
more than offsetting the softer but stable ARW profits. 
The strong growth in ENA Underlying profitability was underpinned 
by further organic growth, particularly in our SBR business, the 
benefits of our focused M&A activity and the associated synergies in 
2016 and 2017, and the depreciation in Sterling which favourably 
impacted our first half results. ARW Underlying profitability has been 
resilient, and performed in line with expectations, with Nitrile latex 
margins broadly stable throughout 2017 at similar levels to the last 
quarter of 2016. Positively, and as guided at the start of 2017, the 
overall Underlying profitability of the Group has moved forward in 
2017 with the combination of underlying organic growth, M&A 
activity and favourable currency impact more than compensating 
for the expected softer Nitrile latex margins. 
Underlying profit before tax increased by 6.4% from £122.2m 
to £130.0m. This reflected a 25.5% increase in ENA Underlying 
operating profits, up from £93.3m to £117.1m and a decrease in ARW 
Underlying operating profits, lower at £35.1m from £48.7m. The rise in 
ENA Underlying profits reflected strong organic growth (£16.0m), 
including a first full year contribution from PAC (Dispersions), the 2017 
acquisition of Speciality Additives (£3.7m) and favourable foreign 
currency translation impact (£4.1m). The reduction in ARW Underlying 
profits principally related to the expected softening in Nitrile latex 
margins seen in the last quarter of 2016, albeit reassuringly the 
margins broadly held firm at this level throughout 2017. 
IFRS profit before tax decreased by 36.8% from £136.7m in 2016 
to £86.4m in 2017, reflecting the inclusion in 2016 of large gains 
on Malaysian land sales (£33.2m) and disposal of our South African 
business (£4.7m), and the foreign currency hedge gain associated 
with the PAC (Dispersions) acquisition purchase price (£13.1m).
Cash generated from operations increased to £162.6m (2016: 
£157.0m) and the cash flows were again strong with good 
conversion of EBITDA to cash. The cash performance of the 
business over the year meant that the Group’s leverage at the year 
end was 1 times net debt:EBITDA. Capital spend increased to a 
record £60.3m in line with guidance and our stated strategy to 
invest in our principal sites. We also invested in our inorganic growth 
strategy with the acquisition of Speciality Additives, our second 
bolt-on acquisition, for £66.1m, and completion of our third bolt-on 
acquisition which took place after the year end on 31 January 2018 
for a further £25.7m. Our strong balance sheet continues to give us 
options for both organic and inorganic investment opportunities to 
support future growth.
Calum MacLean 
Chief Executive Officer Safety, health and environment 
In 2017 we had the best ever recordable injury rate, which was 
reduced by 56% relative to 2016, and we are reassured to see 
positive movement in our other SHE key performance measures. 
Whilst we are pleased with the marked improvement, this is a 
consequence of daily attention and vigilance in our working 
practices and processes, and we recognise that there is no place 
for complacency in this regard. The high standards set by the Group 
in relation to safety, health and environment are complemented by 
the significant investment we continue to make, and our Group SHE 
team monitor the Group’s adherence to our standards and report on 
our performance against those standards at each Executive team 
and Board meeting. 
The Group built on the strong platform of safety standards put in 
place in the prior year by embedding the SHE Principles and 10 
Golden Rules in our operations as well as focusing on eliminating 
the opportunity for work to be carried out in an unsafe way or unsafe 
environment. A rolling programme of Process Hazard Assessment 
Revalidation has been completed on all our high risk sites and 
prioritised action plans are being implemented to address identified 
gaps. This programme will be expanded to all sites in 2018. 
Strong progress has been made in our commitment to the 
environment with a 10% reduction in VOC emissions through 
making operational changes in our sites, particularly the UK. 
With the M&A activity adding new sites to our network, we are in 
the process of setting new targets for all our environmental key 
performance indicators.
Innovation 
In 2017, sales of new products launched in the last five years was 
again 20%, in line with 2016 and meeting our stated target. We are 
excited at the launch of more new products in 2017 with the major 
launch being our new and patented Nitrile latex, SyNovus
®
. The new 
product launch of SyNovus
®
 represented a further milestone for our 
innovation team in Malaysia, reducing the development time from 
inception to commercialisation, including patenting the proprietary 
technology, to just 18 months. The shortened innovation process, 
representing a reduction of almost 50% on previous new product 
developments, is a testament to the dedication, skill and expertise 
of our in-house R&D team.
This patented product delivers significant value to both our 
customers and the end user markets as the SyNovus
®
 formulation 
significantly reduces the required operating temperature of glove 
manufacturing lines, reducing both energy costs and the associated 
environmental impact. It also reduces maturation time thus enabling 
glove manufacturing lines to run at higher throughput providing 
manufacturers with increased capacity without capital expenditure, 
and additionally eliminates certain additives introduced to Nitrile 
latex formulations reducing the risk of potential allergic reactions 
with end users.
These benefits, coupled with superior tensile strength, improved 
colour and reduced odour resulted in a positive, well-received 
product launch in Kuala Lumpur with over 150 glove manufacturing 
leaders and guests in attendance.
M&A integration
With three acquisitions, PAC (Dispersions), Speciality Additives 
and BASF Pischelsdorf, over the last two years, and ongoing 
discussions in relation to transformational and further bolt-on 
acquisitions, our ability to successfully integrate is crucial to 
capturing value. We are pleased with the progress made in the 
integration of PAC (Dispersions) and Speciality Additives and are 
already implementing a detailed plan for the BASF Pischelsdorf 
acquisition. The integration of PAC (Dispersions) is substantially 
complete with the final two major actions initiated in 2017, the sale of 
the Leuna (Germany) site and the announcement of the restructuring 
of Ribécourt (France) site. We are on target to deliver the run rate 
synergies of $12m by the end of 2018, with a further $2m run rates 
savings to be delivered in 2019. 
Delivering organic growth
The largest capital investment programme in the Group’s history is 
well underway. This will help to maintain and upgrade our current 
asset base and respond to market demand for our products. This 
programme commenced in 2016 and we spent £60.3m in 2017 
across the Group. Our Project Excellence approach has been 
introduced Group-wide and aims to ensure that all of the projects 
are completed safely, on time and within budget.
Given the global mega-trends of urbanisation, aging demographics, 
evolving middle class, increasing mobility and the ever more stringent 
environmental legislation, there is increasing demand from the market 
for more of our speciality chemicals and for enhancements to our 
product portfolio, and we have invested accordingly with capacity 
as well as capability expansions in a number of our sites.
• Nitrile latex: 90ktes expansion of our Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) 
site due for completion in late 2018 with a further expansion in 
an advanced stage of planning to address a market which is 
growing at 8% to 10% per annum.
• Dispersions: 36ktes capacity of made-to-order speciality acrylic 
lines in Worms (Germany) and a 9ktes increase in acrylic capacity 
in Roebuck (USA) scheduled to be complete in early 2019.
• SBR latex: Enhancement to our Marl (Germany) site to improve 
output levels to take advantage of opportunities in the Foam 
Market and an upgrading of our Oulu (Finland) site to move from 
supplying the declining graphic paper market to the growth 
markets of speciality paper and packaging.
We continue to invest in the organisational structure and, over 
the last 3 years, have established teams in Operational and 
Manufacturing Excellence, Business Development and Specialist 
Feedstock Procurement. In 2018 the programmes will be further 
enhanced by the introduction of our Commercial Excellence 
programme to our commercial organisation, designed to ensure 
we work more closely with our customers in generating value.
Delivering M&A growth 
Growth through acquisitions is a key part of our growth strategy. 
We are highly active in targeting and reviewing speciality chemical 
acquisition opportunities. These will include both bolt-on 
acquisitions, similar to the ones we have completed, and more 
transformational step-change strategic transactions in adjacent 
chemistries. Our experienced M&A and due diligence teams will 
be opportunistic but disciplined in their approach to acquisitions.
We have made three speciality chemical company acquisitions in 
the last two years, all bolt-on acquisitions complementing our 
existing businesses, and have reviewed many other opportunities 
that have not resulted in completed acquisitions. Whilst we remain 
highly active in M&A processes, we have a clear focus on what 
constitutes an attractive acquisition target, what price we are 
prepared to pay and a firm commitment to incisive due diligence. 
We will remain resolute and disciplined in pursuing only the right 
value-enhancing opportunities.
Outlook
Looking forward, whilst acknowledging the ongoing challenges 
in our Nitrile latex and constructions and coatings Dispersions 
markets, we are confident of making further solid progress in 2018, 
underpinned by underlying growth in both segments, and from 
integrating our recent acquisitions. 
With our significant organic investment in new capacity being 
commissioned in late 2018, we remain confident in continuing to 
deliver growth in profitability and driving further value for 
shareholders in future years.

and successful 
integration of 
acquisitions
26 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 ENA revenue increased from £746.1m to £1,134.9m, an increase  
of 52.1%. The rise in revenue mainly reflects incremental volumes 
associated with the PAC (Dispersions) and Speciality Additives 
acquisitions, the positive impact of weaker Sterling, and the higher 
average raw material prices year on year.
Underlying operating profit at £117.1m was 25.5% higher 
(2016: £93.3m), and IFRS operating profit at £77.5m was 
2.8% higher (2016: £75.4m). 
The significant improvement in ENA’s Underlying operating  
profit was due to good underlying growth of the existing business 
(£16.0m) including the full year benefit of PAC (Dispersions), the 
acquisition of Speciality Additives (£3.7m) and the favourable currency 
translation associated with the depreciation in Sterling (£4.1m).
The segment achieved an improved overall margin, driven by 
higher unit margins in our SBR and Specialities businesses. 
Volumes were 1,067.7ktes (+14.0%) with volume increases in most 
markets compensating for a further reduction in paper volumes.
SBR volumes and unit margins in our Carpet and Foam markets 
increased in 2017. Paper volumes were slightly lower in line with  
the market but margins have been maintained, despite the volatility 
in raw material prices during the year. SBR benefitted from capital 
investment to debottleneck our facility in Marl (Germany) which 
delivered additional capacity and allowed us to take advantage  
of growing opportunities in the attractive Asian Foam market.
Our Dispersions business increased volumes but, consistent with 
other market participants, saw a marginal unit margin decline as  
a result of rising raw material prices. Unlike the SBR business, the 
contracting model in this market is to negotiate prices mainly on a 
monthly basis. The integration of the PAC (Dispersions) business, 
including the consolidation and reallocation of production, allows 
this business better control over its cost base and improved 
flexibility to serve customers through our strategically located 
manufacturing network.

Strategic report Priorities for 2018
Looking ahead to 2018, ENA management is focused 
on driving growth and the future profitability of the 
business. In delivering this growth strategy the key 
priorities for 2018 are:
 + Organic growth at least in line with GDP
 + Continued delivery of acquisition synergies
 + Integration of the BASF Pischelsdorf acquisition 
into our existing plant network
 + Commissioning our capacity and 
capability expansions
Segmental review: Europe and North America (ENA) continued
The integration of the PAC (Dispersions) business, acquired in 2016 
has been substantially completed with a number of actions taken 
this year:
• Our small manufacturing site in Leuna (Germany) was disposed 
of on 1 January 2018. This small site lacked the operational scale 
required for our manufacturing network and, while the site will 
continue to manufacture products for Synthomer for a short 
period, its production will be moved to other facilities in our 
network in due course; and
• During December 2017, we commenced a restructuring 
programme at our manufacturing site in Ribécourt (France) to 
right size and simplify the site operations commensurate with  
its core activities of dispersion and spray drying redispersible 
powders. The site simplification will enhance its operational 
efficiency by reducing the product portfolio as well as reducing 
the fixed cost base. This restructuring programme is expected 
to complete in 2019. 
These actions will complete the integration of the PAC (Dispersions) 
acquisition and will allow us to deliver, as previously announced, 
the run rate synergies savings of $12m by the end of 2018, with a 
further incremental $2m of run rate savings to be delivered in 2019.
Our niche businesses in Specialities showed strong underlying 
volume and margin growth along with the contribution made by the 
acquisition of Speciality Additives. Speciality Additives, a niche 
performance speciality additives business serving the decorative 
and industrial coatings industries, has strong market leadership 
positions (#1 or #2) and serves a highly attractive, blue-chip 
customer base. The business operates from a well located, single 
site in Ghent, Belgium where there is potential for growth in capacity 
to meet future demand. The business is highly complementary to 
Synthomer’s existing markets and customers and the Group is 
focused on expanding its market position through developing closer 
relationships with customers and driving operational performance.
On 31 January 2018 we completed the acquisition of the SBR 
business and assets of BASF Pischelsdorf (Austria) for an enterprise 
value of €30 million. The business produces SBR used in the paper 
industry, notably in packaging end-markets. The acquisition enhances 
Synthomer’s SBR business and production network for paper and 
packaging applications as well as increasing the Group’s access to 
attractive new opportunities across Europe, underscoring our 
long-term commitment to our valued customers in the paper industry.
The acquisition of the Pischelsdorf site firmly cements Synthomer  
as market leader in European aqueous polymers, a significant 
milestone in the development of our ENA business. 
Our organic growth strategy is as important to our ENA business as 
our inorganic M&A growth strategy. We have committed significant 
capital resources this year to meet the growing demand for our 
products across Europe and America, through targeted growth 
capex at our principal sites. These investments included:
• £17m in Worms (Germany) to build made-to-order speciality 
acrylic lines which is on time for commissioning in early 2019;
• £12m investment in Roebuck (USA) on a new acrylic reactor  
line scheduled to be ready in early 2019;
• £3m to expand capacity at our powder coatings business in 
Sant’Albano (Italy) which will come online in Q4 2018; and
• £2m in our SBR facility in Oulu (Finland) scheduled to come 
online in Q3 2018 to expand our capabilities to supply the 
growing packaging and speciality paper markets.

Strategic report
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  29 Segmental review: Asia and Rest of the World (ARW) continued
The performance of our ARW business in 2017 was in line with 
expectations, with the lower profitability principally driven by the  
well trailed softer Nitrile latex margins, the disposal of our South 
African business in August 2016, and the ongoing investment  
at our PAC Chonburi (Thailand) site to integrate it into the Asia 
dispersion network system.
Underlying operating profit at £35.1m was 27.9% below the prior 
year (£48.7m), and the IFRS operating profit at £31.2m was 61.6% 
below the prior year (£81.3m). The 2016 IFRS operating profit 
included the profit on the Malaysian land sale of £33.2m and 
the profit on the sale of the South African business of £4.7m.
The Nitrile latex margins, whilst lower overall than 2016, have  
been reasonably resilient and appear to have settled at a lower  
level in 2017, broadly consistent with the margins seen in Q4 2016. 
Reassuringly, the Nitrile latex margins achieved have improved  
over earlier years when new capacity was brought on line and now 
reflect the level of substantial investment made in our customer 
focussed research and development, capacity expansion, service 
and quality. We are committed to this market and to our important 
customer relationships, and our investment in both increased 
capacity and the patented SyNovus
®
 product are testaments  
to this.
Our 2017 Nitrile latex volumes were broadly flat relative to 2016 with 
our existing capacity sold out, except for modest volumes foregone 
in short shutdown periods to integrate the incremental capacity to 
be brought on line later in 2018. 
Volumes in the Dispersions business were also broadly in line  
with the prior year despite the disposal in 2016 of our South African 
business but, like others, margins were impacted by the rise in 
raw material prices. The start-up production facility in Chonburi 
(Thailand), which joined the Group as part of the PAC (Dispersions) 
acquisition in 2016, continued to require operational support to 
bring it into line with Synthomer standards and had a negative 
contribution of £2.3m in the year. A new management team has 
been now put in place to take the site forward.
Research and development is a critical part of our Nitrile latex 
and Dispersions businesses, and we are currently evaluating the 
opportunity to invest in a new state-of-the-art Innovation Centre in 
the region by 2020 and in continuing developmental research in our 
core markets.
University level sponsorship has been a core part of building 
Synthomer’s technology and innovation capability. This year our 
PhD sponsored student at Manchester University successfully 
completed his studies and joined our R&D Team in Kluang, and in 
Asia the Group continued its collaboration with Universiti Teknologi 
Malaysia (UTM), where a Masters Level student has been sponsored 
to work on a Synthomer defined emulsion polymerisation project. 
On completion of her degree in Q1 2018, she will also join the R&D 
team in Kluang. For the second year running, Synthomer sponsored 
an award for Best PhD thesis in Polymer Science at the Institut 
Kimia Malaysia (IKM, Malaysian Chemistry Society).

30  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Priorities for 2018
Turning to 2018 activities, the business is well 
placed to secure future growth in profitability and 
management is keenly focused on the principal 
activities that will allow this potential to be unlocked. 
The priorities for 2018 are:
 + Successful completion of capital investment 
programme in Pasir Gudang
 + Continue to manage Nitrile latex margins in an 
evolving and competitive market
 + Improve operational efficiency of Chonburi to 
Synthomer standards
 + Market penetration of SyNovus
®
 + Finalise planning for the next phase of Nitrile latex 
capacity expansion 
The Nitrile latex market reached the milestone of one million  
tonnes per annum of demand during 2017 and continues to grow  
at between 8% to 10% per annum. In September 2017, Synthomer’s 
Innovation Group responded to the demand of end users and glove 
manufacturers by launching SyNovus
®
, a ground breaking patented 
new product. SyNovus
®
 is designed to have significantly reduced 
maturation time, superior tensile strength properties, higher levels  
of durability and improved chemical resistance with unprecedented 
colour and odour improvements. This new product was warmly 
received by industry leaders at a dedicated launch event in Kuala 
Lumpur. The Innovation Group also launched a new higher 
performing XSBR latex application for the Carpet market during 
the year.
Our 90ktes capacity expansion of our Nitrile latex facility in Pasir 
Gudang (Malaysia), the largest capital investment undertaken  
by the Group at £45m, is progressing safely, on time and on  
budget. We have now completed all the major construction work 
with commissioning later in 2018 when our installed capacity will 
increase by approximately 40%. As the current expansion moves 
into the commissioning phase we have started the evaluation 
process for the timing of the next stage of the Pasir Gudang 
expansion, the introduction of a further 60ktes of capacity, 
recognising the infrastructure and civil engineering for this further 
expansion has been undertaken in the earlier stage of the project. 
The continued growth in demand for Nitrile latex remains significant 
and we are well placed to capitalise on this growth with our existing 
capacity, our incremental next stage 60ktes capacity expansion, 
and our exciting new patented SyNovus
®
 product.

Managing risk
Risk management
Identification and assessment of risk
We have a structured risk management framework operated 
at regional and Group level. The Business Risk Assessment 
Methodology defines a standard set of risk categories with 
generic risk descriptions to assist management in identifying areas 
of risk. There is also a simple scoring methodology to quantify risk. 
We rank risks, taking into account the mitigating controls in place, 
by combining their economic, operational or reputational impact 
and the likelihood that they may occur.
We use a barrier based “bow tie” method to help management 
define and assess the most critical risk events. The method brings 
structure to the identification of hazards or risk events, potential 
causes of those hazards and the consequences of the hazard 
occurring. The bow tie method also identifies barriers or controls 
in place or needing to be developed to mitigate the likelihood of 
the threats occurring or impact of the effects of the risk event. 
Risk output
Executive management and Group Functions conduct a 
comprehensive independent assessment of the principal risks at 
Group level and record them in a risk register. The Board reviews 
and approves the Group risk register. 
Each region undertakes a formal risk assessment and prepares  
a register using the Business Risk Assessment Methodology. 
Risk management review and assurance
Group Risk Function
The Group Risk Function, an integral part of our Group Operations 
Function, challenges the assumptions, risks identified, prioritisation 
and mitigating actions in place or proposed.
Successful risk management is fundamental to achieving Synthomer’s strategy by facilitating good decision making, embracing 
opportunities and protecting our sites, systems, staff and other stakeholders. 
Risk

Assurance providers
Synthomer operates a “three lines of defence” model. A number 
of different internal assurance providers (for example, Group SHE, 
ISO audits and Internal Audit) review the effectiveness of the 
mitigating actions and controls. External assurance is provided 
by our Statutory Auditors and also by an external specialist in 
ISO standards. 
Our key risks
Risks affect us in many ways. We identify the likelihood and potential 
impact of risks through our formal twice yearly risk assessment 
submissions and also more regularly through empowering 
management to consider and react to risks. These reviews, together 
with our three line defence model, enable us to establish effective 
controls to mitigate their effects. 
We categorise our risks taking into account the effectiveness  
of mitigating actions and controls, in the following areas: 
• Strategic risks that could prevent us from achieving our 
strategic objectives. 
• Operational risks which, if not successfully managed, would 
threaten our viability. These relate to our ability to operate a 
sustainable and safe business.
• Compliance risks where a breach of regulations or laws could 
lead to fines from Regulators and reputational risk that may be 
disproportionate to the size of the event leading to a breach.
• Financial risks relating to the funding and fiscal security of 
the Group.
The table on pages 34 to 37 shows more detail on the key risks 
identified in 2017. Our Board and management consider that these 
pose the greatest threats to our business and they score highest on 
our risk table. They fall into categories that relate closely to our 
business model. Not all risks facing Synthomer are listed and the 
risks are not listed in any order of priority.
The nature of risk changes over time with new risks emerging and 
the impact of others changing. Our risk management and assurance 
programme can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
that key risks are managed to an acceptable level.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  33
Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s strategic objectives can only be achieved if certain risks are taken and managed effectively.  
We have listed below the key risks that affect our business, although there are other lower level risks that occur 
and impact the Group’s performance which are also actively managed through our risk management framework.
Strategic Risks
Risk Response 2018 Plans
Volatility in the chemicals and polymers market
The global chemicals and polymers 
markets are inherently volatile affecting 
volumes and margins and may adversely 
affect the results of the Group. 
1 4
  
V
The Group maintains a balanced portfolio of 
products serving a wide range of end markets 
around the globe. Segment performance at 
business unit level is closely monitored and 
corrective actions are taken as necessary. 
Our acquisition strategy continues to 
target expansion in new geographic 
regions and also adjacent speciality 
chemicals businesses to help us 
diversify the risk further.
New product development continues 
to diversify the Group’s risk.
Competition and failure to innovate
Our markets are highly competitive and 
the Group could lose market share to 
other producers of speciality chemicals or 
to other products that can be substituted 
for the products of the Group.
1 3
  
V
The Group continues to invest in enhancing 
existing products and developing new 
products through our R&D programme and  
also our acquisition strategy includes 
technologies that are new to the Group. 
Our technical services teams work with our 
customers to understand and anticipate their 
future needs and to help them drive efficiencies 
in their own manufacturing process.
All sites operate quality management systems 
including assurance processes to ensure the 
quality of products meets agreed standards. 
We have strengthened our business 
development teams and expect further 
projects and new product releases to 
bring competitive advantage. Our global 
Customer Relationship Management 
system (CRM) will enable our sales teams 
to better identify and secure opportunities. 
Our integrated business planning process 
will enable further efficiencies in 
manufacturing processes and costs. 
Intellectual property
The value of the Group is dependent 
on our ability to identify and secure our 
own intellectual property and ensure we 
do not breach third parties intellectual 
property rights which could lead to 
reputational damage. 
1
The Group has a dedicated team 
for management of IP and protects 
its intellectual property through an 
active patent programme and monitoring 
for infringements. 
Where appropriate we patent all 
intellectual property in products, 
processes and technologies.
We will continue to improve our IT 
Governance to secure IP held within 
our plant and ERP systems to protect 
it from theft or unauthorised use. 
Manufacturing capacity
Enhancements to our plants to 
increase manufacturing capacity 
to take advantage of growth markets 
are dependent on project management. 
Poor execution of our various projects 
could impact on our ability to deliver the 
capacity enhancements. 
4
  
V
We have a robust capital appraisal process 
in place to assess proposed projects to 
ensure they deliver value which includes 
regular reporting to the Board. Project 
Excellence methodology is in place for all 
significant CAPEX projects and is subject  
to Internal Audit review. The outcome of 
completed projects with costs in excess  
of £1m are reviewed by the Audit Committee.
We have announced three significant 
capacity enhancements that will 
deliver volume in late 2018/early 2019.
Our Project Excellence methodology is 
being rolled out across all of our projects 
in 2018.
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for 
our significant capital projects is being 
introduced to the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) performance measures in 2018.
34  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Risk Response 2018 Plans
Acquisition strategy
The Group’s strategic plan involves 
significant M&A activity to grow our 
business. There is a risk that we identify 
the wrong targets, pay too high a price, 
fail to integrate acquired assets and 
drive planned synergies, or encounter 
performance, funding and cashflow 
issues and potentially unknown liabilities. 
5
Executive management has extensive 
experience of successful M&A transactions 
including integration of the acquired business. 
External advice is used to help identify 
targets, prepare bids and incisive due 
diligence. 
Detailed integration plans are prepared  
as part of the due diligence exercise. 
M&A activity will continue to be closely 
scrutinised and challenged by the Board.
We will increase the efficiency of our 
existing processes and continue to invest 
in our ERP systems to enable smoother 
integration of acquired businesses. 
Ongoing review of acquisition process  
and implementation of lessons learned  
to future transactions. 
Operational Risks
Risk Response 2018 Plans
Safety, health and environment (SHE)
The chemical industry is inherently 
dangerous involving the safe transport, 
storage and manufacture of hazardous 
chemicals. Failure to manage the impact 
on our staff, manufacturing sites and the 
environment of these risks could lead to 
regulatory fines, reputational damage and 
lost production.
2
Synthomer operates a central safety audit 
function dedicated to SHE issues and it 
provides advice to, and monitors, our sites 
to enable continuous improvement across 
all major SHE areas. Increasingly the focus 
is on process safety risk to mitigate the risk 
of major incidents. 
Maintenance programmes are undertaken 
to mitigate the risks. 
Our Group SHE audits will continue to 
focus on higher risk areas including 
process safety. We will make further 
progress on our long term ambition 
to implement a proactive approach to 
maintenance as a preventable measure. 
We will focus specifically on completing 
the actions from our Process Hazard 
Assessments.
Volatility in raw material prices
Volatility in the prices of our key raw 
materials can affect the profitability of the 
Group and its working capital position.
2 3
The Group actively manages margins and is 
focused on recovering input cost increases 
from customers.
Strategic raw material sourcing teams 
will continue to broaden and strengthen 
supplier relationships and secure 
contracts to enhance optionality in 
volatile raw materials markets.
Incremental offsite storage facilities will  
be secured to both enhance security of 
supply and provide greater flexibility in 
sourcing key raw materials.
Loss or failure of a manufacturing site
A site might be unable to operate, whether 
temporarily or longer term, due to a risk 
event, including natural disaster, safety 
incident, failure of a key supplier or the 
supply chain, sabotage and cyber-attack, 
and would have an adverse impact on 
operations and business unit profitability.
2 3
  
V
Crisis management procedures are in place 
for all sites to respond to risk events which 
are reviewed and tested regularly. 
Sourcing strategies are in place Group-wide 
to access multiple sources for key raw 
materials and the Group works closely 
with key suppliers to ensure availability. 
Single sourced materials are identified 
and inventory retained, where appropriate, 
to mitigate risk of supply chain failure.
We will continue to improve existing plans 
and develop overall business continuity 
plans including crisis management 
response, disaster recovery for key 
systems and data as well as longer 
term recovery of operations.

Security of systems and sites
We are reliant on various systems to run our 
business. As the frequency, sophistication 
and effect of cyber-attacks continues to 
grow across the world, all of our systems, 
including our industrial control systems, 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and 
communications could be targeted. We could 
lose intellectual property and customer data 
which might undermine our competitive 
position or a cyber attack could leave one of 
our plants out of action or used for sabotage. 
1 2
 
3
Network intrusion detection and prevention 
has been strengthened with all computers 
now protected with a consistent anti-
virus product. 
Vulnerability assessments and penetration 
testing is performed to identify risks in our 
networks and mitigating actions required 
to meet the evolving threats. 
Further security processes and 
procedures targeted at these areas are 
being implemented in 2018 including 
industrial control systems isolation and 
secure third party remote access.
We will increase our IT resilience 
through refreshed testing of 
our disaster recovery arrangements. 
Physical security standards will be 
developed in consultation with our 
SHE teams and Chief Security Officer. 
Compliance Risks
Risk Response 2018 Plans
Product quality
Product quality and reliability is a key 
element of our competitive position. 
The Group may lose customers and 
potentially be liable for damages for 
any quality issues. 
2
Technically qualified personnel and control 
systems are in place around the Group to 
ensure products meet agreed standards.
Synthomer has a Group-wide product 
liability insurance policy.
The Group has a number of leading and 
lagging performance indicators which are 
reviewed monthly. 
The Group will continue to invest in 
quality control systems and quality 
assurance testing. 
SHE regulation
Failure to comply with extensive and 
constantly evolving environmental, health 
and safety laws and regulations could lead 
to significant fines, reputational damage 
and loss of operating licences.
2
Detailed safety, health and environmental 
processes are documented in operating 
guidance which is updated and 
communicated to staff on a regular basis. 
Our Regulatory Affairs department will 
ensure we comply with the REACH 
regulations throughout the European 
Union and monitor changes in legal 
requirements in other jurisdictions to 
ensure we remain compliant. 
Ethics
The Group could suffer substantial 
penalties, damage to reputation and 
other sanctions for any failure to control, 
for example, anti-competitive behaviour, 
bribery and corruption, or breaches of 
trade sanctions. New enhanced rules for 
data privacy in the European Union with 
greater potential penalties could impact 
the Group. 
2
All our key employees affirm their 
understanding of the code of business 
conduct, covering corruption and anti-
competitive business practices. Malpractice 
reporting and whistleblowing protection are 
similarly covered in the Group policy on 
protecting our reputation. Group Legal and 
local management provide regular training 
to targeted groups of employees. 
We plan to enhance the existing e-learning 
modules with an improved monitoring 
process, refresher training, and roll out  
of additional compliance areas. We will 
implement a new sanctions screening 
product to reduce the risk of non-compliance.
We are working to ensure our data privacy 
framework including reporting of breaches 
meet the new legal requirements.
Operational Risks continued
36  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Risks 
Risk Response 2018 Plans
Financial market volatility
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
turnover and assets are in currencies 
other than UK sterling and fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates may significantly 
impact the results of the Group.
The Group’s balance sheet and cash 
flow, and also credit market conditions 
and credit ratings, may restrict the ability 
of the Group to obtain credit facilities or 
to refinance its existing debt facilities in 
the longer term. 
The Group has funding risks relating 
to defined benefit pension scheme 
obligations, the value of which are highly 
dependent on volatile financial markets.
2 5
  
V
The Group has a policy of hedging all 
significant foreign exchange transactional 
exposure at operating company level. The 
Group borrows a proportion of its funding  
in overseas currencies to hedge the net 
assets held in those currencies.
The Group closely monitors its operating 
cash flow and capital expenditure on a 
monthly basis and regularly reviews 
covenant compliance. 
The UK scheme was closed to future 
accrual in 2009 and additional contributions 
and careful asset management should 
reduce the deficit over the longer term. 
Overseas schemes are reviewed annually  
by actuaries to ensure appropriate 
contributions are made and liabilities are 
recognised appropriately. 
We will continue to hedge currency risks.
We will continue to monitor our covenants 
as we pursue our M&A strategy and ensure 
we pay the right price for acquisitions.
Pension deficits are expected to reduce 
over the longer term as the Group pays 
the additional contributions agreed with 
the Trustees in 2016. The timescale will  
be affected by movements in the financial 
markets and the discount rate. 
A Group-wide review of pension and 
other long term employee liabilities will 
be undertaken in 2018. 
 
In accordance with the provision of section C.2.2 of the 2016 
revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a five-year period 
to December 2022, being the period covered by the Group’s 
approved strategic plan. This plan, which is updated annually, 
includes analyses of product and profit performance, cash  
flow, investment programmes and returns to shareholders.
The Directors consider five years to be an appropriate time 
horizon for the strategic plan, being the period over which the 
Group actively focuses on its long term product development 
and capital expenditure investments. A period above five  
years is considered by the Directors to be too long, given  
the uncertainties that exist beyond this time frame.
In making their assessment, the Directors have considered the 
Group’s current strong financial position, including the existing 
committed bank facilities, which have been assumed to be 
refinanced at maturity in July 2019.
Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken, 
focusing on the impact of the principal risks (detailed on pages 34 
to 37) over the five year period. The risks have been assessed 
for their potential impact on the Group’s business model, future 
trading and funding structure. The sensitivity analysis has 
considered a number of severe but plausible 
scenarios, linked to the risks considered to have the most 
significant financial impact. In all cases, the impact was 
considered on both liquidity and borrowing covenants.
The scenarios included trading volatility, increased competition, 
delays in capacity improvement, failure of new products and 
the temporary loss of a major manufacturing site. They also 
included significant foreign currency exchange rate or interest 
rate movements risks, which are deemed to be outside the 
control of the Group. A combined sensitivity was also performed, 
aggregating all of the scenarios considered. The results took 
into account the availability and likely degree of effectiveness 
of mitigating actions available. 
While this sensitivity analysis did not consider all of the risks that 
the Group may face, the Directors consider that it is reasonable 
in the circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five 
year period.

Strategic report Chief Financial Officer’s review
A solid and sustainable 
performance, built on a strong  
and flexible balance sheet
Strategic highlights
 + Solid and sustainable profits growth driven by 
acquisitions, unit margins and fx
 + Consistently strong operating cash flows
 + Record investment in growth capex
 + Strong and flexible balance sheet, allowing us to 
invest in organic and inorganic growth
Overview
2017 has been another progressive year for the Group with solid 
growth and the successful integrations of PAC (Dispersions) 
acquired in 2016 and Speciality Additives acquired in 2017.
The key drivers behind the improvement in overall performance were:
• ENA saw good Underlying profit growth as volumes and unit 
margins increased.
• ARW performed in line with expectations, with stable Nitrile latex 
margins relative to the final quarter of 2016. 
• Speciality Additives, a £66.1m bolt-on acquisition, completed 
and was integrated into the Group.
• The integration of PAC (Dispersions) was substantially completed 
and on target to deliver the $12m run rate synergies by end of 
2018 with a further incremental $2m run rate synergies to be 
delivered by the end of 2019. The disposal of our Leuna 
(Germany) site and the announcement of the restructuring of  
our Ribécourt (France) site were the last significant steps in the 
integration.
• The continuing weakness of Sterling has resulted in a positive 
impact on the Group’s reported results, albeit this mainly related 
to H1.
Alternative performance measures
The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative 
Performance Measures (‘APMs’) since its adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) in 2005:
• Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from 
IFRS profit measures
• EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and 
depreciation from IFRS operating profit
Stephen Bennett
Chief Financial Officer The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the 
Group’s narrative reporting. Further information and the reconciliation to the IFRS measures are included in notes 2, 5 and 6.

The following should be noted:
• The underlying improvement in the ENA existing business of £16.0m (17.1%) reflects the full year impact of the acquisition of PAC 
(Dispersions) as well as improvements in margins in most markets.
• ARW Nitrile latex volumes were in line with the prior year and margins were robust and broadly in line with Q4 2016. Further operational 
investment in the PAC Chonburi (Thailand) site has been made in 2017, impacting Underlying operating profit.
• Underlying unallocated corporate costs increased by £1.4m reflecting the increase in the cost of share-based payments due to the rise in 
share price during 2017 and the crystallisation of the outcome of strategic targets, and further strengthening of the management team in 
the London Head Office.
• The continuing weakness of Sterling during the year resulted in an increase in the Group’s reported profit in Sterling. For the European 
businesses, the rate used for translating profit moved from £1:€1.2180 in 2016 to £1:€1.1430 in 2017, with a resulting uplift in the 2017 
ENA profit of £4.1m.

The following items of income and expense have been reported as Special Items, in line with the comments above:
• The restructuring and site closure costs included £9.0m in relation to the post-acquisition integration of the PAC (Dispersions) business 
with the majority being attributable to the rationalisation of the Ribécourt (France) site. A further £1.6m related to the cost of an onerous 
lease on a site closed during 2017, while £0.8m comprised costs for the post-acquisition integration of Speciality Additives.
• The profit on sale of business relates to the disposal of our South African business in 2016.
• The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton, UK. The profit on sale of land in 2016 related to the disposal of 
tranches of Malaysian land.
• The gain of £13.1m in 2016 resulted from foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US dollar purchase consideration 
of the PAC (Dispersions) acquisition.
• Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to Speciality Additives (2016: PAC (Dispersions)) and for other potential acquisitions which will 
not occur or had not occurred before the balance sheet date. 
• The amortisation of intangibles increased during 2017 due to a full year of amortisation for the 2016 PAC (Dispersions) acquisition, the 
intangibles acquired with Speciality Additives and due to foreign currency exchange rate movements.

The IFRS effective tax rate is impacted by the tax credit on the Special Items. It is therefore helpful to consider the underlying and Special 
Items separately:
• The effective tax rate on Underlying performance has reduced slightly in the year due to prior year adjustments and changes in overseas 
tax rates.
• The effective tax rate for Special Items is principally driven by the deferred tax credit on the amortisation of acquired intangibles.

Strategic report Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Due to the continued strong cash performance of the Group, the Business cash flow at £124.4m (2016: £122.7m) has remained stable, 
despite a £14.7m increase in expenditure on property, plant and equipment. Further commentary on the other significant cash flows is 
provided below. 
• Working capital control remained a key focus of Group management, demonstrated by achieving a cash inflow in a year of organic 
growth and rising raw material prices.
• The increase in capital expenditure, which is largely being invested in our plants, reflects the cash spend on the previously announced 
Nitrile latex capacity increase in Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) (£15m), and the made-to-order speciality acrylic lines in Worms (Germany) of 
£8m.
• The rise in cash tax payments of £9m primarily reflects payments in respect of acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 of £4m and higher 
payments on account, principally in Italy and Germany of £6m. 
• The amount shown as pension funding in excess of IAS19 charge mainly reflects the UK defined benefit deficit recovery funding of 
£14.7m (2016: £14.5m). 
• The outflow for purchase of business of £66.2m primarily relates to the acquisition of Speciality Additives. The prior year outflow of 
£156.7m mainly relates to the purchase of PAC (Dispersions).
• The business sale proceeds of £7.6m is the amount received ahead of the year end on the disposal of Synthomer Leuna GmbH, as 
disclosed in note 37. The prior year proceeds of £12.8m related to the net cash consideration received on the disposal of our South 
African business.
• Substantial amounts of the Group’s borrowings have been maintained in Euros and US dollars as a natural hedge against the net asset 
base in these two currencies. With the devaluation of Sterling referred to above, the translation at the year end rates has resulted in an 
exchange loss and therefore a higher borrowings amount (offset by a corresponding increase in the net asset base in these currencies).
Financing and liquidity
The Group retains the use of a committed revolving credit facility of £370m, sourced from five banks. This facility provided the necessary 
funds to complete the acquisition of Speciality Additives, while maintaining substantial headroom. An additional committed short term bank 
loan facility of €55m (£48.9m) was entered into in November 2017, to provide extra liquidity in anticipation of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR 
business acquisition on 31 January 2018, for an enterprise value of €30m.

In addition to the facility headroom identified above, the Group had cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2017 of £89.6m (2016:

The principal financial covenant in the revolving credit facility remains that net borrowings must be less than 3.0 times EBITDA at 31

The table sets out the total pension charge included in the income statement and the total defined benefit obligation included in the  
balance sheet.
The following should be noted:
• The overseas pension cost has increased due to the PAC (Dispersions) and Speciality Additives acquisitions. The UK pension cost  
has increased, mainly due to an increase in net interest expense in the defined benefit scheme.
• The reduction in UK defined benefit pension liabilities of £34.2m primarily relates to an improvement in mortality actuarial assumptions 
(£18.5m), pension scheme deficit recovery payment of £14.7m, offset by a reduction in the discount rate from 2.7% to 2.5% (£11.4m).
Acquisition and disposal accounting 
The accounting for the acquisition of Speciality Additives and the disposal of Synthomer Leuna GmbH are shown in the notes 31 and 37 respectively. 
For the acquisition, the assets and liabilities have been included at fair value with the balance of consideration shown as goodwill. KPMG 
LLP were engaged to advise on the fair value of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE). Overall their conclusion was that the total fair 
value of the PPE should be increased by £4.8m. KPMG LLP also performed a valuation of the intangibles, which mainly comprised 
customer relationships. Accordingly, on acquisition the Group recognised goodwill and acquired intangibles of £24.1m and £41.4m 
respectively and the valuation is now final. These intangibles are being amortised over periods of 5 to 14 years.
Post balance sheet events
On 1 January 2018, the Group sold Synthomer Leuna GmbH, comprising the assets of a plant in Germany for a profit of £1.5m.
On 31 January 2018, the Group completed the purchase of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR business and assets, for €29.3m. The purchase 
consideration was funded from the Group’s existing financial resources.

Introduction
Synthomer recognises the significance and importance of being  
a responsible Company. We take responsibility for the complete  
life cycle of our products and for the impact our operations have  
on people and the environment. 
Synthomer considers the issues that are material to its business  
and seeks to respond to them in a manner appropriate to the 
interests of all its stakeholders. 
We are committed to approaching our business in an ethical and 
environmentally sound manner and have been committed to the 
International Council of Chemical Associations’ (ICCA) Responsible 
Care project since the early 1990s.
Our work in this area has been highlighted through the Group’s 
inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index since 2004. The FTSE4Good 
Index is operated by FTSE and highlights the performance of stock 
market listed companies against a range of environmental, social 
and governance criteria. To be eligible for inclusion in the index 
companies must demonstrate a high level of commitment in  
areas such as climate change, environmental management  
and human rights.
To ensure the safe management and use of its products, Synthomer 
is committed to sharing relevant health and safety information 
throughout the value chain. To achieve this, we work closely with 
our suppliers and customers to fully understand the environmental 
impact of our raw materials, processes and products on the overall 
product life cycle. We identify potential improvement areas and 
focus efforts on delivering those improvements. Growing sustainably 
is a challenge, but it is one that we are committed to taking on.
Sustainability at the 
heart of our business
The Group’s international operations fulfil their responsibility to record, 
monitor and make publicly available the potential impact of its activities. 
In pursuing its corporate strategy, Synthomer’s aim is to adopt business 
practices that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, 
and to promote these to its stakeholders in order to strengthen 
relationships, share knowledge and encourage best practice. 
The Group’s risk management processes include consideration of  
the potential impact of corporate responsibility issues on Synthomer’s 
performance. The Group’s investment decisions take into account 
appropriate evaluations of the potential consequences for its 
employees, customers and suppliers and the environment.
 
Our commitment to science  
and education
This year, Synthomer supported SCI’s inaugural Bright SCIdea 
Challenge – a competition for teams of university students to turn  
an idea for a scientific innovation into a business pitch. The aim  
of the competition is to help ambitious young scientists develop  
their entrepreneurial skills – the essential tools required to  
translate a scientific idea into a commercially viable business  
with real-world benefits. 
SCI is a multidisciplinary membership organisation where science 
meets business on independent, impartial ground. Established in  
1881 as the Society of Chemical Industry, it supports the translation  
of science-based innovation into industry for the benefit of society.  
SCI work through a global network of industrialists and academics  
in sectors as diverse as food and agriculture, pharmaceuticals  
and energy. 
“Synthomer was excited to take the sponsorship role for the SCIdea 
initiative. This was a great opportunity for Synthomer to help early 
career scientists gain exposure and develop some core competencies 
that will help shape them as future leaders of the chemical industry”.

Attraction & Retention
In 2017 we relaunched our Company website with a particular focus 
on strengthening our employee brand. The new website makes it 
easier for prospective employees to better understand the benefits 
of joining Synthomer and to access employment opportunities. 
We are proud to support a range of initiatives to promote STEM 
(Science Technology Engineering Maths) careers, working in 
partnership with industry partners such as the Royal Society of 
Chemistry (RSC), the Society of Chemical Industry (SCI) and the 
Chemical Industries Association. Our people attended Chemistry at 
Work 2017, a careers event organised by the RSC, to promote our 
business as well as providing Year 10 school students with valuable 
career advice. Members of the team also visit universities and 
schools in all of the countries in which we operate as part of 
promoting STEM and attracting the best people to Synthomer.
Our commitment to employee  
health & wellness
The employee health & wellness programme is divided into three 
phases with the phases one and two delivered over 12 months:
Phase one: health and fitness screening and analytics.  
Phase two: focuses on reviewing results, goal setting, targeted 
education and development of a personal plan to improve  
resilience and performance.  
Phase three: provision of the support required to deliver long term 
behavioural change and subsequent re-evaluation.
“The CorPerformance programme caused me to reflect on personal 
behaviour and potential consequences. It was a real wakeup call 
helping me to sustainably shift the balance towards a more active 
and healthier lifestyle. In the programme cohort that I was part of, 
not only have individual suit sizes changed drastically but also the 
spirit in the team, who share the passion for sensible eating and 
drinking – important in our jobs – and sports. Over a year into the 
programme and I’m still sometimes to be found running through 
Hyde Park at 6.00am with an international and cross functional 
group of colleagues – this is perhaps the most obvious sign –  
apart from weight and blood pressure – of how fundamentally  
this programme has changed me as a leader in Synthomer.”

46  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Our commitment to recognising  
our people
Our businesses around the world reward and recognise our  
people in many different ways. Our Four ‘I’ programme was 
launched in Asia three years ago and it recognises and rewards 
employees who can demonstrate Ideas, Innovation, Improvement 
and Implementation at work. Anyone, irrespective of their level in  
the organisation, who shows they can translate ideas into practical 
action will get a chance to present to senior management. The top 
performers are then duly recognised and rewarded during the 
annual dinner held in Malaysia.
“Our regional leadership team are very active in supporting not  
just our Four “I” programme but all our recognitions schemes  
and are passionate about recognising people who uphold and 
practise the Group’s core values”.
Dato’ Norashikin Ismail, HR Director Asia
Our commitment to developing  
leaders of the future
"The Synthomer European Mentoring Programme gives young 
professionals the opportunity to interact with the senior team  
and understand how the business operates in a supportive 
environment. At the same time it gives that same senior team  
the opportunity to get new perspectives by connecting with  
bright, young professionals – frequently from different cultures  
and functions. The combination of group and one-on-one 
interactions provides a good mix of both formal and informal 
networking. In this way it helps to develop the leaders of  
tomorrow while enhancing the leadership of the business today.”
Andy Axford, European Operations Director/Mentor
"The Synthomer Mentoring Programme is a big opportunity for  
a young professional. It gives the possibility to meet and work  
with the company’s senior leaders. Synthomer has given me  
this opportunity – and to others – at an early stage of my career.  
It gives mentees an interesting challenge: dealing with senior 
managers, having one-to-one meetings, and working with peers 
from different countries and backgrounds, developing our skills, 
sharing experiences that deepen our knowledge of and our 
involvement in the Company."
Clara Colombo, Finance Manager/Mentee
We offer an executive programme to our senior leaders in 
partnership with CorPerformance, a company dedicated to  
driving performance, improving personal resilience, enabling  
lasting behavioural change, while actively reducing the long term 
risk of disease in individuals as well as organisations. In 2015  
a cohort of fifteen of our senior leaders attended the programme  
and based on the significant success of this first intervention  
the programme was extended to a further cohort of 30 leaders  
in 2017 and will continue in 2018.
Reward & Recognition
In 2017 we worked on improving the communication around our 
Global Bonus Scheme. We are proud to offer a bonus scheme that 
extends to all levels in our organisation, not just to senior leaders, 
and having listened carefully to employee feedback have improved 
our communication so that every employee understands how they 
contribute to the sustained success of our business. 
Given our global focus on delivering and sustaining world class  
levels of Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) all employees  
have some elements of their bonus based on safety performance 
measures which pay out, if targets are met, irrespective of Group 
financial performance. 
Organisational Effectiveness
Building on our focus on Succession Planning in 2016 we have 
extended our proactive and structured approach to this area  
further down the organisation to key positions and levels below  
the senior leadership team. Talent and succession plans continue  
to be regularly reviewed by leadership teams, by our Executive  
team and the Board. 
Learning & Development
Our belief is that continuous learning benefits everyone in  
our organisation and drives the performance of our business.  
In 2017, Synthomer employees around the globe participated  
in many thousands of hours of focused learning activities. 
In 2017, we launched a European Mentoring Programme pairing 
12 of our early career professionals with members of our European 
Senior Management Team. This scheme is one example of how  
our leaders take an active role in developing future leaders and  
how we are investing in learning and development.
We have launched a similar scheme in Asia and will further extend 
mentoring schemes in 2018.
Our “Fit for Leadership” programme for Shift Leaders and Middle 
Managers was launched this year in Operations. The programme  
is designed to support the Synthomer leadership culture and  
build engagement and performance in our production sites. The 
programme focuses on empowerment and building self-reliance. 
The initial training of more the 60 employees took place in Germany 
and will be rolled out to other countries in 2018.

Strategic report Sustainability continued
Leadership Development
In 2017 we continued to invest in the recruitment & development  
of graduates and early career professionals with schemes and 
structured programmes launched in Europe, Asia and within our 
Engineering function. 
We received over 1,400 applications for our Asian Graduate 
Programme where we aim to develop and create high calibre 
graduates by exposing them to different environments within 
the Group and giving them international assignments. As well as 
getting exposure to our engineering and commercial operations,  
the candidates are assessed quarterly through presentations to 
senior management. 
We seek individuals who are action-oriented, resourceful, and have 
the courage to challenge the norms. The competencies we look 
for include all-round ability, ambiguity management, the ability to 
collaborate with others together with good interpersonal skills. 
We look to be a valued part of communities in which we operate 
and, as such, we encourage our employees to engage with their 
communities. We actively promote STEM in schools and other 
educational institutes and in 2017 our employees attended and 
presented at a number of events in the UK, Europe and Asia where 
positive feedback was received from both our employees and the 
participants. Our employees are involved in charitable fundraising 
for good causes in their local communities and one of the ways 
we have to encourage this, for example, is by having a policy in 
the UK to match donations raised by employees.
Corporate Responsibility policies
Our global Code of Conduct is governed by a wide range of 
policies which we adopt to ensure our daily business is conducted 
in a professional and responsible manner. These policies play a key 
role in maintaining our reputation with our internal and external 
stakeholders. They also set out the standards to which we hold 
ourselves, our employees and our business partners.
Diversity and human rights
Our Equal opportunities, diversity and human rights policy includes 
our responsibility to follow all applicable laws and regulations as 
well as a complete prohibition of forced, compulsory and child 
labour. Details of this policy, along with our Modern Slavery Act 
Statement are available on our website: www.synthomer.com. 
Diversity is one of Synthomer’s core values. We are a diverse 
organisation who employ significant numbers of employees 
in Europe, Asia and North America. Whilst our Group Head 
Office is based in the UK the majority of employees are based 
elsewhere around the globe. Major Synthomer locations tend to 
be characterised by a diverse range of nationalities and in the UK, 
where we have around 500 employees, we have people from 
over 20 different countries. 
Our commitment to  
leadership development
Sherace studied an MSc in Advanced Chemical Engineering  
at the University of Birmingham (2017), and a BEng in Chemical 
Engineering at the University of Hull (2016). She joined Synthomer  
in 2017.
“I applied for the Synthomer Graduate Programme because  
of the emphasis on development. As a graduate I was looking  
for a company whose ethos matched my own career goals, and 
Synthomer presented themselves very well as a growing company 
who wanted to invest in future leaders. Moreover, I had previously 
undertaken a placement in a Speciality Chemicals company, and 
specifically wanted to join a Speciality Chemicals company in a 
graduate role. So for both those reasons, Synthomer ticked my 
boxes and the opportunity to travel didn’t hurt either!
Since I joined in September, I’ve been working with the  
production department at the Harlow plant. As promised,  
I’ve had the opportunity to take on a diverse portfolio of projects. 
I’ve worked as the Commissioning Engineer on some of the key  
site 2017 projects. I’ve even spent a month on shift with the  
site operators. Currently, I’m working as the Project Manager  
of some key debottleneck projects that yield significant payback  
to the business. 
I love the diversity of my job, and the constant emphasis on 
leadership and competency development. That diversity helps me 
as I’m working towards becoming a Chartered Engineer with the 
IChemE. To qualify, you need to have an extensive experience in 
different engineering capacities. Before I even joined Synthomer  
in September, the company sent me on a commissioning course  
to ensure that I could jump straight into my role after University;  
and since then, the push for development hasn’t stopped.”
Sherace Francis, Graduate Engineer 
48  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Whilst Synthomer operates in a typically male dominated industry 
20% of our employees are female. The rate at which talented 
women are joining our business is increasing and in 2017 41% 
of employees who joined Synthomer in the UK were female  
as were over 30% of our graduate recruits in Europe and Asia. 
In many of our scientific roles we have achieved a gender balance.
Synthomer will comply with UK Gender Pay Gap legislation and has 
a Diversity & Inclusion action plan. 
Corruption and anti-competitive behaviour
Synthomer is committed to complying with the laws and regulations 
of all the countries in which it operates (including those covering 
corruption and anti-competitive behaviour). This applies whether 
Synthomer is acting directly in a country through employees, 
or indirectly through agents, distributors or other intermediaries. 
Synthomer requires any individual or entity acting on its behalf, 
whether as a consultant, representative, agent or distributor to 
know, understand and abide by the laws and regulations applicable 
in the country or countries in which they act for Synthomer. 
Details of this policy are included in the Synthomer Code of 
Conduct which is available on our website: www.synthomer.com
Application of policies
Our values are visible in all corporate communications and are 
prominently displayed at all Synthomer sites. Around the globe 
we have multiple ways in which we communicate our values in 
an engaging way and bring our values to life including induction 
processes, training interventions, communications and awards 
and recognition campaigns. 
All employees are required to complete online training in relation  
to our corporate responsibility policies and this certification is 
renewed annually. 
Before a vendor is on-boarded and approved for purchase  
and use, Synthomer employs multiple assessment processes.  
A periodic review of key suppliers is carried out to assess 
performance of the supplier against criteria covering technical 
support, commercial performance, reputation including REACH 
and local regulatory compliance. We also carry out periodic supply 
chain risk reviews and continually build and improve the raw 
materials and vendor on-boarding processes and procedures.
In 2016 we ran an initial awareness training and risk assessment 
session with our procurement teams from around the globe 
to assess the risk of modern slavery in our supply chains 
where we concluded that our business is not facing a high 
risk of these forms of exploitation. During 2017 we reviewed 
the effectiveness of our policies and supplier due diligence  
processes to reduce further the potential for modern slavery  
within our supply chain. 
In 2018 we will provide further awareness training from the lessons 
learned over the course of the last two years and re evaluate our 
risk assessment. Our procedures will be updated as a result of the 
outcome of this work.

Sustainability continued
Our approach
Our primary focus as an employer is to ensure that our employees 
work safely in a safe and secure environment. Synthomer has 
policies and procedures in place, which are constantly being 
improved, to enable this to happen.
In line with our SHE Policy, the Board, Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee are fully committed to improving SHE performance and 
engaging and involving employees at all levels in all locations in 
our SHE programmes. Effective SHE Leadership to deliver SHE 
performance is a primary duty and expectation of management 
at all levels in the Group, aligned to our three long term goals:
1. To have no accidents or incidents; 
2. To have no adverse impact on the health of those who work in, 
or live near our operations, nor on the health of those who use 
our products; and
3. To minimise any environmental burden created by our activities.
Synthomer is also committed to continually reviewing its activities 
and identifying how we can positively benefit our employees, the 
communities in which we operate, and in ensuring that alongside 
financial performance we identify and manage broader material 
sustainability issues. 
Key practices and programmes
SHE management practices and systems are embedded 
throughout the Group with the aim of continuously improving  
SHE performance.
Key measures, SHE performance indicators and SHE audit results 
are reported to the Board, the Executive Committee and to the 
regional management meetings on a monthly basis.
Embedding of the SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules launched 
in 2016 was a priority for 2017, with a focus on systems linked to 
permit to work and management of change, as well as refreshing 
of guidance on “line of fire”, circulated in local languages across all 
operating locations and supported by a short guidance video being 
incorporated into site inductions.

system improvements
A PTW and MOC improvement 
programme was implemented during 
2017 with the aim of ensuring that all  
sites’ PTW and MOC systems met Group 
standard expectations as a minimum.
To support the work, self-assessment 
questionnaires (SAQ) aligned with each part 
of the Group Standards, periodic monitoring 
check-lists, guidance documents or pocket 
cards were developed to support the sites 
in this journey and to establish a common 
ground. Site management teams were 
directly involved in the process with on-site 
support from the Group SHE team in 
reviewing the SAQs and site performance. 
High hazard activities in particular were 
targeted and 4-eyes validation of all such 
work is now required. Revised training 
packs were also developed for permit 
issuers that are being rolled out early 
in 2018.
New indicators were developed to track 
and analyse progress, with specific focus 
on live monitoring of permit controlled 
work and control of high hazard activities.
By the end of 2017 most of the indicators 
showed improving trends – however  
it was clear that there were still some 
fundamental failings being identified. 
Activities linked to PTW and MOC will 
continue to be prioritised during 2018  
with the focus on embedding and 
sustaining improved performance.
Safety, health and accident performance
Occupational Safety
The Group’s main lagging indicator of SHE injury performance  
is the recordable injury rate for accidents involving more than  
first aid treatment. During 2017 we saw a significant improvement 
with the number of recordable injuries halving from 18 down to 9, 
with a frequency rate of 0.13 per 100,000 hours worked, a 56% 
improvement on 2016.
The Group’s reportable lost time accident rate improved in 2017  
to give Synthomer its best ever performance, with six over-three-day 
lost time accidents during the year down from 11 the previous year, 
at frequency rate of 0.09 per 100,000 hours worked.
Our target ultimately is to have no accidents or injuries and whilst 
2017 performance is encouraging we will continue to reinforce our 
SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules work to achieve a sustained 
performance and interdependent safety culture. This is being 
supported by work such as the Line of Fire cards and video 
roll-out noted earlier.
There were no reported cases of disease attributed to occupational 
factors during the year.
Process Safety
Ensuring the safety of our operations is of paramount importance  
to the Group. Alongside our auditing and site support activities,  
from 2015 onwards, we have recorded, rated and tracked  
process safety events (PSE) using a 4 tier scoring system where  
tier 1 and 2 incidents (tier 1 being more severe) meet the definition  
for a “Reportable PSE” from the International Council of Chemical 
Association’s (ICCA). A Reportable PSE incident rate is now 
calculated that will allow for future benchmarking of performance 
against our peers.
Performance in this area during 2017 remained broadly flat against 
a wider definition of what we classed as a process safety event. 
There were 13 Reportable PSEs (equivalent to a rate of 0.19 per 
100,000 hours, a 13% increase on 2016). Thankfully none of the 
reported incidents resulted in serious injury. More information will 
be provided in our CSR Report.
The increase was partly linked to the wider definition and seven 
of the events occurred at sites acquired in 2016 and 2017. Those 
sites were adopting our more stringent standards and there is an 
increased focus on support for all acquired sites to ensure that  
their process safety management controls and layers of protection 
are robust.

Sustainability continued
Delivery of the programmes of work started in 2017 on PHA 
revalidation and further strengthening of management of change 
and permit to work systems will continue in 2018 with the goal  
of delivering significant improvement in this area.
Environmental performance
For 15 years we have been able to report ongoing reductions in 
each of our main environmental targets: global warming burden; 
energy and water consumption per tonne of production; and waste 
disposal from our sites.
Following the acquisition of 7 sites in 2016 from Hexion and 
the acquisition of a Belgian site from Perstorp, the Group’s  
baseline for target setting and approach to delivering Group  
level improvements is being revised to reflect the fact the Group  
has a far different energy and emissions profile to its previous  
core polymer technology focused structure.
Going forward the focus will be on Tier 1 operations (the 5-6 
that contribute around 75% of the Group total) and some Tier 2 
sites (the next 15-20%) implementing projects and efficiency 
improvement initiatives to meet Group targets. This will include 2% 
year on year reductions in specific energy consumption from 2018 
to 2020 as an initial step against a revised 2017 baseline.
Energy
Based on the sites which formed part of the Group during the year 
the total net specific energy consumption (SEC, i.e. energy use per 
tonne of production – with electricity converted to primary energy) 
rose 2.5%. Most of the increase relates to a rise of 3.5% GJ per 
tonne at our plant in the Czech Republic that produces monomers 
and accounts for 25% of the Group total energy consumption.
The new Belgian speciality additives site operates more energy 
intensive processes compared to our latex and dispersion 
processes so also contributed to this increase.
Absolute energy consumption (based on primary rather than 
metered electricity) was up 1.6% whilst Group production output 
dropped 0.9%. Most of the net increase in GJ used related to the 
Belgian site (excluding this the increase was 0.2%).
Lower output at some sites combined with switching to some 
product technologies that are more energy intensive (e.g. more 
steam stripping on some latex products) offset some significant 
improvements on sites where the full benefits of a number of energy 
projects were realised during 2017. This included installation of 
steam generators to replace old boilers at a plant in the UK during 
Q4 2016 that led to a more than 10% improvement in performance.

There is a pipeline of energy saving related projects now being 
progressed on the Tier 1 sites that are designed to help return 
to an improvement in performance in the coming years.
Water use
Total water consumption per tonne of production decreased 4.5% 
in 2017, with most of the improvement due to a reduction in “once 
through” cooling requirements on two German sites and reduced 
losses due to a replacement reactor in the Middle East.
Excluding river water (used for “once through” cooling and then returned 
to the river on a number of sites), water usage per tonne improved by 
2.4%, reflecting improved operating processes and investment on some 
sites. Variance is expected year to year since the majority of our products 
are water based dispersions with some changes down to product mix 
and volumes. As with energy, opportunities to improve water efficiency 
will be built in to sites’ manufacturing strategies and environmental 
targets on a prioritised basis.
Waste disposal
Overall there was a 24% increase in total waste generated by the 
group, 26% on a waste per tonne production basis. Most of this is 
related to a specific waste stream on the new site in Belgium, which 
will increase the baseline going forward. Excluding this there was 
4% increase per tonne. 600t of this relates to a one-off relocation of 
cinder waste from our plant in the Czech Republic to offsite landfill.
Looking ahead, with several major capital investment projects 
underway, one-off construction waste figures are expected to 
influence 2018 performance.
There was a 34% drop in the amount of hazardous waste sent 
to landfill on a per tonne basis. This was mainly due to 800t of 
hazardous waste being processed with other waste streams at an 
intermediate facility to produce non-hazardous waste. Ongoing 
projects to improve product quality and reduce process waste 
should lead to a reduction in overall waste going forward.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  53
Strategic report Sustainability continued
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group reports environmental KPIs in the format recommended 
by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 
with Annual Reports containing data for each year since 2005 on  
a three year rolling basis.
Reporting parameters
The 2017 financial year reporting includes all manufacturing 
operations, all office locations co-located with manufacturing  
and those listed as contact locations in the Annual Report or  
on the Company’s website. It does not include some very small 
locations such as home offices. These locations will have no 
material effect on the Group’s overall GHG emissions, being 
estimated at considerably less than 0.1% of the Group total.
All known emissions from manufacturing process have been 
included. Specifically this covers direct energy usage and the 
indirect energy costs of heating, cooling and other site services 
where these are provided by a third party. They include estimates 
for the effects of the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
and refrigerant gases. The only known emissions which have not 
been included are direct emissions of CO 2 from on-site waste 
treatment facilities that have not currently been quantified, but  
which are not believed to have significant material impact on  
the overall figures reported.
The Group has no known uses or releases of perfluorocarbons 
or sulphur hexafluoride. All releases of nitrous oxide or methane 
are associated with energy production and are not separately 
quantified. The Group continues to report scope 1 & 2 emissions. 
No estimate has been made of scope 3 emissions. The Group 
continues to use emissions per production tonne as its intensity 
ratio. The data sources for emissions factors (CO 2e) are those  
from DEFRA (dataset for 2016 reporting published in June 2017)  
and the IEA (International Energy Authority).
Calculation methods
All direct energy production from fossil fuels has been aggregated 
on a Group-wide basis and converted to CO 2e by using the 
appropriate DEFRA emissions factors. No allowance has been 
made for possible country to country variation in calorific value 
or CO 2 emission factors for primary fuels.
Electricity has been converted to CO 2e on a country by country 
basis. For 2015, factors provided by DEFRA for all operating 
countries were used. For 2016 and 2017, factors from DEFRA  
were used for UK grid electricity and for overseas grid electricity the 
factors used are those from the relevant IEA “World CO 2 Emissions 
from Fuel Combustion” databases.
In accordance with UK Government guidance, factors used for 2017 
reporting are based on 2015 validated data.
Several sites within the Group purchase certified “green” electricity. 
Electricity for these locations has been given a CO 2e emissions 
factor of 0.00 in calculating energy related emissions totals. These 
sites were Oss (Netherlands), Marl (Germany) and all sites  
in the UK.
Synthomer’s site in Stallingborough, UK takes most of its electricity 
from an exclusive contract with an adjacent waste incinerator 
operated by Newlincs. This electricity is certified as “Green” by the 
UK government. As a mixture of waste is deemed both renewable 
and non-renewable, it does not have a zero emission factor. For 
2017 the applied emission factor for electricity from Newlincs is 
based around that determined for the site’s Climate Change 
Agreement (CCA) reporting of around 0.50 kg CO 2e per kWh. Work 
is ongoing to validate the factors applied. The site is also provided 
with indirect heating in the form of hot water from Newlincs.
VOCs have been aggregated on a Group basis and converted to 
CO 2e using a factor of 11. This figure has been used by UK CIA 
member companies since 2005 and is at the upper end of the range 
for VOCs. Information on the release of refrigerant gases has been 
collected for the past 5 years. Releases of each individual gas have 
been aggregated each year to give a Group release total and then 
converted to CO 2e using the equivalence factors given by DEFRA 
for each gas. The emissions factors applicable to refrigerant release 
in 2017 are as per those in 2016 as no changes were reported by 
DEFRA–Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors from the IPCC 4th 
assessment report.
Performance in 2017
An increase in energy consumption and associated emissions from 
the plant in the Czech Republic that uses brown coal and accounts 
for 31% of Group emissions meant that overall emissions also rose 
in 2017 compared to 2016.
However, a reduction in reported VOC emissions, implementation of 
energy related projects and the purchase of “green” grid electricity 
for all UK sites meant the overall emissions increase at Group level 
was 1.1% tonnes CO 2 equivalent/tonne production against the 2.5% 
increase in GJ/tonne energy used.
Changes in the emissions factors in different countries have  
a significant impact over which the company has no control. For 
2017 reporting the emissions factors for the Czech Republic, Italy 
and Malaysia (countries whose sites all contribute >2% of overall 
emissions) all increased by more than 3%. Some benefit was gained 
in Germany where there was a 5% reduction in the factor applied.
Refrigerant losses in the larger Group were up 5% compared 
to 2016, mostly linked to equipment failures on one site where 
replacement equipment has now been purchased. However, owing 
to the refrigerants involved having less global warming potential,  
the CO 2 equivalent tonnage loss was 24% lower than 2016.
VOC emissions reduced by 10% in 2017 due mainly to better 
operation of the cryogenic VOC system in Harlow.

Notes
1. Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport of goods to and from site and the movement of these vehicles on site. Internal transport on site is included.
2. Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel. They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect emissions related 
to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc., with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity (these losses are in 
Scope 3, this report is for Scope 1 & 2). 
3. CO2 equivalent emissions include contributions from CH4 and N2O associated with combustion.
4. NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes. The CO2 equivalent Global Warming Potential contribution from these releases is already 
included in the CO2 from energy figure above.
5. The total CO2e figure is the total of the CO2 equivalent from energy + the VOC contribution (assuming an average factor of 11 kg CO2e per kg VOC) + the 
refrigerant contribution.
6. Percentage changes are calculated from the base data and may differ slightly from changes calculated from the data in the tables because of rounding.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  55
Strategic report Board well prepared for  
forthcoming governance changes
Letter from the Chairman
Neil Johnson
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report on our corporate governance compliance for 
2017 and give an update on the Board’s ongoing programme to 
improve its effectiveness. 
We were once again in full compliance with the applicable UK 
Corporate Governance Code (being the April 2016 version effective 
for the Company from 1 January 2017) throughout the year. 
The Board composition remained unchanged until the end of the 
year and therefore we maintained a balanced position between 
independent and non-independent directors throughout that period. 
Our 2017 AGM resolutions received overwhelming support and it 
was particularly pleasing to achieve greater than 99% in favour of 
the new remuneration policy which has subsequently been fully 
implemented by the Remuneration Committee. The Board 
supported the work of the Audit Committee during the year in 
the development of its remit in connection with the oversight of 
risk management processes and review of tax matters. 
In accordance with the commitment given in my 2016 letter, an 
externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its Committees was 
carried out in 2017 . The online surveys were completed by non-Board 
members who are regular attendees at Board and Audit Committee 
meetings as well as the Directors themselves, in order to gain a broad 
range of opinions on Board and Committees performance. The 
feedback report recognised the Board’s progress in promoting a 
culture of openness and mutual respect, developing good boardroom 
dynamics and increasing exposure to wider management. Areas 
identified for focus in 2018 include development of the Board’s 
oversight of employee management and provision of tailored training 
and workshops on aspects of the Group’s business and operations. 
In addition, an updated code of business conduct will be launched in 
2018 in order to promote the setting of the correct tone in which the 
Group’s business and its employees are required to operate. 
Other governance activity carried out by the Board and its 
Committees in 2017 included the review and approval of the Group’s 
Modern Slavery Act Statement and tax strategy. Reports were also 
received on gender pay gap data and the proposed reporting for 
external publication will be approved by the end of March 2018.
Jinya Chen retired as an independent non-executive director on 
31 December 2017 after 5 years’ service on the Board. The 
Nomination Committee has initiated a search for a replacement 
independent non-executive director in order to bring the Board 
composition back into balance. 
As we enter 2018, I believe the Board is well positioned to adapt to 
the changes in the corporate governance landscape envisaged by 
the new Code proposals and board guidance, currently under 
consultation and likely to be effective from 1 January 2019.
I do hope you find the information contained in the following pages 
of this report helpful and informative.
Neil Johnson
Chairman
1 March 2018 Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board considers that it has complied throughout the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017 with the provisions set out in 
the April 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”).*
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the board
The activities of the Company are controlled by the Board which, 
during 2017, comprised two executive directors and seven non-
executive directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are clearly divided between Neil Johnson who heads the Board in his 
capacity as non-executive Chairman and Calum MacLean who has 
responsibility for the running of the Company’s business as Chief 
Executive Officer. The non-executive directors all have wide business 
and boardroom experience gained in a broad range of business 
sectors, details of which are given on pages 58 and 59.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which 
includes setting long-term objectives for the Group and the 
strategies to be employed in achieving them. The Board has 
delegated to the Chief Executive Officer responsibility for the 
development and preparation of the business plan and the annual 
budget for recommendation to the Board. As the senior executive 
director, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for all aspects of 
day-to-day operational control of the Group and execution of the 
Group strategy. The Chief Executive Officer has established and 
chairs an Executive Committee (whose other members are the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Counsel and Company Secretary, and 
the operational vice presidents for the Group) to assist him in the 
performance of his duties and which meets once a month. The 
Chairman has available to him the minutes of the Executive 
Committee and all directors receive a monthly management report 
comprising business, financial and safety, health and environmental 
reviews from the Chief Financial Officer.
The Board has established Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and 
Disclosure Committees which are discussed on page 63.

supported by a written report and presentation by the Vice 
President for Operations.
Investing in Organic Growth
Material capital expenditure projects are subject to Board review and 
approval. During the year investment in capacity expansion projects 
were approved at sites in Finland, Italy and the USA. Progress on 
the major capacity expansion projects approved in 2016 at sites in 
Malaysia and Germany were monitored throughout the year.
Growth Through Acquisition
The acquisition of Speciality Additives and of BASF Pischelsdorf were 
subject to detailed review and approval. The post completion progress 
on integration and synergy achievement of the PAC (Dispersions)

During 2017 the Board held seven meetings with a full day 
dedicated to an annual strategy development review. The 
directors receive in advance full information on all matters to 
be discussed at Board meetings as well as a detailed review of 
performance. The non-executive directors met once without 
the Chairman to appraise his performance. The Board met once 
without the executive directors to appraise their performance.
In addition, arrangements are made each year for the Board 
to visit up to two of the Group’s operational sites and meet 
local management. Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for individual 
non-executive directors on request. During 2017 the Board 
held one of its meetings in Belgium and in conjunction with 
that Board meeting visited the Company’s newly acquired plant 
near Ghent where presentations were given by local senior 
management and a plant tour took place.

Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Senior Independent Director together with Chairs and members of 
the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Disclosure Committees 
are identified on pages 58 and 59. The Board considers that Caroline 
Johnstone, Just Jansz and Brendan Connolly are independent in 
accordance with the provisions of the Code. The Board considered 
that Jinya Chen was independent until the date of his retirement on 
31 December 2017. The Board composition remained unchanged 
until 31 December 2017 and therefore maintained a balanced 
position between independent and non independent directors 
throughout 2017. As there has been an imbalance between the 
number of independent and non-independent directors since 
1 January 2018 the Nomination Committee has initiated a search 
for a replacement independent non-executive director in order to 
bring the Board composition back into balance. 
Non-executive directors are appointed for one-year terms. 
All directors submit themselves for annual election at each 
Annual General Meeting.

Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure new 
directors receive a full formal and tailored induction on appointment. 
The Chairman reviews and agrees the training and development 
needs of the directors and the skills and knowledge of the Board 
as a whole are updated by briefings provided by the Company’s 
internal resources and materials, workshops and seminars offered 
by external advisers. During 2017 briefings were delivered to the 
Board on developments in corporate governance reporting 
and governance and best practice in remuneration. The Audit 
Committee was provided with updates and workshop training 
provided by PwC LLP. As no directors were appointed during 
the year no induction training was required to be given. 
Performance evaluation
In 2017, Lintstock were engaged to undertake an evaluation of 
the performance of the Board of Directors. Lintstock is an advisory 
firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no 
other connection with the Company.
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with 
the Chairman, the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
and Company Secretary to set the context for the evaluation, and to 
tailor survey content to the specific circumstances of the Company. 
All Board members were then requested to complete online surveys 
addressing the performance of the Board, its Committees, and the 
Chairman. Non-Board members of the Executive Committee, as 
regular attendees at Board meetings, were also invited to complete 
the online survey relating to the Board. Members of the Group 
Finance Department who attended Audit Committee meetings during 
the course of 2017 were invited to complete the online survey relating 
to that Committee. The surveys were distributed following the Board 
and Annual Strategy review meetings held in November 2017. The 
anonymity of the respondents was ensured throughout the process 
in order to promote an open and frank exchange of views.
62  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following 
areas of Board performance:
• The appropriateness of the Board’s composition was assessed, 
and respondents were asked to identify any changes that ought 
to be made to the profile of the Board.
• The Board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders and 
the markets in which the Company operates was considered, 
and the Board’s oversight of relevant technological 
developments, and the culture and behaviours throughout the 
Company, was reviewed.
• The relationships between Board members and management, 
and the atmosphere in and management of meetings, were 
assessed, as was the quality of the Board packs and 
management presentations.
• The effectiveness of the Board in reviewing the Group's 
current performance, and influencing future performance, 
was considered, and respondents were asked to identify 
areas upon which they feel the Board should spend more or 
less time focusing over the coming year.
• The Board’s oversight of strategy and progress against each of 
the Company’s strategic priorities was considered, as was the 
flow of information to the Board around potential acquisition 
opportunities, and the integration of acquired businesses. 
Respondents’ views as to the top strategic issues facing the 
Company were also identified.
• The Board’s focus on risk was assessed, as was the adequacy 
of succession plans for members of top management. 
Respondents were asked to consider the top Human 
Resources priorities facing the Group over the coming years.
The performance of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees of the Board was also reviewed in separate reports. The 
report on the performance of the Chairman was provided to the Senior 
Independent Director who discussed it with the Chairman and the 
report on individual Board members was provided to the Chairman.
The Lintstock reports on the Board and its Committees were 
distributed to Board members in early January 2018 and were 
discussed and considered in detail at the Board meeting held 
later that month. A representative of Lintstock attended that Board 
meeting in order to assist with the Board’s consideration of the 
reports. The findings of the evaluation are reviewed in the letter 
from the Chairman on page 56.
Board Committees
The Board has formally established Audit, Nomination, 
Remuneration and Disclosure Committees, each with their own 
terms of reference which set out their respective roles and the 
authority delegated to them by the Board. Copies of the terms of 
reference are available upon request from the Company Secretary 
and can also be downloaded from the Company’s website. All 
non-executive directors have a standing invitation to attend 
Committee meetings unless they are notified otherwise.
The Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committee reports 
are set out at the end of this Corporate Governance report.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular basis by 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and meetings 
take place following the announcement of half and full year results and 
at other times according to circumstances. In addition to half and full 
year reporting, the Board has decided to continue with the practice 
of providing interim management statements notwithstanding that it is 
no longer a regulatory requirement to do so. 
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication 
principles in order to ensure that Board members develop an 
understanding of the views of the Group’s major shareholders. 
These principles require the Chairman to be present with the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer at sufficient 
shareholder presentations and meetings that he fully understands 
the issues and concerns of major shareholders. Alternatively, the 
Chairman is also available for meetings with major shareholders at 
their request.
The Chief Executive Officer reports on shareholder relations at 
each Board meeting. Communications with shareholders relating 
to corporate governance matters are conducted by the Chairman 
with the assistance of the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. Reports on all meetings between non-executive 
directors and institutional shareholders and their representative 
bodies are given to the Board at the first opportunity following 
such meetings, as is all correspondence with them.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they 
have concerns and where contact through the normal channels of 
the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve or 
for which such contact is inappropriate.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all shareholders, 
and in particular private investors, at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting and endeavours to ensure all Board members are in 
attendance. In particular, the Chairs of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its website www.synthomer.com to 
communicate with its shareholders and also publishes half and full 
year results, Company announcements, share price and corporate 
governance and other investor information there.
Information on the Company’s major shareholdings and share 
capital is included in the Report of the Directors on pages 85 to 87.
Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements, their report that the business is a going 
concern, a viability statement, a responsibility statement and their 
statement as to disclosure of information to the auditor are set out 
on pages 86 to 88 respectively. Statements by the auditor about its 
reporting responsibilities are set out on pages 89 to 94. 
A report on the approach to internal control is set out below. 
The directors endeavour to make the Annual Report and financial 
statements as informative and understandable as possible.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  63
Governance Corporate governance continued
Risk management and internal control 
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
systems of risk management and internal control and for reviewing 
their effectiveness and sets appropriate policies to ensure that the 
Code requirements are met. The systems of risk management and 
internal control deployed within the Group are designed to reduce 
the risks of failure to meet business objectives, but these risks 
cannot be eliminated. The risk management and internal control 
systems adopted can therefore only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance about meeting such business objectives or 
against material misstatement or loss. The Group risk management 
framework is set out on pages 32 to 37. Risks associated with 
safety, health and the environment are, by the nature of the Group’s 
business, always of the utmost concern and the Sustainability 
report on pages 44 to 55 reviews the Group’s performance in this 
regard in 2017. The Board confirms that a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group has been carried out and that it 
has monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems in 2017.
The Group’s internal controls over the financial reporting and 
consolidation processes are designed under the supervision of the 
Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair 
presentation of the Group’s published financial statements for 
external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.
The processes which are used by the Board either directly or, 
where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review the 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems 
in relation to the financial reporting process and the process for 
preparing consolidated accounts include the following:
• a review of the external and internal audit work plans;
• consideration of reports from management and external parties, 
including the internal and external auditors, on the system of 
internal financial control and any material control weaknesses;
• discussion with management of the actions taken on any 
possible problem areas for the business that are identified.
In addition, the Board:
• receives copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee meetings;
• receives regular written and oral reports from management 
on all aspects of production, operations, financial and risk 
management matters.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental (together with 
health and safety) protection is central to the Group’s business. 
A separate statement on safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
matters has been a feature of the Annual Report for a number 
of years. The Sustainability report on pages 44 to 55 includes 
a report on the initiatives the Group has adopted regarding 
sustainable development.
Social, community and human rights matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as part of 
its review of internal control which, by virtue of its approach to risk 
identification, covers areas which encompass social and ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities 
in which the Group’s businesses operate and encourages 
local engagement by management which includes supporting 
environmental, health and education initiatives. 
The Board is also aware of the reputational and legal risks 
associated with social and ethical issues and has a Group-wide 
code of business conduct on corruption and anti-competitive 
activities, which is available on the Company’s website and upon 
request from the Company Secretary. The purpose of this code is 
to ensure that the Group’s employees have a clear understanding 
of the principles that are important in these areas when conducting 
the Group’s business. The application of the code is explained to 
senior management at regular intervals and they are charged with 
its communication throughout their businesses supported by 
internal and external training. A compliance procedure involving 
annual certification by senior management and a procedure for 
maintaining a register of, and where appropriate gaining prior 
approval for, gifts, entertainment and corporate hospitality operates 
throughout the Group. A report is made to the Audit Committee 
annually on the code and the Company’s whistleblowing procedure.
The Group’s operating activities are highly regulated in all territories 
and largely carried out in countries that have established legislation 
on human rights issues. As such, information on human rights issues 
is not considered to be necessary for an understanding of the 
development, performance or position of the Group’s business. 
The Group has nonetheless adopted a policy on equal opportunities, 
diversity and human rights which is available at www.synthomer.com.
The Company is a member of the FTSE4Good Index.
Further details of the Group's social and community activities can 
be found on pages 48 and 49. 
64  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Dear Shareholder
In another year of progress for Synthomer, the Audit 
Committee has continued to develop its programme of 
work in 2017. Alongside our formal meetings, members of 
the committee visited our new facility in Ghent with the rest 
of the Board and we also separately visited the Langelsheim 
plant to meet with managers and staff there and hear about 
the plant’s approach to risk management. 
Our core remit is assessing the integrity of the Group financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management systems 
and overseeing the work of the external and internal audit 
functions. The Committee has also continued to focus 
on our oversight of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management processes and the development of our finance, 
internal audit and other functions which are important in an 
organisation with a growth strategy. The terms of reference 
of the committee have been expanded to include the review 
of taxation matters to support the Board in monitoring the 
Company’s approach to transfer pricing and the Base Erosion 
and Profit Shifting legislation. 
During 2017, as part of the Committee’s oversight of the 
risk management processes, senior management from 
Procurement, IT and R&D met with us to present how 
they embed the Group’s risk management approach and 
mitigating controls across all aspects of their function. 
We asked for regular updates to the Board on particular 
aspects from the developing procurement function and the 
review of our business information processes and systems. 
The recently appointed Group Head of Tax presented the 
Group’s proposed tax strategy to the Committee, which, 
after discussion, we approved ahead of publication on the 
Company’s website. We revisited the Group’s risk appetite 
statement during the year resulting in a formal discussion at 
the Board’s strategy day in November 2017. This will continue 
to form part of the Committee and Board discussions in 2018.
Audit Committee
The Committee has been pleased to support the Chief 
Financial Officer as he has continued to strengthen finance, 
IT and tax teams across the group with a small number of 
senior appointments during the year bringing additional and 
relevant talent and experience into the organisation. 
The Group’s 2016 Annual Report was included in the Financial 
Reporting Council’s thematic review of Alternative Performance 
Measures (“APMs”). Executive management and the 
Committee reviewed all aspects of how we report APMs, 
discussed our approach with the external auditor and, where 
appropriate, made some changes to enhance our presentation 
of our reported performance measures. The FRC’s review 
concluded that there were no issues to raise regarding the 
Group’s approach to Alternative Performance Measures.* 
In 2018, alongside our core remit, the Committee will continue 
to focus on the Group’s internal control and risk management 
processes as well as reviewing recent acquisitions and 
capital investments. We will also oversee the development 
of underlying business information systems – and to look at 
risk assurance mapping. 
We set out further details of our work in the following pages.
I am happy to answer any questions the shareholders may 
have at any time and look forward to meeting those who 
attend the AGM.

In addition, outside of the formal meetings, Caroline Johnstone had 
regular dialogue with the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, 
other senior members of the head office finance team and PwC 
to develop the Committee's programme of work as well as review 
progress in addressing actions agreed by the Committee. 
As set out in the Chair’s introductory comments, members of 
the Committee visited both the Ghent and Langelsheim sites 
during the year as part of an ongoing programme of engagement 
with the business.
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee

66  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Addressing our remit
Systems of risk management  
and internal controls effectiveness 
Each year, the Board is required to conduct a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk management and 
internal control. The Board’s statement about this review is set 
out on page 64. At its meeting in February 2018, the Committee 
reviewed management’s assessment of the key elements of these 
systems and confirmed their overall effectiveness. In forming its 
conclusion, the Committee reflected on matters such as:
• The internal audit programme completed during 2017 and 
the progress in implementing actions arising therefrom. 
• The risk management processes rolled out across the Group 
in 2016 and 2017 and implemented in new acquisitions as 
soon as practical.
• Our own programme of risk reviews and discussions with 
senior managers across the Group throughout the year.
• Assurance (Committee papers, Board and Committee 
presentations and discussions) that management continued 
to review the Group’s key financial controls to ensure that they 
supported the Group’s continued growth.
• The key controls questionnaire developed in 2017, which is 
completed and signed by each operating unit across the Group 
on a quarterly basis.
• Half yearly representations from financial and commercial 
management in the business to the Chief Financial Officer.
Whistle-blowing
At each Committee meeting during the year, the Committee was 
provided details of the issues reported during the period and how 
management had investigated them, together with any update on 
ongoing investigations. No material issues were reported during 
the year.
2017 Annual report and accounts
Fair, balanced and understandable
The work undertaken by management and the Committee to 
support the Board’s statement included:
• establishing a working group of key individuals, who are 
appropriately qualified, within the Group to oversee the drafting 
of the Annual Report;
• the CEO and CFO confirming that, in their opinion, the drafting 
of the Annual Report was ‘fair, balanced and understandable’;
• where appropriate, requesting that certain key contributors to 
sections of the Annual Report (for example, Vice Presidents and 
Finance Directors of business units) sign a declaration confirming 
the accuracy of the information provided;
• arranging for Deloitte LLP , the Company’s remuneration consultants, 
to review the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• requesting that an audit trail was completed by the Director of 
Group Finance for material data underpinning non financial 
information in the Annual Report;
• circulating drafts of the Annual Report to PwC, the Committee 
and the Board for review; and
• discussing material disclosure items at a meeting of the 
Committee held in February 2018.
The Committee discussed the ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ 
statement at its meeting in February 2018 in the light of the above 
and, having done so, recommended that the Board provide it in the 
form set out on page 88.
Going concern
The principal aspects of the review process conducted by the 
Committee and management to support the Board’s statement were:
• Reviewing the Group’s available sources of funding and, in 
particular, testing the covenants and assessing the available 
headroom using a range of assumptions.
• Reviewing the short, medium and long-term cash flow forecasts 
in various material downside scenarios.
• Assessing the level of available facilities, which are considered 
necessary to support the Group’s ability to trade and deliver 
future growth.
• Assessing the Group’s current and forecast activities, including any 
long-term contracts and order books, and those factors considered 
likely to affect its future performance and financial position.
The Committee discussed the going concern statement at its 
meeting in February 2018 and, having done so, recommended 
that the Board provide it in the form set out on page 87.
Viability statement
The Board has chosen to consider the prospects of the Group over 
a five year period ending 31 December 2022, consistent with the 
five year Strategic Plan of the Group, as they consider it to be a 
period over which the Group actively focuses on its long term 
product development and capital expenditure investments.
The Committee’s robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group included a review of the potential impact of severe but 
plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the Group 
and the potential mitigations that management believes would be 
available. These scenarios included trading volatility, increased 
competition, delays in capacity improvement, failure of new 
products and the temporary loss of a manufacturing site. They 
also included significant foreign currency exchange rate and interest 
rate movements, which are deemed to be outside the control of 
the Group. The Committee discussed the viability statement at its 
meeting in February 2018 and, having done so, recommended that 
the Board provide it in the form set out on page 37.

The chair of the Committee was in discussion regularly with PwC’s 
lead audit partner to discuss the progress of the audit. Ahead of 
and following the conclusion of the February 2018 meeting, the 
Committee met PwC without management being present: no 
significant issues, other than those discussed at the Committee 
meeting, were raised.
Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements, 
the Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and considers particular areas where management 
has had to exercise judgement or make estimates. The main areas 
which we reviewed in the year ended 31 December 2017, together 
with a summary of our work, are set out below:
• Provisions for uncertain taxation positions:
Significant judgement is exercised by management, with advice 
from appropriate tax advisors, to arrive at the amounts provided 
for tax given that the final tax outcome of several transactions is 
uncertain and may not be known for several years. As part of 
their audit, the external auditor reviewed the judgements that had 
been made, using tax specialists as appropriate, and provided 
the Committee with an assessment of the appropriateness of 
management judgements. The Group Head of Tax presented to 
the Committee on the rationale and judgement on each of the 
provisions held by the Group and the Committee considered 
whether these provisions were appropriate and in line with the 
Group tax strategy and took the external auditor’s conclusions 
into consideration. The Committee concurred with 
management’s views and in addition reviewed the adequacy 
of the tax disclosures in the financial statements.
• Defined benefit pension accounting:
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which 
have significant liabilities as outlined in note 26 to the Group 
financial statements. Although the UK schemes are closed to 
future accrual, they are sensitive to changes in actuarial 
assumptions. The Group uses appropriately qualified external 
actuarial advisers to help establish the actuarial assumptions 
used in the valuation of the Group’s pension assets and liabilities. 
During their audit, the external auditor evaluated the assumptions 
and methodologies used by the Group’s actuarial advisers and 
management and assessed whether the assumptions made 
were appropriate and not materially different from external 
benchmarks for similar types of schemes. The external auditors 
reported to us that they were satisfied with the assumptions 
used and with the way that the schemes had been accounted 
for. The Committee reviewed the assumptions and methodology 
used by the management and concurred with their conclusions.
• Purchase of business:
The accounting for the acquisition of the Speciality Additives 
business is shown in the note 31 to the accounts. For the 
acquisition, the assets and liabilities have been included at fair 
value with the balance of consideration shown as goodwill. 
KPMG LLP were engaged to advise on the fair value of the 
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE). Overall their conclusion 
was that the total fair value of the PPE was higher than the 
carrying value mainly in relation to Land and Buildings. KPMG 
LLP also performed a valuation of the intangibles, of which the 
only one of significant value was the customer relationships. The 
external auditors reviewed the work undertaken by KPMG LLP. 
The Committee reviewed the methodology used by KPMG LLP 
along with their conclusions and discussed them with the 
external auditor. The Committee concurred with management’s 
view on the fair value of the acquired business.
Internal audit
The Group Operational Review Manager (who leads the Internal 
Audit function) was appointed in 2016. We now have a dedicated 
and focused in-house internal audit function, which draws on 
specialist resources as required. At each meeting, the Committee 
reviewed progress against the internal audit annual plan and 
explored areas identified for action.
To assess the effectiveness of Internal Audit, the Committee 
reflected on:
• Internal Audit reports during the year.
• Feedback from operational and finance functions on the quality 
of the Internal Audit reports and activities.
• Compliance with appropriate Internal Audit  
professional standards.
• Implementation of Internal Audit recommendations.
There was positive feedback regarding the constructive and 
challenging approach of Internal Audit as well as the development 
of new internal audit reporting, with clear summaries and 
recommendations. In the coming year, the function will focus 
on agreeing the scope of each audit and continuing to ensure 
implementation of recommendations on a timely basis. On the 
basis of our review, the Committee concluded that the function 
was operating effectively although we continue to review the 
resources required for the developing Group.
The internal audit plan for 2018 was reviewed at our meeting in 
November 2017 and includes auditing areas which account for more 
than 75% of operating profit as well as certain key central functions 
such as the financial consolidation process. Specialists will be 
included in a number of audits such as IT security.
Audit Committee continued
68  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Role
The Committee’s remit includes responsibility for: 
• the regular review of the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) 
of the Board and the making of recommendations with 
regard to any changes; 
• leading the process for Board appointments and 
nominating candidates for non-executive positions; and 
• considering succession planning for directors and senior 
executives and reviewing the succession plans put forward 
for ensuring the executive leadership needs of the Company 
are met.
Activities in 2017
The Nomination Committee held one formal meeting during 2017 .
The Committee reviewed senior management succession 
planning within the Group during the course of the year. 
Following Mr Jinya Chen’s retirement from the Board at the 
end of 2017 the Committee has initiated a search for a 
replacement independent non-executive director. There were 
no appointments to the Board during the year and accordingly 
the Committee was not involved in any recruitment activity and 
did not appoint or work with any advisers. 
Diversity
The Board adopted its current policy on diversity in 2014 in 
recognition of the importance of diversity in strengthening decision 
making and competitiveness. This policy seeks to ensure that 
diversity in its broadest sense is taken into account in the process of 
making appointments on merit against objective selection criteria. 
Gender and ethnicity are acknowledged as significant elements 
of diversity and the Committee is mindful of the recommendations 
of the Hampton-Alexander, Parker and McGregor-Smith Reviews 
but has not recommended to the Board the setting of quotas for 
female or other representation at this time. 
As there were no changes to the composition of the Board during 
2017 , the Committee did not actively seek to implement the 
diversity policy and accordingly has not reported on its results.
A copy of the diversity policy is available at www.synthomer.com. 
Further details on the Company’s approach to, and reporting on, 
diversity are contained within the Strategic report.

Nomination Committee
External audit
Auditor objectivity and independence and  
non-audit services provided by the auditor 
With effect from 1 January 2017, the Committee adopted a new 
policy on the provision of non–audit services by the external auditor. 
We have defined the very limited non audit services which can 
be provided by the external auditors. Services can only be provided 
if approved by the Committee and subject to a cap of 70% of the 
average of audit fees for the preceding three years – with discretion 
to exceed this until January 2020. The policy is in compliance with 
the FRC Ethical Standard for Auditors issued in August 2016 and a 
full copy of the policy on the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor is available on the Company website. 
Details of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor in 2017 are set 
out in note 8 on page 111. Non-audit fees principally relate to the 
interim review at the half year and providing factual understanding 
about work performed for the Group prior to 1 January 2017 in relation 
to an overseas tax investigation. The Committee concluded that 
PwC’s independence and objectivity was not compromised by it 
providing these services and that, as a result of its knowledge of the 
Group and its financial statements, it was in the Group’s interests to 
engage PwC to do so.
As part of the 2017 audit, PwC confirmed that it was independent 
within the meaning of applicable regulatory and professional 
requirements. Taking this into account and having considered the 
steps taken by PwC to preserve its independence, the Committee 
concluded that PwC continues to demonstrate appropriate 
independence and objectivity.
Effectiveness of the external audit
During the year the Committee evaluated the performance and 
effectiveness of the external auditors. Feedback was obtained from 
people across the business who were involved with the external 
audit and the Committee reflected on the effectiveness of the 
external audit partner and team members, both in Committee 
meetings and in discussions with the chair. A review of performance 
against an evaluation checklist was also conducted by the Audit 
Committee Chair and the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee 
assessed the robustness of the audit, the quality of delivery of the 
audit against the agreed plan and the competence with which the 
auditors handled key accounting estimates and judgements. Having 
considered all of these factors the Committee concluded that the 
external auditors were effective.
Re-appointment of the auditor
PwC was re-appointed external auditor in 2016, following a full 
retender process, having been the Group’s auditors since 2012. 
Having assessed the effectiveness of the external audit referred to 
above and the independence of PwC, the Committee recommends 
the re-appointment of PwC at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
Committee performance evaluation and future focus
We addressed the areas of development for 2017 as planned and 
reviewed the risk appetite as part of a wider programme of risk 
reviews. In 2017, we decided to undertake an evaluation of the 
Committee’s performance using an external questionnaire process. 
The feedback was positive about our progress in overseeing and 
challenging the systems of risk management and supportive of 
continuing to develop this in 2018.

Governance Dear Shareholder
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for 
their support for our new remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM 
where we were pleased to receive greater than 99% support. 
I also take this opportunity to thank the Committee and 
Board members, our advisors and the wider remuneration 
community for their input, discussion and debate. 
Our Policy
The Policy was approved at the 2017 AGM and implemented 
across all elements of remuneration in the year. The Policy, 
details of which are summarised in the subsequent pages of 
this report, will remain in force until the 2020 AGM unless new 
regulation or guidance requires us to review or change the 
policy at an earlier date.
Remuneration outcomes in 2017
• Base salaries: In 2018 both the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer remain on 2016 salary levels 
as per the policy. This will be the second year that no 
increase has been given, and at the end of 2018 they 
will have been on the same salary for three years. The 
Committee has the option to increase salaries for 2019 
as per the policy.

• Bonus plan: The 3 parts of the bonus plan were met in full. 
 - Financial – 80%: The +10% above budget Adjusted 
Underlying PBT target was exceeded with Adjusted 
Underlying PBT of £121.5m being delivered (with 
adjustments relating to M&A activity in the year and 
the impact of currency). The Board challenged 
management to offset the softening Asian Nitrile latex 
market during the budget process and in 2017 they 
have managed to fill the gap through a number of 
market focused initiatives. Overall performance 
was above budget expectations. More detail on 
performance is available in the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chairman reports, the segmental reviews and 
the Chief Financial Officer's review.
 - Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) – 10%: The 
two targets were exceeded, which represents an 
excellent outcome in the journey towards ‘best in class’ 
performance. The Recordable Injury Rate (RIR) target 
of 0.25 or less and the Process Safety Event rate 
(PSER) of 0.2 or less were set to challenge the 
organisation through the integration of the PAC 
(Dispersions) acquisition whilst keeping the legacy 
organisation on an improvement path. The results of 
0.13 (RIR) and 0.19 (PSER) demonstrate the efforts 
made during the year. 
 - Personal strategic goals – 10%: Both the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer are deemed to have 
fully achieved their personal strategic goals. For both the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the 
improvement and development of the risk management 
process was a focus. This has improved substantially 
with more frequent risk reviews, a wider risk process 
and more Board involvement. Furthermore, for the 
Chief Executive Officer, the other goals of improved 
information flow to investors, which was based on 
feedback has been positively received and, ensuring 
major capital projects are delivered to plan were 
considered to have been fully met during the year. It is 
too early to determine if the promised returns from these 
projects will be delivered and for that reason we will be 
adding this objective into the 2018 LTIP as part of the 
strategic measures. For the Chief Financial Officer , the 
pension review was timely, strategic and well received, 
and the Chief Financial Officer's involvement in the full 
M&A process was evident and impactful.
Remuneration Committee
Directors’ Remuneration report
70  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 • LTIP: EPS and TSR performance resulted in maximum 
(80%) vesting of that part of the 2011 performance share 
plan awards made in 2015 relating to these performance 
conditions. The three part strategic measures condition 
was partially met (see details on page 80 of the following 
report) resulting in 96.3% of the 2015 award vesting in 
aggregate. As a result of the 2017 outcomes, together with 
the vesting in May 2018 of the “buyout” award of 100,000 
shares granted to the Chief Financial Officer in 2015, the 
Chief Executive Officer will exceed and Chief Financial 
Officer will substantially meet the shareholding guidelines 
requirements to hold shares equal in value to at least 
200% and 150% of salary respectively (based on the 
share price at the end of 2017) during the course of 2018. 
• Chairman’s fee: We reviewed the Chairman’s fees at the 
end of 2017 and concluded that no increase was required 
at this time.
Committee evaluation 
An evaluation of the performance of the Committee was 
undertaken in 2017 by Lintstock and formed part of the wider 
evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors. 
Further details of this process are given in the Governance 
section on page 56. 
Other activities in the year
The Committee reviewed gender pay gap data and will 
approve the proposed reporting for external publication in 
the first quarter of 2018. CEO/average employee pay ratio 
data was discussed and reviewed and will form part of our 
reporting remit from 2019 onwards.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference were reviewed 
and the annual schedule of business will be adjusted to 
accommodate consideration of forthcoming changes to 
the governance and legislative remuneration landscape.
Alignment to Group strategy
We continue to strengthen the link and alignment between 
the remuneration structure and the Group strategy of 
innovation, excellence and growth. 
Innovation; through R&D and process engineering delivering 
new and improved products in the medium and long term, to 
successfully compete in the speciality chemical sector which 
is reflected in the LTIP where the management and all the 
LTIP participants are challenged to deliver a percentage of 
revenue from new products over a five year period.
Excellence; safety, health and environmental performance 
are critical for risk management and being able to deliver 
a safe and environmentally controlled workplace, avoiding 
potential physical and reputational damage. Measures for 
both personal and process safety are captured in the bonus 
plans of the CEO and CFO and the wider organisation. 
Excellence also includes operational processes, efficiency, 
cost management, utilisation, product quality and an array of 
other measures which are all captured through objectives for 
the key operational executives and those directly involved in 
managing the plants.
Growth; organic year on year growth, M&A and internal 
capital investment remain important strategic initiatives 
to drive financial growth, increased capacity and a wider 
specialty product base to achieve increased market share. 
The bonus plan and the LTIP through PBT, EPS, TSR and 
specific expansion objectives are aligned and weighted 
heavily towards driving a healthy growth. 
Remuneration Report
The Directors Remuneration report will not require a binding 
vote for the policy at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
however the Annual Report on Remuneration, will, as in 
previous years, be subject to an advisory vote.

Directors’ Remuneration – Policy principles
The key principles for executive directors’ remuneration at Synthomer are as follows:
• Sufficient to attract and retain executive directors of the ability and expertise necessary to achieve the strategic goals of the Company.
• Incentivise executive directors by rewarding performance and driving the right behaviours.
• Align executive director reward with the experience of shareholders. 
In setting executive directors’ remuneration, the Committee takes account of pay and conditions throughout the Company. The Committee 
also considers corporate governance requirements and best practice in terms of remuneration structures and the process of setting 
executive remuneration. 
The Committee reviews performance targets regularly to ensure that they do not encourage or motivate inappropriate risk taking. 
Furthermore, the Committee, when necessary, will take into account any environmental, social and governance (ESG) events and the 
Audit Committee’s reviews of the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management when assessing performance.
The following diagram provides an overview of the key elements of reward for executive directors and the performance measures used.

Directors’ Remuneration – Policy Summary
Set out in the table below is a summary of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (“the Policy”) as it applies to executive directors. 
The Policy was put forward, and received shareholder approval, at the Company’s 2017 AGM in accordance with section 439A  
of the Companies Act 2006. The Policy has been effective from 27 April 2017 and is available in full at www.synthomer.com.
72  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Future Policy Table
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary Supports the 
recruitment and retention 
of executive directors.
Reflects the individual’s 
skills, experience, 
performance and role 
within the Company.
Salary levels are generally 
reviewed annually by the 
Committee.
When reviewing salary 
levels the Committee 
takes into account:
• the individual’s skills, 
experience and 
performance; 
• the size and scope of the 
individual’s responsibilities; 
• pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Group;
• pay at companies of 
similar size; and
• the complexity and 
international scope of 
the Group.
There is no overall maximum 
for salary opportunity or 
increases. Salary increases 
will normally be in-line with the 
increases awarded to other 
employees within the Group. 
Larger increases may 
be made under certain 
circumstances, including, 
but not limited to:
• an increase in the scope 
and/or responsibility of 
the individual’s role; 
• the development of the 
individual within the role;
• alignment to market levels; 
and
• corporate events such as a 
significant acquisition or 
Group restructuring which 
impacts the scope of 
the role.
For 2018, executive director 
salaries remain at the 2016 level:
• C G MacLean: £535,500
• S G Bennett: £334,560 
and will be frozen at this level 
until at least the end of 2018.
None, although individual and 
Company performance are 
factors taken into account when 
considering salary increases.
Benefits Provided to support the 
retention and recruitment 
of executive directors.
Benefits to executive directors 
may include private health 
insurance, life insurance and 
a fully expensed car or car 
allowance. From time to time 
the Committee may review 
the benefits provided. The 
Committee may remove 
benefits that executive 
directors receive or introduce 
other benefits if it considers 
it is appropriate to do so. 
Any other benefits will be 
proportionate with the 
current benefits provided.
Where executive directors 
are required to relocate or 
complete an international 
assignment, the Committee 
may offer additional benefits 
or vary benefits according 
to local practice.

Operation of the executive director Remuneration Policy for 2018
The current Policy has been in force since 27 April 2017. The specific remuneration arrangements for 2018 are described below
Base salary There were no salary increases awarded for 2018. This will be the second year that no increase has been given and 
accordingly salaries remain at 2016 levels as follows: 
• C G MacLean: £535,500.
• S G Bennett: £334,560.
Pension and 
benefits
No changes. Executives receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions, a fully expensed car or car 
allowance and private health insurance. 
2018 cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions:
• C G MacLean: 25% of salary
• S G Bennett: 20% of salary
Annual bonus For 2018, performance under the annual bonus will be measured on the following basis:
• 80% subject to performance against Underlying profit before tax targets.
• 10% subject to performance measures against key health and safety targets.
• 10% subject to performance against individual strategic and operational goals.
• Targets and objectives for 2018 are, by their financial and commercial nature, considered by the Board to 
be unsuitable for disclosure in advance. However, the Committee will provide information on targets and 
objectives retrospectively.
2018 maximum award opportunity:
• C G MacLean: 125% of salary
• S G Bennett: 115% of salary
Performance 
share plan
For awards made in 2018, performance will be measured on the same basis as for awards made in 2017 other than 
in relation to the business strategy target as follows:
• 40% based on relative TSR performance versus FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts and financial services companies):
 - 25% of this element will vest for median performance.
 - 100% vesting for upper quartile performance.
 - Vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
• 40% based on underlying EPS growth:
 - 25% of this element will vest for EPS growth of 4.5% per annum.
 - 100% vesting for EPS growth of 10% per annum. 
 - Vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
 - This target range was set following consideration of the long-term strategy and the outlook for the markets in 
which we operate.
• 20% based on performance against three equally weighted measures directly linked to the delivery of the 
business strategy:
 - Proportion of sales volumes (excluding monomers and speciality additive products) from new products together 
with products covered by patents and patent applications derived from new products launched in the five years 
to the end of the performance period – incentivising greater innovation through new product development.
 - Cumulative Underlying profit before tax growth in respect of acquisitions in line with the strategic plan as 
approved by the Board – incentivising the delivery of profitable growth. 
 - ROIC generated from the most significant growth projects being commissioned in 2018 measured in the third 
year of the performance period – incentivising the delivery of profitable organic growth. 
 - For each of these measures, 25% will vest for threshold performance.
 - The targets for these measures, and the level of performance achieved, will be disclosed following the end of 
the performance period.
2018 maximum award opportunity:
• C G MacLean: 150% of salary 
• S G Bennett: 120% of salary
Shareholding 
guidelines
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are required to build interests in shares of at least 200%

* Non-beneficial interest.
1. Unvested performance related options comprise the awards made under the 2011 PSP in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Details of the performance conditions attaching to the 
2017 awards are set out on page 81. As disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report, in addition to his performance related award S G Bennett was granted a ‘buyout’ award 
of 100,000 shares in 2015 which will vest subject to continued employment until 1 May 2018. 
2. Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of 
share awards under such plans. The Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such 
that they should count (on a net of tax basis) toward compliance with the share ownership guidelines. As a result of the 2017 remuneration outcomes together with 
the vesting of his 'buyout' award S G Bennett will substantially meet his share ownership requirement during 2018 based on the share price at the end of 2017.
The performance conditions attaching to the PSP awards granted in 2016 are as follows:
Relative total shareholder return condition EPS condition
Company relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services 
companies) over three year period ending 31 December 2018
EPS for the 2018 financial year Percentage of award that vests
Upper quartile 28.6 pence or more 40%

and 40% 
Median 24.5 pence 10%
Below median Less than 24.5 pence 0%
A further 20% of the award is subject to strategic measures as referred to on page 75, the targets for which will be disclosed following the 
end of the performance period.

Attendance at Committee meetings is set out on page 70.
Key duties of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration and the 
specific remuneration for the Chairman and each of the executive directors, including pension rights, within the terms of the agreed policy. 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group. 
Advisers
The Chief Executive Officer, Company Secretary and the Vice President – Global HR are invited to attend Committee meetings to contribute to 
the Committee in its deliberations. However, no individual is involved in discussions, or is part of any decisions, relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee received independent advice from Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) who were appointed as the Committee’s independent 
remuneration advisers in April 2013. 
During the year, Deloitte provided advice on governance and market trends and other remuneration matters that materially assisted the 
Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of this work were charged on a time and expenses basis and totalled £17,400 for advice 
in 2017. Deloitte also provided tax services to part of the Group in the year. The Committee was satisfied that this did not compromise the 
independence of the advice received.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and adheres to its code of conduct. Deloitte was appointed directly 
by the Committee, and the Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.

86  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Going concern
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going concern and in reaching their conclusions have taken into account factors which 
include the amendment and restatement in March 2016 of the Group’s main credit facility put in place in July 2014 and which involved the putting 
in place of an extended commitment of £370 million under the multicurrency revolving facilities agreement until July 2019. After making enquiries 
and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, the directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of both the Group and the Company.
Cautionary statement
The purpose of this report is to provide information to the members of the Company. It contains certain forward-looking statements with 
respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since

Governance Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Financial statements, including adoption of going concern basis
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group 
and company and of the profit or loss of the group and company for 
that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the group financial statements and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, 
have been followed for the company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and 
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the group and company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group and company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Report of the Directors, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the company;
• the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the group as a whole; and
• the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the group and company as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the audit of financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Synthomer plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated balance sheet and 
statement of financial position – Synthomer plc as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to 
the group or the company.
Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the company in the 
period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit 
procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, 
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement in the group and company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing 
Rules, Pensions legislation, UK tax legislation, UK environmental regulations and the EU registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction 
of chemicals regulations and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant component teams. Our tests included, but were 
not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, enquiries of management, review of 
significant component auditors' work and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are 
inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from 
the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of Defined Benefit Pension Schemes
As set out in Note 26 on page 128 the Group has significant 
defined benefit pension schemes. These primarily represent the 
Yule Catto Group retirement benefits scheme in the UK and an 
unfunded scheme in Germany, which account for £78.3 million 
and £68.5 million, respectively, of the net pension deficit of 
£157.2 million recorded on the Group balance sheet at the year 
end. We focused on the pension liabilities in particular, as the 
amounts reflected in the financial statements for defined benefits 
schemes are sensitive to relatively small changes in a few key 
assumptions such as the inflation rate, mortality tables and most 
notably, the discount rate applied. The Group uses third party 
actuaries to calculate the amounts to reflect in the financial 
statements in respect of these schemes and it is accordingly 
important for us to assess the work they perform and their 
competency to undertake the work in order to conclude on 
the results of their work.
We obtained external actuarial reports of the UK and German schemes 
which set out the calculations and assumptions underpinning the year 
end pension scheme valuation. We read these reports and were 
satisfied that the scope of their work was such that we could use this 
work to provide evidence for the purpose of our audit. We assessed the 
competency and objectivity of the external actuaries commissioned by 
the Group to perform the year end calculations by considering their 
technical expertise and independence from the Group. We identified 
no concerns over their competency or objectivity. We used our own 
specialist actuarial knowledge to evaluate all the key assumptions 
used in each of the two schemes by comparing these assumptions 
to our expectations for similar schemes as at the year end. We found 
management’s assumptions to be within an acceptable range.
90  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Accounting for the acquisition of Oxo Belgium
On 5 March 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of 
Perstorp Oxo Belgium AB ("Oxo Belgium") for consideration 
of £66.1m, as described in note 31.
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” (“IFRS 3”) requires that all assets 
and liabilities acquired in the business combination are recorded 
at fair values on acquisition. Judgement is required in identifying 
and valuing all the assets and liabilities acquired, in particular 
intangible assets which are recognised on acquisition and 
valuing the acquired property, plant and equipment.
Intangible assets totalling £38.9m were identified relating to 
customer relationships. The key judgements were in determining 
an appropriate methodology to value these assets and appropriate 
assumptions, including forecast revenue and profit, discount rate 
and rates of obsolescence to determine their fair values.
Tangible assets relating to land, buildings and plant and 
machinery have been valued at £8.9m. The key judgements were 
in determining an appropriate methodology to value these assets, 
assessing current market values for similar assets, replacement 
costs and other valuation assumptions.
We evaluated the process used by management to identify and value 
the assets and liabilities acquired. We assessed the assets and 
liabilities acquired and the fair value adjustments applied. The fair 
value adjustments were considered appropriate.
We considered the Directors’ process for identifying the intangible 
assets acquired, considering the rationale for the acquisition and the 
nature of the Oxo Belgium business. Using our valuation specialists, 
we assessed the valuation methodology used by the Directors in 
valuing the identified assets. We evaluated the forecasts and data 
used and the key assumptions made.
We were satisfied that the fair values of the intangible and tangible 
assets were supportable, and that the assumptions used in valuing 
the assets were within an acceptable range.
Provisions for Uncertain Tax Positions
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to a 
range of tax laws in a number of different tax jurisdictions. In 
determining the amount to record at the year-end for tax liabilities 
there is an element of judgement as to what amounts will 
ultimately be payable for assessed tax exposures. As set out in 
Note 10 at 31 December 2017, the Group has recorded current 
tax liabilities totalling £40.2 million. A significant element of this 
tax liability relates to uncertain tax positions. We focused on this 
area due to the size of the amounts involved and level of 
judgement needed to determine the estimated provisions.
We used our tax specialists to assess the level of provisions held 
against various tax exposures and to consider the appropriateness of 
any provisions. In our assessment we had regard to the nature of the 
individual exposures, including their origin, and any developments in 
the year to assess the rationale for their continued validity at the 
current year end. As part of this work we inspected correspondence 
with tax authorities and the Group’s tax advisors. We challenged the 
judgements made by assessing individual provisions against our 
expectations of potential exposures, having regard to the facts of each 
case. No significant issues arose from this work to suggest that the 
judgements made and amounts recorded were inappropriate. 
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
As set out on page 2, the Group reports its results as two segments: ‘Europe and North America’ and ‘Asia and the Rest of the World’. The 
Group financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating 
companies, across 17 countries. Three countries, being the UK, Germany and Malaysia, account for the majority for the Group’s results. 
We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in these countries, which were subject to audits of their complete financial 
information. In addition, to increase our coverage of the Group’s revenues and underlying profit before tax we performed audit procedures at 
an additional 10 reporting units located in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, USA, Finland and the Czech Republic. These components 
accounted for 88% of the Group’s revenue, 89% of the Group’s operating profit and 87% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those 
reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole. The key reporting units in the UK, Germany and Malaysia were visited by senior members of the 
Group team during the audit.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £6.5 million (2016: £6.1 million). £5.0 million (2016: £5.0 million).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before tax. 2% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that underlying profit before tax, 
being profit before tax adjusted for special 
items, is the principal metric against which 
the Group’s financial performance is 
measured in the Chairman’s and CEO’s 
statements within the financial statements.
We believe that total assets is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in 
assessing the performance of the company, 
and is a generally accepted benchmark. This 
has been capped at a level below that of the 
group materiality.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £450,000 and £5,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
materiality that was less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £325,000 (Group audit) 
(2016: £300,000) and £325,000 (Company audit) (2016: £300,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
92  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Report of the 
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did 
not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 67 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 88, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 68 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)

Group financial statements Group financial statements
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page 88, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the directors on 12 July 2012 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 6 years, covering 
the years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2017.

98  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
31 December 2017
1 General information
Synthomer plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered 
office is given on the inside back cover. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling (functional currency of the parent company).  Foreign operations are 
included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
No new standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting period and 
have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for 
hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 
1 January 2018. 
The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and expects there to be no material impact arising from the adoption of the new 
standard on 1 January 2018. 
As disclosed in note 23, the Group’s only financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables, which will continue to be 
held at amortised cost. There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the 
accounting for financial liabilities that are designated as fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
The Group has confirmed that its current hedging relationships will continue to qualify as hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses, rather than only incurred 
credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The Group does not expect any material movement in the loss allowance for trade receivables on 
the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods and services 
and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of 
a good or service transfers to a customer. The standard also requires entities to apportion revenue earned from contracts to individual 
performance obligations, based on a five-step model. This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. 
The Group has performed a detailed assessment at all major sites, and as a result has concluded that no material impact is expected 
on the accounting of revenue in the Group. No material separate performance obligations are expected, and no material adjustment is 
anticipated to the pattern of revenue recognition. Further work is being done to identify any potential increased disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction 
between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right-to-use the leased item) and a financial 
liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. This standard is mandatory for financial 
years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Group’s operating leases, and the Group has undertaken a review to identify all 
leases in each entity. As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £34.7m (see note 33). 
However, the Group has not yet assessed what other adjustments are required, for example because of the change in definition of lease 
term, and the treatment of extension and termination options. 
Moreover, the standard offers various transitional arrangements which may have an impact on the adjustments required . As the various 
options are still being considered to establish which is right for the Group, an estimate has not yet been made for the amount of right-to-use 
assets and lease liabilities that will have to be recognised on adoption of the new standard, and how this may affect the Group’s income 
statement and classification of cash flows going forward.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or 
future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  99
Group financial statements Group financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments at fair value through the 
Income Statement. As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 87 , the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.  
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination (see below) and the 
non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed 
for impairment at least annually at the cash generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a “Bargain purchase”, the excess is credited to the income 
statement immediately on acquisition.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

100  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes;
• liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held investment is 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses from such re-measurement are recognised in the income statement.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, on the following bases:
Customer relationships  – between 5 and 14 years
Technology – 10 years 
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent 
valuation reports.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions 
in IAS 38 are met:
• an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software and new processes);
• it is technically feasible to complete the asset;
• management intends to complete the development;
• there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria required for capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year. Where no internally-generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  101
Group financial statements Group financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost comprises original 
purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, 
capitalised finance costs. Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially 
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other 
comprehensive income.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease. Any benefits 
received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring, the Group forfeits the 
right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised. The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as 
a finance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2017
102  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the carrying 
amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost 
of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are 
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value 
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts (see below for details of the 
Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the relevant average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in 
the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, 
including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a 
negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless 
the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement 
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of 
foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly 
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017  103
Group financial statements Group financial statements
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same 
line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks which become fully liquid within three months or less and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

104  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Retirement benefit costs
Current and past service costs in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the consolidated income 
statement.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised outside of the 
consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. 
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-
administered funds. For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under 
local laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group. 
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected parties.
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in 
the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales are recognised when products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s 
acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specified location, the risks of obsolescence 
and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, 
the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period. The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

Definitions
Operating profit
Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation. 
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Special Items (as defined below).
Special Items
The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying performance:
•  Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;
•  Impairment of non-current assets;
•  A cq u i sit i on c o s t s ; 
•  Re-structuring and site closure costs;
•  Fair value adjustment – mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes 
where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied;
•  Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature; and    
•  Tax impact of above items. 
These Special Items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to a 
distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not 
reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year.
Underlying performance 
Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding Special Items.
Net cash/(borrowings)
Net cash/(borrowings) represents cash and cash equivalents less short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related 
derivative instruments, irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements and the inclusion 
of financial assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the Group has made in the process 
of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, tax losses and 
accelerated capital allowances. Determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high degree of management 
judgement and is dependent on management’s ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss positions carried forward 
against future income taxes.
Valuation of goodwill and intangibles on acquisition
Acquired intangibles IFRS 3 (revised) “Business Combinations” requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised 
and included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions 
involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome. These 
estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. Changing the assumptions 
selected by management could significantly affect the allocation of the purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking the current and expected future 
market conditions into consideration.
Post retirement benefit obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions. Any changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations. These are shown in detail in note 26.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2017
106  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Current tax liability and deferred tax
The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also recognises 
significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s interpretations of applicable 
laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply 
what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.
3 Special Items
The Special Items are made up as follows:
Note
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Continuing operations
Restructuring and site closure (11.6) (5.2)
Profit on sale of business – 4.7

Acquisition costs (2.3) (4.3)
Amortisation of acquired intangibles 16 (31.0) (27.0)

(Loss)/profit before taxation from continuing operations (43.6) 14.5
Taxation 10 13.1 9.1
(Loss)/profit for the year from continuing operations (30.5) 23.6
The restructuring and site closure costs included £9.0m in relation to the post-acquisition integration of the PAC (Dispersions) business, 
with the majority being attributable to the rationalisation of the Ribécourt (France) site. A further £1.6m comprised the cost of an onerous 
lease on a site closed during 2017, while £0.8m comprised costs for the post-acquisition integration of Speciality Additives.
The profit on sale of business relates to the disposal of our South African business in 2016.
The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton, UK. The profit on sale of land in 2016 related to the disposal of 
tranches of Malaysian land.
The gain of £13.1m in 2016 resulted from foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US dollar purchase consideration of 
the PAC (Dispersions) acquisition.
Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to Speciality Additives (2016: PAC (Dispersions)) and for other potential acquisitions which will not 
occur, or have not occurred before the balance sheet date. 
The amortisation of intangibles increased during 2017 due to a full year of amortisation for the 2016 PAC (Dispersions) acquisition, the 
intangibles acquired with Speciality Additives and due to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
4 Segmental analysis 
The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group’s performance and has identified two 
reportable segments of its business:
Europe and North America (ENA)
These markets are well developed and are typically growing in line with GDP.
Asia and Rest of the World (ARW) 
These markets are characterised by growing at rates generally above GDP coupled with an increased penetration of more sophisticated 
products into wider uses.
The Executive Committee primarily uses Underlying operating profit, being operating profit before Special Items, to assess the performance 
of the operating segments. No information is provided to the Executive Committee at the segment level concerning interest income, interest 
expenses, income taxes or other material non-cash items. 
No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues.

5 Underlying segmental performance
The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and as such includes all sources of income and expenses, including 
both irregular items and those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing businesses. To provide additional clarity on the ongoing trading 
performance of the Group’s businesses, the management uses “Underlying performance” as an alternative performance measure to plan for, 
control and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items.
The definition of Special Items is shown in note 2 and has been consistently applied. Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including 
them in the assessment of a segment's performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the 
Group's financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year, or both. 
An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to acquired customer relationships. 
The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. 
The Group considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the 
potential double counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

6 EBITDA
The Group uses EBITDA as an alternative performance measure as it provides an indication of the level of cash being generated by the 
business from its trading activities in the period by excluding the depreciation and amortisation charges and Special Items. This is also the 
principal profit measure used for the financial covenants in the Group’s debt facilities.
The definition of EBITDA is shown in note 2.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash flows. The key assumptions 
for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. The discount rate is based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGU’s activities and geography 
of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with management’s expectations for future business 
performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2017
116  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Pre-tax discount rates of 11% (2016: 11%) and 12% (2016: 12%) have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America and 
Asia & Rest of the World respectively. 
The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts; for years six to ten a growth rate is applied.  
Growth rates of 2% (2016: 2%) and 2% (2016: 5%) have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of the World respectively, 
representing management’s best estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the 
markets concerned.  The profit for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
The directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2017, £70.5 million (2016: £70.5 million) is located in the UK.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values of 
financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by 
applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly 
observable, (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted to address these 
risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group monitors interest rate trends 
regularly, through discussion with its banks, and fixes interest rates when it is prudent to do so.
Foreign currency risk
When it is efficient to do so, the Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, 
which are predominantly denominated in Euro, US dollar and Malaysian Ringgit. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group’s 
policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material currency 
exposures to disclose (2016: none).

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at 
the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation 
at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign 
operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity through 
monthly management accounts.

The Group owns agricultural land in Malaysia, which is operated as a palm oil and natural rubber plantation. The land is owned by Kind 
Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has a 30% non-controlling interest. The directors 
decided in 2013 to dispose of this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing facilities, on the open market.

The 2016 overseas column includes two offsetting one-off items. Following a regulatory clarification by the authorities, employers in Germany 
are now required to provide for post retirement disability benefits in funded plans rather than in unfunded arrangements. The Group has 
complied with this by transferring this liability from its unfunded defined benefit plan to a multi-employer funded plan in which it participates. 
The latter, although a defined benefit arrangement, is accounted for on a defined contribution basis as discussed below. Although this transfer 
has no financial impact on the Group, IAS 19 results in a different accounting treatment for the transfer in the two plans. 
• The transfer out of the unfunded plan is treated as a past service credit under defined benefit accounting and as such is included as 
a reduction of £3.9m in the overseas defined benefit charge above.
• The transfer in to the funded plan increases the liabilities of this scheme by the same amount. As this scheme is accounted on a defined 
contribution basis, this additional liability would not be reflected until additional contributions were made. However, an actuarial valuation 
of this scheme has been performed in the year, which concluded that additional contributions were required to address underfunding. 
As a result the overseas defined contribution amount above includes an additional charge of £3.6m.

UK pension schemes
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension benefits since that time are provided by way 
of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme
The UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company. 
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. 
The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2015 and updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified actuary.
The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2015 valuation. This valuation indicated a shortfall, 
when measured against the scheme’s technical provisions of £118.7m. This shortfall is expected to be eliminated in eight years following 
the valuation date. As a result the Group is committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from 
£14.0m for the year commencing 6 April 2015 to £18.2m for the year commencing 6 April 2022.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2017
128  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 The scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets 
underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which 
are expected to outperform corporate bonds on the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. 
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase 
in the value of the plan’s bond holdings. 
Longevity risk The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. 
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is re-insured by an external 
insurance company.
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2017 2016
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.00% 2.10%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.20%
Discount rate 2.50% 2.70%
Inflation assumption 3.10% 3.20%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. These assumptions translate 
into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows:

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality. The sensitivity 
analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period 
assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £63m
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £18m
The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit 
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes are held separately 
from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £72.1m, 2016: £69.6m) where in line with 
common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.

Multi-employer schemes
In addition to the overseas defined benefit schemes included in the above, the Group participates in the Degussa Pensionskasse in Germany, which is 
a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme.  Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits 
accruing.  The assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience, 
therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts 
for the scheme on a defined contribution basis.  The Group expects to make regular contributions of £2.3m to the scheme in 2018. 
To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable.  Based on the latest actuarial assessment each 
participating employer’s share has been determined according to the value of its future benefit accrual and it has been determined that the 
Group is liable for total deficit contributions of €4.6m in three installments payable in January 2017, 2018 and 2019.  As a result an accrual of 
£2.7m (2016: £3.6m) has been included at 31 December 2017 representing the present value of these contributions not yet paid.

A provision is recognised for the costs to be incurred in the restoration of land which is no longer being used as a manufacturing site.
Legal and customer claims
This amount represents a provision for certain legal and customer claims brought against the Group. In the directors’ opinion, after taking appropriate 
legal advice, the outcome of these claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2017 .
Restructuring
The "Synthomer 2015" restructuring exercise was commenced in 2014. In 2017 the Group provided for an onerous lease on the site in 
Osset, and as part of the post PAC (Dispersions) acquisition restructuring programme, the Group has planned the demolition of buildings 
at the site in Ribécourt, France. The cost of all these restructuring programmes is charged to the income statement when permitted by 
the Group's accounting policy, within Special Items. The provision reflects the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.
Liability arising on a business combination
As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty property. The provision reflects this 
onerous contract.
The provisions are expected to be fully utilised over the next five years.

Exercisable at 31 December 50,166 – 17,796 – 
For options outstanding as at 31 December 2017, the exercise price was £nil and the weighted average remaining contractual life was 4.73 
years (2016: 5.0 years).
The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust
The Company established a trust, formerly the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees 
enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan 
to be met. The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey. 
At 31 December 2017, the Trust held 249 (2016: 26,794) ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of £nil (2016: £0.1 million). 
The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £4.70 (2016: £3.56).
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £2.97 (2016: £1.84). The valuation 
was based on the following inputs and assumptions:
2017 2016
Weighted average share price (£) 5.03 3.67 
Option price (£) – – 
Value of optionality nil nil
Vesting assumption 59% 50%
Given the option price is £nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price is £nil. There is 
some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be made but this is considered to be minimal and therefore this has not 
been modelled.
The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and is based on 
management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
36 Share price information
The middle market value of the listed ordinary shares at 31 December 2017 was 491.4 pence (31 December 2016: 382.6 pence). During the 
year, the market price ranged between 372.0 pence and 509.5 pence. The latest ordinary share price is available on the Group’s website 
www.synthomer.com.

International Financial Reporting Standard 3 "Business Combinations" (revised 2008) requires the assets acquired to be initially recorded 
at Fair Value at the date of acquisition. Any such Fair Value adjustments are provisional and will be finalised within twelve months of the 
acquisition date. Any resulting changes in the fair values may have an impact on the depreciation from the date of acquisition and would 
be recorded in the financial statements.
Due to the short period of time since acquisition, neither a preliminary assessment of intangible assets nor the Property Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) valuation had been completed at the date of these financial statements. When the final valuation work is concluded, a substantial 
increase is anticipated in PPE, intangible assets and associated deferred tax liabilities, along with a corresponding reduction in goodwill. 
The acquisition of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR business was completed on 31 January 2018. The acquired business has therefore not 
contributed to the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017. Sufficient information is not currently available to disclose 
the contribution to the Group if the acquisition had been made on 1 January 2017. 
Sale of business
On 1 January 2018, the Group disposed of 100% of the share capital of Synthomer Leuna GmbH for £7.6m. The net assets of Synthomer

31 December 2017
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of Synthomer plc have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land 
and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement, and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on industry experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The directors have reviewed the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements. The directors do not believe 
that there is a significant risk which would lead to material adjustments to the carrying value of any assets and liabilities in the next financial 
year due to changes on estimates or assumptions.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance 
with FRS 101:
• IAS 7, ‘Statement of cashflows’;
• The requirements in IAS24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members 
of a group;
• IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’;
• Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement 
of assets and liabilities; and
• Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share 
options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).
Going concern
The Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash reserves and borrowings. After making enquiries and 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance the Directors have concluded that the Company should be able 
to operate within the level of its current cash reserves and borrowings and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Company operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in ‘Pounds Sterling’ (£), which is also the 
Company’s functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. All other foreign exchange gains and 
losses are presented in the income statement within ‘Other operating income’.
Property, plant and equipment
Properties are shown at professional valuation from 1985. All other plant and equipment are stated at cost. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset plus the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other comprehensive income and shown as 
Revaluation reserve in shareholders’ funds. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged in other comprehensive 
income and debited against Revaluation reserve; all other decreases are charged to the income statement. Each year the difference 
between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset charged to the income statement, and depreciation based 
on the asset’s original cost is transferred from ‘Revaluation reserve’ to ‘Retained earnings’.
140  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Intercompany
Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right of set off exists. Balances are valued at fair value at inception and are repayable 
on demand.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Financial instruments
All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial assets 
classified as at fair value through the income statement, which are initially measured at fair value. Financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the balance sheet when, and only when, there exists a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets are derecognised, when and only when, a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are 
settled, b) the Company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the 
Company, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party 
and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability 
unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortisation cost using the 
effective interest rate method.

Company financial statements Company financial statements
1 Accounting policies continued
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including 
cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each statement of financial position date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a 
derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the 
income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The Company only applies fair value 
hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings
Borrowings represents short-and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether 
they qualify for hedge accounting.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as pre-payment for liquidity service and amortised over the term of the facility.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Financial guarantees
The Company issues guarantees in respect of bank and other facilities of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
2 Auditors’ remuneration
The audit fee of Synthomer plc amounted to £10,000 (2016: £10,000).
