The Financial Review presents the comparative results of the Group on both a 
pro forma reporting basis and on a statutory reporting basis. On a statutory 
basis, the prior period comparative results are for the 18 month period  
ended 31 December 2016, and include the results of Partnership Assurance 
Group plc (“Partnership”) only for the nine months following acquisition at the 
beginning of April 2016. In order to present information that enables a clearer 
comparison of results for the current year against the prior period, the Group 
has chosen to present additional pro forma financial information for the 12 
months ended 31 December 2016 prepared on the basis that the merger 
between Just Retirement and Partnership had already taken place as at 
1 January 2016. Pro forma information is unaudited. A reconciliation of pro 
forma financial information to statutory financial information for the period  
to 31 December 2016 is given at the end of the Financial Review section.
JRP Group was renamed Just Group following a vote at the AGM on 18 May 
2017. “Group”, “Company” and “Just” are used interchangeably throughout 
the report to refer to Just Group plc unless explicitly stated.

A sustainable model  
in growing markets
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to introduce Just Group plc’s 
2017 Annual Report. The Company has once 
again produced a strong set of results.
The Group has a robust strategy, a strong 
management team and we enjoy a 
competitive advantage based on our 
hard-to-replicate intellectual property. We 
are focused on some of the most attractive 
growing markets in the retirement sector 
and we are confident this growth will 
continue, given the strong structural drivers 
supporting it.
Just has a strong social purpose and by 
providing people with advice, guidance, 
products and services, we help them achieve 
security, certainty and peace of mind in later 
life. We believe everyone deserves a fair, 
fulfilling and secure retirement.
This is possible because our Board is focused 
on building a sustainable business and using 
our capital wisely. This focus ensures we are 
always able to keep the promises that we 
have made to our customers.
Profit growth continues
Participating in economically attractive 
growing markets enables us to be selective in 
the risks we choose to write and this has 
enabled us to improve our margins and grow 
profits, rather than pursue headline sales 
growth in search of market share.
I am delighted that we have been able to 
exceed the synergy benefits we targeted 
from the merger and deliver them one year 
ahead of plan. The cost efficiency achieved 
from the merger has contributed significantly 
to improved margins, as explained in more 
detail in the Financial Review.
Dividend
Despite the challenging external 
environment, Just has delivered another 
strong operating and financial performance, 
driven in particular by our focus on disciplined 
pricing and risk selection. The Board proposes 
a final dividend of 2.55 pence per share, a  05

total of 3.72 pence per share for 2017 (2016 
calendar year: 3.5 pence per share). This is a 
6% increase and reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the Group’s prospects.
Board composition and governance
I take great pride in leading the Board and 
the Group’s governance function, and I am 
pleased to confirm we have benefited from 
continuity of membership since the AGM in 
2017. Shortly before the AGM we announced 
that James Fraser and Peter Catterall wished 
to step down as Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company and I would like to thank them 
for their significant contribution to the Group 
over many years.
My introduction to the Corporate Governance 
Report provides further information on our 
robust governance and decision making 
processes. I would like to thank the entire 
Board for their significant contribution, 
commitment and service; and look forward to 
working with them in 2018 as the Group 
continues to build on its strategic priorities.
Shareholders and other stakeholders
By serving our customers well we aim to 
generate strong returns for our shareholders, 
provide rewarding roles for our colleagues 
and support for communities. The Board 
engages with our regulators, legislators and 
wider society to promote the interests of our 
customers more broadly and we place great 
importance on working effectively with these 
groups.
We had an active programme of engagement 
with shareholders and the investment 
community in 2017; we listened to their views 
and provided detailed insight into our 
markets, how we win new business and the 
considerable growth opportunities we see for 
our Group. 
A confident future
The outlook remains favourable for each of 
our key businesses. I am excited about the 
prospects for growth in our markets and the 
opportunities for Just Group plc. Our results in 
this period demonstrate our ability to deliver 
increasing profits, and we look forward to 
delivering further growth and value for our 
shareholders.
On behalf of the Board I would like to close by 
thanking all of our colleagues across the 
Group in the UK, South Africa and the United 
States for their hard work, ingenuity and 
commitment to our mission. Their positive 
energy and dedication in supporting our 
customers and business partners has helped 
our business progress in 2017, and has 
ensured we are well placed for the future.

Defined benefit  
de-risking solutions
Introduction
Defined benefit pension schemes have an 
obligation to pay a pre-determined monthly 
retirement income based on an employee’s 
earnings history, tenure of employment  
and age. Operating these schemes has 
become unattractive and more costly for 
employers over the last decade and this has 
created an opportunity for guaranteed 
income providers to de-risk, fully or partially, 
an employer’s existing defined benefit 
obligations to its members.
  Taking the risk out of  
paying company pensions
Defined benefit de-risking can occur via a 
Buy-in, whereby a pension scheme pays a 
single premium to an insurance company to 
purchase an income stream that matches its 
obligations to its members, but retains legal 
responsibility for those obligations. An 
alternative is a Buy-out, where a pension 
scheme removes its obligations by 
purchasing individual insurance policies to 
replicate its obligations to some or all of its 
pension scheme members, who then become 
customers of the de-risking provider.
The solutions for de-risking can be medically 
underwritten, meaning that insurers use 
individual members’ medical and lifestyle 
information to assess their longevity as 
opposed to relying on proxies such as the 
member’s age, pension amount and possibly 
postcode. For some schemes, medically 
underwritten pricing is typically better  
value than traditional non-medically 
underwritten pricing.
Defined benefit pension schemes with fewer 
members offer the greatest opportunity for 
medical underwriting to deliver benefits. This 
potentially occurs if there are a small number 
of scheme members, with a high proportion 
of the schemes’ liabilities that are assessed 
by using medical underwriting to have life 
expectancies below average. Medical 
underwriting has become well established in 
the defined benefit de-risking market and its 
benefits are well understood.
Current market and outlook
There are approximately £2tn in UK defined 
benefit pension scheme obligations (source: 
PPF), which is driving high demand for 
de-risking solutions, with Buy-in transactions 
forecast over the next decade to be 
approximately £350bn (source: Hymans 
Robertson). While insurer capacity will 
increase in the long term, over the medium 
term we believe the demand for de-risking 
solutions exceeds the current supply 
available from providers. The defined benefit 
de-risking market is projected to grow further 
over the next decade with transactions 
expected to double to over £30bn per year. 
This level of activity would result in only 2%  
of total defined benefit pension assets each 
year being de-risked, providing significant 
potential upside. The total volume of 
de-risking transactions in 2017 is expected  
to exceed £10bn (source: LCP).
The capacity of companies to deliver
de-risking solutions is constrained. Defined
benefit pension schemes are competing  
for the same resources as a number of life
insurance companies who have explored,  
or are exploring, selling their large books of
Guaranteed Income for Life business.

Individual retirement income market
Introduction
Guaranteed Income for Life (“GIfL”) products 
are bought by individual customers to 
convert some or all of their accumulated 
pension savings into a guaranteed lifetime 
retirement income. The solution provides 
people with peace of mind from the security 
of knowing the income will continue to be 
paid for as long as the customer and where 
relevant, for as long as they or, typically, their 
spouse lives. In the UK, GIfLs traditionally 
offered an income payable without reference 
to the individual’s health or lifestyle, and 
were differentiated only by reference to a 
limited number of factors such as age, 
postcode, premium size and, prior to 
31 December 2012, gender. 
An individually underwritten GIfL takes into 
account an individual’s medical conditions 
and lifestyle factors to determine their life 
expectancy. People who are eligible and 
purchase an individually underwritten GIfL 
typically achieve double digit percentage 
increases in income compared to purchasing 
a GIfL which is not individually underwritten.  07

  Providing security and  
peace of mind
The proportion of people purchasing an  
individually underwritten GIfL is continuing to 
increase and our view is this will become the 
minimum standard for all providers over the 
next few years.
Pension customers are encouraged to 
compare the GIfL offer provided by their 
existing pension company to those offered on 
what is the open or external market. In March 
2018 the FCA introduced rules requiring 
pension companies to provide customers 
with an external GIfL quotation showing the 
best quote available from the external 
market alongside the quotation from the 
incumbent firm. This should provide new 
opportunities for Just Group as we compete 
in the open market when these customers 
choose to shop around; this is our 
addressable market as we do not have an 
existing base of pension savings customers. 
The open market increased from 45% in 2016 
to over 48% in 2017 of the total GIfL market 
and over 49% in the final quarter of 2017 
(source: ABI). 
Continuing developments are driving growth 
in our addressable market:
• the structural drivers of growth in the 
retirement income market are strong and 
assets accumulating in defined 
contribution (“DC”) pension schemes are 
projected to increase consistently over the 
next decade. This growth arises from an 
increase in the number of people joining 
workplace pension schemes as a result of 
the successful state auto enrolment policy 
and the increase in contribution rates due 
to be implemented in 2018;
• growth in DC pension assets also arises as 
companies close down final salary or 
defined benefit (“DB”) pension schemes 
and offer their employees DC pensions 
instead;
• thousands of people are transferring out 
of DB pension schemes into DC pension 
schemes to take advantage of Pension 
Freedoms. When transferring, many 
people are choosing to secure a 
guaranteed income for life, by using some 
of the transfer value to purchase an 
individually underwritten GIfL; and
• many life and pension companies are 
choosing to put in place broking solutions 
to offer their pension savings customers 
access to the best individually 
underwritten GIfL deals in the market. 
Some are choosing to transfer their 
obligations to provide a guaranteed GIfL 
rate to their customers to an alternative 
product provider or broking solution. This 
grows our addressable market and 
provides customers with better outcomes. 
Our Group business HUB Financial 
Solutions is providing many of these 
corporate services.

Lifetime Mortgages
Introduction
A lifetime mortgage (“LTM”) allows 
homeowners to borrow money secured 
against the equity in their home without the 
need to move out. The amount borrowed is 
repayable together with accrued interest on 
the death of the homeowner or moving 
permanently into residential care. This product 
can be used by retirees to supplement savings, 
top up retirement income or to settle any 
outstanding indebtedness.
The typical lifetime mortgage customer is 
around 70 years old, has a house valued at 
around £200,000 and agrees a facility to 
borrow up to 30% of the house value.
  Enabling people to improve their 
later-life living standards
People are becoming increasingly positively 
disposed to accessing some of the equity in 
their homes to improve the quality of their 
later lives or to help their family. The 
compound annual growth rate of the lifetime 
mortgage market between 2001 and 2017 
was 26% and this has attracted new providers 
to enter the market in the last few years.
Just Group is a leading product provider of 
lifetime mortgages. Our HUB Financial 
Solutions business is a leading distribution 
business providing consumers with regulated 
advice on equity release solutions from 
across the market.
Current market and outlook
Homeowners aged over 55 are estimated to 
own property wealth of over £2.5 trillion 
(source: ONS). We estimate that the existing 
industry loan book including interest is just 
£20bn. The market remains under-penetrated 
and there is significant headroom for growth.
Just is forecasting that the LTM market will 
grow to around £6bn by the end of 2021, 
which is a compound annual growth rate of 
18% from 2017. The primary drivers of 
growth are:
• Households wanting to top-up their 
retirement income to improve their 
standard of living in later life;
• An increase in the number of people with 
outstanding interest only mortgages who 
are entering retirement and require a 
solution to settle the debt with the 
existing mortgage company;
• Strong demographic growth. The number 
of people aged 65 and over is forecast to 
increase from around 12 million today to 
over 18 million in by 2040; and
• An increase in new entrants who spend 
money on advertising which results in 
people becoming aware of LTMs combined 
with people becoming more disposed to 
using some of their housing equity.

Long-term care solutions
Introduction
Care Plans, or immediate needs annuities 
(“INA”), are a segment of purchased life 
annuities. A Care Plan offers a guaranteed 
income paid directly to a registered care 
provider or an individual for the life of the 
insured, in exchange for an up-front lump 
sum premium. Under current rules this 
income is tax free when paid directly to the 
registered care provider. Care Plans are 
available to individuals entering care facilities 
or receiving domiciliary support. As such, 
Care Plans provide a form of longevity 
insurance to the individual against the costs 
of receiving care until their death.
Just has a strong pedigree in the market, 
having been one of the market leaders  
for 16 years.
Current market and outlook
There is a substantial market for care in  
the UK. The drivers of the need for care are  
strong because:
• there are currently around 1.6m people 
aged 85 or over in the UK – this is the 
average age at which people go into care 
homes. It is expected that this number 
will more than double over the next two 
decades suggesting a growth rate in 
excess of 3%;
• around 33% of women aged 65 and 20% 
of men aged 65 are likely to enter a care 
home at some point in the future; and
• there is uncertainty over government 
policy for long-term social care. The 
government has withdrawn the cap  
on care fees that was due to become 
effective in 2020 and plans to publish  
a Green Paper on care and support for 
older people by summer 2018. This will 
set out  how the government proposes  
to improve care and support for older 
people and tackle the challenge of an 
ageing population.

International markets
South African retirement income market
South Africa has one of the five largest 
immediate guaranteed income for life 
markets in the world, with many structural 
similarities to the UK including legislative 
framework, products and distribution. 
Limited state social security, tax incentives 
for private retirement provision and  
increased compulsion to purchase a 
guaranteed income for life or drawdown 
solution mean the retirement market is 
expected to grow significantly over the 
coming years.
The market is dominated by defined 
contribution arrangements. The market that 
could annuitise includes approximately £3bn 
at-retirement and £18bn in-retirement 
savings, however currently the great majority 
of consumers use drawdown plans.
Just has introduced an innovative new 
product to the South African market which 
provides the customer with the benefit of a 
guaranteed income for life solution within a 
drawdown product. 
Prudential regulation is moving from the 
current regulatory basis to Solvency 
Assessment and Management (“SAM”). This 
was delayed from 1 July 2017 to 1 July 2018; 
SAM is recognised as equivalent to the 
Solvency II regime. 
Additionally, the government-led reform to 
retirement legislation was introduced in 
August 2017.  This makes trustees of  
retirement funds responsible for providing 
default solutions at retirement, with 
retirement benefit counselling provided by 
each pension scheme to provide information 
on default options at retirement.
US care market
The US represents an opportunity for our 
Group in this significant market. Within the 
care segment, the US has a similar backdrop 
to the UK with a government-funded safety 
net but significant volumes of self-funders.
Total annual spending is estimated at 
$145bn, of which $45bn is self-funded.  
There is widespread acceptance of the  
need to self-fund, with many wishing to 
avoid State dependency. There are very 
limited underwritten guaranteed income  
for life options available to consumers  
in the US market.
The target market for our Group’s products are 
US residents in later life receiving, or about to 
receive, long-term domiciliary or residential 
care and able to afford a single premium. 10

Operating Model
Superior risk selection
We have world-class capabilities in 
selecting risks that help us focus on 
creating value for shareholders and 
delivering better outcomes for customers.
Next generation underwriting system: 
PrognoSys™
• PrognoSys™ is a powerful proprietary tool for 
pricing and reserving that allows the Group 
to identify and price for the risks we want and 
provide improved outcomes for customers.
• Whilst it is already market-leading, we 
continue to invest in PrognoSys™ to ensure 
continued leadership.
• Recent enhancements are allowing us to 
fine-tune our offers to healthier customers, 
offering the personalisation that we 
originally brought to the medically 
underwritten market to a far greater number 
of customers.
Experienced medical team and 
underwriters 
• Our in-house medical team is made up of 
epidemiologists, doctors and bio-statistical 
modellers. This team enables us to develop 
superior pricing and reserving processes and 
stay as up to date as possible with latest 
medical and longevity developments. 
• We benefit from a deep understanding of the 
whole spectrum of lifestyle, medical and 
behavioural factors and their impact on  
life expectancy. 
• Our experienced underwriters enable us to 
apply our proprietary IP in our pricing and 
reserving. 
Unrivalled proprietary data
• Our extensive database means we 
understand the likely impact of medical and 
lifestyle information on life expectancy. 
• We have combined Just and Partnership 
datasets, creating an unrivalled breadth  
and depth of resource for our analysis.
• We now hold over 2.6 million person-years  
of medical and mortality data. The insight 
this gives us into customer lifestyle  
and medical outcomes is a significant  
competitive advantage. 
Strong financial model
The Group creates value by taking on 
those risks which we believe can be  
fairly rewarded.
Capital efficient model
• Our synergistic suite of products results in an 
efficient and balanced use of capital. 
• Just Retirement Limited, the Group’s principal 
life assurance company, uses an internal 
model to calculate our capital requirements 
more accurately than a standard model and 
approval is only granted to companies who 
have met the Prudential Regulation 
Authority’s (“PRA”) requirements.
• Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited 
is currently in the process of seeking approval 
from the PRA for authorisation to use an 
internal model.
Financial risk management 
• Our operating model is complemented by a 
conservative approach to risk management. 
• We have strong experience of delivering 
accurate longevity estimates coupled with 
prudent reserving. 
• The majority of longevity risk for both DB and 
GIfL business is held by high quality 
international reinsurers. 
Investment management
• Our investment policy enables us to provide 
attractive returns to customers and to 
optimise risk-adjusted returns for 
shareholders, while ensuring that cash flows 
from assets under management are 
sufficient to meet payment obligations to our 
DB and GIfL portfolios. 
• We follow an enhanced buy-and-maintain 
investment strategy whereby we purchase 
assets with attractive risk–reward 
characteristics and hold them to maturity to 
capture the full risk premium, particularly the 
illiquidity premium. We replace assets where 
this makes sense, taking into account 
frictional costs. 
• The majority of our financial asset portfolio is 
held in investment grade, fixed income 
securities such as government and corporate 
bonds. The Group also invests in lifetime 
mortgages, private placements, commercial 
property mortgages and infrastructure loans.  12

Key Resources and Relationships
CUSTOMERS
At Just, all our activities start by 
understanding how we can best meet the 
needs of our target customers. Whether we 
are designing new services or new products, 
our customers are the focus of everything 
that we do. We invest our resources to enable 
our customers to achieve a fair, fulfilling and 
secure retirement.
Distribution  
partners
Distribution plays a key role in our ability to 
reach, attract and retain customers. Building 
out and diversifying our distribution network 
helps ensure that we fully capitalise on the 
opportunities available to us in each of our 
markets. Just has a highly effective multi-
channel distribution strategy which is one of 
our key strengths. 
Our DB sales are made via employee benefits 
consultants (“EBCs”) who advise pension 
schemes’ trustees and we have developed 
strong relationships in this area. We 
distribute our individual retail products 
through a number of channels, including 
generalist and specialist financial 
intermediaries and emerging channels 
accessed via our HUB business such as life 
insurance companies, banks, building 
societies, pension schemes and affinity 
partners. Our consistent record in achieving 
the highest accolades in industry service 
awards demonstrates the strength and 
quality of our relationships with those to 
whom we provide services.  13
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
Our colleagues ensure we continue to 
respond effectively to the changing external 
environment. Their resilience and enthusiasm 
were critical to the Group achieving the 
excellent set of results we have reported
In 2017 we have continued to develop new 
corporate partnerships and extend our 
services to current business customers to 
broaden our distribution reach. This has 
helped our corporate partners to develop 
improved outcomes for their at- and 
in-retirement customers. We continue to 
invest in our HUB business and we have 
achieved success, winning mandates to 
deliver services to other life insurance 
companies to provide regulated advice, and 
guidance services, together with access to 
Just’s products and those sourced from the 
external market. 
Reinsurers
These include the Group’s key relationships 
with Hannover Ruck SE, RGA Global 
Reinsurance Company Ltd, RGA International 
Reinsurance Company DAC and SCOR Life 
Global Life (UK Branch), as well as strong 
working relationships with Achmea 
Reinsurance Company N.V., Pacific Life Re Ltd, 
General Reinsurance AG (London branch), 
Hannover Life Reassurance Bermuda Ltd, 
Nomura Reinsurance 5IC Ltd and Partner 
Reinsurance Company Ltd. 
This diverse group of counterparties helps  
to ensure strong risk mitigation and 
competitive terms.
Government and  
regulators
Regulators and policymakers are important 
stakeholders for Just. We believe that an 
important part of our role in the retirement 
income market is to engage positively with 
government and regulators to encourage 
effective competition and consumer 
protection that results in achieving better 
customer outcomes. We engage regularly 
with ministers, government officials, 
regulators and other policymakers directly 
and through trade bodies. As a leader in the 
markets we serve, we are well placed to share 
our customer and market insights to 
contribute to progressive policy development. 
Suppliers
The Group generally manages its own 
customer-facing systems and processes, and 
uses professional partners to provide 
specialist services. This continues to allow us 
to flex and adapt our services to meet 
evolving customer demands. 
The Group outsources certain operational 
and administrative functions where 
appropriate. This includes the administration 
of pension payments for our DB business, 
some sections of our Guaranteed Income for 
Life business and some lifetime mortgage 
books acquired from our heritage Partnership 
business. The relationships with the suppliers 
of these services are managed through 
dedicated teams. 
Our colleagues
It is our colleagues at Just who continue to 
deliver the strategy for the business and will 
drive future success. We focus on recruiting 
the right people, helping them to understand 
our values and their role, and then giving 
them the training and support to develop a 
high-performance culture. 
Our approach to colleagues focuses on  
staff engagement, well-being, personal 
development and commitment to the 
highest level of performance, with a 
particular focus on reviewing our corporate 
working policies to enhance their daily 
working lives.
Development
Developing our colleagues is central to our 
overall business strategy and this 
commitment is set out in our Learning and 
Development Policy. Our development 
activities focus on the organisational 
initiatives that have the biggest impact.
Diversity
We are committed to valuing diversity and 
promoting equality of opportunity for our 
Group colleagues. We ensure that they are 
selected and promoted on the basis of merit 
and ability, regardless of age, gender, race, 
religion, sexual orientation or disability. We 
aim to create and promote a safe and 
healthy environment where diversity is 
valued and colleagues have a sense of 
well-being. We will not tolerate discrimination 
on any grounds, whether it relates to age, 
disability, sex, gender re-assignment, 
pregnancy, maternity, race, sexual 
orientation, religion or belief, and to marital/
civil partnership status.
Benefits
We value the contribution our colleagues 
make to the business, so in return we offer a 
wide range of policies and benefits designed 
to attract, develop and retain the best and

FOCUSED ON 
GROWING 
PROFITS
We are focused on growing  
profits and in 2017 have delivered 
increasing new business margins  
and profits
Introduction
I am pleased to present my CEO Statement 
for 2017. This year marks the first full year’s 
results post-merger (for the combined two 
predecessor businesses, now reporting 
as Just Group plc), and I am immensely 
proud of all we have achieved. We have 
demonstrated that we can adapt and 
respond to the changing retirement and 
regulatory landscapes to meet the needs of 
our customers, deliver improved margins, 
sustainable growth in profits and, in doing 
so, created value for our shareholders. 
Performance review
We compete in attractive growth markets 
and our strategy is focused on growing 
profits not headline sales. Expanding markets 
enable us to achieve profitable growth as 
selecting the most attractive risks is easier 
when there is more business to choose from. 
During 2017 we have improved margins and 
delivered significant growth in new business 
operating profit and adjusted operating 
profit. New business operating profit was 
£169.8m for 2017, an increase of 37% 
compared to the prior year, and adjusted 
operating profit before tax grew in the same 
period by 35% and was £220.6m. IFRS profit 
before tax for 2017 was £181.3m, an increase 
of 5% compared to 2016.
In addition, we have delivered synergy 
benefits of £52m on a run rate basis from the 
merger which is in excess of both our original 
target of £40m and our revised target of 
£45m. This has contributed materially to the 
Group’s new business profitability. 
Our product range across Retirement Income, 
Drawdown and Lifetime Mortgages is well 
established and presents a comprehensive 
offering to at-retirement and in-retirement 
customers. During the year, Retirement 
Income sales rose by 4% to £1,889.9m. 
Once again we are proud to have been 
awarded Financial Adviser 5 Star service 
awards in both the Life & Pensions and 
Mortgages categories, for the 13th and 10th 
consecutive years respectively. This is a great 
achievement and a well-deserved reflection 
of the Just customer experience that we have 
been working so hard to deliver each and 
every day.
Capital and dividends
During the year the Group’s primary 
insurance subsidiary, Just Retirement 
Limited (“JRL”), achieved an inaugural 
Insurer Financial Strength credit rating of 
A+, and in addition JRL and Just Group plc 
achieved Issuer Default Ratings of single A. 
 
Furthermore, the Group improved its 
liquidity options by agreeing a £200m 
revolving credit facility with three banks, 
which remains undrawn.

The Group’s Solvency Capital Requirement 
coverage ratio was estimated at 141% at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
151%), as expected due to the transitional 
measures for technical provisions (“TMTP”) 
recalculation and strong new business 
volumes written during the year, with the 
majority of our own funds comprised of  
Tier 1 capital. Our economic capital ratio at 
31 December 2017 was 238% (31 December 
2016: 216%). 
Since year end our capital position has been
strengthened further by our successful issue
of £230m 7 year Tier 3 capital at a 3.5% 
coupon in February 2018.
The PRA continues to publish industry-wide 
consultation papers and supervisory 
statements setting out its expectations for 
certain aspects of prudential regulation. 
There is a possibility that the implementation 
of one or more of these could result in a 
change to the regulatory capital position of 
the Group. We maintain frequent dialogue 
with regulators to ensure we implement the 
emerging policies appropriately.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 
2.55p per share, a total of 3.72p per share for 
2017. This is an increase of 6% from 2016. 
Colleagues
In each of our markets we have teams 
focused on delivering for our customers. 
It is the hard work, creativity and 
determination of these teams that enable 
Just to succeed. Our colleagues ensure 
we continue to respond effectively to the 
changing external environment and their 
resilience and enthusiasm were critical to 
the Group achieving the excellent set of 
results we have reported. My thanks go 
to all our colleagues across the Group for 
their hard work and support throughout the 
year and for their determination to make a 
positive difference to our customers’ lives.
And finally…
We have delivered what we set out to 
achieve during the year, including the 
implementation of our new brand, Just. 
The rollout of the new brand has provided 
the opportunity to bring together the best 
of our predecessor companies and has 
encouraged our talented colleagues across 
the Group to create new ways of achieving 
our mission to deliver a fair, fulfilling and 
secure retirement for our customers. The 
outlook remains favourable for each of our 
key businesses. We have demonstrated our 
ability to grow profits and position the Group 
to select the most attractive risks so that we 
may grow sustainably and deliver value to 
our shareholders, outstanding service to our 
customers and opportunities for our people.

Grow our markets  
AND broaden our  
distribution reach
We increase sales in our markets by working 
to grow market demand; we capture our 
share of these growing markets by ensuring 
growth in distribution reach and customer 
access 
Why this is important
We have a fundamental belief that our 
products meet needs that, if unaddressed, 
create risks to the quality of later life that 
our customers may experience. So it’s 
important to grow markets and reduce the 
experience of those risks. Of course, larger 
markets create more sales opportunities for 
us and more value for shareholders. And a 
combination of distribution reach and larger 
markets means greater opportunity for us to 
select the risks we want to address. 
How we achieve this
In our UK DB De-risking business we continue 
to drive growth in the small and medium 
transaction segment of the DB de-risking 
market. Our innovative medical underwriting 
solutions enable us to provide more options 
for pension scheme trustees. 
We support growth in the UK GIfL, LTM  
and care markets through market and 
distributor education and regulatory 
engagement. We expand our distribution 
reach through the active pursuit of new 
partner business relationships.

2
Give customers  
a distinctly ‘just’  
experience every time
We align our customer experience with 
our brand promise across all channels 
and businesses
Why this is important
Our brand embodies fairness, a strong 
social purpose and our desire to improve 
retirement for customers by providing them 
with simple-to-use products and services. It 
expresses our ambition to present ourselves 
differently, provide outstanding service to 
our customers and support people with the 
broader challenges of later life.
How we achieve this
We have defined our customer experience 
principles and framework to ensure that our 
products and services live up to the brand 
promise we live by. 
We are working hard to ensure that our post-
merger culture embraces the brand promise 
and customer perspective. For instance, 
in our call centres, no one is measured 
against call-handling time. Such measures 
undermine willingness to spend time on the 
phone to fully address customer needs. 
We measure, share and celebrate great 
customer feedback.

We aim to deliver 
consistent growth  
in revenues and  
profits through risk 
and margin selection 
in our current 
markets combined 
with growth into 
new markets and 
strong internal cost 
and capital discipline
When we succeed in addressing all 
of our strategic objectives we will 
be achieving consistent growth in 
shareholder value and be addressing 
an ever greater number of later 
life needs. We will also be laying 
progressively stronger foundations to 
pursue our fifth objective to diversify 
and build businesses outside of our 
current core, meeting more needs and 
generating more valuable growth. 
Our strategic choices are also made 
with a view to reducing the principal 
risks our business faces and making 
our business more resilient.

Diversify our business away 
from any single business 
line or market
We grow outside our core businesses by 
leveraging our insights, capabilities and 
intellectual property. We diversify to grow 
and also to reduce dependency on any one 
business line, distributor or market
Why this is important
Our current markets have growth potential, 
but we already have substantial market 
shares and a focus on profitable new 
business over growth for the sake of it.  
So identifying new markets helps us  
access profitable and potentially higher 
growth potential. 
Just as importantly, new markets are 
a means to diversify away from any 
concentration in market, regulatory or 
balance sheet risk. 
With diversification we can seek to develop 
businesses that have a lower new business 
strain on capital, meaning growth is not 
constrained by our balance sheet.
How we achieve this
We are selective in pursuing a limited 
number of diversification prospects. Our 
focus is on opportunities in which our existing 
assets and capabilities create advantage, 
maximise potential, and minimise downside 
risk. We closely monitor progress and act fast 
when expectations are not met. 
—
3
Make smart risk  
choices
We identify and price for the business we 
want. We ensure new business complements 
our balance sheet and provides the best 
balance of risk, reward and capital usage
Why this is important
Efficient deployment of our capital is key 
to optimising the amount of business that 
we write, at what margin, and with what 
capital use. In addition, we seek to ensure 
that the synergies between our businesses 
are maximised through careful matching of –
amongst other factors – the likely duration of 
mortgages, DB and GIfL solutions.
How we achieve this
We combine customer insight, market 
knowledge and unrivalled medical IP to 
target the business and customer segments 
that are most attractive. Our distribution 
reach gives us access into our target 
segments and significant business flows 
from which to pick our preferred risks. 
Strong relationships with high quality 
reinsurers allow us to mitigate risks 
cost-effectively.

Focus on strong financial 
management
We ensure that we spend money wisely, 
avoid waste and deliver value for the 
business. We consider the capital impact 
and return of all our decisions
Why this is important
We have a firm target to achieve capital self- 
sufficiency, which we will only achieve with 
the careful application of our available capital 
and a focus on ensuring that expenses 
are aligned to the scale and needs of the 
business. Careful stewardship of our finances 
makes money available to fund our existing 
business and diversification ambitions.
How we achieve this
Having delivered the synergy benefits of the 
merger, we are continuing to use the strict 
governance demanded in this delivery to 
focus on our on-going operating costs. A 
strong cost-benefit approach is embedded 
into all our investment decision making.
The evolution of our new culture includes  
a strong emphasis on avoiding waste. 
We use our internal model to drive a 
disciplined approach to pricing our services 
and to continuously improve our capital 
management activities.

DELIVERING 
PROFIT
We are a pioneer in medically

Income for Life solutions and 
have collected more details,  
of more customers, for longer 
than our competitors
HUGH MCKEE
MANAGING DIRECTOR,  
UK RETAIL BUSINESS
Delivering profit from 
sustainable advantage
Our focus on effective use of capital leads to 
attention on margin over market share. As a result 
our IFRS new business margin has increased from 
6.8% pro forma in 2016 to 9.0% in 2017. 
The Guaranteed Income for Life category has been 
an important driver of this improvement, and a key 
factor in doing this is the unique and granular data 
that allows us to make accurate risk selections. 
We are a pioneer in medically underwritten GIfL and 
have collected more details, of more customers, for 
longer, than our competitors. This brings unique 
insight to our pricing and risk-selection decisions, 
enabling us to be selective in the business we write, 
and offering better rates than competitors, while 
achieving attractive margins. 
By closely aligning our operational processes and 
underwriting approach we are able to optimise 
outcomes for both customers and shareholders, a 
win-win that provides a great return on the 
investments we have made over many years in these 
key components of our business model.
Why we win
Risk selection
We have long, broad and deep datasets 
driving a detailed understanding of risks 
and the ability to micro-segment our 
markets, helping us to target where to 
compete for attractive margin.
Grow Markets
As a market leader we have a strong 
voice with commentators and market 
participants. We use this to grow our 
core markets, for instance in helping 
financial intermediaries understand GIfL, 
Care, Equity Release and defined benefit 
de-risking markets and increase their 
activity in these areas.
Digital solutions
We are hands-on where it creates value, 
for instance in customer contact, but 
look to streamline where possible. Our 
highly automated underwriting, with 
low processing cost and fast turnaround, 
both manages our expenses and 
improves outcomes for our customers.

Risk Management
Through our strong risk culture, 
we are confident of making  
better decisions to achieve 
business success 
Purpose
We use risk management to make better informed business 
decisions that generate value for shareholders while delivering 
appropriate outcomes for our customers and providing confidence 
to other stakeholders. Our risk management processes are designed 
to ensure that our understanding of risk underpins how we run 
the business.
Risk framework
Our risk management framework is developed in line with our risk 
environment and best practice. The framework, owned by the 
Group Board, covers all aspects of risk management, including risk 
governance, reporting and policies. Our appetite for different types 
of risk is embedded across the business to create a culture of 
confident risk taking.
Risk evaluation and reporting
We evaluate risks in our operating environment and decide how best 
to manage them within our risk appetite. Management regularly 
reviews its risks and produces reports to provide assurance that 
material risks in the business are being mitigated. The Risk function, 
led by the Group Chief Risk Officer (“GCRO”), challenges the 
management team on the effectiveness of its risk evaluation 
and mitigation. The GCRO provides the Group Board’s Risk and 
Compliance Committee with his independent assessment of the 
principal risks to the business and emerging risk themes.
Financial risk modelling is used to assess the amount of each risk 
type against our risk appetite. This modelling is aligned to both our 
economic capital and regulatory capital metrics to allow the Board 
to understand the capital requirements for our principal risks. By 
applying stress and scenario testing, we gain insights into how risks 
might impact the Group in different circumstances.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment
The Group’s Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) further 
embeds comprehensive risk reviews into our Group management 
structure. Our annual ORSA report is a key part of our business cycle 
and informs strategic decision making. ORSA updates are prepared 
each quarter to keep the Board apprised of the Group’s evolving 
risk profile. 20

Risks from our 
chosen market 
environment 
Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
The Group operates in a market where 
changes in pensions legislation can have a 
considerable effect on our strategy and could 
reduce our sales and profitability or require us 
to hold more capital. 
The Group has developed propositions to 
enable customers to have more flexible 
retirement solutions. Customers’ need for 
a secure income in retirement continues 
and the Group expects that demand  
for guaranteed income for life solutions  
will continue.
Our approach to legislative change is 
to participate actively and engage with 
policymakers, and this will not change.
The Group offers a range of retirement 
options, allowing it to remain agile in this 
changing environment, and has flexed its 
offerings in response to market dynamics. 
We believe we are well placed to adapt to 
changing customer demand, supported by 
our brand promise, innovation credentials 
and financial strength.
The most influential factors in the successful 
delivery of the Group’s plans are closely 
monitored to help inform the business. The 
factors include market forecasts and market 
share, supported by insights into customer 
and competitor behaviour.
Risk 
B
Risks from 
our pricing 
assumptions
Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
Writing long-term DB de-risking, GIfL and 
equity release business requires a range of 
assumptions to be made based on market 
data and historical experience, including 
customers’ longevity, corporate bond yields, 
interest rates, property values and expenses. 
These assumptions are applied to the 
calculation of the reserves needed for future 
liabilities and solvency margins using 
recognised actuarial approaches. 
The Group’s assumptions on these risk factors 
may be materially inaccurate, requiring them 
to be recalibrated. This could affect the level  
of reserves needed, with an impact on 
profitability and the Group’s solvency position.
To manage the risk of our longevity 
assumptions being incorrect, the Group 
has the benefit of extensive underwritten 
mortality data to provide insights and 
enhanced understanding of the longevity 
risks that the Group chooses to take.
Longevity and other decrement experience is 
analysed to identify any outcomes materially 
different from our assumptions and is used 
for the regular review of the reserving 
assumptions for all products. 
Some longevity risk exposure is shared 
with reinsurance partners, who perform due 
diligence on the Group’s approach to risk 
selection. There is a related counterparty risk 
of a reinsurer not meeting its repayment 
obligations. This risk is typically mitigated 
through the reinsurer depositing the 
reinsurance premiums back to the Group or 
into third party trusts and by collateral 
arrangements. 
For equity release, the Group underwrites 
the properties against which it lends using 
valuations from expert third parties. The 
Group’s property risk is controlled by limits 
to the initial loan-to-property value ratio, 
supported by product design features, 
limiting specific property types or regions, 
and monitoring of the exposure to adverse 
house price movements.

Risks from 
regulatory 
changes
Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
The financial services industry continues 
to see a high level of regulatory activity 
and intense regulatory supervision. This 
reflects in part an increasing concern about 
the effect of the economic environment on 
the ability of insurers to continue to be able to 
meet policyholder obligations. The regulatory 
agenda for the coming year covers many 
areas directly relevant to the Group. 
Further to the implementation of Solvency II, 
the PRA has published and continues to 
publish supervisory statements that set out  
its expectations for certain aspects of 
prudential regulation. This includes to date 
statements relating to illiquid assets, 
matching adjustments and transitional 
provisions. There is a risk that the 
implementation of one or more of these 
statements could result in a negative  
impact on the regulatory capital position  
of the Group.
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
is developing a strategy to address the 
challenges for financial services of the ageing 
UK population and is pursuing reviews and 
initiatives pertinent to the retirement and 
mortgage markets. 
The EU General Data Protection Regulation 
(“GDPR”) comes into effect on 25 May 2018. 
Although many of the GDPR’s requirements 
are already present in the UK Data Protection 
Act 1998 (“DPA”), its requirements are more 
prescriptive and the rights of consumers are 
clearer and easier to enforce.
The Solvency II risk margin is particularly 
sensitive to movements in interest rates, 
which can increase its volatility. The matching 
adjustment to meet Solvency II requirements 
makes management of liquidity within the 
Group more complex. 
The ultimate terms of the UK’s exit from the 
EU could have significant consequences for 
the regulation and legislation that apply to 
Just’s operations. 
We monitor and assess regulatory 
developments on an on-going basis and 
engage fully with the regulators. Our aims 
are to implement any required changes 
effectively, and to deliver better outcomes 
for our customers and competitive advantage 
for the business. 
Just has an approved partial internal model 
to calculate a Group Solvency Capital 
Requirement, and intends to progress an 
internal model major change application for 
Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited 
to use the Group internal model. 
The Group has recalculated its transitional 
measure on technical provisions (“TMTP”) 
in accordance with the Solvency II directive 
which allows for a recalculation of the TMTP 
every 24 months. 
We will continue to engage with the PRA to 
understand and seek to influence its 
developing views on prudential regulation. 
The Group is also engaging with industry 
bodies to ensure an appropriate 
implementation of supervisory statements. 
We actively seek to participate in all 
regulatory initiatives which may affect or 
provide future opportunities for the Group. 
We aim to champion outcomes that are 
positive for consumers by ensuring their 
retirement needs are understood. We 
develop our strategy by giving consideration 
to planned political and regulatory 
developments and allow for contingencies 
should outcomes differ from our 
expectations. 
We manage sensitive personal data in 
accordance with existing DPA requirements 
and are adjusting our existing practices and 
processes to meet the requirements of the 
new regime. 22

Risks from 
the economic 
environment
Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
The premiums paid by the Group’s customers 
are invested to enable future benefits to be 
paid. The economic environment and 
financial market conditions have a significant 
influence on the value of assets and liabilities 
and on the income the Group receives. An 
adverse economic environment could 
increase the risk of credit downgrades and 
defaults in our corporate bond portfolio. 
The lack of clarity regarding the UK’s future 
trading arrangements with the EU has 
introduced material uncertainty for the UK’s 
macro-economic outlook in the medium and 
long term. It is too early to be clear on the 
long-term implications of departure from the 
EU for the UK economy and indeed the wider 
economic impacts on the rest of Europe and 
the world. Market conditions may become 
more volatile. 
In an environment of low interest rates, 
investors may be more willing to accept 
higher credit and liquidity risk to improve 
investment returns. These conditions could 
make it difficult to source sufficient assets to 
offer attractive DB de-risking and GIfL terms. 
Low credit spreads similarly affect the income 
that can be made available, although 
margins from our equity release portfolio 
help offset this risk. 
Most defined benefit pension schemes link 
member benefits to inflation through 
indexation. As the Group’s Defined Benefit 
De-risking business volumes grow, its 
exposure to inflation risk increases. 
A fall in residential property values could 
reduce the amounts received from equity 
release redemptions and may also affect the 
relative attractiveness of the equity release 
product to customers. The regulatory capital 
needed to support the possible shortfall in 
the redemption of equity release mortgages 
also increases if property values drop. 
Uncertainty following the UK’s withdrawal 
from the EU could result in property values 
stagnating or even falling in some, or all, UK 
regions. Conversely, significant future rises in 
property values could increase early 
mortgage redemptions, leading to an earlier 
receipt of anticipated cash flows and 
reinvestment risk. 
Market risks may affect the liquidity position 
of the Group by, for example, having to realise 
assets to meet liabilities during stressed 
market conditions or to service collateral 
requirements due to the changes in market 
value of financial derivatives.
Economic conditions are actively monitored 
and alternative scenarios modelled to better 
understand the potential impacts of 
significant economic changes on the amount 
of capital required to be held to cover risks, 
and to inform management action plans. 
It is anticipated that the UK’s withdrawal 
from the EU will have limited direct impact 
on the Group as it is predominantly UK-
based with no services provided into other 
countries of the EEA, and its customers and 
policyholders are predominantly UK-based. 
However, the Group remains exposed to the 
indirect impact that the UK’s withdrawal 
may have on the UK economy as a whole, 
including its residential housing market.  
Any changes to the regulatory environment 
as a result of the UK’s withdrawal are  
being monitored. 
The Group’s strategy is to buy and hold 
high-quality, lower-risk assets in its 
investment portfolio to ensure that it has 
sufficient income to meet outgoings as they 
fall due. Portfolio credit risk is managed by 
specialist fund managers executing a 
diversified investment strategy in investment 
grade assets within counterparty limits. 
In a low interest rate environment, improved 
returns are sought by diversifying the types, 
geographies and industry sectors of 
investment assets. Such diversification 
creates an exposure to foreign exchange 
risk, which is controlled using derivative 
instruments. Swaps and swaptions are used 
to reduce exposures to interest rate volatility. 
The credit exposure to the counterparties 
with whom we transact these instruments 
is mitigated by collateral arrangements. 
The Group’s exposure to inflation risk through 
the Defined Benefit De-risking business is 
managed with inflation hedges. 
Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that 
assets of a suitable maturity and 
marketability are held to meet liabilities as 
they fall due. Sufficient liquid assets are 
maintained so the Group can readily access 
the cash it needs should business cash 
inflows unexpectedly reduce. 
There is little short-term volatility in the 
Group’s cash flows, which can be reliably 
estimated in terms of timing and amount. 
Regular cash flow forecasts predict liquidity 
levels both short term and long term and 
stress tests help us understand any potential 
periods of strain. The Group’s liquidity 
requirements have been comfortably met over 
the past year and forecasting confirms that 
this position can be expected to continue for 
both investments and business operations.

arising from 
operational 
processes and

Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
The Group relies on its operational processes 
and IT systems to conduct its business, 
including the pricing and sale of its products, 
measuring and monitoring its underwriting 
liabilities, processing applications and 
delivering customer service and maintaining 
accurate records. These processes and 
systems may not operate as expected, may 
not fulfil their intended purpose or may be 
damaged or interrupted by human error, 
unauthorised access, natural disaster or 
similarly disruptive events. Any failure of the 
Group’s IT and communications systems and/
or third party infrastructure on which it relies 
could lead to costs and disruptions that could 
adversely affect its business as well as harm 
its reputation. 
As witnessed in 2017, large organisations 
are increasingly becoming targets for 
cyber-crime, particularly those organisations 
that hold customers’ personal details. The 
Group is no exception and a cyber-attack 
could affect customer confidence, or lead to 
financial losses.
The Group maintains a suite of risk 
management tools to help identify, measure, 
monitor, manage and report its operational 
risks including those arising from operational 
processes and IT systems. These include a 
risk management system, risk and control 
assessments, risk event management, loss 
reporting, scenario analysis and risk reporting 
through the ORSA. 
The Group maintains plans and controls to 
minimise the risk of business disruption and 
information security related events. Detailed 
incident and crisis management plans also 
exist to ensure effective responses. These are 
supported by specialist third parties for our 
workplace recovery centre. 
Our approach to information security is 
under constant review as the cyber-threat 
landscape evolves. Due diligence is 
performed on all partners to ensure that they 
work to the same high security standards as 
the Group. The Group continues to invest in its 
information security control environment but 
we recognise that the speed of change in 
cyber-threats means that a risk exposure 
remains.

Risks to the 
Group’s brands 
and reputation
Strategic objective
1 2 3 4 5
We believe everyone deserves a fair, fulfilling 
and secure retirement. Our aim is to help 
people to rethink retirement to achieve this. 
Our Just brand reflects the way we intend to 
conduct our business and treat our customer 
and wider stakeholder groups. 
There is a risk that the Group’s brands and 
reputation could be damaged if the Group is 
perceived to be acting, even unintentionally, 
below the standards we set for ourselves. 
Damage to our brand or reputation may 
adversely affect our underlying profitability, 
through reducing sales volumes, restricting 
access to distribution channels and attracting 
increased regulatory scrutiny. 
Additionally, the Group’s brands and 
reputation could be threatened by external 
risks such as regulatory intervention or 
enforcement action, either directly or as a 
result of contagion from other companies 
in the sectors in which we operate.
The Group actively seeks to differentiate 
its business from competitors by investing 
in brand-enhancing activities. Fairness to 
customers and high service standards are at 
the heart of the Just brand, and we 
encourage our colleagues to take pride in 
the quality of service they provide to our 
customers. Engaging our colleagues in the 
Just brand and its associated values has 
been, and remains, a critical part of our 
internal activity. The Group maintains a 
system of internal control, and associated 
policies and operational procedures, that 
defines the standards we expect of all 
colleagues. 24

STRONG 
performance
Financial Review 
Strong performance reflecting 
the Group’s continued focus 
on margin and the benefits of 
synergies achieved post-merger
The Financial Review presents the results of the Group on both 
statutory and pro forma reporting bases.
Just Retirement merged with Partnership to form Just Group at the 
beginning of April 2016, and the accounting reference date was 
subsequently changed from 30 June to 31 December. On a statutory 
basis, the prior period comparative results are therefore the 18 month 
period ended 31 December 2016, and include the results of Partnership 
Assurance Group plc (“Partnership”) only for the nine months following 
the merger. 
In order to present information that enables a clearer comparison of 
results for 2017, the Group has chosen to present additional pro forma 
financial information for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016 
prepared on the basis that the merger between Just Retirement and 
Partnership had already taken place as at 1 January 2016. Pro forma 
information is unaudited. A reconciliation of pro forma financial 
information to financial information for the 18 months to 31 December 
2016 is given at the end of this section.
Within the Financial Review, the Group has presented a number of 
alternative performance measures (“APMs”), used in addition to IFRS 
statutory performance measures. The Board believes that the use of 
APMs gives a more representative view of the underlying 
performance of the Group. The APMs used by the Group are:
new business operating profit, in-force operating profit, underlying 
operating profit, adjusted operating profit, new business sales, 
adjusted earnings per share, Group European embedded value and 
economic capital coverage ratio. Further information on APMs can be 
found in the glossary on page 134 together with a reference to where 
the APM has been reconciled to the nearest statutory equivalent.
Adjusted operating profit 
Adjusted operating profit is presented in the table opposite with 
comparative information on a pro forma basis representing the 
operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 for both Just 
Retirement and Partnership as if they had been merged throughout 
that period. The underlying assumptions have been aligned to be 
consistent across both Group companies.
Adjusted operating profit before tax
The increase in adjusted operating profit before tax of 35%, from 
£163.7m on a pro forma basis for the year ended 31 December 2016, 
to £220.6m for the year to 31 December 2017, is mainly a reflection of 
the Group’s continued focus on margin over volume, as well as the 
benefits of the merger synergies. There has also been a net positive 
contribution in the current year from the review of the assumptions 
underlying the calculation of the Group’s insurance liabilities. These 
have partly been offset by a small increase to the losses and 
expenses incurred by the Group’s non-insurance entities and holding 
companies, and increased reinsurance and finance costs. 
Adjusted operating profit 
before tax
£221m
2016: pro forma £164m, up 35%  25
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
New business operating profit
New business operating profit has increased by 37% on a pro forma 
basis. This mainly reflected the increased margin achieved which has 
risen from 6.8% to 9.0%. The volume of Retirement Income sales rose 
by 4% compared to the prior period, demonstrating our prioritisation of 
margin rather than volume. The margin improvement was achieved 
through risk selection, pricing discipline, lower unit costs from synergy 
savings, and more efficient asset-liability management. In addition, 
the investment returns within our new business margin assumptions 
benefited from sustained attractive lifetime mortgage spreads.
In-force operating profit
The in-force operating profit was slightly lower than in the prior 
period, mainly as a result of tightening corporate bond spreads.
Underlying operating profit
The increase in underlying operating profit reflects movements in 
new business operating profit and in-force operating profit as 
explained above.
Operating experience and assumption changes
The favourable operating experience variances and assumption 
changes were as a result of number of changes.
In relation to expense reserves, the delivery of integration synergies 
has reduced the running per-policy costs, which has led to the release 
of c.£90m of maintenance expense reserves.
The operating experience variances actually experienced in the year 
amounted to a negative variance of £15m, being mainly driven by 
early mortgage mortality.
In relation to mortality, a review has been completed on the mortality 
basis of our mortgage and non-medically underwritten defined 
benefit books to reflect the slower rate of longevity improvement in 
the general population. The strain arising from our mortgage 
mortality assumption changes was partly offset by mortality releases 
from our non-medically underwritten DB reserves and leading to a 
net charge of £30m.
These items, when combined with some other smaller negative items 
of less than £10m, resulted in a net income statement benefit of 
£35m in operating experience and assumption changes.
Other Group companies’ operating results
The operating result for other Group companies changed from a loss 
of £12.4m on a pro forma basis for the year to 31 December 2016 to a 
loss of £15.1m for the year to 31 December 2017. During the year the 
Group brought the JRS and TOMAS businesses together as HUB 
Financial Solutions, which is expected to improve the efficiency of 
these business activities. This line item also includes expenses 
relating to the Group’s holding companies.
Reinsurance and finance costs 
The increase in reinsurance and finance costs in 2017 mainly reflects 
the inclusion of a full year’s worth of interest costs relating to the 
£250m Tier 2 debt issued in October 2016.
New business sales 
New business sales for the year to 31 December 2017 are presented in 
the table below together with comparative sales on a pro forma basis 
representing sales for the year to 31 December 2016 for both Just 
Retirement and Partnership.
Retirement Income sales increased by 4% on a pro forma basis. Total 
new business sales increased by 2%, from £2,407.9m on a pro forma 
basis for the year ended 31 December 2016, to £2,457.1m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. The main reasons for these increases are 
explained below.
DB sales were £997.8m for 2017 (2016 pro forma DB sales: £943.4m), 
increasing by 6% year on year. The momentum in DB continues to be 
strong and it is expected to grow substantially over the next decade. 
We have made a strong start in 2018 and are quoting on a healthy 
pipeline of new Buy-in and Buy-out business.

GIfL sales increased by 5% year on year to £820.5m, compared to pro 
forma 2016 sales of £778.1m. During 2017 GIfL sales benefited from 
individual customers transferring from their defined benefit pension 
schemes into a pensions drawdown and GIfL mix. The GIfL outlook 
remains positive for the Group, especially as the trend for retirees to 
shop around the market gathers momentum.
Care Plan sales for 2017 were £71.6m, down from pro forma 2016 
sales of £97.2m, reflecting renewed emphasis on risk selection, and 
political uncertainty in relation to Care provision around the time of 
the general election. The Group remains one of the market leaders in 
this sector.
Drawdown sales were £51.2m for the year ended 31 December 2017 
(pro forma 2016: £25.2m) and mainly represent Flexible Pension Plan 
(“FPP”) sales. The FPP allows consumers to take advantage of 
Pensions Freedoms and this product continues to grow in popularity. 
During the year we closed our sub-scale Protection product to new 
business. Protection sales for 2017 were £6.0m (2016 pro forma sales: 
£4.7m). 
Lifetime mortgage advances were £510.0m in the year (pro forma 
2016: £559.3m). We take a risk based approach towards our mortgage 
appetite and use the longer duration characteristics of these assets 
to provide an optimum backing ratio relative to the shape of the 
liabilities we write during a particular period.
Earnings per share 
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the Group is shown in the 
table below, with comparatives on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EPS 
(based on adjusted operating profit after attributed tax) shows a 36% 
increase compared to the pro forma comparative figure. This increase 
reflects the trends in operating profit described above, together with 
a reduction in the tax rate attributed to operating profit from 20.00% 
to 19.25%, in line with effective tax rates.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Capital management 
The Group continues to manage its business on both regulatory and 
economic capital bases.
Just Group plc estimated Solvency II capital position
The Solvency II regime came into effect on 1 January 2016. The Group 
has approval to apply the matching adjustment (“MA”) and 
transitional measures for technical provisions (“TMTP”) in its 
calculation of technical provisions and uses a combination of an 
internal model and the standard formula to calculate its Group 
Solvency Capital Requirement (“SCR”). 
The Group’s capital position has benefited from our continued focus 
on margin and pricing discipline together with careful asset liability 
management. The Group’s Solvency Capital Requirement coverage 
ratio was estimated at 141% at 31 December 2017 after the effect of 
the required TMTP recalculation at year end. This has fallen from the 
151% reported at 31 December 2016 but this figure did not assume 
any TMTP recalculation. If we had anticipated the TMTP recalculation 
within the 31 December 2016 figure the comparative SCR coverage 
ratio would have been 148% on a comparable basis. Additionally, as 
expected, the SCR coverage ratio was impacted by new business 
strain from the strong new business volumes written during the year.
Since the year end, the Group’s capital position has been further 
strengthened by the successful issue of £230m 7 year Tier 3 capital in 
February 2018. If this Tier 3 capital had been in issue at the year end, 
the SCR coverage ratio would have benefited by circa 15 percentage 
points, increasing to an estimated 156% at 31 December 2017. The 
increase in risk-free rates since 31 December 2017 has also had a 
beneficial effect on the Group’s capital position.
The table on page 26 analyses the movement in excess own funds in 
the 12 months to 31 December 2017.
Summary of Just Group plc economic capital position
The table below shows the Group’s economic capital position as at 
31 December 2017. The capital coverage ratio at 31 December 2017 
remains strong at 238%, a 22 percentage point increase on the prior 
year (31 December 2016: 216%). The increase in economic capital 
mainly reflects the impact of new business written over the period 
and the impact of expense synergies from the merger.
European Embedded Value (“EEV”) 
The Embedded Value result for Just Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is summarised in the table below. EEV reporting is 
not a statutory requirement, but supplementary disclosure intended 
to facilitate users’ understanding of the Group. The Directors have 
therefore chosen not to include comparative figures including 
Partnership for just nine months of an 18 month comparative period. 
Comparative data for the year ended 31 December 2016 is instead 
provided on a pro forma basis only as if the merger had taken place 
on 1 January 2016. The underlying assumptions in the comparative 
period were aligned across both companies.
Operating EEV earnings of £152.6m mainly relate to £160.8m from 
new business written in the period and a positive contribution of 
£33m from in-force business, offset by interest costs and operating 
expenses. Non-operating earnings include integration costs and the 
impact of revaluation of the Group’s own debt. The Group paid a 
dividend of £33.2m in the period representing the final 2016 dividend 
and interim 2017 dividend.
EEV earnings for the 12 month period ended 31 December 2017 have 
reduced by £161.9m compared to the prior year. This reduction is 
primarily due to the EEV earnings for 2016 including large positive 
economic variances from the fall in risk-free rates over 2016.

Statutory financial information and Key Performance 
Indicators 
The current year statutory financial information is for the year ended 
31 December 2017, and the comparative period statutory financial 
information is for the 18 month period ended 31 December 2016. The 
comparative period statutory financial information includes the 
results of Partnership Assurance Group from the date of its acquisition 
at the beginning of April 2016. The Group’s accounting reference date 
was changed from 30 June to 31 December during 2016, resulting in 
an 18 month accounting period.
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
The Board has adopted the following metrics, which are considered to 
give an understanding of the Group’s underlying performance drivers. 
These measures are referred to as key performance indicators. The 
Board regularly reviews the KPIs against our strategic objectives to 
ensure that we continue to have the appropriate set of measures in 
place to assess and report on our progress.
New business sales
£2,457.1m (18 months ended 31 December 2016: £3,480.6m)
The decrease between the two periods reflects the longer period of 
account in the comparative accounting period. The section at the 
beginning of the Financial Review shows our new business sales for 
2017 on a pro forma 12 months basis.
New business operating profit
£169.8m (18 months ended 31 December 2016: £171.7m)
New business was written on a higher margin during 2017 than in the 
comparative period for the 18 months to 31 December 2016. However, 
due to the longer period of account in 2016, the absolute value of this KPI 
has decreased from the prior period to the current period. A comparison 
of the year to 31 December 2017 to the year to 31 December 2016 on a 
pro forma basis is given at the beginning of the Financial Review section.
In-force operating profit
£71.3m (18 months ended 31 December 2016: £89.3m)
The movement in in-force operating profit is due to the longer period 
of account in the comparative period. A comparison of the year to 
31 December 2017 to the year to 31 December 2016 on a pro forma 
basis, is given at the beginning of the Financial Review section.
Adjusted operating profit
£220.6m (18 months ended 31 December 2016: £215.7m)
The movement in adjusted operating profit mainly reflects the 
movements in new business and in-force operating profits explained 
above as well as the positive contribution from changes in operating 
experience and assumption changes during the year, offset by lower 
finance and reinsurance costs in the year to 31 December 2017 
compared to the longer period of account in the comparative period. 
A comparison of the year to 31 December 2017 to the year to 
31 December 2016 on a pro forma basis is given at the beginning of 
the Financial Review section.
IFRS profit before tax
£181.3m (18 months ended 31 December 2016: £198.8m)
The IFRS profit before tax mainly comprised the operating profit of 
£220.6m and favourable investment and economic profits of £22.6m, 
partly offset by integration costs of £25.6m and £24.7m of 
amortisation of intangible assets. 
IFRS net assets
£1,740.5m (31 December 2016: £1,610.6m)
The Group’s total equity at 31 December 2017 was £1,740.5m, 
£129.9m higher than at 31 December 2016. The growth in net assets 
mainly reflects the profit after tax of £155.1m for the period less the 
2016 final dividend and 2017 interim dividend.
European embedded value (“EEV”)
£2,142.5m (31 December 2016: £2,047.0m)
EEV at 31 December 2017 was £2,142.5m, an increase of £95.5m 
compared to the closing value at 31 December 2016. The increase 
principally reflects the value of new business written in the period less 
the 2016 final dividend and 2017 interim dividend.
Solvency II capital coverage ratio
Estimated 141% (31 December 2016: 151%) 
Solvency II has been the Group’s regulatory capital basis since 
1 January 2016. The Group’s Solvency II capital coverage ratio at 
31 December 2017 was estimated as 141% (31 December 2016: 151%). 
As expected, this ratio reduced due to TMTP recalculation and strong 
new business volumes written during the year. Since the year end, the 
Group’s capital position has been further strengthened by the issue of 
£230m 7 year Tier 3 capital, in February 2018.
Economic capital coverage ratio
238% (31 December 2016: 216%)
Economic capital is a key risk-based capital measure. Economic 
capital remained strong during the year. The increase in economic 
capital mainly reflects the impact of new business written over the 
period and the impact of expense synergies from the merger.

31 December 2017, and the comparative period statutory financial 
information is for the 18 month period ended 31 December 2016. The 
comparative period statutory financial information includes the 
results of Partnership Assurance Group from the date of its 
acquisition at the beginning of April 2016. 
Adjusted operating profit before tax
The underlying trends in the profit components are explained in the 
KPI section on page 28.
Non-recurring and project expenditure
Non-recurring and project expenditure decreased from £21.1m for 
the 18 month period ended 31 December 2016 to £11.6m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and relates to a number of projects across 
the Group including Solvency II and the reorganisation of our 
corporate solutions and distribution businesses to form HUB Financial 
Solutions. In the prior period the Group incurred significant one-off 
costs relating to preparation for the Solvency II regulatory reporting 
regime, which commenced on 1 January 2016.
Investment and economic profits
Investment and economic profits were £22.6m (18 month period 
ended 31 December 2016: £93.1m), mainly reflecting the impact of 
narrowing credit spreads, and positive corporate bond default 
experience. There were no bond defaults within our portfolio during 
the year. These gains were partly offset by changes to economic 
property assumptions. The prior period figure benefited from a 
significant fall in risk-free rates. 
Acquisition integration costs
Integration costs of £25.6m (18 month period ended 31 December 
2016: £40.7m) related to the costs arising from the post-merger 
integration of Just Retirement and Partnership. The restructuring has 
delivered £52m of synergies on a run rate basis.
Acquisition transaction costs
Transaction costs of £23.4m in the prior period reflected the one-off 
costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of Partnership Assurance 
Group plc. This included advisory fees, legal fees and stamp duty.
Financial Review continued 31
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
the longer accounting period to 31 December 2016, the underlying 
trend year on year is an increase in net claims paid, reflecting the 
growth of the in-force book.
Change in insurance liabilities
Change in insurance liabilities decreased from a £2,406.7m cost for 
the 18 months ended 31 December 2016 to a £1,656.5m cost for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. The reduced cost compared to the 
prior period partly reflects the longer accounting period to 
31 December 2016, and also reflects the impact of reinsurance 
recaptures during the prior period as noted in net premium revenue 
above, and operating and assumption changes made during the year.
Acquisition costs
Acquisition costs have decreased by £10.5m from £53.6m for the 18 
months ended 31 December 2016 to £43.1m for the year ended 
31 December 2017 reflecting mainly the longer accounting period in 
the prior period, but also taking into account increased commission 
paid on LTM sales compared to the previous period.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses decreased by £103.1m from £341.5m for 
the 18 months ended 31 December 2016 to £238.4m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. The decrease mainly reflects the longer 
accounting period in the prior period, together with costs of 
integration during 2016. The current period also benefits from 
post-merger synergy savings. 
Finance costs
Finance costs decreased by £25.7m from £232.7m for the 18 months 
ended 31 December 2016 to £207.0m for the year ended 31 December 
2017. The current year includes a full year’s interest on the Just Group 
plc subordinated debt, issued in October 2016, although overall 
finance costs have decreased compared to the prior period due to the 
longer accounting period in 2016.
Income tax
The income tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 
£26.2m, an effective tax rate of 14.5% (18 months ended 
31 December 2016: income tax charge of £51.3m and an effective tax 
rate of 25.8%). The effective tax rate for the current year has been 
driven by one-off adjustments to tax recognised on prior year profits.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets
Amortisation mainly relates to the value of the acquired in-force

line with the expected run-off of the in-force business. Amortisation 
of the acquired in-force business relating to Partnership Assurance 
Group plc during the year to 31 December 2017 was £14.3m (18 
month period ended 31 December 2016: £10.7m). Additionally in the 
prior period there were charges of £3.8m relating to the impairment 
of brand and property lease intangible assets.
Highlights from Condensed consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income
The table on page 30 presents the Condensed consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the Group, with key line item 
explanations. The information is extracted from the statutory 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 compared to the 18 month period ended 
31 December 2016. The 18 month period ended 31 December 2016 
includes nine months of Partnership results. 
Gross premiums written
Gross premiums written for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
£1,893.4m (18 month period ended 31 December 2016: £2,693.5m). 
The decrease between the two periods reflects the longer 
comparative accounting period. 
Net premium revenue
Net premium revenue increased slightly from £2,307.0m for the 18 
months ended 31 December 2016 to £2,343.8m for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The prior period included the impact of 
reinsurance recaptures following the restructuring of a number of 
reinsurance arrangements ahead of the commencement of Solvency 
II. The current period reflects a fall in reinsurance premiums ceded 
following the adoption of a strategy of use of longevity swaps rather 
than quota share reinsurance. 
Net investment income
Net investment income decreased from £1,616.8m for the 18 months 
ended 31 December 2016, to £621.1m for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The main components of investment income are 
interest earned and changes in fair value of the Group’s corporate 
bond, mortgage and other fixed income assets. The result for the 
comparative period reflected the impact of the falling long-term 
investment rate over the period, as well as the acquisition of 
Partnership and a longer accounting period. 
Net claims paid
Net claims paid decreased by £54.0m from £692.1m for the 18 month 
period ended 31 December 2016 to £638.1m for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The decrease from the prior period is as a result of  32
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Financial investments
Financial investments increased by £1.0bn from £17.3bn at 
31 December 2016 to £18.3bn at 31 December 2017; the increase 
being mainly a result of the continued investment of new business 
premiums into corporate bonds, gilts, loans secured by mortgages, 
and other fixed income investments. The quality of the corporate 
bond portfolio remains high, with 61% of the Group’s corporate bond 
and gilts portfolio rated A or above (31 December 2016: 62%) and is 
well balanced across a range of industry sectors. The loan-to-value 
ratio of the mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2017 was 
approximately 29% (31 December 2016: 28%).
The sector analysis of the Group’s financial investments portfolio at 
31 December 2017 is shown below and is well balanced across a 
variety of industry sectors. 
Reinsurance assets
Reinsurance assets decreased from £6.1bn at 31 December 2016 to 
£5.3bn at 31 December 2017. This reduction in the reinsurance assets 
was as a result of reinsurance recapture, and increased use of 
reinsurance swaps rather than quota share treaties following the 
introduction of Solvency II.
Other assets
Other assets mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, and 
intangible assets.
 
Insurance liabilities
Insurance liabilities increased from £15.7bn at 31 December 2016 to 
£16.6bn at 31 December 2017. The increase in liabilities arose as a 
result of new insurance business written less claims paid, and some 
reduction due to the effect of rising long-term interest rates. 
 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities decreased from £5.7bn at 31 December 2016 
to £5.0bn at 31 December 2017. These liabilities are mainly 
reinsurance-related and include deposits received from reinsurers, 
reinsurance financing and other reinsurance-related balances. The 
change in the financial liability reflects the liabilities arising on new 
business written during the period, offset by claims paid, reinsurance 
recapture and the effect of rising long-term interest rates in the period. 
Insurance and other payables
Insurance and other payables decreased by £27.6m from £113.1m at 
31 December 2016 to £85.5m at 31 December 2017. This change was 
mainly due to timing differences in the settlement of investment 
transactions.
 
Other liabilities
Other liability balances decreased by £21.5m from £682.0m at 
31 December 2016 to £660.5m at 31 December 2017. These balances

Reconciliation of pro forma financial information to 
financial information for the 18 months to 31 december 2016
The comparative figures discussed in the Financial Review are the pro 
forma financial results for the calendar year to 31 December 2016 
assuming that the merger of Just Retirement and Partnership had 
taken place before the beginning of the year to 31 December 2016. 
The statutory comparative figures show the Group’s results for the  
18 months ended December 2016, including Partnership since its 
acquisition at the beginning of April 2016. In the opinion of the 
Directors, the pro forma information provides a more meaningful 
comparison for evaluating the performance of the Just Group in 2017.
Below are reconciliations between comparative pro forma adjusted 
operating profits and comparative pro forma sales to the equivalent 
comparative KPIs computed on a statutory basis. Reconciliation 
between the sales KPI and gross written premiums and the adjusted 
operating profit KPI and IFRS profit before tax, are set out in note 7 to 
the financial statements. The Board believes that adjusted operating 
profit, which excludes effects of short-term economic and investment 
changes, provides a better view of the longer-term performance and 
development of the business and aligns with the longer-term nature 
of the products. Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
Community and charity
Just has a comprehensive programme 
of community and charitable activities, 
and during 2017 we have maintained our 
extremely popular schools engagement 
programme. This gives colleagues across 
the Group the opportunity to participate in 
various activities in primary and secondary 
schools in Reigate and Tower Hamlets, 
London, including giving assistance with 
reading, developing study skills and offering 
career advice. We have continued to support 
a number of charities - this has included 
taking part in St Catherine’s Hospice 2017 
Dragon Boat Festival (with a Company 
team called “Just Oar-some”), donating 
food to Loveworks to help families who are 
experiencing food poverty, and a “Reindeer 
Run” around the City of London to raise funds 
for the London and Midlands Air Ambulances. 
Vulnerable customers
As a business we are acutely aware 
of the number of consumers who are 
potentially vulnerable, and recent FCA 
reports suggest that as many as half of 
UK consumers – more than 25 million 
people – currently show one or more 
characteristics of potential vulnerability. 
This indicates the scale of the challenge.
We are proud to sponsor the Citizens Advice 
Money Plan initiative. This initiative is 
supported by the Personal Finance Society, 
whose financial planners give up their time 
on a pro bono basis to work with Citizens 
Advice to deliver this valuable service to 
citizens across 113 bureaus across England 
and Wales. The service provides access to 
free financial guidance and information 
across a variety of topics including pensions, 
retirement planning, mortgages, equity 
release and debt. Over the last 12 months the 
Moneyplanners have helped around 600 
citizens in potentially vulnerable situations.
Looking forward
Offering greater help to vulnerable customers 
will be an important focus for our Company 
over the coming years. At the “Future of 
Ageing” conference in November, Just, in 
conjunction with the International Longevity 
Centre, launched a programme called 
“Innovating for Ageing” to bring together 
experts, innovators and groups who work to 
support vulnerable consumers to collaborate 
on future solutions. The aim is to identify 
and support the development of practical 
products and services that will address the 
challenges faced by ageing consumers at 
risk of vulnerability due to physical disability, 
illness, dementia or financial exclusion. 
This is one of a number of focused activities 
that colleagues at Just will be involved 
in during 2018, as well as more broadly 
helping people who are approaching and 
in-retirement to manage their money, 
build social and digital connections, 
maintain healthy minds and get active.
The Just brand has a strong social purpose at 
its core. Over the last year we have continued 
to strengthen and develop new ways to help 
improve the lives of people approaching 
and in retirement, with a particular focus on 
vulnerable consumers

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
1. REPORTING PERIOD
The reporting period set using a fixed year approach is 1 January 
2017 to 31 December 2017.
2. APPROACH
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors from 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
Standard Set 2017.
3. ORGANISATIONAL BOUNDARY
We have used the financial control approach to identify the GHG 
emissions for which Just Group have responsibility. The boundaries 
of the reported emissions comprise all UK offices and building 
related emissions including business travel, covering car, train and 
flights (long haul and domestic).
4. OPERATIONAL SCOPES
We have measured our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and significant 
Scope 3 emissions.
5. TARGETS
Just Group have set annual targets in accordance with the 
recommendations that are included within our ESOS Energy Pack, 
which has been submitted to the Environment Agency.
6. INTENSITY MEASUREMENT
We use both a financial emissions intensity metric (tonnes of 
CO 2 e per £m revenue) and an employee intensity metric (tonnes 
of CO 2 e per employee) to normalise our data and provide useful 
performance indicators. Since our revenue is largely relative to our 
business activity levels with our clients (which in turn influences our 
level of business travel and revenue growth), these are the most 
appropriate and useful intensity measurements for our sector.
7. APPROACH TO ASSURANCE
Alphacello Ltd conduct an annual review of Just Group’s data 
collation and calculation processes and provide verification of their 
GHG Emissions Statement.
8. CARBON OFFSETS
At present, carbon offsets do not form part of our carbon mitigation 
strategy. We are currently implementing energy saving initiatives 
throughout our buildings as a result of our ESOS report. This includes 
updating out of date air conditioning units and the installation of 
energy efficient LED lighting. The building we occupy in London uses 
photovoltaic cells to generate renewable energy.
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. These sources fall within 
our consolidated financial statement.
We do not have responsibility for any 
emission sources that are not included in our 
consolidated statement. 
We have used the Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and emission 
factors from UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, 
expiry 31 July 2018.
We have identified relevant activity data for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions with the support 
of independent consultants, Alphacello Ltd. 
Data from all emission sources has been 
collected and the validity and completeness 
of the dataset was verified by Alphacello Ltd.
Greenhouse gas emissions are measured  
in units of tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (“tCO
2
e”) which is a standard  
unit used to express the impact of each 
different greenhouse gas in terms of the 
amount of CO
2
 that would create the same  
amount of warming.
We remain committed to reducing  
the environmental impact of our  
business and are now reporting  
as one entity, Just Group plc

Chairman’s introduction to Governance
I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Corporate Governance Report for 
the period to 31 December 2017
The Group Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance in Just and demonstrates this commitment by the way in 
which it conducts business and carries out its responsibilities in 
response to the challenges and opportunities of a changing market. 
The Board focuses primarily upon strategy, policy, governance and 
performance, acting in accordance with the best interests of the 
shareholders as a whole. It also approves the Group strategy, oversees 
the allocation of resources and monitors the Group’s performance. 
The Board decisions aim to link the Group’s strategy, its governance, 
and risk appetite to the pursuit of sustainable profit growth over the 
longer term for the benefit of all stakeholders. We lead the 
development of a governance framework that promotes 
transparency, accountability and challenge as the fundamental 
underlying principles for the Board’s entrepreneurial and prudent 
approach to developing Just’s business. 
This year has been a year of considerable change and challenge. In 
particular, the Group has been deeply engaged with regulatory 
matters and a number of significant issues for both the Group and the 
industry have been raised by the PRA’s implementation of 
Solvency II. Like others in the industry, we have put considerable 
effort into ensuring that we have effective dialogue with industry 
regulators to ensure our Group is understood and well placed to 
compete in markets and deliver good outcomes for consumers. 
Much of the Board time has been engaged with the business plan, 
including deep discussions about the nature of the business that the 
Group should be pursuing. This has resulted in highly satisfying 
financial outcomes. The Board continually addresses the themes of 
customers, distribution channels, pricing and risk. This is a business 
that is continually investing to develop our existing markets, and to 
positively disrupt new markets where we believe our Group can 
deliver better outcomes for customers. We are also focused on 
diversifying our portfolio.

Board composition and succession planning
During the year James Fraser and Peter Catterall retired from the 
Board before the Annual General Meeting. I would like to record my 
thanks to both James and Peter for their valuable contribution to the 
Board during their tenure. Tom Cross Brown has also announced his 
intention to retire at the forthcoming AGM. Succession planning was a 
focus of the Nomination Committee at both the Board and senior 
management level.
Diversity
Last year, I undertook to take an active role in overseeing a 
programme driven by the Nomination Committee to ensure that 
progress was made in achieving the Group’s diversity goals. 
Particularly, the female representation on the Board, the Executive 
Committee and the direct reports to the Executive Committee. You 
can read more about my and the Committee’s work in this area in the 
Nomination Committee report on page 48.
CULTURE
The Group has continued its investment in the culture of the 
organisation. The programme to develop and implement the new Just 
brand has been a beacon for change and we are building on this 
positive momentum with colleagues, customers and all our 
stakeholders to ensure there is a clarity on what being ‘Just’ means. We 
are driven by a strong underlying belief in fairness. Everybody deserves 
to be treated fairly and with integrity, particularly in retirement, and 
this principle underpins our actions, which ultimately “champion the 
customer”. We have been accredited as “one to watch” in The Sunday 
Times Best Companies to Work For 2017 survey. 
evaluation
In 2017, Just Group engaged Lintstock to facilitate an evaluation of 
the performance of the Board of Directors. Lintstock is an advisory 
firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no other 
connection with the Group.
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the 
Chairman and Company Secretary to set the context for the 
evaluation, and to tailor survey content to the specific circumstances 
of Just Group. All Board members and the Company Secretary were 
then invited to complete an online survey addressing the 
performance of the Board, its Committees, and the Chairman, as well 
as their own individual contribution to the Board. The anonymity of 
the Board members was ensured throughout the process in order to 
promote an open and frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following 
areas of Board performance:
• The appropriateness of the Board’s composition was assessed, 
and Board members were asked to identify any changes that 
ought to be made to the profile of the Board over the next 3 - 5 
years.
• The Board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders, and of 
the products and services which the Company offers, was 
considered. The Board’s oversight of digital issues facing the 
Group, and the culture and behaviours throughout the 
organisation, was also reviewed.
• The relationships between Board members and management, 
and the atmosphere in and management of Board meetings, 
were assessed, as was the quality of the Board packs and 
management presentations.
• The effectiveness of the Board in making decisions and monitoring 
their implementation was considered, and Board members were 
asked to identify any areas upon which they feel the Board should 
spend more or less time focusing over the coming year.
• The Board’s oversight of strategy and progress against each of the 
Company’s strategic objectives was considered, as was the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s capacity to deliver the strategy. The 
Board members’ views as to the top strategic issues facing the 
Company were also identified.
• The Board’s focus on risk was assessed, as was the appropriateness 
of the Group’s structure at senior levels and the adequacy of 
succession plans for members of top management. Board 
members were asked to consider the top human resources 
priorities facing the Company over the coming years.
Lintstock produced a report on the Board and Committee evaluations 
that was circulated to all Board and Committee members and 
discussed at a Group Board meeting, together with a review of the 
2016 action points. An action plan was drawn up by the Chairman 
and Company Secretary for the Board and Committees and agreed 
with the relevant Chair. Progress against these actions will be 
reviewed during the year.
Investor Relations Activity 2017
The Group maintains an on-going dialogue with its major institutional 
shareholders through a scheduled programme of meetings which are 
generally undertaken by the CEO and/or CFO. Ad hoc one-to-one 
meetings are held throughout the year with both existing and 
prospective shareholders, in addition to managing on-going queries. 
The Investor Relations function also provides the Board with regular 
analysis of shareholder movements, market and peer activity, in 
addition to share price performance.
Analysts’ and brokers’ reports are made available to all Directors, 
while the executive Directors receive anonymous feedback via our 
corporate brokers following investor meetings. After its October 2016 
Capital Markets Day, the Group Investor Relations function continued 
to increase its engagement with fund managers and research 
analysts throughout 2017. During the year, we hosted shareholders 
and analysts for three teach-in seminars focused on the market 
opportunity, and the Group’s unique positioning within the key 
Defined Benefit De-risking, Guaranteed Income for Life and Lifetime 
Mortgage product lines. In addition to the three seminars, Just Group 
attended five investor conferences, and held investor roadshows for 
equity investors in January, March and September. 
Subsequent to the issuance of £250m of Tier 2 subordinated debt in 
October 2016, in August 2017, we were delighted to announce that 
members of the Group had been assigned inaugural A/A+ credit 
ratings with Stable outlook by Fitch. During 2017, we had an active 
programme of engagement with debt investors at investor 
conferences, in addition to a dedicated debt investor roadshow. 
Access to debt capital markets provides further optionality and 
flexibility to the Group’s future capital planning process. Since the 
year end in February 2018, the Group issued a £230m BBB rated 
Solvency II Tier 3 qualifying instrument at par with a maturity date of 
February 2025 and coupon of 3.5%, which has further reduced the 
Group’s cost of capital.
In 2017, two international investment banks initiated coverage, 
bringing the total to ten analysts. The Investor Relations team also 
maintains an open dialogue with non-covering analysts, banks, 
brokers and other market participants. 
As the year progressed, Just Group plc’s shares increased by 14% to 
170.4p (as of 31 December 2017), compared to the FTSE 350 life 
insurance index which was up 13.3% during 2017. The Senior 
Independent Director is available for consultation by shareholders if 
they have concerns which are inappropriate to raise with the 
Chairman, CEO or other Executive Directors. Further information for 
shareholders is included on page 131. 44

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board with the discharge of 
its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting, internal and 
external audits, including reviewing the Group’s annual financial 
statements, reviewing and monitoring the scope of the annual audit 
and the extent of the non-audit work undertaken by external 
auditors, advising on the appointment of external auditors and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit activities, internal 
controls and risk management systems in place within the Group. The 
Audit Committee will normally meet not less than four times a year 
and is chaired by Paul Bishop.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee recommends what policy the Group 
should adopt on executive remuneration and, within the terms of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by the shareholders at the 
AGM in May 2017, determines the remuneration benefits, pension 
rights and compensation payments for all Solvency II staff, the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors of the Company, the Chief Actuary, 
the Group Company Secretary, the members of the Executive 
Committee and any other employees of the Group for when the 
Committee determines it will have oversight as agreed by the Board 
from time to time. The Remuneration Committee will also generate 
an annual remuneration report to be approved by the members of 
the Group at the AGM. The Remuneration Committee will normally 
meet not less than twice a year and is chaired by Ian Cormack.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in determining the 
composition and make-up of the Board. It reviews the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company provided 
by the Directors, with the aim of ensuring the Board has the 
capabilities necessary to deliver its responsibilities for business 
strategy and governance. The Committee determines succession plans 
for the Chairman and the CEO. It will normally meet not less than twice 
a year and is chaired by Chris Gibson-Smith. The Nomination 
Committee actively supports the Board on the principle of improving 
gender balance in the boardroom. Further information about the 
Board’s policy on diversity is given on page 48.
Group Risk and Compliance Committee
The Group Risk and Compliance Committee is principally responsible 
for assisting the Board and other members of the Group in the 
discharge of their risk and regulatory oversight responsibilities. The 
Committee reviews and challenges the overall effectiveness of the 
Group’s regulatory systems and controls, risk management and 
future developments. It also provides advice on regulatory and risk 
strategies including oversight of current risk exposures and the 
Solvency II internal model. The Committee will normally meet not 
less than four times a year and is chaired by Keith Nicholson. 
Investment Committees 
The Investment Committees of the Board of Just Retirement Limited 
(“JRL”) and Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited (“PLACL”) 
assist the Boards in achieving their investment objectives. The 
Investment Committees are responsible for reviewing and overseeing 
the implementation of JRL and PLACL’s investment policy, including 
the performance of the investment portfolio, recommending the 
appointment and assessing the performance of the external 
investment managers, and the effectiveness of reporting procedures. 
The Investment Committees will normally meet not less than four 
times a year and is chaired by Michael Deakin. 
The Market Disclosure Committee oversees the disclosure of 
information by the Company to meet its obligations under the Market 
Abuse Regulation (“MAR”), and to ensure that decisions in relation 
to those obligations can be made quickly. The Committee’s role is 
to determine whether information is inside information, when such 
information needs to be disclosed and whether any announcements 
are required. Other responsibilities include reviewing and approving 
announcements concerning developments in Just’s business and 
monitoring compliance with the Group’s MAR disclosure controls and 
procedures. Its members comprise Tom Cross Brown (Chair), Rodney 
Cook, Chris Gibson-Smith, Keith Nicholson, David Richardson and 
Simon Thomas.
The Allotment Committee has responsibility for overseeing the 
allotment and listing of new ordinary shares in the Company in 
accordance with the Company’s executive incentive plans and 
employee share plans. Its members comprise any two Directors, 
one of whom must be a Non-Executive Director.
Board responsibilities and operation
The Group Board is responsible for the proper management of Just’s 
Group strategy and direction, including its risk appetite. It also 
oversees the activities and direction of JRL and PLACL and the Group’s 
other operating subsidiaries. There are 11 Board members: the 
Chairman (independent on appointment), three Executive and seven 
Non-Executive Directors (all of whom are considered independent). 
Keith Nicholson is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 46
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Corporate Governance Report continued
The Board considers that the Non-Executive Directors Paul Bishop, 
Tom Cross Brown, Ian Cormack, Michael Deakin, Steve Melcher, Keith 
Nicholson and Clare Spottiswoode are each independent of 
management in character, judgement and opinion. The Board 
benefits from the wide range of sector experience of its Non–
Executive Directors. Biographical details of all Directors are given on 
pages 38 to 41.
The Board believes that documented roles and responsibilities for 
Directors, with a clear division of key responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer, are essential elements 
in the Group’s governance framework and facilitate the effective 
operation of the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the effective leadership and 
governance of the Board but takes no part in the day-to-day running 
of the business. His key responsibilities include:
• leading the Board effectively to ensure it is primarily focused on 
strategy, performance, value creation and accountability; 
• ensuring the Board determines the significant risks the Group is 
willing to embrace in the implementation of its strategy; 
• leading the succession planning process and chairing the 
Nomination Committee; 
• encouraging all Directors to contribute fully to Board discussions 
and ensuring that sufficient challenge applies to major proposals;
• fostering relationships within the Board and providing a sounding 
board for the CEO on important business issues; 
• identifying development needs for the Board and Directors;
• leading the process for evaluating the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and individual Directors; and
• ensuring effective communication with major shareholders.
The CEO is responsible for leadership of the Group’s business and 
managing it within the authorities delegated by the Board. His key 
responsibilities include:
• proposing and developing the Group’s strategy and significant 
commercial initiatives; 
• leading the executive team in the day-to-day running of the 
Group; 
• ensuring the Group’s operations are in accordance with the 
business plan approved by the Board, including the Board’s overall 
risk appetite, the policies established by the Board, and applicable 
laws and regulations;
• representation of the Group’s interests in the UK and abroad; 
• maintaining dialogue with the Chairman on important business 
and strategy issues; 
• recommending budgets and forecasts for Board approval;
• providing recommendations to the Remuneration Committee on 
remuneration strategy for Executive Directors and other senior 
management; and
• leading the communication programme with shareholders and 
ensuring the appropriate and timely disclosure of information to 
the stock market.
As the Senior Independent Director, Keith Nicholson provides a 
sounding board for the Chairman, and serves as an intermediary for 
the other Directors when necessary. The Senior Independent Director 
will also meet annually with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Chairman being present to approve the Chairman’s performance, and 
address any other matters which the Directors might wish to raise. 
The Senior Independent Director conveys the outcome of their 
discussions to the Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors of the 
Board will meet at least twice per year without the Executive 
Directors being present. 
Decisions on operational matters are delegated to the Executive 
Directors under documented policies and procedures. 
In advance of scheduled Board meetings, each Director receives 
documentation providing updates on the Group’s strategy, finances, 
operations and development, and which have reference to a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for Board approval, which includes:
• the Group’s business strategy and risk appetite;
• business strategy plans and objectives, budgets and forecasts;
• extension of the Group’s activities into new business or geographic 
areas; 
• changes in capital structure and any form of fundraising;
• major changes to the Group’s corporate structure, including 
reorganisations, acquisitions, disposals and major capital projects;
• the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management;
• changes to the membership of the Board; 
• interim and annual financial statements; and
• dividend policy.
The Board held 8 meetings during the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. The table below shows Directors’ attendance at Board 
and Committee meetings for the period.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Governance
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
believes that it has the appropriate balance of skills, expertise, 
independence and knowledge to enable it and its Committees to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively. 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are subject to review every 
three years. Their letters of appointment set out the expected time 
commitment, recognising the need for availability in exceptional 
circumstances, and request that the Board is informed of any 
subsequent changes in their other significant commitments. None of 
the Executive Directors hold a Non-Executive Directorship in a FTSE 
100 company. All Directors’ appointments are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders.
A Group policy and process is in place to address possible conflicts of 
interest of Directors. Any relevant conflicts and potential conflicts 
with the interests of the Company that arise must be disclosed 
at the next Board meeting for consideration and, if appropriate, 
authorisation by relevant Board members in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles. 
The Board has established a broad risk governance and management 
framework, which is designed to provide control and oversight over 
the management of all financial and non-financial risks. The Group 
operates a ‘‘Three Lines of Defence’’ model. The first line of defence 
is line management who devise and operate the controls over the 
business. The second line functions are Risk Management and 
Compliance, which oversee the first line, ensure that the system 
of controls are sufficient and are operated appropriately, and also 
measure and report on risk to the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee. The third line is Internal Audit who provide independent 
assurance to the Board and its Committees that the first and second 
lines are operating appropriately.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness and 
monitoring of the Group’s systems of internal control, covering all 
material financial, operational and compliance controls, and for 
undertaking an annual review of the control systems in place, while 
the implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility of 
management. The Group’s systems of internal control are designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material financial misstatement. The Group’s 
internal control systems comprise the following key features:
• establishment of clear and detailed terms of reference for the 
Board and each of its Committees;
• a clear organisational structure, with documented delegation of 
authority from the Board to senior management;
• a Group policy framework, which sets out risk management and 
control standards for the Group’s operations; and
• defined procedures for the approval of major transactions and 
capital allocation.
It is the view of the Board that the Group’s internal controls are 
appropriate to the Group’s needs at this time. Internal controls are 
kept under review by the Board and its Committees and the Board is 
committed to maintaining standards of internal controls that are in 
line with industry practice, the Group’s needs and regulatory regimes, 
in particular the requirements of the PRA and FCA.
All new Directors receive formal induction on joining the Board and 
a tailored training plan. Their induction includes discussions with the 
Chairman and Executive Directors as well as one-to-one briefings 
and presentations from senior management on matters relating to 
the Group’s business, its procedures and regulatory developments. 
As part of the annual Board effectiveness review, the Chairman 
discusses with each of the Directors their training and development 
needs.
Directors may seek independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense where they consider it appropriate in relation to 
their duties. All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Group Company Secretary.
The role of the Group Company Secretary is to support the Chairman 
and the Board, which includes bringing all governance matters to the 
attention of the Board and delivering a programme of Board and 
Committee meetings, training and senior management presentations 
to ensure that each Director has the information required to 
discharge their statutory duties.

Nomination Committee Report
Statement from the Nomination Committee Chairman
I am pleased to present the 
Nomination Committee Report 
covering our work in 2017
This year the Board has become fully established, whilst continuing to 
see a streamlining of its membership and that of the executive team. 
In May, both James Fraser and Peter Catterall, at that time principal 
shareholders through Permira and Cinven, left the Board. Tom Cross 
Brown, Deputy Chairman, has confirmed his intention to retire from 
the Board at the 2018 AGM.
Following the successful implementation of the merger five 
executives, below Board level, who had previously indicated their 
intention to do so, exited the business. 
Accordingly, the focus of the Nomination Committee has been on 
executive development, succession planning, and the development of 
the Board’s skills and diversity.
We are in the progress of recruiting an additional female Non-
Executive Director. This process is now at an advanced phase and will 
be followed by an appointment announcement in due course.
Committee members
The Committee is comprised of six Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The members are Paul Bishop, Tom Cross Brown, Ian 
Cormack, Michael Deakin, Keith Nicholson and myself. 
Role of the Committee 
The role of the Nomination Committee is to keep under review the 
leadership needs of the Company, and regularly review the size and 
composition of the Board, where appropriate making 
recommendations for the orderly succession of Executive and 
Non-Executive Director appointments, and the progressive refreshing 
of the Board and its Committees. In assisting and advising the Board, 
the Committee seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of skills, 
knowledge, independence, experience and diversity on the Board, 
taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the 
Group. 
The Committee meets at least twice a year, and the CEO and Group 
Human Resources Director are normally invited to attend meetings. 
The Group Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. 
Members’ biographies are set out on pages 38 to 41. 
The Committee’s duties are explained in more detail in its terms 
of reference which are available on the Group’s website at  
www.justgroupplc.co.uk. 
Executive development programme and CEO succession 
planning
In setting out the succession plan for his executive team, the CEO 
provided an account to the Nomination Committee of his vision for 
the future structure and evolution of the management team.
The Committee reviewed the succession plans and contingency 
arrangements that were in place and the bench strength of the 
executive team.
To assess their potential and development needs, each member of 
the executive team took part in a Korn Ferry led assessment in 
October/November 2017 against a role profile which described the 
competencies, skills and experiences required for a Just Group 
executive. Highlights were reported to the Committee at the end of 
November 2017. This review recognised that there was some 
exceptional talent within the business and was followed up by a Korn 
Ferry “deep dive” exercise and feedback provided to each executive. 
The exercise included identifying individuals suitable to be considered 
for CEO succession planning purposes. 
Just has put in place a structured development programme for all 
members of the executive team. Some executives have business 
coaches and all have attended a number of professional development 
type events both in-house and externally.
APPOINTMENTS POLICY AND PROCESS
When considering Board appointments the Board follows formal and 
transparent procedures to ensure that appointments of Directors are 
made having regard to a broad set of qualities and competences to 
fulfil the requirements of the role and to promote diversity among 
Board members. The Committee has discussed at some length the 
need for new strategies and behaviours not only among the Board 
but across all parts of the business, to improve diversity. 
Whilst the statistics had been adversely impacted by the merger and 
the decision to locate more roles in Reigate, it is the case that women 
are underrepresented at senior levels generally. We acknowledge 
that the Group’s current diversity position is lagging behind other 
financial service companies in both the Board and executive team 
make up. A challenge further down the business had been identified 
with emerging talent with lower than desired diversity in bands 
reporting to the executive team. A diversity and inclusion programme 
is addressing these challenges. 
The Deputy CEO has been designated as the executive sponsor and 
diversity champion for the Group. Within this framework we are 
considering other measures of cultural diversity which is the focus of 
the Parker Report, such as educational background and wider 
experience. 
The Committee is sponsoring a number of initiatives to identify key 
female, black and minority ethnic (“BME”) talent below executive 
level. A leadership programme was launched in Q2 and a talent 
programme was launched in Q3. The Committee has signed up to the 
Women in Finance Charter as a good way of demonstrating that 
commitment both internally and externally. The Group will also be 
mindful of findings of the BME talent initiative led by Department for 
Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in its Diversity and Inclusion 
programme strategy. 
The Committee has amended its appointments policy and process to 
promote greater diversity in the composition of the Board and 
improve in particular the gender balance. It is currently reviewing the 
process and actions necessary to put in place a diversity policy which 
best supports the business and promotes the success of the 
Company. The current recruitment process begins by evaluating the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience of its existing members, 
the diversity of the Board and the on-going requirements and 
strategic developments of the Group. The search process is then able 
to focus on appointing a candidate that will complement and 
enhance the Board’s effectiveness and overall performance. 
The Committee uses the services of search firms to identify 
appropriate candidates. The Committee will only use those firms that  49
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Governance
have adopted the voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender 
diversity and best practice in search assignments. Korn Ferry has 
been retained during the current reporting period. It has also been 
retained to facilitate the executive development programme. 
A “long list” of potential appointees is reviewed followed by the 
shortlisting of candidates for interview based upon the objective 
criteria set out in the agreed role specification. Non-Executive 
appointees must be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient 
time available to devote to the role and prior to appointment all 
prospective Directors must identify whether they have any potential 
conflicts of interest.
Shortlisted appointees are interviewed by the Chairman, other 
Committee Members and the CEO. The Committee recommends a 
preferred candidate who is invited to meet other Board members. 
Finally, detailed external references are taken and following  
this the Committee makes a formal recommendation to the  
Board for appointment. 
The Nomination Committee has met formally on three occasions 
during the period and considered in addition to the succession plans 
set out above:
• the proposed changes to the Board;
• the effectiveness review of the Board, its Committees, the 
Chairman and individual Directors which was conducted through 
an externally facilitated process;
• keeping under review the independence of Non-Executive 
Directors, considering the judgement, thinking and constructive 
challenge that they demonstrate in Board and Committee 
discussions;
• recommending to the Board that each of the Directors be 
proposed for election by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 17 May 2018. The Committee made this 
recommendation having considered the balance of abilities and 
experience required of both Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors, and on the basis that all Non-Executive 
Directors, whether independent or not, continue to demonstrate 
the personal qualities necessary to contribute to the leadership 
of the Company; and
• over the coming year, the Committee will focus on Board 
succession planning, progressing the diversity and inclusion 
programme and talent development.

Audit Committee Report
Statement from the Audit Committee Chairman
I am pleased to report on the 
activities discharged by the 
Committee during 2017 
The Committee worked with executive management to continue 
improving the appropriateness of the financial reporting and 
effectiveness of the internal controls. 
Having conducted a thorough review of the significant financial 
judgements and financial statement assumptions made in 
preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts of Board and 
Committee papers and minutes, and of the Annual Report and 
Accounts themselves, the Committee is satisfied that the judgements 
and assumptions are appropriate and that the Annual Report and 
Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Committee continued to oversee the preparation and review of 
the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (“SFCR”) as at 
31 December 2016 and the Quantitative Reporting Templates for the 
PRA submission in June 2017. It also provided oversight of the project 
work in preparation for the implementation of new standard IFRS 17. 
The Committee invited to its meetings members of the Executive 
team and other senior managers to present reports on their areas of 
responsibility and provided effective challenge and debate. The 
external auditor was also invited to the meetings to report on its work 
and had direct access to myself and the Committee to raise any 
concerns. As Chairman, I also held regular one-to-one meetings with 
the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the 
Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Actuary, the Group 
Regulatory and Audit Director, and the external Audit Partner, to 
ensure that all significant areas of internal controls, including 
financial reporting controls, were given appropriate consideration.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s key role is to provide effective governance and 
assurance over the Group’s financial reporting, the performance 
of the internal audit function, the external auditor, and the 
management of the Group’s systems of internal controls and related 
compliance activities.
The Audit Committee is focused on the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reports and internal control framework. The Audit 
Committee liaises closely with the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee through some cross-membership and close cooperation 
of the Chairmen, which ensures that audit work is focused on higher 
risk areas and that the results of internal and external audit work can 
be used to inform the work of the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee.
Committee composition
The Committee members have been selected with the aim of 
providing the wide range of financial and commercial expertise 
necessary to fulfil the Committee’s duties and include appropriate 
life insurance accounting expertise. The Board considers that the 
Committee Chairman has recent and relevant financial experience 
as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”).
The Committee is chaired by Paul Bishop and its members are Steve 
Melcher, Keith Nicholson and Clare Spottiswoode.
Summary of meetings during the year
The Committee held six formal meetings and two Working Group 
meetings during the year. The matters covered, relating to the 
Group’s financial reporting, external audit, and internal audit are as 
follows:
Financial reporting and actuarial assurance
• The Group’s Annual Report and Interim Reports.
• The assumptions critical to assessing the value of assets and 
liabilities, in particular technical provisions and Lifetime Mortgages 
(“LTMs”).
• Other key issues including the going concern basis, longer term 
viability assessment and the accounting for goodwill and 
intangibles.
• The annual plan from the actuarial assurance team and regular 
reports on progress and results.
• Regular updates on regulatory matters which impact the Group’s 
Solvency II reporting.
External audit
• Regular reports from the external auditor including meetings with 
the audit engagement partner without the presence of 
management.
• The 2017 year end audit work plan including the scope of the audit 
and the materiality levels adopted by the auditor.
• The independence of the external auditor including approval for 
the use of non-audit services provided by them.
• The effectiveness of the audit process.
• The reappointment, remuneration and terms of engagement 
letter of the external auditor.
Internal audit 
• The annual plan from the Group Regulatory and Audit Director, 
regular updates on internal audit work carried out and his end of 
year report.  51
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Governance
2017 financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting 
is to review with both management and the external auditor the 
appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements 
concentrating on, amongst other matters:
• the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
• the appropriateness and clarity of the disclosures and compliance 
with financial reporting standards and relevant financial and 
governance reporting requirements;
• material areas in which significant judgements have been applied 
or there has been discussion with the external auditor; and
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
To aid our review, the Committee considers reports from the Group 
Chief Financial Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Actuary, and it reviews reports from the external auditor on 
the outcomes of their half-year review and year end audit. As a 
Committee we encourage the external auditor in displaying the 
necessary professional scepticism its role requires.
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee in 
relation to the 2017 accounts, and how these were addressed, were:
The discount rate used to calculate the Group’s insurance liabilities, 
reinsurance assets and deposits from reinsurers
The return on bond assets is adjusted for valuation purposes for 
insurance liabilities, reinsurance assets and deposits from reinsurers 
to allow for credit risk for each bond by considering the “spread” – the 
difference between the gross redemption yield and the yield on an 
equivalent duration “risk-free” reference instrument. The Group sets 
the credit risk as a fixed minimum component plus a percentage of 
the spread, calibrated significantly in excess of historic default rates, 
which are provided by the leading rating agencies. The return on 
equity release assets is adjusted to allow for the risks associated with 
these assets – namely, the potential shortfall resulting from the 
No-Negative Equity Guarantee (“NNEG”). The Group calculates the 
shortfall in respect of the NNEG using a variant of the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. Inputs required (e.g. current house prices, 
future house price growth and house price volatility) are derived from 
available market data.
Longevity assumptions
The length of time the Group’s Retirement Income customers and 
Lifetime Mortgage holders will live and therefore the projected cash 
flows for Retirement Income and mortgage assets are key 
assumptions when setting the Group’s insurance liabilities and fair 
value of lifetime mortgages. Longevity experience is a key area of 
focus for the Board, and the Committee, and the Board receives 
regular reports on the actual against expected number of deaths and 
the likely causes, by condition, of any positive or negative divergence 
as well as the output of industry studies such as CMI 2016. Following 
the merger of Just Retirement and Partnership, the Company is 
undertaking a comprehensive review of Retirement Income customer 
longevity which will be completed during 2018. 
The property assumptions used to value the Group’s equity  
release assets
The value of the Group’s lifetime mortgages, are reliant on a range of 
assumptions as to future house price growth and the volatility of 
house prices which determine the expected shortfall on redemption 
in respect of the NNEG which is given to all mortgagees.
The Committee addresses both the methodology underpinning these 
valuations and their calibration by reviewing and challenging the 
detailed analysis and recommendations put forward by the Group 
Deputy Chief Executive Officer in the year end and interim basis 
papers, which are also reviewed by the external auditor as part of 
their audit. Where appropriate, the Committee will also seek views of 
external experts and advisers.
Just Group plc’s investment in subsidiaries
In addition to considering matters relating to the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group, the Committee also considers 
matters relating to the individual Company financial statements of 
Just Group plc and its subsidiaries.
Just Group plc’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is a significant 
asset and underpins the net equity reported by Just Group plc in its 
individual Parent Company financial statements. The carrying value 
of this asset is assessed through consideration of the financial 
position and performance of the underlying subsidiary companies, 
including their net asset position and planned trading performance. 
The Committee reviews these assessments, the recoverability of the 
balances reported and appropriateness of accounting policies, as part 
of its work on financial reporting.
regulatory reporting oversight
The Committee receives regular updates on the Group’s regulatory 
reporting matters including the oversight and preparation of the 
Group’s annual Solvency and Financial Condition Report, and 
Quantitative Reporting Templates. The Committee also receives 
regular updates relating to the on-going publication by the Prudential 
Regulation Authority of supervisory statements that set out its 
expectations for certain aspects of prudential regulation. The Audit 
Committee also has responsibility for overseeing the recalculation of 
TMTP. During 2017 the implementation of Solvency II in practice has 
continued to evolve and is expected to do so in the future. The 
emergence of new supervisory statements could impact certain key 
non-GAAP measures disclosed in the Annual Report and Acccounts 
and is closely monitored by the Committee to ensure disclosures are 
appropriate.
External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on 
appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. We 
receive a detailed audit plan from KPMG, identifying its assessment 
of these key risks. For the 2017 reporting period the primary risks 
identified were in relation to the valuation of insurance liabilities, 
equity release asset valuation, reinsurance assets and liabilities and 
the recoverability of Just Group plc’s investment in its subsidiaries. We 
challenged the work done by the auditor to test management’s 
assumptions and estimates around these areas. We assess the 
effectiveness of the audit process in addressing these matters 
through the reporting we receive from KPMG at the interim and year 
end. In addition, we also seek feedback from management on the 
effectiveness of the audit process. For the 2017 reporting period, 
management were satisfied that there had been appropriate focus 
and challenge on the primary areas of audit risk and assessed the 
quality of the audit process to be good. The Audit Committee 
concurred with the view of management. 52
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Auditor independence
The Committee believes that the independence of the external 
auditor is one of the primary safeguards for shareholders. The 
Committee reviewed audit independence and the scope of non-audit 
services and independence safeguards with KPMG. As part of this 
review, the Committee has received and reviewed written 
confirmation that, in KPMG’s professional judgement, KPMG is 
independent within the meaning of all UK regulatory and professional 
requirements and the objectivity of the audit engagement partner 
and audit staff is not impaired.
An analysis of auditor remuneration is shown in note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The Committee was satisfied 
throughout the year that the objectivity and independence of KPMG 
was not in any way impaired by the nature of the non-audit services 
undertaken during the year, the level of non-audit fees charged or 
any other facts or circumstances. The Group has a policy on the 
provision by the external auditor of audit and non-audit services, and 
during 2017, KPMG was paid £1.0m for non-audit services. These 
services related to the audit of the Group’s Solvency II regulatory 
returns, half year review procedures, and due diligence and reporting 
accountant services. This amount is significantly lower than the prior 
period, which included significant costs associated with the 
acquisition of Partnership (non-audit services for the 18 month period 
ended 31 December 2016: £2.5m). 
Audit tender and tenure of external auditor
The appointment of KPMG as the Group’s external auditor is kept 
under review. KPMG has audited Just Retirement Limited, a public 
interest entity, since the 2006 year end. 
As described in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 2016, a 
formal audit tender process was completed during 2016. 
In line with audit partner rotation rules, a new audit engagement 
partner was appointed in 2017 following the rotation of the previous 
audit engagement partner after the 31 December 2016 audit, at which 
point he had served five years as lead audit partner for the Group.
The Committee has approved KPMG’s remuneration and terms of 
engagement and is fully satisfied, following a review, with the 
performance, objectivity, quality of challenge and independence of 
the external auditor. 
The Committee will review the tenure of the auditor in 2018,  
and will continue to comply with the Code and extant regulations  
on audit tendering.
The Committee believes that, when a tender takes place, those asked 
to tender should have an equal chance of being appointed auditor. 
The Company therefore intends, where appropriate, to use audit firms 
other than KPMG for non-audit services so that relationships are 
enhanced with those firms capable of performing the role of external 
auditor. The Committee will seek, with management, to ensure that 
there are no contractual obligations which restrict the Committee’s 
choice of auditor.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining 
the Group’s systems of internal control. The Audit Committee  
keeps under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. 
The Committee has reviewed and is satisfied as to the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control systems based on reports from the 
Head of Internal Audit and the Group Chief Financial Officer.
Internal audit
Monitoring and review of the scope, extent and effectiveness of the 
activity of the Group Internal Audit department is an agenda item at 
each Committee meeting. The Committee considers and approves 
the internal audit plan annually and looks to ensure its alignment 
with the external audit and the Group’s risk management approach. 
Reports from the Head of Internal Audit include updates on audit 
activities, progress of the internal audit plan, the results of any 
unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these areas. 
The Committee reviews the resource requirements of the Internal 
Audit department and is satisfied that it has the appropriate 
resources identified. An effectiveness review of Internal Audit is 
carried out every three to five years. The Committee held private 
discussions with the Head of Internal Audit as necessary during the 
year. The Committee Chairman also meets with him regularly outside 
the formal committee process, approves his performance appraisal, 
and sets his annual objectives.

Group Risk and Compliance Committee Report
Statement from the group Risk and Compliance Committee 
Chairman
I am pleased to report on the Group 
Risk and Compliance Committee’s 
activities during 2017
The Committee has supported the Board by providing leadership, 
direction and oversight of the Group’s overall risk appetite, its risk 
management framework and conduct risk. In doing so, the 
Committee has played a key role in delivering effective oversight of 
the risks inherent in the business. In addition, the Committee has 
been responsible for reviewing the Group’s Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment and the Solvency II Internal Model and recommending 
to the Board the Group’s regulatory and internal control policies and 
procedures and the compliance monitoring plan.
Roles and responsibilities 
The Committee’s key roles and responsibilities include the review and 
recommendation to the Board of the Group’s overall risk appetite, 
strategy, monitoring the overall effectiveness of the risk management 
framework, governance, and compliance activity within the Group. In 
reviewing the Group’s risk exposures, it ensures that these are 
adequately mitigated by the risk methodologies and management’s 
actions. The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the 
appropriateness of the Internal Model related to the implementation 
of the Solvency II regime requirements and for recommending any 
changes to the Model to the Board. In this regard it established a 
sub-committee to provide a more flexible forum in which to consider 
emerging developments.
Committee composition
The Committee is chaired by Keith Nicholson, and its members are 
Chris Gibson-Smith, Ian Cormack, Clare Spottiswoode, Tom Cross 
Brown and Steve Melcher. All members, including the Chairman of the 
Committee, are Non-Executive Directors. Regular attendees include 
both Executive and other Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Investment Committee of 
the life companies of the Group, the Group Chief Executive Officer, the 
Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Risk Officer, the 
Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Actuary and the Group 
Regulatory and Audit Director are regular attendees of the 
Committee. Senior managers are also invited to attend the meetings 
to report as appropriate on their areas of responsibility. 
The Committee has a standing agenda based on the annual cycle of 
business covering all areas of its responsibility. The Chairman of the 
Committee also holds regular one-to-one meetings with the Group 
Chief Risk Officer and the Group Regulatory and Audit Director to 
ensure that all significant areas of risk are considered. 
Summary of meetings during the period
The Committee met formally on seven occasions and the sub-
committee met formally on five occasions during the year. Additional 
meetings to brief other Directors on progress of the internal model 
were also held on an ad hoc basis. The main areas considered and 
activities undertaken by the Committee related to:
Risk governance
The Committee ensured that the risk framework continued to develop 
in line with the business needs, ensuring that policies and practices 
were kept up to date, and that the risk appetite, against which the 
business plan and strategy are assessed, remained appropriate. In 
particular, it reviewed the frameworks for legal risk and strategic risk. 
It also reviewed and approved the risk management plan for the year, 
and commissioned and reviewed a report into the effectiveness of 
risk management.
Risk oversight
The Committee regularly reviewed and challenged management’s 
view of the developing risk and capital outlook for the Group by 
considering the Own Risk and Solvency reports and updates provided 
to it. The emerging risks from Brexit were given special consideration, 
particularly in relation to the outlook for the economy and the 
property market in the UK, and also for potential implications of 
Brexit on the Group’s Belfast operations. The Committee maintained 
oversight of the risks to and arising from the integration programme, 
and has followed the associated integration activity through to 
its establishment in business as usual. As part of a programme of 
deep dives it commissioned reports on longevity risk, lifetime 
mortgaging underwriting risk, liquidity risk and the risk of price 
competition in lifetime mortgages. 
Capital adequacy
The Committee considers the adequacy of the capital resources of 
the Group against both the regulatory capital and the underlying 
economic risks to the business.
In considering the appropriateness of regulatory capital, the 
Committee monitors the methodology and assumptions underlying 
the Internal Model and the operation of the matching adjustment. It 
also ensured that management was appropriately interpreting and 
implementing the application of Solvency II in accordance with the 
emerging policy of the Prudential Regulation Authority (as set out in 
the publication of supervisory statements including those relating to 
illiquid assets, matching adjustments and transitional provisions). To 
support it in this activity it reviewed the conclusions of internal and 
externally commissioned reports. 
The Committee also commissioned external support to stress-test 
the adequacy of the Group’s resources to pay claims in a number 
of stringent economic scenarios, including those specified for  
the banking sector by the Bank of England, and was satisfied with 
the results.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Business resilience
The Committee reviewed and endorsed plans for strengthened 
measures in managing private information, in order to ensure 
compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). 
The Committee also considered reports presented by the Group Chief 
Digital Information Officer on the current business practices in 
respect of IT, operations and cyber issues, and endorsed plans to 
further develop information security and business resilience.
Conduct
The Committee regularly reviews and challenges management’s view 
of conduct across the Group. The risk to appropriate customer 
outcomes is considered against a dashboard of measures in general 
and against the quality of advice provided by advisers in the HUB 
business and the number and cause of complaints arising within the 
Group in particular. The Committee also reviews and approves the 
plan for monitoring compliance with law, regulation and policies 
across the Group and receives and challenges the results of those 
compliance reviews.

Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee’s  
report for the year ended  
31 December 2017 
The Committee’s report is presented in the following sections:
1. this summary statement outlines the key decisions made by the 
Committee during the year;
2. the Directors’ Remuneration Policy on pages 58 to 62, which was 
approved at the 2017 AGM. This describes the key components of 
our remuneration packages and the approach for each 
component; and 
3. the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 63 to 72, which 
describes how the Committee applied the Remuneration Policy. 
A new feature of our report this year is the inclusion of an “at a 
glance” section, which now follows this statement. The purpose is to 
summarise key features of the Committee’s report in a concise format 
focusing on relevant highlights, full details of which can be found 
later in the longer report. 
 
The strategic context
The strategy for the Group is set out in the Strategic Report and 
focuses on creating long-term value for our shareholders, through 
consolidating our position in our core markets and delivering growth 
and diversification through new business, thereby delivering a 
sustainable growth in profit. A full outline of the strategy can be 
found on page 16.
1. Remuneration in 2017
Adapting our remuneration programme to a unified structure was the 
primary focus for the Committee’s 2017 work. 2017 saw the first full 
financial year of the Company operating as Just Group plc. This 
meant, unlike 2016, the year of the merger, when the Committee had 
to take into account the differences in financial reporting 
arrangements (an 18 month reporting period was shown in the 2016 
remuneration report) and different remuneration practices, it now 
operates one Remuneration Policy and uses a 12 month financial 
calendar for performance measurement. In section 3 of this report, 
where comparisons of 2016 to 2017 are made, the 18 month 
reporting period to 31 December 2016 is included for completeness.
At the AGM in May 2017, a binding vote approved our new 
Remuneration Policy which reflected developments in markets and 
good remuneration practice, with the key changes being:
• replacement of ‘adjusted operating profit’ with ‘adjusted earnings 
per share’ as a performance target for future awards made under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”);
• the introduction of a two year post-vesting holding period for 
future awards made under the LTIP; and
• an increase in the share ownership guidelines to 200% of salary 
for all Executive Directors.
Remuneration practices in 2017 were focused primarily on 
implementing the new Remuneration Policy for the Group and 
reviewing the remuneration arrangements of senior employees 
including our three Executive Directors, an outline of which is 
described below:
Base salary increases for 2017 
Salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed with effect from 1 April 
each year along with those of the general employee population. As 
disclosed last year at the time of the AGM the salaries of the three 
Executive Directors had not yet been determined. Following the AGM, 
the Committee reviewed the salaries of our senior employees 
including our three Executive Directors. In light of the performance of 
the Executive Directors in leading the successful integration of the 
two Companies following the merger in 2016 and the resulting 
increased size and complexity of the Group, which has grown on 
merger from total assets of £11.2bn to £24.2bn and from 769 
employees to 1,108 as at 31 December 2017: an increase of 6.3% was 
awarded to Rodney Cook, 6.1% to Simon Thomas and 2.2% to David 
Richardson. For context, this compares with a range of 0% to 4% for 
other employees. Following these increases, the salaries of the 
Executive Directors are now at what the Committee believes to be an 
appropriate current market level.
Short Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”)
Pages 64 to 65 detail the targets and outcomes relating to 2017 as 
well as remuneration received relating to the year. For performance in 
2017 the Committee approved awards for the Executive Directors at 
maximum level for the financial measures reflecting the strong 
financial performance of the Group. For the non-financial 
performance element, the performance of each of the Executive 
Directors was also close to their maximum, which in combination 
resulted in bonuses of between 91.7% and 95% of the maximum 
being awarded. In line with the policy, two-thirds of bonus earned 
was paid post-tax in cash and one-third deferred into shares for three 
years. The Committee is satisfied that this level of bonus payout is 
reflective of the financial performance delivered and the significant 
progress made against the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
As explained in last year’s report, the aggregate value of awards 
granted to the former Executive Directors of Just Retirement was 
greater than the level that might normally be expected under the 
Policy in an 18 month period. This was a result of the change to the 
Company’s year end from 30 June to 31 December and corresponding 
change to the timing of annual long-term incentive grants in 2016. 
The Committee, when determining award levels for the grant of the 
2017 LTIP, has sought to ensure that, when considered over the 30 
month period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2017, the aggregate 
level of awards granted is appropriate. Following shareholder 
approval of a change to one of the Long Term Incentive Plan 
measures, awards for 2017 were made to a small number of senior 
employees and to the Executive Directors of between 128% and 170% 
of base salary.
The awards made in 2014, under the Just Retirement Long Term 
Incentive Plan, vested in September 2017. The Remuneration 
Committee agreed that for 50% of the award, subject to TSR 
performance, targets were not met, and that 50% of the award 
subject to the adjusted operating profit targets were met, resulting in 
commensurate vesting; further detail can be found on page 65.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”)
Awards made under the Just Retirement Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
i.e. those awards which had been deferred as part of the Short Term 
Incentive Plan in 2014 also vested in September 2017. These do not 
have performance conditions and the Committee approved the 
vesting in full of these awards. 
 
On-going review of policy 
The Committee is aware of the external remuneration environment, 
including shareholder’s views, and the wider competitiveness of 
remuneration against the market. In the next 12 months it will 
continue to review the Remuneration Policy to ensure it remains both 
appropriate and relevant to the business. Particular areas of focus will 
be the balance of financial and non-financial measures for our LTIP.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2018
In recognition of the performance the Group has achieved, the 
Remuneration Committee agreed that a salary review would take 
place with effect from 1 April 2018. The level of increases for the 
Executive Directors and senior management and that for the general 
employee population was broadly 2.4%. Executive Directors received 
salary increments in line with the wider employee base. Maximum 
annual bonus opportunity will continue to be 150% of base salary for 
all Executive Directors and will be subject to stretching corporate 
financial and personal non-financial measures. The Committee 
intends to grant LTIP awards to the CEO of up to 200% of base salary 
and for the Deputy CEO and CFO, up to 150% of base salary. Awards 
will be assessed against TSR and adjusted EPS measures. See the  
“at a glance” section for more detail. 
I hope that you will be able to support the resolution in the Annual 
Report at the forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
2. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the Group’s Remuneration Policy for its Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Policy has been 
developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, guidelines from major investors and guidance from the UK 
regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), on best practice. The Policy was approved 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. A full copy of the Policy can be found on page 67 of last year’s report. For reference, we have included the key 
elements of the Policy below.
Remuneration components
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation (including framework used to assess performance) Opportunity
Base salary
Provides a competitive and 
appropriate level of basic 
fixed pay to help recruit and 
retain Directors of a 
sufficiently high calibre.
Reflects an individual’s 
experience, performance 
and responsibilities within 
the Group.
Set at a level which provides a fair reward for the 
role and which is competitive amongst relevant 
peers.
Normally reviewed annually with any changes 
taking effect from 1 April.
Set taking into consideration individual and Group 
performance, the responsibilities and 
accountabilities of each role, the experience of 
each individual, his or her marketability and the 
Group’s key dependencies on the individual.
Reference is also made to salary levels amongst 
relevant insurance peers and other companies of 
equivalent size and complexity.
The Committee considers the impact of any basic 
salary increase on the total remuneration package. 
There is no formal maximum; 
however, increases will normally 
be in line with the general 
increase for the broader 
employee population. More 
significant increases may be 
awarded from time to time to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role and change 
in position or responsibility.
Current salary levels are 
disclosed in the “at a glance” 
section. 
Benefits
Provides competitive, 
appropriate and cost-
effective benefits.
Each Executive Director currently receives an 
annual benefits allowance in lieu of pension, car, 
private medical insurance and other benefits. Each 
Executive Director also receives life assurance and 
permanent health insurance.
The benefits provided may be subject to minor 
amendment from time to time by the Committee 
within this Policy.
The Group operates a money purchase pension 
scheme into which Directors may elect to pay part 
of their benefits allowance as a company 
contribution, having regard to government limits 
on both annual amounts and lifetime allowances.
The benefits allowance is 
subject to an annual cap of 15% 
of base salary plus £20,000, 
although this may be subject to 
minor amendment to reflect 
changes in market rates.
The cost of the other insurance 
benefits varies from year to year 
and there is no prescribed 
maximum limit. However, the 
Committee monitors annually 
the overall cost of the benefits 
provided to ensure that it 
remains appropriate. 59

Governance
Remuneration components
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation (including framework used to assess performance) Opportunity
Short Term 
incentive 
plan (“STIP”)
Incentivises the execution 
of annual goals by driving 
and rewarding performance 
against individual and 
corporate targets.
Compulsory deferral of a 
proportion into Group 
shares provides alignment 
with shareholders.
Paid annually, any bonus under the STIP is 
discretionary and subject to achievement of a 
combination of stretching corporate financial and 
personal non-financial performance measures. 
Corporate measures normally determine at least 
two-thirds of the STIP opportunity.
One-third (or such higher proportion as has been 
determined by the Committee) of any bonus earned 
will be deferred into awards over shares under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan, with awards normally 
vesting after a three year period.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
deferral percentage if required to comply with 
future regulatory requirements relevant to the 
insurance industry.
The Committee has the authority to apply a malus 
adjustment to all, or a portion of, an outstanding 
award in specific circumstances. The Committee 
also has the authority to recover (clawback) all, or a 
portion of, amounts already paid in specific 
circumstances and within a defined timeframe. 
These provisions apply to both the cash and 
deferred elements of the STIP.
The on-target bonus payable to 
Executive Directors is 75% of 
base salary with 150% of base 
salary the maximum payable.
The bonus payable at the 
minimum level of performance 
varies from year to year and is 
dependent on the degree of 
stretch and the absolute level of 
budgeted profit.
Dividends will accrue on DSBP 
awards over the vesting period 
and be paid out either as cash or 
as shares on vesting and in 
respect of the number of shares 
that have vested.
Long Term 
incentive 
plan (“LTIP”)
Rewards the achievement 
of sustained long-term 
financial and operational 
performance and is 
therefore aligned with the 
delivery of value to 
shareholders.
Facilitates share ownership 
to provide further alignment 
with shareholders.
Granting of annual awards 
aids retention.
Annual awards of performance shares normally 
vest after three years subject to performance 
conditions and continued service. Performance is 
normally tested over a period of at least three 
financial years. 
Awards are normally subject to an absolute 
financial growth measure and Total Shareholder 
Return relative to the constituents of a relevant 
comparator index or peer group. 
25% vests at threshold under the financial growth 
measure. 25% vests at median for the relative TSR 
condition. There is straight-line vesting for 
performance between threshold and maximum.
Different performance measures and/or weightings 
may be applied for future awards as appropriate. 
However, the Committee will consult in advance 
with major shareholders prior to any significant 
changes being made.
The Committee has the authority to apply a malus 
adjustment to all, or a portion, of an outstanding 
award in specific circumstances. The Committee 
also has the authority to recover (clawback) all, or a 
portion of, amounts already paid in specific 
circumstances and within a defined timeframe. 
A post-vesting holding period will apply to Executive 
Directors for awards made in 2018 and beyond. 
Executive Directors are required to retain the LTIP 
shares that vest (net of tax and NICs) for a period of 
two years. The two year holding requirement will 
continue if they leave employment during the 
holding period. The shares held will count towards 
the Executive Director’s normal holding 
requirement.
The maximum opportunity is 
250% of base salary. However, 
the normal policy is that awards 
made to the CEO and other 
Executive Directors are 200% 
and 150% of base salary 
respectively.
Dividends will accrue on LTIP 
awards over the vesting period 
and be paid out either as cash or 
as shares on vesting and in 
respect of the number of shares 
that have vested. 60

policy figures have been used in the charts above.

All-employee 
share plans
Encourages employee share 
ownership and therefore 
increases alignment with 
shareholders.
The Group may from time to time operate 
tax-approved share plans (such as HMRC-approved 
Save As You Earn Share Option Plan and Share 
Incentive Plan) for which Executive Directors could 
be eligible.
The schemes are subject to the 
limits set by HMRC from time to 
time.
Shareholding 
guideline
Encourages Executive 
Directors to build a 
meaningful shareholding in 
the Group so as to further 
align interests with 
shareholders.
Each Executive Director must build up and maintain 
a shareholding in the Group equivalent to 200% of 
base salary.
Until the guideline is met, Executive Directors are 
required to retain 50% of any LTIP or DSBP awards 
that vest (or are exercised), net of tax and NICs.
Not applicable.
1 Awards may be structured as nil-cost options which will be exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
Illustration of the 2018 Remuneration Policy
Under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, a significant proportion of 
total remuneration is linked to Group performance. The following 
charts illustrate how the Executive Directors’ total pay package varies 
under three different performance scenarios: fixed pay only, on-target 
and at maximum. These charts are indicative, as share price 
movement and dividend accrual have been excluded. All assumptions 
made are noted below.
Assumptions:
• Minimum = fixed pay only (salary + benefits allowance)
• On-target = fixed pay plus 50% payout of the maximum STIP 
opportunity and 25% of maximum LTIP award
1
• Maximum = fixed pay plus 100% or maximum payout of the STIP 
and LTIP awards
1
The Executive Directors can participate in any all-employee share 
schemes on the same basis as other employees. The value that may 
be received under these schemes is subject to tax-approved limits. 
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in 
these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.
Remuneration policy on recruitment or promotion
Remuneration package on appointment 
The on-going remuneration package for a new Executive Director 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy at the time of 
appointment and the maximum limits set out therein.
Salaries may be set at a below-market level initially with a view to 
increasing them to the market rate, subject to individual performance 
and developing into the role, by making phased above-inflation 
increases.
Maximum opportunity under the incentive plans 
Currently, for an Executive Director, STIP payments will not exceed 
150% of base salary and LTIP payments will not normally exceed 
200% of base salary (not including any arrangements to replace 
forfeited entitlements).
Where necessary, specific STIP and LTIP targets may be introduced 
for an individual for the first year of appointment if it is appropriate to 
do so to reflect the individual’s responsibilities and the point in the 
year at which they joined the Board.
Payments beyond the Remuneration Policy
The Committee retains flexibility to offer additional cash and/or 
share-based awards on appointment to take account of 
remuneration or benefit arrangements forfeited by an Executive 
Director on leaving a previous employer. If shares are used, such 
awards may be made under the terms of the LTIP or as permitted 
under the Listing Rules.
Such payments would take into account the nature of awards 
forfeited and would reflect (as far as possible) performance 
conditions, attributed expected value and the time over which they 
would have vested or been paid.
The Committee may agree that the Group will meet certain 
relocation, legal, tax equalisation and any other incidental expenses 
as appropriate, so as to enable the recruitment of the best people 
including those who need to relocate.
Internal appointments
In the case of an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed  
to pay out according to its terms, and adjusted as relevant to take  
into account the appointment. In addition, any other on-going 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 61

Governance
Executive Directors’ terms of employment and loss of office
Service agreements and notice periods
The Executive Directors have entered into service agreements with an 
indefinite term that may be terminated by either party on six months’ 
written notice. Contracts for new appointments will be terminable by 
either party on a maximum of six months’ written notice.
An Executive Director’s service contract may be terminated 
summarily without notice and without any further payment or 
compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, 
if they are deemed to be guilty of gross misconduct or for any other 
material breach of the obligations under their employment contract.
The Group may suspend an Executive Director or put them on a period of 
garden leave during which they will be entitled to salary and benefits.
If the employment of an Executive Director is terminated in other 
circumstances, compensation is limited to base salary due for any 
unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Committee 
as representing the value of other contractual benefits which would 
have been received during the period. At the Company’s discretion a 
payment in lieu of notice (“PILON”) may be made. Such PILON 
payments will normally be phased and subject to mitigation. The 
Group may choose to continue providing some benefits instead of 
paying a cash sum representing their cost.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in 
connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the 
Committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of 
outplacement services) would be paid as necessary.
Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at 
the Group’s registered office during normal business hours and will be 
available for inspection at the AGM.
STIP
There will be no automatic entitlement to a bonus if an Executive 
Director has ceased employment or is under notice on the last day of 
the financial year. However, the Committee may at its discretion pay 
a pro-rated bonus in respect of the proportion of the financial year 
worked. Such payment could be payable in cash and not subject to 
deferral. The Committee retains authority to apply a clawback 
adjustment to all, or a portion of the payment.
 
LTIP and DSBP
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under 
the Group’s share plans will be treated in accordance with the 
relevant plan rules. Usually, any outstanding awards lapse on 
cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, 
retirement with the consent of the Committee, the sale of the entity 
that employs him/her out of the Group, or any other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied.
For good leavers under the LTIP, outstanding awards will vest at the 
original vesting date to the extent that the performance condition 
has been satisfied and be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the 
period of time which has elapsed between the grant date and the 
date on which the participant ceases to be employed by the Group. 
The Committee retains the discretion to vest awards (and measure 
performance accordingly) on cessation and disapply time pro-rating; 
however, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. For good leavers under the DSBP, unvested awards will 
usually vest in full upon cessation.
In determining whether a departing Executive Director should be 
treated as a good leaver, the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the business unit/Group over 
the whole period of employment and the reasons for the 
individual’s departure.
Treatment of outstanding share awards if there is a takeover or other 
corporate event
The treatment of outstanding awards on a takeover (or other 
corporate event such as a demerger, delisting, special dividend or 
other event which, in the opinion of the Committee, may affect the 
current or future value of shares) mirrors that set out above in 
relation to a good leaver (albeit with the vesting period automatically 
ending on the date of the relevant event).
Alternatively, the Committee may permit or, in the case of an internal 
reorganisation or if the Board so determines, require both LTIP and 
DSBP awards to be exchanged for equivalent awards which relate to 
shares in a different company.
External directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one external 
appointment with the prior approval of the Chairman and where 
there is no impact on their role with the Group. The Board will 
determine on a case-by-case basis whether the Executive Directors 
will be permitted to retain any fees arising from such appointments, 
details of which will be provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section.
Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) 
Appointment letters 
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the 
Group for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election 
by the Group at a general meeting. Directors’ letters of appointment 
are available for inspection at the registered office of the Group 
during normal business hours and will be available for inspection  
at the AGM.
The Chairman’s appointment may be terminated by either party with 
six months’ notice. It may also be terminated at any time if he is 
removed as a Director by resolution at a general meeting or pursuant 
to the Articles, provided that in such circumstances the Group will 
(except where the removal is by reason of his misconduct) pay the 
Chairman an amount in lieu of his fees for the unexpired portion of his 
notice period.
The appointment of each Non-Executive Director may be terminated 
at any time with immediate effect if he/she is removed as a Director 
by resolution at a general meeting or pursuant to the Articles. The 
Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are not entitled to 
receive any compensation on termination of their appointment.
Recruitment policy on appointment of a new Chairman or Non-
Executive Director
For a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement 
would be set in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy in 
force at that time. 62

3. Annual Report on Remuneration
This report describes the details of the Remuneration Policy for our Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors and sets out how this Policy 
has been used and, accordingly, the amounts paid relating to the year ended 31 December 2017.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the FCA’s Listing Rules and The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended. The report has also been prepared in line with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Various disclosures of the detailed information about the Directors’ remuneration set out below have been audited by the Group’s independent 
auditor, KPMG LLP.
Total remuneration – Executive Director single figure (audited)
In line with regulatory requirements, the total remuneration table contained within the Annual Report on Remuneration section covers the 
financial period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. As we are required to do so by the regulations, the single figure includes the value of 
long-term awards vesting in respect of the financial year within the single figure table. Therefore, pre-merger LTIP plans for Just Retirement 
awarded in 2014 (for Rodney Cook and Simon Thomas) and Partnership Assurance (David Richardson) are included. The latter had a 
performance period ending 31 December 2016 but vested in 2017. As mentioned in the Remuneration Chairman’s statement, the tables below 
show a 12 month comparison with the 12 month period from 1 January to 31 December 2016, and also as required by law with the original 18 
month financial reporting period as shown in the 2016 Remuneration Report. Information for the 12 month period from 1 January to 
31 December 2016 is unaudited.

1 One-third of bonus payments have been deferred into awards over shares under the DSBP and will vest after three years.
2 Awards were made under the LTIP in the period and the respective values will be reported on vesting in the respective Annual Report on Remuneration section.
3 All-employee share plans includes the value of SAYE and SIP awards that vest after three or five years for SAYE, and three years for SIP.
4 Benefits include Executive allowance for which the Executives can purchase their own benefits, for example a pension or private medical cover.
5 Benefits for Rodney Cook includes a taxable cash payment of £32,500 for reimbursement of holiday which had to be cancelled to deal with urgent Company business. This 
is in line with Company policy for employees in similar circumstances,
6 Figures for David Richardson represent a 9 month period as he was appointed an Executive Director on 4 April 2016. Included is the actual vest value of £108,104 relating to 
20% vesting of the Partnership Assurance LTIP 2015 for the performance period ended 31 December 2016, the terms of which were set out in the merger agreement. An 
estimated value of this award was omitted in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
7 The cost of private medical insurance for Simon Thomas in the 18 month period to 31 December 2016 was paid via the benefit allowance and should not have been added 
to the benefit total. Accordingly, the 18 month period figure of £111,118 reported in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report has been restated.
8 At the time of the IPO 2013, and under the same terms as other employees, Executive Directors received the opportunity to subscribe for free Company shares, which 
vested in June 2016 and November 2016 respectively, three years from grant. This was omitted in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report.  64

Risk consideration 
The Committee reviewed a comprehensive report from the Group Chief Risk Officer to ascertain that the Executive Directors’ objectives had 
been fulfilled within the risk appetite of the Group. In addition, the Committee received feedback from the Group Regulatory Risk and 
Compliance function and from the Group Legal Counsel that there were no material issues to consider around regulatory breaches, customer 
outcomes or litigation that would prevent payment of any STIP award or trigger any malus. The Committee was satisfied that the STIP awards 
should be paid.

Vesting of LTIP awards with a performance period ending in 2017 (audited)
The 2014 Just Retirement LTIP award vested at 50% in September 2017 based on award measures of adjusted operating profit (“OP”) and 
relative TSR over the three year period ending 30th June 2017 (see tables below). As previously disclosed to shareholders, operating profit 
performance was measured from the year ending 30 June 2015 as operating profit from the year ended 30 June 2014 was considered by the 
Committee to be an inappropriate base from which to measure growth in light of the changes to the previous annuity market announced in the 
budget for that year. In line with the policy, the Committee considered the pre and post-merger performance of the companies, including risk 
considerations, and saw no reason not to allow the LTIP to vest in accordance with the performance conditions.
At grant, the end of performance period for the 2014 award was intended to be the three financial years from the year ended 30 June 2014. The 
change to the Company’s financial year, which resulted in an 18 month financial reporting period from 30 June 2015 to 31 December 2016, 
would have resulted in a 42 month performance period which ended after the vesting date of the awards. The Committee therefore determined 
that performance should be measured over the original 36 month period. In order to measure OP growth to 30 June 2017, pro forma OP figures 
for the half year to 31 December 2016 and the half year to 30 June 2017 were combined as shown in the table below.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
2017 LTIP awards granted ( audited)
As outlined in last year’s report, in order to take account of the change to the Company’s year end from 30 June to 31 December, the 
Remuneration Committee reviewed the timing of the annual grant of long-term incentive awards, bringing forward the grant of the 2016 
awards from November to April 2016. As a result of this and the change of timing in the grant of awards, the aggregate value of awards granted 
to the former Executive Directors of Just Retirement was greater than the level that might normally be expected under the Policy in an 18 
month period. The Committee was aware that this situation was anomalous and when determining award levels for the grant of the 2017 LTIP 
ensured that, when considered over the 30 month period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2017, the aggregate level of awards granted is 
appropriate. As a result, the following awards were made:

1 Awards were granted at a share price of 130.52p, being the average of the middle-market quotations of shares over the five consecutive dealing days immediately prior to 
the date of grant.
2 Half of the award is subject to growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) performance target. If the adjusted EPS growth target for the 12 months ending 
31 December 2019 exceeds the adjusted EPS growth target for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 by 6% p.a. (equivalent to 19.1% cumulative growth), 25% of the 
award will vest. The award will vest in full for growth of 12% p.a. (equivalent to 40.5% cumulative growth) with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points. No 
award will vest if cumulative growth is below 19.1%. Half of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers). Vesting of 25% of these awards will occur for median performance and the maximum 100% will vest for 
upper quartile performance or above, with straight-line vesting between these points. None of these awards will vest if TSR is below the median. 
Directors’ shareholding guidelines ( audited)
To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, each Executive Director must build up and maintain a shareholding in the 
Group equivalent to 200% of base salary, in line with the Policy. Until the guideline is met, Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of any 
LTIP and DSBP share awards that vest (or are exercised), net of tax and NICs.

1 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in September 2014 was based half on adjusted operating profit growth and half on relative TSR performance as described earlier in this 
report.
2 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in November 2015 is based half on adjusted operating profit growth and half on relative TSR performance. Half of the award is subject to 
growth in the Group’s adjusted operating profit. If adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 30 June 2018 exceeds adjusted operating profit for the financial year 
ending 30 June 2015 by 7.5% p.a. (equivalent to 24.2% cumulative growth), 25% of the award will vest. The award will vest in full for growth of 15% p.a. (equivalent to 52% 
cumulative growth) with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points. No award will vest if cumulative growth is below 24.2%. Half of the award is subject to TSR 
performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts). Vesting of 25% of these awards will occur for median performance 
and the maximum 100% will vest for upper quartile performance or above, with straight-line vesting between these points. None of these awards will vest if TSR is below 
the median.
3 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in April and September 2016 is based 25% adjusted operating profit growth, 50% on relative TSR performance and 25% cost-synergy 
targets. 25% of the award is subject to growth in the Group’s adjusted operating profit. If adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 31 December 2018 exceeds 
adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 31 December 2015 by 9% p.a. (equivalent to 29.5% cumulative growth), 25% of the award will vest. The award will vest 
in full for growth of 15% p.a. (equivalent to 52% cumulative growth) with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points. No award will be made if cumulative growth 
is below 29.5%. 50% of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts, mining 
companies and oil and gas producers). Vesting of 25% of these awards will occur for median performance and the maximum 100% will vest for upper quartile performance 
or above, with straight-line vesting between these points. None of these awards will vest if TSR is below the median. 25% of the award is subject to cost-synergy targets. 
Where the Company’s total pre-tax realised cost savings per annum over the performance period are at £40m, the Annual Synergy Saving Performance percentage shall 
be 25% (threshold). The Committee has set the 100% vesting level at a stretching target which is above the £45m advised to the market. Between each point, intermediate 
results shall be calculated by interpolation.
4 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in May 2017 is based half on growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) and half on relative TSR performance as described 
earlier in this report.
5 These were issued in Partnership Assurance Group plc and converted into the Just Group plc scheme on acquisition at 4 April 2016. 
6 Dividend shares are included in the SIP total.
The closing share price of the Group’s ordinary share price at 31 December 2017 was £1.704 and the closing price range from the start of the 
financial year to the year end was £1.215 to £1.704.
 
Dilution 
The Committee supports the Investment Association guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors the Group’s compliance with these 
requirements. Assuming that all awards made under the Group’s share plans vest in full, the Group has utilised 2.15% of the 10% in ten years’ 
dilution limit and 1.68% of the 5% in ten years’ dilution limit.

2016) and its other members are Chris Gibson-Smith (appointed on 4 April 2016), Michael Deakin (appointed on 23 March 2015), and Steve 
Melcher (appointed on 4 April 2016). 
The terms of reference are available on the Company website. The focus of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy for 
the whole Company as well as the Executive Directors.
The key activities of the Committee during the year include:
• Reviewing and approving the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• Approving of the grant of the 2017 awards and performance conditions under the Long Term Incentive Plan;
• Assessing the performance of Executive Directors against the 2017 corporate financial and personal non-financial performance targets set 
for the annual bonus and approving the payments;
• Review of the Company’s Gender Pay Gap data; and 
• Monitoring the developments in the corporate governance environment and investor expectations.
External assistance provided to the Committee
New Bridge Street (“NBS”), part of Aon plc, is retained as the independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee. NBS has no other connection 
with the Group and provides no other services to the Group. 
NBS has been appointed by the Committee to provide advice and information. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of 
Conduct, which requires that its advice be objective and impartial. The Committee will review annually the performance and independence of 
its advisers.
The total fees paid to NBS for providing advice and information related to remuneration and employee share plans to the Committee during the 
year were £104,920. The fees charged are predominantly charged on a “time spent” basis.
Internal assistance provided to the Committee

Shareholder views
The Group values and is committed to dialogue with its shareholders. The Committee will consider investor feedback and the voting results 
received in relation to relevant AGM resolutions each year. In addition, the Committee will engage proactively with shareholders, and will 
ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance where any material changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy are proposed. During the 
year, the Committee consulted with shareholders in relation to 2017 salary increases and the grant of the 2017 long-term incentive awards.
Remuneration for employees below the Board 
General Remuneration Policy 
The Remuneration Policy for the wider Group is designed to attract, retain and motivate new and existing employees. It is in line with the sector 
in which we operate and our overall total remuneration approach is to pay a market competitive level of remuneration that is structured to 
appropriately reward employees, align them with the interests of our shareholders, customers and be relevant to the markets/geographies in 
which we operate. We define total remuneration as base salary, annual incentive (STIP), and any benefits, for example pension. For those 
eligible to participate in the LTIP this will also be included.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 71
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Governance
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Executive Director 
Remuneration element Policy approach 
Base Salary 
To attract and retain key employees we pay salaries which deliver market competitive total remuneration. We 
take into account the following when determining the base salary: the size of the role, and its scope, the required 
skills, knowledge and experience, relevant pay in terms of the wider organisation and appropriate market 
comparative data. For 2017 the salary average increase for all employees was set at 2.5%. This is an average 
figure, with individual increases varying within a range depending on the factors above.
Short term 
incentive plan 
(“STIP”)
Most of our employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan, for example in 
relation to sales roles, is in operation. This plan is based on the achievement of corporate (Company) 
performance and personal performance, the latter is based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and 
conduct in the role. For regulated roles, for example in risk, audit or compliance roles, an element of the financial 
performance may be replaced by functional performance. The Group also operates bonus plans for certain types 
of roles, for example sales, based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and conduct in the role. The 
Remuneration Committee has the ultimate discretion on all incentive plans and these are reviewed on an annual 
basis. Bonuses for all of the Executive team who are not Board members have an element of bonus deferred into 
shares for three years. 
Long term 
Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
Participation in the LTIP is for a small number of executives and key roles each year in recognition of the strategic 
and critical roles that they hold in supporting the strategic direction of the business and delivering Company 
performance. In 2017 fewer than 50 people were granted awards. 
Other Share Plans
The Company operates a deferred share bonus plan (“DSBP”) which provides the vehicle for the deferral of the 
STIP award. 
Pension 
All employees are provided with the opportunity to participate in the Group defined contribution pension plan. 
Other Benefits
All employees are able to participate in the private medical cover scheme.
Group’s share performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index
This graph shows a comparison of the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (share price growth plus dividends paid) with that of the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding investment trusts, mining companies, and oil and gas producers). The Group has selected this index as it comprises 
companies of a comparable size and complexity and provides a good indication of the Group’s relative performance. The FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers) is also included as it is the comparator group used for the 2014 
PSP award that vested during the year under review.

statements for Just Group plc (“Just”), registered in England & Wales 
No: 8568957, for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Overview
The Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. These 
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future statements. 
Rather they are based on current views and assumptions and involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may 
cause actual results to differ from any future results or developments 
expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Each 
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of that 
particular statement.
The Directors’ Report of the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2017 is set out on pages 73 to 76 inclusive. Additional information 
which is incorporated by reference into this Directors’ Report,

Both the Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report have been drawn 
up and presented in accordance with, and in reliance upon, applicable 
English company law. The liabilities of the Directors in connection 
with those reports shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions 
provided by such law.
The Company does not have any overseas branches within the 
meaning of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern and viability statement
The Directors are required to assess the prospect of the Group as a 
going concern over the next 12 months, and also its longer-term 
viability in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016.
Going concern
Under the annotated version of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors are required to state whether in their assessment the 
business is a going concern. In considering this requirement, the 
Directors have taken into account the following:
• The Group plan, which was approved by the Board in the first 
quarter of 2018, and in particular the forecast regulatory solvency 
position calculated on a Solvency II basis.
• The findings of the August 2017 Group Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (“ORSA”), and in particular sensitivity to the most 
significant risks faced by the Group as referred to on pages 19 to 
23 of this report.
• The projected liquidity position of the Group as at 31 December 
2017, current financing arrangements and contingent liabilities. 
Having due regard to these matters and after making appropriate 
enquiries, the Directors confirm that they consider it appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.
Viability statement
The Directors also confirm that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as 
they fall due, over the next five years. The Directors have carried out  
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity, and make this assessment with reference to the 
risk appetite of the Board and the processes and controls in place to 
mitigate the principal risks and uncertainties as detailed in the 
Strategic Report. 
The Group undertakes stress and scenario testing to consider the 
Group’s capacity to respond to a series of relevant financial, 
insurance, changes to financial regulations, or operational shocks 
should future circumstances or events differ from current 
assumptions. The review also considers mitigating actions available 
to the Group should an extreme stress scenario occur.
The Directors note that the Group is subject to the Prudential 
Regulatory Regime for Insurance Groups which monitors the Group’s 
compliance with Solvency Capital Requirements. While the Directors 
have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a 
longer period, given the inherent uncertainty which increases as 
longer time frames are considered, the Directors consider five years 
to be an appropriate time frame upon which they can report with a 
reasonable degree of confidence. A five year time frame has been 
selected for this statement, although the Group, as with any 
insurance group, has policyholder liabilities in excess of five years and 
therefore performs its modelling and stress and scenario testing on 
timeframes extending to the expected settlement of these liabilities, 
with results reported in the Group’s ORSA.
Results and dividend 
The financial statements set out the results of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and are shown on page 85. 
The first interim dividend for the year of 1.17 pence per ordinary share 
was paid on 24 November 2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 3 November 2017 (2016: first and second interim 
dividends of 1.1 pence per share). 
The Directors are recommending a final dividend for the year of 2.55 
pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend, 
makes a total dividend for the period of 3.72 pence (2016: 3.5 pence) 
per ordinary share. Subject to approval by shareholders of the 
recommended final dividend, the dividend award to shareholders for 
2017 will total £34.8m. If approved, the Company will pay the final 
dividend on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 4 May 2018.

shareholders may by special resolution, remove any Director before 
the expiration of that Director’s period of office.
Copies of Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non-
Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available to 
shareholders for inspection at the Company’s registered office and at 
the AGM. Details of the Directors’ remuneration and service contracts 
and their interests in the shares of the Company are included in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which is set out on pages 55 to 72. 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The statements describing how the Company has applied the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) are set 
out in the Company’s Corporate Governance Report on pages 42 to 47, 
and together with the information on share rights set out in note 11 
on pages 101 to 104 forms part of this Directors’ Report and is 
incorporated by reference.
The Board considers that it has complied with the provisions of the 
Code during the year and up to the date of the Directors’ Report.
The Code recommends that at least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by 
the Board to be independent in character and judgement and free 
from relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. More than half of its members 
(including the Chairman) comprised of Non-Executive Directors, are 
independent in the manner required by the Code and the Board feels 
that there is a right balance of skills and experience to support the 
Group’s challenges ahead. 
Directors’ insurance and indemnities 
The Directors and Officers of the Company benefit from an indemnity 
provision in the Company’s Articles of Association against any liability 
they may incur in relation to the Company’s affairs, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as amended. Each Director of 
the Company benefits from a deed of indemnity in respect of the 
costs of defending claims against him or her and third party liabilities 
(the terms of which are in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
as amended). Such qualifying third party indemnity provision remains 
in force at the date of this report. Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance cover was maintained throughout the year at the 
Company’s expense and remains in force at the date of this report.
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the Company had an issued share capital 
of 938,308,340 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. No shares are held in 
treasury. The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Company’s Articles specify that, subject to the authorisation of 
an appropriate resolution passed at a General Meeting of the 
Company, Directors can allot relevant securities under Section 551 of 
the Companies Act up to the aggregate nominal amount specified by 
the relevant resolution. In addition, the Articles state that the 
Directors can seek the authority of shareholders at a General Meeting 
to allot equity securities for cash, without first being required to offer 
such shares to existing ordinary shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings under Section 561 of the Companies Act, in 
connection with a rights issue and in other circumstances up to the 
aggregate nominal amount specified by the relevant resolution.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 18 May 2017, the Directors 
were (i) authorised to allot ordinary shares in the Company up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal amount of £62,194,736 and (ii) 
empowered to allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive 
basis up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4,664,605 and further 
granted an additional power to disapply pre-emption rights 
representing a further 5% only to be used in specified circumstances, 
and (iii) authorised to make market purchases of up to an aggregate 
of 93,292,104 ordinary shares, representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital as of 9 March 2017. No 
shares were purchased by the Company during the year. The Directors 
propose to renew these authorities at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting for a further year. In the year ahead, other than in respect of 
the Just Group’s ability to satisfy rights granted to employees under 
its various share-based incentive arrangements, the Directors have 
no present intention of issuing any share capital of Just Group plc.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts, to attend and speak at Company 
general meetings including the AGM, to appoint proxies and to 
exercise voting rights.
The share price on 31 December 2017 was £1.704. 
Further information relating to the Company’s issued share capital 
can be found in note 21 on page 112.
Securities carrying special rights
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights 
with regard to control of the Company. 
Restrictions on Transfer of Shares and Voting
The Company’s Articles of Association (“Articles”) do not contain any 
specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of 
shares, except that certain restrictions may from time to time be 
imposed by laws and regulations (for example by the Market Abuse 
Regulations (“MAR”) and insider trading law) or pursuant to the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain 
employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to 
deal in the Company’s ordinary shares. The Directors are not aware of 
any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
No person has any special rights with regard to the control of the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. This is a 
summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles should be 
consulted if further information is required.
Share Plans
The Group operates a number of share-based incentive plans. For 
these plans the Group can satisfy entitlements by the acquisition of 
existing shares or by the issue of new shares. Existing shares are held 
in an employee benefit trust (“EBT”). The trustee of the EBT purchases 
shares in the open market as required to enable the Group to meet 
liabilities for the issue of shares to satisfy awards that vest. The 
trustee does not register votes in respect of these shares and has 
waived the right to receive any dividends. 75

Employees
Equal opportunities employment
Just Group plc is an equal opportunities employer and decisions on 
recruitment, development, training and promotion and other 
employment related issues are made solely on the grounds of 
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. These 
principles are operated on a non-discriminatory basis, without regard 
to race, colour, nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, belief, 
gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or any other reason not 
related to job performance or prohibited by applicable law. If there 
were to be an instance of an employee becoming disabled during 
their employment with the Group, support for continued employment 
would be provided and workplace adjustments made as appropriate 
in respect of their duties and working environment.
Employee communication
We want to ensure that Just is a great place to work and 
communicating and engaging with our employees is critical to our 
success. We have a well-defined communication and engagement 
programme in place so that all employees understand our 
organisation’s goals and how we need to work together to achieve 
them. This includes regular emails to all employees, news items on 
our intranet, videos, face to face briefing sessions, breakfast 
gatherings, events and lunch and learns. We also encourage 
employees to communicate directly with each other through our 
collaboration tool, Yammer. 
We consistently monitor the engagement of our employees and their 
views on things that are important to them, including their wellbeing, 
opportunities for personal growth and if they feel recognised for the 
good work that they do. This is achieved through formal methods, 
such as surveying, as well as informal approaches which include 
gathering feedback via word of mouth. All of these insights allow us 
to put in place specific and tangible actions to ensure that our 
employees find Just a fulfilling place to work and are proud to be part 
of our organisation.
Further information on employee communications, development and 
diversity is given on page 13. 
Change of Control Provisions
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and 
employee share plans. In the context of the Group as a whole, none of 
these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact 
except for the following:
The Relationship Agreement with Avallux S.à.r.l. dated 12 November 
2013 (the Company’s principal shareholder holding 17.70% of 
the issued ordinary share capital) will continue for so long as the 
Company is premium-listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market and is entitled to control the exercise of 15% or more of the 
votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general 
meetings of the Company. Under the Relationship Agreement, 
Avallux S.à.r.l. is entitled to appoint one Non-Executive Director to 
the Board of the Company, but has chosen to waive its right to do so.  76

(non-profit pension annuities) policies written from 1 July 2004 to 
31 December 2015 and underwritten using the Merica 
underwriting system;
• the Hannover Re treaty between Just Retirement Limited and

26 September 2013, 1 January 2014, 23 July 2014 and 1 June 2015) 
in relation to Just Retirement Limited’s GIfL (non-profit pension 
annuities) policies written from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2014 
and underwritten using the Merica underwriting system; 
• the Achmea Re treaty between Just Retirement Limited and 
Interpolis Reinsurance Services Limited as novated to Achmea

annuities) policies written from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2012 and 
underwritten using the Merica underwriting system; and
• the Nomura treaty between Just Retirement Limited and Nomura

Just Retirement Limited’s GIfL (individual underwritten annuities) 
policies written from 1 July 2009 to 1 July 2013 and underwritten

In the case of the RGA reinsurance treaties, the reinsurer can 
immediately terminate if there is any material change in the 
ownership, management or control of Just Retirement Limited, its 
parent or ultimate parent. In the case of the Achmea Re treaty, the 
reinsurer can immediately terminate if there is any material change

terminated in respect of new business and the reinsurer may exercise 
an option either to continue the treaty in respect of business already 
written or to require recapture of that business, which has the effect 
of withdrawing the reinsurance in respect of past business (subject to 
any repayment by Just Retirement Limited not causing it to breach its 
PRA minimum capital requirements).
The Company does not have any agreements with any Non-Executive 
Director, Executive Director or employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a 
change of control.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they have elected to prepare both the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRSs” as 
adopted by the “EU”) and applicable law, and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU;
• assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company, and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.  
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge that:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and comprehensive income of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; 
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance business model and strategy.
The Strategic Report contains certain forward-looking statements 
providing additional information to shareholders to assess the 
potential for the Company’s strategies to succeed. Such statements 
are made by the Directors in good faith, based on the statements 
available to them up to the date of their approval of this report, and 
should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties 
underlying forward-looking information.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any 
person in relation to the Annual Report and Accounts except to the 
extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, 
any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any 
untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in 
accordance with Section 90A and Schedule 10A of the Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2000.

• the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of changes in equity, Consolidated statement of financial 
position, Consolidated statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1; and
• the statement of financial position of the Company, statement of changes in equity of the Company, statement of cash flows of the 
Company and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1 of the Company financial statements
 In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the Group’s comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is 
consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders in 2006. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 12 financial years ended 
31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We 
summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key 
audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were 
addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. 
The risk Our response
Valuation of insurance 
liabilities 
(2017: £16,633million,  
2016: £15,748 million). 
The risk compared to the 
prior year is unchanged. 
Refer to page 50  
(Audit Committee report), 
page 95 (accounting policy) 
and pages 113 to 116 
(financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation 
The Group has significant insurance 
liabilities representing 75% (31 December 
2016: 71%) of the Group’s total liabilities. 
This is an area that involves significant 
judgement over uncertain future outcomes, 
mainly the ultimate total settlement value 
of long-term policyholder liabilities. 
The Group is required to use judgement in 
the selection of key assumptions covering 
both operating assumptions and economic 
assumptions.
The key operating assumptions are 
mortality, (determined by reference to the 
Group’s own experience and expected levels 
of future mortality), and the expected level 
of future expenses, (which is based on the 
expected future costs of administering the 
underlying policies). 
The key economic assumption is credit risk 
that is based on the Group’s view of 
expected future investment defaults.
Calculation error and data capture
The Group uses complex actuarial models to 
calculate policyholder liabilities. There 
is the risk that the modelling does not 
appropriately reflect the model 
specifications and / or the product features 
due to incorrect or incomplete data input 
into the model and / or unauthorised or 
erroneous changes to the models. 
We used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our 
procedures in this area. Our procedures included: 
Control design and performance: 
• Testing of the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of key controls over the processes to determine the 
valuation of the policyholder liabilities including Group’s review 
and approval of the methods and assumptions adopted the 
calculation of policyholder liabilities and appropriate change 
management controls over the actuarial models. 
• Testing of the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the reconciliation controls to ensure 
completeness and accuracy of data flows from policy 
administration systems and data warehouses to the 
actuarial models.
Methodology cover:
We have assessed the methodology for selecting assumptions and 
calculating the policyholder liabilities. This included:
• Applying our understanding of developments in the business and 
the impact of changes in methodology on the selection of 
assumptions;
• Comparing changes in methodology to our expectations derived 
from market experience; and 
• Evaluating the analysis of the movements in insurance liabilities 
during the year, including consideration of whether the 
movements were in line with the methodology and assumptions 
adopted.
Benchmarking assumptions and sector experience:
• Evaluating the evidence used to prepare the Group’s mortality 
experience investigation, together with industry data on 
expectations of future mortality improvements and assessing 
whether this supports the assumptions adopted. 
• Assessing whether the expense assumptions reflect the 
expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by 
analysing current year unit costs, considering the expected 
future level of expense inflation and testing the appropriateness 
of the Group’s best estimate of future cost savings based on 
management actions and forecast budgets.
• Assessing the credit risk assumptions and appropriateness of the 
Group’s methodology used to determine the liquidity premium 
applied to the risk-free rate, by reference to industry practice and 
our expectations derived from market experience.
Independent reperformance: 
• Using our own valuation models to calculate the insurance 
liability balance for a sample of policies across the reserves 
and compare to the balances recorded by the Group. 
Assessing transparency:
• Considering whether the Group’s disclosures in relation to the 
assumptions used in the calculation of insurance liabilities 
appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to 
alternative scenarios and inputs.
Our results 
• We found the valuation of insurance liabilities to be acceptable 
(2016: acceptable). 81

The risk compared to the 
prior year is unchanged.

(Audit Committee report),

(financial disclosures). 
Subjective valuation
The loans are measured at fair value 
determined through projecting future 
discounted cash flows using internally 
developed models. The Group is required to 
use judgement in the selection of key 
assumptions in determining the projected 
cash flows and in determining the liquidity 
premium applied to the discount rate.
The key assumptions include property price 
inflation, property price volatility, mortality 
(determined by reference to the Group’s own 
experience and expected levels of future 
mortality) and the liquidity premium added 
to the swap curve. 
A small change in these assumptions can 
have a significant impact on the overall 
valuation.
We used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our 
procedures in this area. Our procedures included: 
Control design and performance: 
• Testing of the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of key controls over the process to review 
and approve the estimates and assumptions used in the 
valuation process.
 Benchmarking assumptions and sector experience: 
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the property price inflation 
assumption used within the valuation process by assessing the 
expected property price inflation with reference to market data 
and industry benchmarks.
• Assessing the reasonableness of the property price volatility 
assumption by considering historic volatility in property prices 
and comparing the assumption to industry benchmarks.
• Evaluating the evidence used to prepare the Group’s mortality 
experience analysis, together with industry data on expectations 
of future mortality improvements to assess the reasonableness 
of the assumptions adopted.
• Assessing the appropriateness of the liquidity premium applied 
to the risk-free rate, by reference to industry practice and our 
expectations derived from market experience.
 
Independent reperformance: 
• Using our own valuation models to value the loans secured by 
residential mortgages balance for a sample of policies and 
comparing to the balances recorded by the Group.
Assessing transparency: 
• Considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation 
to the valuation of loans secured by residential mortgages, in 
particular the sensitivity of the valuations adopted to alternative 
outcomes. 
Our results 
• We found the valuation of loans secured by residential 
mortgages to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Valuation of reinsurance

Reinsurance Asset  
(2017: £5,285 million,  
2016: £6,057 million). 
Deposits received 
from insurers  
(2017: £4,556 million,  
2016: £5,231 million). 
The risk compared to the 
prior year is unchanged.
Refer to page 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
page 94 (accounting policy) 
and pages 113 to 117 
(financial disclosures). 
Accounting treatment 
The Group needs to determine, based on the 
underlying cash flows and complex treaty 
terms, whether the deposits received from 
reinsurers should be accounted for as 
insurance contracts or as financial liabilities. 
The classification of the treaty impacts the 
valuation basis applied. 
 
Subjective valuation
Reinsurance assets and deposits received 
from insurers are measured at fair value. 
The valuation of the reinsurance assets is 
sensitive to movements in mortality and 
economic assumptions and the valuation of 
the deposits received from reinsurers is 
driven by the discount rate applied to the 
related cash flows. The calculation of these 
fair values involves significant judgement 
over uncertain future outcomes.
Our procedures included: 
Accounting analysis: 
• Evaluating the classification of deposits from reinsurers under 
relevant accounting standards as insurance contracts or 
financial liabilities based on the underlying cash flows and terms 
of the treaties.
We used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our 
procedures in this area.
Methodology implementation: 
• Comparing the methodology applied for the valuation of the 
reinsurance assets and deposits received from reinsurers to 
confirm that it is appropriate and is consistent with the terms 
and conditions set out in the reinsurance treaties. 
Expectation vs outcome: 
• Assessing the Group’s analysis of the movements in reinsurance 
assets and deposits received from reinsurers’ liabilities with 
reference to the movement in policyholder liabilities driven by 
changes in mortality and economic assumptions, increase in 
new business and recorded claims.
Assessing transparency: 
• Considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation 
to the assumptions used in the calculation of reinsurance assets 
and deposits received from reinsurers, in particular the 
sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and 
inputs.
Our results 
• We found the valuation of reinsurance assets and deposits 
received from reinsurers to be acceptable (2016: acceptable). 82

The risk Our response
Recoverability of Parent 
Company’s investment 
in subsidiaries 
(Parent Specific Risk)
(2017: £1,135 million, 
2016: £1,124 million). 
The risk compared to the 
prior year is unchanged.
Refer to page 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
page 129 (accounting 
policy and 
financial disclosures).
Low risk, high value 
The carrying amount of the Parent 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
represents 91% (2016: 87%) of the 
Company’s total assets. Their recoverability 
is not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant 
judgement. However, due to their 
materiality in the context of the Parent 
Company financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had the 
greatest effect on our overall Parent 
Company audit.
Our procedures included:
 
Tests of detail: 
• Comparing the carrying amount of a sample of the highest value 
investments, representing 100% (2016: 100%) of the total 
investment balance with the relevant subsidiaries’ financial 
statements to identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in 
excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those 
subsidiaries have historically been profit-making. 
Assessing subsidiary audits: 
• Assessing the audit work performed on that sample of those 
subsidiaries and considering the results of that work, on those 
subsidiaries’ profits and net assets.
Our results 
• We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Following the acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc 
as at 1 April 2016, we identified acquisition accounting as a 
key audit matter for the audit of the financial statements of 
Just Group plc for the 18 month period ended 31 December 
2016. As the risk related to acquisition accounting was an 
event-driven risk in the prior period and is not related to the 
audit of the financial statements of Just Group plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2017, we have not assessed this as 
a significant risk in our current year audit and, therefore, it is 
not separately identified in our report this year.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £11.5m (31 December 2016: £11.5m), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of 2016 
Group net assets (of which it represents 0.7%; (2016: 0.7%)). 
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as 
a whole was set at £8 million (2016: £ 7.1 million) in line with 
component materiality, determined by reference to 
Company net assets, of which it represents 0.8 % (2016: 
0.7%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.58 
million (2016: £0.53m), in addition to other identified 
misstatements below that threshold that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 26 (2016: 28) reporting components, we 
subjected seven (2016: six) to full scope audits for Group 
purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for 
the percentages illustrated opposite.
For the residual components, we performed analysis at an 
aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatements within these.
The Group audit team approved component materiality, which was 
set at £8.0 million (31 December 2016: £7.1m), having regard to the 
mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
work on all seven (2016: six) components, including the audit of the 
Parent Company, was performed by the Group team based at Just’s 
offices in London and Reigate. 83

4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s 
use of that basis for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
• the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 73 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.
 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work 
we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 
• the Directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 73 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
• the principal risks disclosures on pages 19 to 23 describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
• the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done 
so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or 
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 11 provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.
 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects. 84

7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 77, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative  
but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud, other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. We identified relevant areas of laws and regulations from our sector experience, through discussion with the Directors (as required 
by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting (including related 
company legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our 
procedures on the related financial statements items. 
In addition, we considered the impact of laws and regulations in the specific areas of regulatory capital, recognising the financial and regulated 
nature of the Group’s activities. With the exception of any known or possible non-compliance, and as required by auditing standards, our work 
in respect of these was limited to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence. 
We communicated the identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance 
throughout the audit. 
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The financial statements of Just Group plc have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors of the Company have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In 
accordance with the requirements of IAS 1 the financial statements’ assets and liabilities have been presented based on order of liquidity which 
provides information that is more reliable and relevant for a financial institution.
The following new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing accounting standards in issue, but not yet effective, have 
not been early adopted by the Group. Unless stated, the new and amended standards and interpretations are being assessed but are not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements:
• Amendments to IFRS 4, Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2018). 
The amendments to IFRS 4 allow the deferral of the application of IFRS 9 until accounting periods commencing on 1 January 2021. This is 
intended to align with the effective date of IFRS 17, the replacement insurance contracts standard. This option, which the Group intends to 
adopt, is subject to meeting criteria relating to the predominance of insurance activity. At 31 December 2017, the Group’s insurance liabilities in 
relation to its total liabilities were 96% and deferral of IFRS 9 was applicable. 
The impact of adopting the amendments to IFRS 4 from 1 January 2018 is that additional disclosures will be required to allow comparison with 
those entities which have adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. On application of IFRS 9 there is potential for certain financial assets that are 
currently classified as fair value through profit or loss to be reclassified as fair value through other comprehensive income. However, the Group 
anticipates that it will continue to designate these assets as fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9 under the option to do so when it 
eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise occur. Therefore the Group believes the impact of adopting 
the amendments to IFRS 4 is not significant. 
• IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018). 
IFRS 15 specifies how and when an entity recognises revenue, providing a single, principles-based model to be applied to all contracts with 
customers, whilst requiring more informative and relevant disclosures. Insurance contracts, although contracts with customers, are outside the 
scope of IFRS 15. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 
the year to 31 December 2017 the main source of non-insurance contract income was fee and commission income, which amounted to £5.8m. 
Under the Group’s existing accounting policies, fee and commission income is recognised when the service is rendered. Therefore, the 
application of IFRS 15 will not result in a material difference to when revenue is recognised by the Group based on the current recognition policy 
of non-insurance contract income. 
• IFRS 16, Leases (effective 1 January 2019). 
IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single accounting model, requiring lessees to 
recognise assets and liabilities for leases unless the term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value. 
The effect of applying this standard at 31 December 2017 would be to recognise operating lease assets and lease payment liabilities on the 
balance sheet with an approximate value of £11.9m.
• IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (effective 1 January 2021, not yet endorsed by the EU). 
IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their valuation, income statement presentation 
and disclosure. The Group has initiated a project to assess the financial and operational implications of the standard and to prepare for 
adoption. 
1.2 Significant accounting policies and the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items 
reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
The major areas of judgement used as part of accounting policy application are summarised below.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
All estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge and 
predictions of future events and actions. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.
The table below sets out those items the Group considers susceptible to changes in critical estimates and assumptions together with the 
relevant accounting policy.
Accounting policy and notes Item involving estimates and assumptions Critical estimates and assumptions
1.18, 16(a) and (d) Measurement of fair value of loans secured 
by residential mortgages
The critical estimates used in valuing loans secured by residential 
mortgages include the projected future receipts of interest and loan 
repayments, future house prices, and the future costs of 
administering the loan portfolio. 
The key assumptions used as part of the valuation calculation 
include future property prices and their volatility, mortality, the rate 
of voluntary redemptions and the liquidity premium added to the 
risk-free curve and used to discount the mortgage cash flows.
1.19, 22, 25 Measurement of reinsurance assets and 
deposits received from reinsurers arising 
from reinsurance arrangements
The critical estimates used in measuring the value of reinsurance 
assets include the projected future cash flows arising from 
reinsurers’ share of the Group’s insurance liabilities. 
Deposits received from reinsurers are measured in accordance with 
the reinsurance contract and taking account of an appropriate 
discount rate for the timing of the expected cash flows of the 
liabilities. 
The key assumptions used in the valuation include discount rates 
and mortality experience, as described below, and assumptions 
around the reinsurers’ ability to meet its claim obligations.
1.22, 22(b), 23(b) Measurement of insurance liabilities arising 
from writing Retirement Income insurance/
investment contracts
The critical estimates used in measuring insurance liabilities include 
the projected future Retirement Income payments and the cost of 
administering payments to policyholders.
The key assumptions are the discount rates and mortality 
experience used in the valuation of future Retirement Income 
payments. The valuation discount rates are derived from yields on 
supporting assets after deducting allowances for default. Mortality 
assumptions are derived from the appropriate standard mortality 
tables, adjusted to reflect the future expected mortality experience 
of the policyholders.
Further detail can be found in notes 22 and 23.
1.16, 2, 14 Assessment of carrying value of intangible 
assets recognised on acquisition of 
Partnership Assurance Group (“PAG”)
Intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of PAG in 2016, 
including the value of the acquired in-force business are reviewed 
for indicators of impairment and if such indicators exist, are tested 
for impairment. The key impairment testing assumptions include 
the choice of discount rate used, which represents a weighted-
average cost of capital determined using a capital asset pricing 
model (“CAPM”) approach.
1.3 Consolidation principles
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those investees over which the Group has control. The Group has control over an investee if all of the following are met: (1) it 
has power over the investee; (2) it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (3) it has the ability to 
use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from consolidation from the date on 
which control ceases. All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Group policies.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under this method, the cost of acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair value of the consideration at date of acquisition and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The excess 
of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The Group uses the equity method to consolidate its investments in joint ventures and associates. Under the equity method of accounting the 
investment is initially recognised at fair value and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets of the 
joint ventures and associates.

1.4 Segments
The Group’s segmental results are presented on a basis consistent with internal reporting used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) 
to assess the performance of operating segments and the allocation of resources. The CODM has been identified as the Group Executive Office 
Committee.
The internal reporting used by the CODM includes product information (which comprises analysis of product revenues, LTM advances and 
amounts written under investment contracts) and information on adjusted operating profit and profit before tax for the Group’s operating 
segments.
Product information is analysed by product line and includes DB, GIfL, Care Plans, Protection, LTM and Capped Drawdown products.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses.
The operating segments from which the Group derives revenues and incurs expenses are as follows:
• The writing of insurance products for distribution to the at- or in-retirement market, which is undertaken through the activities of the life 
company (this is referred to as the insurance segment in note 7, Segmental reporting); 
• The arranging of guaranteed income for life contracts and lifetime mortgages through regulated advice and intermediary services; and 
• The provision of licensed software to financial advisers, banks, building societies, life assurance companies and pension trustees. 
Operating segments, where certain materiality thresholds in relation to total results from operating segments are not exceeded, are combined 
when determining reportable segments. For segmental reporting, the arranging of guaranteed income for life contracts, providing intermediary 
mortgage advice and arranging, plus the provision of licensed software, are included in the Other segment along with Group activities, such as 
capital and liquidity management, and investment activities.
The information on adjusted operating profit and profit before tax used by the CODM is presented on a combined product basis within the 
insurance operating segment and is not analysed further by product.
1.5 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange at the reporting date. The revenues and 
expenses are translated to sterling at the average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation to 
sterling are accounted for through other comprehensive income.
1.6 Classification of insurance and investment contracts
The measurement and presentation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses arising from life and pensions business contracts is dependent 
upon the classification of those contracts as either insurance or investment contracts.
A contract is classified as insurance only if it transfers significant insurance risk. Insurance risk is significant if an insured event could cause an 
insurer to pay significant additional benefits to those payable if no insured event occurred. A contract that is classified as an insurance contract 
remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts. Capped Drawdown pension business 
and Flexible Pension Plan contracts are classified as investment contracts as there is no transfer of longevity risk due to the fixed term and 
unit-linked natures of these respective contracts.
1.7 Premium revenue
Premium revenue in respect of individual GIfL contracts is accounted for when the premiums are received, which coincides with when the 
liability to pay the GIfL contract is established.
Premium revenue in respect of Defined Benefit De-risking contracts is accounted for when the Company becomes ‘on risk’, which is the date 
from which the policy is effective. If a timing difference occurs between the date from which the policy is effective and the receipt of payment, 
the amount due for payment but not yet received is recognised as a receivable in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Premium revenue in respect of Care Plans and Protection policies are recognised in the accounting period in which the insurance contract 
commences.
Facilitated adviser charges, are not accounted for within premium revenue, and do not represent a charge on the Group.
Deposits collected under investment contracts are not accounted for through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for 
fee income and attributable investment income, but are accounted for directly through the Consolidated statement of financial position as an 
adjustment to the investment contract liability.
Reinsurance premiums payable in respect of reinsurance treaties are accounted for when the reinsurance premiums are due for payment under 
the terms of the contract. Reinsurance premiums previously incurred can be recaptured under certain conditions, notably once reinsurance 
financing for an underwriting year is fully repaid.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1.8 Net investment income
Investment income consists of interest receivable for the period and realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities 
at fair value through profit and loss.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
Realised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities occur on disposal or transfer and represent the difference between the proceeds 
received net of transaction costs, and the original cost.
Unrealised gains and losses arising on financial assets and liabilities represent the difference between the carrying value at the end of the 
reporting period and the carrying value at the start of the reporting period or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously 
recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the period.
1.9 Fee and commission income
Fee and commission income, which consists of fee income for initial advances made on loans secured by mortgages, investment management 
fees, administration fees and commission, are recognised as the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised in full on acceptance and 
inception of the contract by the product provider as there are no post-placement obligations. In addition, operating income includes fees from 
software licensing which are recognised across the licence period.
1.10 Claims paid
Policyholder benefits are accounted for when due for payment. Reinsurance paid claim recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the 
related claim.
Death claims are accounted for when notified.
1.11 Acquisition costs
Acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as commission and indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business. Acquisition costs are 
not deferred as they relate to single premium business.
1.12 Leases
Leases, where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
1.13 Finance costs
Finance costs on deposits received from reinsurers are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Interest on 
reinsurance financing is accrued in accordance with the terms of the financing arrangements.
Interest on loans and borrowings is accrued in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Loan issue costs are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan issued. Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
1.14 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds 
managed by a third party. Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme are recognised as an expense in profit or 
loss when due.
Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date, determined using 
stochastic and scenario-based modelling techniques where appropriate. The fair value is expensed in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity, based on the Group’s estimate of 
the equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest as a result of changes in non-market-based vesting conditions, and recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity. Where a leaver is entitled to their scheme benefits, this is treated as an acceleration of the vesting in the period they leave. Where a 
scheme is modified before it vests, any change in fair value as a result of the modification is recognised over the remaining vesting period. 
Where a scheme is cancelled, this is treated as an acceleration in the period of the vesting of all remaining options.
1.15 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted-average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The calculation of the weighted-average number of ordinary shares excludes ordinary shares 
held in trusts on behalf of employee share schemes.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares held 
in trusts on behalf of employee share schemes, is adjusted to assume conversion of potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to 
employees, if their conversion would dilute earnings per share.

1.16 Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, which is deemed to have an indefinite useful life, Purchased Value of In-Force (“PVIF”), brand and 
purchased and internally developed software (including PrognoSys
TM
), which are deemed to have finite useful lives.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary 
and represents the future economic benefit arising from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. 
Goodwill is measured at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised, but assessed for impairment annually 
or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over the carrying value.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units and an impairment is recognised when the 
carrying value of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised directly in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and are not subsequently reversed.
Other intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group, 
and are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairments.
PVIF, representing the present value of future profits from the purchased in-force business, is recognised upon acquisition and is amortised over 
its expected remaining economic life up to 16 years on a straight-line basis.
PrognoSys
TM
 is the Group’s proprietary underwriting engine. The Group has over two million person-years of experience collected over 20 years 
of operations. It is enhanced by an extensive breadth of external primary and secondary healthcare data and medical literature.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are capitalised and 
recognised as an intangible asset. Direct costs include the incremental software development team’s employee costs. All other costs associated 
with researching or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which range from three to 16 years. The 
useful lives are determined by considering relevant factors, such as usage of the asset, potential obsolescence, competitive position and 
stability of the industry.
For intangible assets with finite useful lives, impairment testing is performed where there is an indication that the carrying value of the assets 
may be subject to an impairment. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount.
The significant intangible assets recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of intangibles 
acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method
PVIF Up to 16 years Estimated value in-force using European Embedded Value model
Brand 2 – 5 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed
Distribution network 3 years Estimated discounted cash flow
Software 2 – 3 years Estimated replacement cost
Intellectual property 12 – 15 years Estimated replacement cost
The useful economic lives of intangible assets recognised by the Group other than those acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life
PrognoSys
TM
12 years
Software 3 years
1.17 Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings are measured at their revalued amounts less subsequent depreciation, and impairment losses are recognised at the date of 
revaluation. Valuations are performed with sufficient frequency to ensure that the fair value of the revalued asset does not differ materially 
from its carrying value.
A revaluation surplus is recognised in Other comprehensive income and credited to the revaluation reserve in equity. However, to the extent 
that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, the increase is recognised in profit or loss. A 
revaluation deficit is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the 
revaluation reserve.
Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings of 25 years.
Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write 
down the cost to residual value over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment – 3 to 4 years
Furniture and fittings – 2 to 10 years

1.18 Financial investments
Classification
The Group classifies financial investments in accordance with IAS 39 whereby, subject to specific criteria, they are accounted for at fair value 
through profit and loss. This comprises assets designated by management as fair value through profit and loss on inception, as they are 
managed on a fair value basis, and derivatives that are classified as held for trading. These investments are measured at fair value with all 
changes thereon being recognised in investment income in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. 
Amounts payable or receivable on unsettled purchases or sales are recognised in other payables or other receivables respectively. Transaction 
costs are expensed through profit and loss.
Loans secured by residential mortgages are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers.
The Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or gilts in respect of derivative contracts. Collateral received is recognised as an 
asset in the Consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in other financial liabilities. Collateral 
pledged is recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position within the appropriate asset classification.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not 
available, by using standard valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow models or option pricing models. All derivatives are carried as 
assets when the fair value is positive and liabilities when the fair values are negative. The Group does not use hedge accounting.
The Group’s policy is to derecognise financial investments when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred.
Use of fair value
The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices. Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued 
using prices provided by third parties. If there is no active established market for an investment, the Group applies an appropriate valuation 
technique such as discounted cash flow analysis.
Determining the fair value of financial investments when the markets are not active
The Group holds certain financial investments for which the markets are not active. These comprise financial investments which are not quoted 
in active markets and include loans secured by residential mortgages, derivatives and other financial investments for which markets are not 
active. When the markets are not active, there is generally no or limited observable market data that can be used in the fair value measurement 
of the financial investments. The determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires management’s 
judgement.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Group establishes 
fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties or internally developed pricing models. The 
valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction 
would take place between market participants on the measurement date. The valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length 
transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation techniques may 
include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates and, for loans secured by mortgages, mortality, 
future expenses, voluntary redemptions and house price assumptions. Changes in assumptions relating to these variables impact the reported 
fair value of these financial instruments positively or negatively.
The financial investments measured at fair value are classified into the following three-level hierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of inputs 
that are significant to the fair value measurement of the financial investment concerned:
Level 1: Quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: Significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
1.19 Reinsurance
Reinsurance assets
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are measured in a consistent manner with insurance liabilities and are classified as reinsurance assets. If 
a reinsurance asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly and that impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities
Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group are structured to provide financing, with financing components to be repaid in future 
periods, such amounts are classified as “reinsurance finance” and included in other financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of 
financial position.
Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group require deposits received from reinsurers to be repaid, such amounts are classified as 
“deposits received from reinsurers” and included in other financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of financial position. Where the 
liability carries no insurance risk, it is initially recognised at fair value at the date the deposited asset is recognised and subsequently re-
measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Fair value is determined as the amount payable discounted from the first date that the amount is required to be paid. All other deposits 
received from reinsurers are valued in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts, which take into account an appropriate discount 
rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
1 Significant accounting policies continued 95
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Financial Statements
Amounts receivable/payable
Where reinsurance contracts the Group has entered into include longevity swap arrangements, such contracts are settled on a net basis and 
amounts receivable from or payable to the reinsurers are included in the appropriate heading under either Insurance and other receivables or 
Insurance and other payables.
1.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with less than 90 days’ maturity from the date of acquisition.
1.21 Equity
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued is 
credited to the share premium account.
Interim dividends are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends are recognised when they have been approved 
by shareholders.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from 
equity. Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to equity net of related costs.
The reserve arising on the reorganisation of the Group represents the difference in the value of the shares in the Company and the value of 
shares in Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited for which they were exchanged as part of the Group reorganisation in November 2013.
1.22 Insurance liabilities
Measurement
Long-term insurance liabilities arise from the Group writing Retirement Income contracts, including Defined Benefit De-risking Solutions, 
long-term care insurance, and whole of life and term protection insurance. Their measurement uses estimates of projected future cash flows 
arising from payments to policyholders plus the costs of administering them. Valuation of insurance liabilities is derived using discount rates, 
adjusted for default allowance, and mortality assumptions, taken from the appropriate mortality tables and adjusted to reflect actual and 
expected experience.
Liability adequacy test
The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure the carrying amount is sufficient to cover the current estimate of 
future cash flows. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.23 Investment contract liabilities
Investment contracts are measured at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with IAS 39. The fair value of investment contracts is 
estimated using an internal model and determined on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future Retirement Income 
benefit and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract.
1.24 Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently amortised through profit and loss over 
the period to maturity at the effective rate of interest required to recognise the discounted estimated cash flows to maturity.
1.25 Other provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. The amount 
recorded as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of 
the time value of money is material, the provision is the present value of the expected expenditure.
1.26 Taxation
The current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the Consolidated statement of 
financial position date, and after any adjustments in respect of prior years. Tax, including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over 
profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to components of other comprehensive income and equity as appropriate.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all material temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The principal 
temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including technical provisions and other insurance 
items and tax losses carried forward, and include amortised transitional tax adjustments resulting from changes in tax basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.

2 Acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc
On 4 April 2016, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the ordinary share capital of Partnership Assurance Group plc (“PAG”) through 
an all share exchange which gave PAG shareholders 0.834 Just Retirement Group plc (“JRP”) shares for every PAG share held, with effective 
control having passed on 1 April 2016. In total, 368,376,421 new JRP shares were issued and commenced trading on 4 April 2016. As a result, 
PAG shareholders held approximately 40% of the enlarged share capital of the Combined Group. At the closing price of 154.60 pence on 
1 April 2016, the share exchange represented consideration of £569.5m. As part of the acquisition certain employee share schemes granted to 
PAG employees have been exchanged for equivalent JRP employee share schemes. The fair value cost of replacing those schemes, included in 
the consideration for PAG, was £2.4m.
When compared with total consideration of £571.9m, goodwill of £0.3m arose on acquisition, as follows:

The issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for shares of PAG attracted merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Of 
the £569.5m, £36.8m was credited to share capital (representing 10 pence per ordinary share) and the remaining £532.7m was credited to the 
merger reserve within equity. 
Fair value and accounting policy adjustments
Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets
On completion of the acquisition, the economic assumptions applied to the actuarial models used to determine the value of insurance liabilities 
and reinsurance assets were reviewed across the Group. Following this review, consistent economic and other assumptions were applied to all 
Group entities, resulting in an increase of £37.3m to PAG’s insurance liabilities and an increase of £6.2m to PAG’s reinsurance assets recognised 
on acquisition. Similarly, consistent economic assumptions were applied to the models used to determine the fair value of loan assets secured 
by mortgages, resulting in an increase of £30.7m to the value of PAG’s mortgage loan assets.
Financial liabilities
PAG’s subordinated debt liability was recognised at fair value on acquisition. The fair value represented a £5.8m reduction to the amortised cost 
of the debt liability. The methodology applied to the valuation of reinsurance deposit back liabilities in Partnership Life Assurance Company 
Limited was also reviewed and a Group accounting basis adopted. Together with the impact of other basis alignments, this resulted in a £74.7m 
increase in the value of PAG’s financial liabilities.
Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets
An asset of £142.7m was recognised on acquisition representing the present value of future profits from the acquired in-force business as at 
1 April 2016. Future profit streams were discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital of 11.1%, which was determined using a capital 
asset pricing model (“CAPM”) approach. This is being amortised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Intangible assets of £26.9m represent PAG’s distribution and customer relationships, brands, technology and software including IP, and other 
intangibles. These balances are being amortised over their remaining useful economic lives, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 97

2 Acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc continued
Goodwill arising on acquisition
The acquisition resulted in goodwill of £0.3m, representing the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired. The 
acquisition consideration consisted of shares in the Group exchanged for shares in PAG at a ratio set at the announcement of the transaction on 
11 August 2015.
Profit and loss
If the acquisition had been effective on 1 July 2015, on a pro forma basis the Group’s revenue is estimated at £4,368.7m and profit before tax 
attributable to shareholders is estimated at £121.2m for the 18 month period ending 31 December 2016. In determining these amounts, 
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition 
occurred on 1 July 2015. The pro forma results are provided for information purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the actual results that 
would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 July 2015. For the period from 1 April 2016 to 31 December 2016, £363.3m was 
recognised within the Group’s revenue and £24.0m was recognised within the Group’s profit before tax attributable to shareholders arising from 
the acquired entities.
Acquisition costs of £23.4m incurred to support the transaction were recognised within other operating expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income, during the 18 month period ended 31 December 2016.

7 Segmental reporting 
Adjusted operating profit
The Group reports adjusted operating profit as an alternative measure of profit which is used for decision making and performance 
measurement. The Board believes that adjusted operating profit, which excludes effects of short-term economic and investment changes, 
provides a better view of the longer-term performance and development of the business and aligns with the longer-term nature of the 
products. The underlying operating profit represents a combination of both the profit generated from new business written in the period and 
profit expected to emerge from the in-force book of business based on current assumptions. Actual operating experience, where different from 
that assumed at the start of the period and the impacts of changes to future operating assumptions applied in the period, are then also 
included in arriving at adjusted operating profit.
New business profits represent expected investment returns on financial instruments backing shareholder and policyholder funds after 
allowances for expected movements in liabilities and acquisition costs. Profits arising from the in–force book of business represent the expected 
return on surplus assets, the expected unwind of prudent reserves above best estimates for mortality, expenses, corporate bond defaults and, 
with respect to lifetime mortgages, no-negative guarantee and early redemptions.
Adjusted operating profit excludes the impairment and amortisation of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation, and 
restructuring costs, since these items arise outside the normal course of business in the year. Adjusted operating profit also excludes 
exceptional items. Exceptional items are those items that, in the Directors’ view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature 
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Variances between actual and expected investment returns due to economic and market changes are also disclosed outside adjusted 
operating profit.
Segmental analysis
The insurance segment writes insurance products for the retirement market – which include Guaranteed Income for Life Solutions, Defined 
Benefit De-risking Solutions, Care Plans, Flexible Pension Plans and Protection − and invests the premiums received from these contracts in debt 
securities, gilts, liquidity funds and lifetime mortgage advances. 
The professional services business, HUB, is included with other corporate companies in the Other segment. This business is not currently 
sufficiently significant to separate from other companies’ results and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) does not separately consider 
its results at present. The Other segment also includes the Group’s corporate activities that are primarily involved in managing the Group’s 
liquidity, capital and investment activities.
The Group operates in one material geographical segment which is the United Kingdom.

The tax rate for the current year is lower than the prior year, due to changes in the UK corporation tax rate, which decreased from 20% to 19% 
from 1 April 2017. Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 (on 6 September 2016). 
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been 
measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 have been calculated based on the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
Taxation of life insurance companies was fundamentally changed following the publication of the Finance Act 2012. Since 1 January 2013, life 
insurance tax has been based on financial statements; prior to this date, the basis for profits chargeable to corporation tax was surplus arising 
within the Pillar 1 regulatory regime. Cumulative differences arising between the two bases, which represent the differences in retained profits 
and taxable surplus which are not excluded items for taxation, are brought back into the computation of taxable profits. However, legislation 
provides for transitional arrangements whereby such differences are amortised on a straight-line basis over a ten year period from 1 January 
2013. Similarly, the resulting cumulative transitional adjustments for tax purposes in adoption of IFRS will be amortised on a straight-line basis 
over a ten year period from 1 January 2016. The tax charge for the period to 31 December 2017 includes profits chargeable to corporation tax 
arising from amortisation of transitional balances of £2.5m (2016: £(10.1)m). 
Tax balances included within these financial statements include the use of estimates and assumptions which are based on management’s best 
knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions. This includes the determination of tax liabilities and recoverables for 
uncertain tax positions. The actual outcome may differ from the estimated position. 
9 Remuneration of Directors
Information concerning individual Directors’ emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. For the 
purposes of the disclosure required by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the Directors in the period 
was £5.7m (2016: £6.7m). Employer contributions to pensions for Executive Directors for qualifying periods were £nil (2016: £nil). The aggregate 
net value of share awards granted to the Directors in the period was £2.3m (2016: £5.6m). The net value has been calculated by reference to the 
closing middle-market price of an ordinary share at the date of grant. Two Directors exercised share options during the period whilst a Director 
of the Company (2016: nil). 101

Share Awards
Share incentive plan (“SIP”)
The SIP is an ‘‘all-employee’’ share ownership plan. The Group made an award of 831,070 free shares immediately after admission to all eligible 
employees. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employees. The shares are forfeited if the employees cease employment (except in 
“good leaver” circumstances) within the first three years from the date of the award. The awards vested on 11 November 2016.
On the acquisition of PAG, shares held in trust in respect of SIP awards were converted to JRP shares in the same ratio as the share exchange 
which achieved the acquisition of PAG. The awards vested on 12 June 2016.
Awards made in the period are in respect of additional shares to existing scheme participants on payment of dividends by the Group. The 
weighted-average fair value of awards made in the year was £15,857 measured by reference to the quoted share price of the Company at grant 
date.

The Group’s policy is to pay a progressive dividend subject to sufficient distributable reserves, available funds, and available capital to meet 
minimum solvency requirements. The Group has sufficient distributable reserves, available funds and a resilient capital position to be able to 
maintain its current dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
Subsequent to 31 December 2017, the Directors proposed a final dividend for 2017 of 2.55 pence per ordinary share (2016: 2.4 pence), 
amounting to £23.9m (2016: £22.4m) in total. Subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM, the dividend will be paid on 25 May 2018 and will 
be accounted for as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2018.

Amortisation and impairment charge
The amortisation and impairment charge is recognised in other operating expenses in profit or loss. The fair value attributed to the Partnership 
brand has been impaired following the adoption of the Just brand. The lease intangible asset has been impaired as a result of the 
rationalisation of office space.
Impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least annually.
The Group’s goodwill of £33.1m at 31 December 2017 represents £0.3m recognised on the 2016 acquisition of the Partnership Assurance Group 
and £32.8m on the 2009 acquisition by Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited of Just Retirement (Holdings) Limited, the holding company of 
Just Retirement Limited (“JRL”).
The existing goodwill has been allocated to the insurance segment as the cash generating unit. The recoverable amounts of goodwill have been 
determined from value-in-use. The key assumptions of this calculation are noted below:
2017 2016
Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years 5 years
Discount rate (pre-tax) 10.0% 12.0%
The value-in-use of the insurance operating segment is considered by reference to latest business plans over the next five years, which reflect 
management’s best estimate of future profits based on historical experience, expected growth rates and assumptions around market share, 
customer numbers, expense inflation and mortality rates. A stressed scenario that assumes no growth in sales for the next five years and 
discount rate of 20% is also considered. The outcome of the impairment assessment under both scenarios is that the goodwill in respect of the 
insurance operating segment is not impaired and that the value-in-use is higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
Any reasonably possible changes in assumption will not cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts.

Deposits with credit institutions with a carrying value of £87.1m (2016: £71.0m) have been pledged as collateral in respect of the Group’s 
derivative financial instruments. Amounts pledged as collateral are deposited with the derivative counterparty.
(a) Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
Level 1
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date.
Level 2
Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term 
of the instrument. Level 2 inputs include the following:
• Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; 
• Quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary 
substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which very little information is released publicly; 
• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and 
• Market-corroborated inputs.
Where the Group uses broker/asset manager quotes and no information as to observability of inputs is provided by the broker/asset manager, 
the investments are classified as follows:
• Where the broker/asset manager price is validated by using internal models with market-observable inputs and the values are similar, the 
investment is classified as Level 2; and 
• In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker/asset manager prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers/
asset managers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3. 
The majority of the Group’s debt securities held at fair value and financial derivatives are valued using independent pricing services or third 
party broker quotes, and therefore classified as Level 2.
Level 3
Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to 
the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or 
liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date 
from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the same assumptions as 
those that the market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Group’s assets and liabilities held at fair value which are valued using valuation techniques for which significant observable market data is 
not available and classified as Level 3 include loans secured by mortgages, asset-backed securities, investment contract liabilities, and deposits 
received from reinsurers. 108
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
The valuation of loans secured by mortgages is determined using internal models which project future cash flows expected to arise from each 
loan. Future cash flows allow for assumptions relating to future expenses, future mortality experience, voluntary redemptions and repayment 
shortfalls on redemption of the mortgages due to the no-negative equity guarantee. The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash 
flows at a swap rate plus a liquidity premium.
Under the “no-negative equity” guarantee, the amount recoverable by the Group on termination of mortgages is generally capped at the net 
sale proceeds of the property. This guarantee does not apply where the mortgage redemption is not accompanied by a sale of the underlying 
property. This could occur when, for example, the property is remortgaged with another provider. The time value of this option and guarantee is 
allowed for in the asset valuation using closed form calculations, based on a variant of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. The formula 
incorporates a number of assumptions, including those for risk-free interest rates, future property growth and future property price volatility. 
The Level 3 bonds are either private placement bonds or asset-backed securities. Such securities are valued using discounted cash flow 
analyses using prudent assumptions based on the repayment of the underlying bond.
The Level 3 Other loans are infrastructure-related loans, and are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using prudent assumptions based 
on the repayment of the underlying loan.
Investment contract liabilities are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future retirement income benefits and 
expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements as at 31 December 2017 (2016: nil).

(c) Transfers between levels
The Group’s policy is to assess pricing source changes and determine transfers between levels as of the end of each half-yearly reporting period. 
During the period there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. The transfer from Level 2 to Level 3 followed a change in the availability 
of market prices for specific bonds.

Debt securities and other fixed income securities
Debt securities classified as Level 3 are either private placement bonds or asset-backed securities.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the debt securities and other fixed income securities classified as Level 3
Redemption and defaults
The redemption and default assumptions used in the valuation of infrastructure private placement bonds are similar to the rest of the Group’s 
bond portfolio.
For asset-backed securities, the assumptions are that the underlying loans supporting the securities are redeemed in the future in a similar 
profile to the existing redemptions on an average rate of 3% per annum, and that default levels on the underlying basis remain at the current 
level of the Group’s bond portfolio.
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonable possible alternative assumptions for unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in 
the fair value of the assets. The sensitivity of the valuation of bonds to the default assumption is determined by reference to movement in credit 
spreads. The Group has estimated the impact on fair value to changes to these inputs as follows:

Loans secured by residential mortgages
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by residential mortgages
All gains and losses arising from loans secured by mortgages are largely dependent on the term of the mortgage, which in turn is determined 
by the longevity of the customer. Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by mortgages include the following:
Maintenance expenses
Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Group’s recent expense analyses. The assumed future expense levels incorporate 
an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.2% for loans written by JRL (2016: 4.3%) and PLACL (2016: 4.3%).
Mortality
Mortality assumptions have been derived with reference to CMI 2016 mortality tables for both base table rates and mortality improvements 
(2016: ELT17 for base table rates, CMI 2015 for mortality improvements). These tables have been adjusted to reflect the expected future 
mortality experience of mortgage contract holders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the sales process 
and the Group’s assessment of how this experience will develop in the future. This assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and 
population studies, published research materials and management’s own experience.
Property prices
The value of a property at the date of valuation is calculated by taking the latest valuation for that property and indexing this value using the 
Office for National Statistics monthly index for the property’s location. The appropriateness of this valuation basis is regularly tested on the 
event of redemption of mortgages. 
Future property prices
In the absence of a reliable long-term forward curve for UK residential property price inflation, the Group has made an assumption about future 
residential property price inflation based upon available market and industry data. These assumptions have been derived with reference to the 
long-term expectation of the UK retail price inflation, “RPI”, (consistent with the Bank of England inflation target) plus an allowance for the 
expectation of house price growth above RPI (property risk premium) less a margin for a combination of risks including property dilapidation 
and basis risk. An additional allowance is made for the volatility of future property prices. This results in a single rate of future house price 
growth of 4.25%, with a volatility assumption of 12% per annum.
Voluntary redemptions 
Assumptions for future voluntary redemption levels are based on the Group’s recent analyses and external benchmarking. The assumed 
redemption rate varies by duration and product line between 0.7% and 3.0% for loans written by JRL (2016: 0.7% and 2.3%) and between 0.9% 
and 2.8% for loans written by PLACL (2016: 1.8% and 4.5%).
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonable possible alternative assumptions for unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in 
the fair value of the assets. The Group has estimated the impact on fair value to changes to these inputs as follows:
Loans secured by residential mortgages valuation assumptions
Net increase/(decrease) in fair value (£m)

2016 (5.9) 36.8 (79.8) (46.4) (30.7)
The sensitivity factors are determined via financial models. The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions 
remaining constant. In reality such an occurrence is unlikely due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted 
that these sensitivities are non-linear and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Group’s assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any 
actual market movement occurs.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only 
represents the Group’s view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty.
Loans secured by commercial mortgages
Principal assumption underlying the calculation of loans secured by commercial mortgages
The discount rate is the most significant assumption applied in calculating the fair value of the loans secured by commercial mortgages. The 
discount rate used is 0.9% (2016: 0.9%) plus a spread % of between 1.3% (2016: 1.3%) and 2.8% (2016: 2.8%) depending on the individual loan.
Sensitivity analysis

Redemption and defaults
The redemption and default assumptions used in the valuation of infrastructure loans are similar to the Group’s bond portfolio. They have 
additional covenants which provide greater security but these are not quantified in the valuation.
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonable possible alternative assumptions for unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in 
the fair value of the assets. The sensitivity of the valuation of infrastructure loans to the default assumption is determined by reference to the 
movement in credit spreads.

Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts
Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts represent fully reinsured funds invested under the Flexible Pension Plan. The linked 
liabilities are included in Level 3 investment contract liabilities.
Principal assumptions and sensitivity of fair value
Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts are valued based on the price of the reinsured underlying funds determined by the asset 
managers. The assets are classified as Level 3 because the prices are not validated by internal models or the observable inputs used by the 
asset managers are not available. Therefore, there are no principal assumptions used in the valuation of these Level 3 assets.
Investment contract liabilities
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of investment contract liabilities 
Maintenance expenses
Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Group’s recent expense analyses. The assumed future expense levels incorporate 
an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.4% (2016: 4.5%).
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of fair value to changes in maintenance expense assumptions in respect of investment contract liabilities is not material.
Deposits received from reinsurers
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of deposits received from reinsurers 
Discount rate
The valuation model discounts the expected future cash flows using a contractual discount rate derived from the assets hypothecated to back 
the liabilities at a product level. The discount rates used for individual retirement and individual care annuities were 3.11% and 0.95% 
respectively (2016: 3.24% and 1.17% respectively). 
Credit spreads
The valuation of deposits received from reinsurers includes a credit spread applied by the individual reinsurer. A credit spread of 102bps (2016: 
166bps) was applied in respect of the most significant reinsurance contract.
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonable possible alternative assumptions for unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in 
the fair value of the liabilities (see note 25 (b)). The Group has estimated the impact on fair value to changes to these inputs as follows:

(a) Terms and conditions of insurance contracts
The Group’s long-term insurance contracts include annuities to fund Retirement Income, Guaranteed Income for Life (“GIfL”) and Defined 
Benefit (“DB”), annuities to fund care fees (immediate needs and deferred), long-term care insurance and whole of life and term protection 
insurance.
The insurance liabilities are agreed by the Board using recognised actuarial valuation methods proposed by the Group’s Actuarial Reporting 
Function. In particular, a prospective gross premium valuation method has been adopted for major classes of business.
Although the process for the establishment of insurance liabilities follows specified rules and guidelines, the provisions that result from the 
process remain uncertain. As a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual value of claims could vary from the amounts provided to cover 
future claims. The Group seeks to provide for appropriate levels of contract liabilities taking known facts and experiences into account but 
nevertheless such provisions remain uncertain.
The estimation process used in determining insurance liabilities involves projecting future annuity payments and the cost of maintaining the 
contracts. For non-annuity contracts, the liability is determined as the sum of the discounted value of future benefit payments and future 
administration expenses less the expected value of premiums payable under the contract. The key sensitivities are the assumed level of interest 
rates and the mortality experience.
(b) Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance contracts
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance contracts are as follows:
Mortality assumptions
Mortality assumptions have been set by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables. These tables have been adjusted to reflect the 
future mortality experience of the policyholders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the underwriting 
process, premium size, gender and the Group’s assessment of how this experience will develop in the future. The assessment takes into 
consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Group’s lead reinsurer and management’s 
own industry experience.
The standard tables which underpin the mortality assumptions are summarised in the table below.

Valuation discount rates
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regards to yields on supporting assets. An explicit allowance for credit risk is included by 
making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on a prudent expectation of default experience of 
each asset class.

Future expenses
Assumptions for future policy expense levels are determined from the Group’s recent expense analyses. The assumed future policy expense 
levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.4% (2016: 4.5%) derived from the expected retail price index implied by inflation swap 
rates and an additional allowance for earnings inflation.

Effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the period
Economic assumption changes
The principal economic assumption change impacting the movement in insurance liabilities during the period relates to discount rates for both 
JRL and PLACL.
Discount rates
The movement in the valuation interest rate captures the impact of underlying changes in risk-free curves and spreads on backing assets. Both 
existing in-force assets and new assets purchased during the period contribute to the movement in the discount rate. Differences between the 
discount rates recognised on new business written during the period and the prevailing discount rates on the entire portfolio of business also 
contribute to the movement in insurance liabilities. 
Non-economic assumption changes
The principal non-economic assumption changes impacting the movement in insurance liabilities during the period relate to maintenance 
expenses for both JRL and PLACL, and DB mortality for JRL. 
22 Insurance contracts and related reinsurance continued 115
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Financial Statements
Expense assumption
Cost synergies arising within the Group following the merger have been recognised through an overall reduction in maintenance expense 
assumptions. This has resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The JRL GIfL maintenance expense assumption used at 31 December 2017 was £30.68 per plan (2016: £46.68), whilst the JRL DB maintenance 
assumption used at 31 December 2017 was £113.53 per scheme member (2016: £56.61). The PLACL GIfL maintenance expense assumption 
used at 31 December 2017 was £23.69 per plan (2016: £32.30), whilst the PLACL DB maintenance assumption used at 31 December 2017 was 
£128.02 per scheme member (2016: £32.85). An increase in the maintenance expense assumption increases the carrying value of the insurance 
liabilities. Relative to the 2016 assumptions, there has been a re-allocation of expenses between GIfL and DB reflecting improvements made to 
the method of apportionment of expenses to specific products in the Group’s expense allocation process.
Mortality assumptions
The JRL DB mortality basis for standard underwritten business at 31 December 2017 has been set with reference to modified E&W Population 
mortality tables, calibrated from Club Vita experience, with CMI 2016 model mortality improvements (2016: Reinsurer supplied tables, with CMI 
2009 model mortality improvements).

(e) Sensitivity analysis
The Group has estimated the impact on profit for the year in relation to insurance contracts and related reinsurance from changes in key 
assumptions relating to financial assets and liabilities.
Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied
Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in the market interest rates by +/- 1% (e.g. if a current interest rate is 5%, the 
impact of an immediate change to 4 and 6% respectively). The test consistently allows for similar changes 
to both assets and liabilities
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%
Base mortality rates The impact of a decrease in base table mortality rates by 5% applied to both Retirement Income liabilities 
and mortgage assets
Immediate property price fall The impact of an immediate decrease in the value of properties by 10%. The test allows for the impact on 
the Retirement Income liabilities arising from any change in yield on the loans secured by residential 
mortgages and loans secured by commercial mortgages used to back the liabilities
Future property price growth The impact of a reduction in future property price growth by 0.5% 
Voluntary redemptions The impact of an increase in voluntary redemption rates on loans secured by residential and commercial 
mortgages by 10%. The test allows for the impact on the annuity liabilities arising from any change in 
yield on the loans secured by residential mortgages and loans secured by commercial mortgages used to 
back the liabilities

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
The sensitivity factors are applied via financial models. The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions 
remaining constant. In reality, such an occurrence is unlikely, due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be 
noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from these results. 
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Group’s assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any 
actual market movement occurs. The impacts indicated above for insurance contracts also reflect movements in financial derivatives, which 
are impacted by movements in interest rates. Related reinsurance assets are not impacted by financial derivatives.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only 
represents the Group’s view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption 
that there is a parallel shift in interest rates at all durations.

(a) Terms and conditions of investment contracts
The Group writes Flexible Pension Plan products for the at-retirement market. Policyholder premiums are invested in selected unit-linked funds, 
with the policyholder able to drawdown on funds, the return on which will be based on actual investment returns.
The Group has written Capped Drawdown products for the at-retirement market. These products are no longer available to new customers. In 
return for a single premium, these contracts pay a guaranteed lump sum on survival to the end of the fixed term. There is an option at outset to 
select a lower sum at maturity and regular income until the earlier of death or maturity. Upon death of the policyholder and subject to the 
option selected at the outset, there may be a return of premium less income received or income payable to a dependant until the death of that 
dependant.
(b) Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of investment contracts
Valuation discount rates
Valuation discount rate assumptions for investment contracts are set with regards to yields on supporting assets. An explicit allowance for 
credit risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on historical default 
experience of each asset class.

25 Other financial liabilities continued
(a) Derivative financial liabilities and obligations for repayment of cash collateral received
The derivative financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss. All financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are 
designated as such on initial recognition or, in the case of derivative financial liabilities, are classified as held for trading.
(b) Deposits received from reinsurers
Deposits received from reinsurers are measured in accordance with the reinsurance contract and taking into account an appropriate discount 
rate for the timing of expected cash flows of the liabilities.
(c) Reinsurance finance
The reinsurance finance has been established in recognition of the loan obligation to the reinsurers under the Group’s reinsurance financing 
arrangements, the repayment of which are contingent upon the emergence of surplus under the old Solvency I valuation rules.
(d) Reinsurance funds withheld
Reinsurance funds withheld are measured and valued in accordance with the reinsurance contract, which takes into account an appropriate 
discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
26 Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates, counterparty credit risk, inflation and foreign 
exchange risk, including interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, inflation swaps, credit default swaps, and foreign currency asset swaps.

The Group’s derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in their fair value are included in profit or 
loss. Derivatives are used to manage the Group’s European embedded value and regulatory capital, which is affected by a surplus of long dated 
fixed interest securities when liabilities are measured on a realistic basis.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. (“ISDA”) 
master agreements, and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under 
each of these market master agreements.
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had pledged collateral of £119.3m (2016: £176.6m) of which £5.8m were gilts and European Investment 
Bank bonds (2016: £105.6m) and had received cash collateral of £16.3m (2016: £52.2m).

27 Reinsurance
The Group uses reinsurance as an integral part of its risk and capital management activities. New business was reinsured via longevity swap 
arrangements as follows:
• DB is 55% reinsured for underwritten schemes, and 75% for non-underwritten schemes (55% prior to 1 January 2016) 
• GIfL is 75% reinsured (45% prior to 1 January 2016) 
• Care is 42.5% reinsured (90% prior to 1 April 2016)
• Protection is 65% reinsured 
In-force business is reinsured under longevity swap and quota share treaties. The quota share treaties have deposit back or premium withheld 
arrangements to remove the majority of the reinsurer credit risk.
The quota share treaties entered into by the Group’s subsidiary, JRL, include financing arrangements (see note 25c), the repayment of which is 
contingent upon the emergence of surplus under the old Solvency I valuation rules. The Group retains a capital benefit under Solvency II from 
the financing arrangements as these form part of the transitional calculations.
These treaties also allow JRL to recapture business once the financing has been repaid. During the period the Group recaptured business in 
respect of certain underwriting years that resulted in a decrease of ceded liabilities of £467.5m and a reduction of equal amount in the deposit 
received.
In addition to the deposits received from reinsurers recognised within other financial liabilities (see note 25b), certain reinsurance arrangements 
within the Group’s subsidiary, PLACL, give rise to deposits from reinsurers that are not included in the Consolidated statement of financial 
position of the Group as described below:
• The Group has an agreement with two reinsurers whereby financial assets arising from the payment of reinsurance premiums, less the 
repayment of claims, in relation to specific treaties, are legally and physically deposited back with the Group. Although the funds are 
managed by the Group (as the Group controls the investment of the asset), no future benefits accrue to the Group as any returns on the 
deposits are paid to reinsurers. Consequently, the deposits are not recognised as assets of the Group and the investment income they 
produce does not accrue to the Group. 
• The Group has an agreement with one reinsurer whereby assets equal to the reinsurer’s full obligation under the treaty are deposited into a 
ringfenced collateral account. The Group has first claim over these assets should the reinsurer default, but as the Group has no control over 
these funds and does not accrue any future benefit, this fund is not recognised as an asset of the Group.

34 Financial and insurance risk management
This note presents information about the major financial and insurance risks to which the Group is exposed, and its objectives, policies and 
processes for their measurement and management. Financial risk comprises exposure to market, credit and liquidity risk.
(a) Insurance risk
The writing of long-term insurance contracts requires a range of assumptions to be made and risk arises from these assumptions being 
materially inaccurate.
The Group’s main insurance risk arises from adverse experience compared with the assumptions used in pricing products and valuing insurance 
liabilities, and in addition its reinsurance treaties may be terminated, not renewed, or renewed on terms less favourable than those under 
existing treaties.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to longevity, mortality and morbidity and exposure to factors such as withdrawal levels and 
management and administration expenses.
Individually underwritten GIfL are priced using assumptions about future longevity that are based on historic experience information, lifestyle 
and medical factors relevant to individual customers, and judgements about the future development of longevity improvements. In the event 
of an increase in longevity, the actuarial reserve required to make future payments to customers may increase.
Loans secured by mortgages are used to match some of the liabilities arising from the sale of GIfL and DB business. In the event that early 
repayments in a given period are higher than anticipated, less interest will have accrued on the mortgages and the amount repayable will be 
less than assumed at the time of sale. In the event of an increase in longevity, although more interest will have accrued and the amount 
repayable will be greater than assumed at the time of the sale, the associated cash flows will be received later than had originally been 
anticipated. In addition, a general increase in longevity would have the effect of increasing the total amount repayable, which would increase 
the LTV ratio and could increase the risk of failing to be repaid in full as a consequence of the no-negative equity guarantee. There is also 
morbidity risk exposure as the contract ends when the customer moves into long-term care.
Underpinning the management of insurance risk are:
• The development and use of medical information including PrognoSys™ for both pricing and reserving to provide detailed insight into 
longevity risk; 
• Adherence to approved underwriting requirements; 
• Controls around the development of suitable products and their pricing; 
• Review and approval of assumptions used by the Board; 
• Regular monitoring and analysis of actual experience; 
• Use of reinsurance to minimise volatility of capital requirement and profit; and 
• Monitoring of expense levels. 
Concentrations of insurance risk
Concentration of insurance risk comes from improving longevity. Improved longevity arises from enhanced medical treatment and improved 
life circumstances. Concentration risk is managed by writing business across a wide range of different medical and lifestyle conditions to avoid 
excessive exposure. 120
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
(b) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss or of adverse change in the financial situation resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level and in 
the volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and financial instruments, together with the impact of changes in interest rates.
Significant market risk is implicit in the insurance business and arises from exposure to interest rate risk, property risk, inflation risk and 
currency risk. The Group is not exposed to any equity risk or material currency risk.
Market risk represents both upside and downside impacts but the Group’s policy to manage market risk is to limit downside risk. Falls in the 
financial markets can reduce the value of pension funds available to purchase Retirement Income products and changes in interest rates can 
affect the relative attractiveness of Retirement Income products. Changes in the value of the Group’s investment portfolio will also affect the 
Group’s financial position.
In mitigation, Retirement Income product monies are invested to match the asset and liability cash flows as closely as practicable. In practice, 
it is not possible to eliminate market risk fully as there are inherent uncertainties surrounding many of the assumptions underlying the 
projected asset and liability cash flows.
For each of the material components of market risk, described in more detail below, the market risk policy sets out the risk appetite and 
management processes governing how each risk should be measured, managed, monitored and reported.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its impact on the value of, or income from, specific assets, liabilities or both. It seeks to limit 
its exposure through appropriate asset and liability matching and hedging strategies.
The Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates is concentrated in the investment portfolio, loans secured by mortgages and its insurance 
obligations. Changes in investment and loan values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting 
changes in the value of insurance liabilities. The Group monitors this exposure through regular reviews of the asset and liability position, capital 
modelling, sensitivity testing and scenario analyses. Interest rate risk is also managed using derivative instruments e.g. swaps and swaptions.
The following table indicates the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates for the Group’s significant financial assets.

(ii) Property risk
The Group’s exposure to property risk arises from indirect exposure to the UK residential property market through the provision of lifetime 
mortgages. A substantial decline or sustained underperformance in UK residential property prices, against which the Group’s lifetime 
mortgages are secured, could result in proceeds on sale being exceeded by the mortgage debt at the date of redemption. Demand may also 
reduce for lifetime mortgage products through reducing consumers’ propensity to borrow and by reducing the amount they are able to borrow 
due to reductions in property values and the impact on loan-to-value limits.
The risk is mitigated by ensuring that the advance represents a low proportion of the property’s value at outset and independent third party 
valuations are undertaken on each property before initial mortgages are advanced. Lifetime mortgage contracts are also monitored through 
dilapidation reviews. House prices are monitored and the impact of exposure to adverse house prices (both regionally and nationally) is 
regularly reviewed.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of property price movements on profit before tax is included in note 22(e).
(iii) Inflation risk
Inflation risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets or liabilities or both in combination, arising from relative or 
absolute changes in inflation or in the volatility of inflation.
Exposure to inflation occurs in relation to the Group’s own management expenses and its matching of index-linked Retirement Income 
products. Its impact is managed through the application of disciplined cost control over its management expenses and through matching its 
index-linked assets and index-linked liabilities for the inflation risk associated with its index-linked Retirement Income products.
(iv) Currency risk
Currency risk arises from fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies, from relative or absolute 
changes in foreign exchange rates or in the volatility of exchange rates.
Exposure to currency risk could arise from the Group’s investment in non-sterling denominated assets. From time to time, the Group acquires 
fixed income securities denominated in US dollars or other foreign currencies for its financial asset portfolio. All material Group liabilities are in 
sterling. As the Group does not wish to introduce foreign exchange risk into its investment portfolio, derivative or quasi-derivative contracts are 
entered into to eliminate the foreign exchange exposure as far as possible.
(c) Credit risk
Credit risk arises if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
Credit risk exposures arise from:
• Holding fixed income investments where the main risks are default and market risk. The risk of default (where the counterparty fails to pay 
back the capital and/or interest on a corporate bond) is mitigated by investing only in higher quality or investment grade assets. Market risk 
is the risk of bond prices falling as a result of concerns over the counterparty, or over the market or economy in which the issuing company 
operates. This leads to wider spreads (the difference between redemption yields and a risk-free return), the impact of which is mitigated 
through the use of a “hold to maturity” strategy. Concentration of credit risk exposures is managed by placing limits on exposures to 
individual counterparties and limits on exposures to credit rating levels. 
• The Group also manages credit risk on its corporate bond portfolio through the appointment of specialist fund managers, who execute a 
diversified investment strategy, investing in investment-grade assets and imposing individual counterparty limits. Current economic and 
market conditions are closely monitored, as are spreads on the bond portfolio in comparison with benchmark data. 
• Counterparties in derivative contracts – the Group uses financial instruments to mitigate interest rate and currency risk exposures. It 
therefore has credit exposure to various counterparties through which it transacts these instruments, although this is usually mitigated by 
collateral arrangements (see note 26). 
• Reinsurance – reinsurance is used to manage longevity risk but, as a consequence, credit risk exposure arises should a reinsurer fail to meet 
its claim repayment obligations. Credit risk on reinsurance balances is mitigated by the reinsurer depositing back more than 100% of 
premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement. 
• Cash balances – credit risk on cash assets is managed by imposing restrictions over the credit ratings of third parties with whom cash is 
deposited.
• Credit risk – credit risks for loans secured by mortgages has been considered within “property risk” above.

The carrying amount of those assets subject to credit risk represents the maximum credit risk exposure.
(d) Liquidity risk
The investment of Retirement Income cash in corporate bonds, gilts and lifetime mortgages, and commitments to pay policyholders and other 
obligations, requires liquidity risks to be taken.
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss because the Group, although solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to it in order to 
meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
Exposure to liquidity risk arises from:
• Deterioration in the external environment caused by economic shocks, regulatory changes or reputational damage; 
• Realising assets to meet liabilities during stressed market conditions; 
• Increasing cash flow volatility in the short term giving rise to mismatches between cash flows from assets and requirements from liabilities; 
• Needing to support liquidity requirements for day-to-day operations; 
• Ensuring financial support can be provided across the Group; and 
• Maintaining and servicing collateral requirements arising from the changes in market value of financial derivatives used by the Group. 
Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due. The Group’s 
short-term liquidity requirements are predominantly funded by advance Retirement Income premium payments, investment coupon receipts, 
and bond principal repayments out of which contractual payments need to be made. There are significant barriers for policyholders to 
withdraw funds that have already been paid to the Group in the form of premiums. Cash outflows associated with Retirement Income liabilities 
can be reasonably estimated and liquidity can be arranged to meet this expected outflow through asset-liability matching and new business 
premiums.
The cash flow characteristics of the lifetime mortgages are reversed when compared with Retirement Income products, with cash flows 
effectively representing an advance payment, which is eventually funded by repayment of principal plus accrued interest. Policyholders are able 
to redeem mortgages, albeit at a cost. The mortgage assets are considered illiquid, as they are not readily saleable due to the uncertainty 
about their value and the lack of a market in which to trade them.
Cash flow forecasts over the short, medium and long terms are regularly prepared to predict and monitor liquidity levels in line with limits set 
on the minimum amount of liquid assets required.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the financial liabilities, including both principal and interest payments, of the Group based

35 Capital
Since 1 January 2016, the Group has been required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a new regulatory basis and to comply with 
the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) in the UK. The 
Group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain eligible capital, or “Own Funds” in excess of the value of their Solvency Capital 
Requirements (SCR). The SCR represents the risk capital required to be set aside to absorb 1 in 200 year stress tests of each risk type that the 
Group is exposed to, including longevity risk, property risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. These risks are all aggregated with appropriate 
allowance for diversification benefits.
In December 2015, Just Retirement Group plc and JRL received approval to calculate their Solvency II capital requirements using a full internal 
model which continued to be used for those parts of the Group at December 2016. The capital requirement for the ex-Partnership business is 
assessed using the standard formula.
The surplus of Own Funds over the SCR is called “Excess Own Funds” and this effectively acts as working capital for the Group. The overriding 
objective of the Solvency II capital framework is to ensure there is sufficient capital within the insurance company to protect policyholders and 
meet their payments when due.
The Group’s capital position can be adversely affected by a number of factors, in particular factors that erode the Group’s capital resources and/
or which impact the quantum of risk to which the Group is exposed. In addition, any event which erodes current profitability and is expected to 
reduce future profitability and/or make profitability more volatile could impact the Group’s capital position, which in turn could have a negative 
effect on the Group’s results of operations.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital for all subsidiaries are:
• To comply with the insurance capital requirements required by the regulators of the insurance markets where the Group operates. The 
Group’s policy is to manage its capital in line with its risk appetite and in accordance with regulatory requirements; 
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders; and 
• To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing insurance and investment contracts commensurately with the level of risk.
Group entities that are under supervisory regulation and are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital include:
• Just Retirement Limited and Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited – authorised by the PRA, and regulated by the PRA and FCA. 
• HUB Financial Solutions Limited, Just Retirement Money Limited, and Partnership Home Loans Limited – authorised and regulated by the 
FCA. 
The Group and its regulated subsidiaries complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1 Accounting policies
General information
Just Group plc (formerly JRP Group plc) (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 13 June 2013 as a public 
company limited by shares. 
1.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union effective for accounting periods commencing on or before 1 January 2017 and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies followed in the Company financial statements are the same as those in 
the consolidated accounts. Values are expressed to the nearest £0.1m.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income. The loss arising in the year amounts to £21.7m (18 month period to 31 December 2016: retained profit 
£74.7m).
1.2 Net investment income
Investment income is accrued up to the balance sheet date. Investment expenses and charges are recognised on an accruals basis.
1.3 Taxation
Taxation is based on profits for the period as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments to 
provisions for prior periods.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or 
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise carried forward tax losses against which the reversal of 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on 
an undiscounted basis.
1.4 Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
1.5 Financial investments
Financial investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. Investments in subordinated debt issued by 
subsidiary companies are valued at amortised cost.
1.6 Share-based payments
The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn scheme for all employees. The share-based 
payment plans operated by the Group are all equity-settled plans. Under IFRS 2, Share-based payment, where the Company, as the Parent 
Company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such 
share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the 
investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised 
directly in equity. The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, 
the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

Warning about unsolicited approaches to shareholders and “Boiler Room” scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in UK investments. These operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. These “brokers” 
can be very persistent and persuasive. Just Group plc shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of such approaches and advised to only 
deal with firms authorised by the FCA. You can check whether an enquirer is properly authorised and report scam approaches by contacting the 
FCA on www.fca.org.uk/consumers or by calling the FCA Consumer Helpline: 0800 111 6768.

Glossary and definitions
Acquisition costs – acquisition costs comprise the direct costs 
(such as commissions) of obtaining new business. 
Adjusted earnings per share – an APM, this measures earnings per 
share based on adjusted operating profit after attributed tax, rather 
than IFRS profit before tax.  This measure is calculated by taking the 
adjusted operating profit APM, reduced for the effective tax rate 
(19.25% for 2017), and dividing this result by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue by the Group for the period.
Adjusted operating profit – an APM and one of the Group’s KPIs, this 
is the sum of the new business operating profit and in-force operating 
profit together with the impact of one-off assumption changes, 
experience variances, results of the other Group companies and 
financing costs. Adjusted operating profit is reconciled to IFRS profit 
before tax on page 33.
Alternative performance measure (“APM”) – in addition to statutory 
IFRS performance measures, the Group has presented a number of 
non-statutory alternative performance measures (APMs) within the 
Annual Report & Accounts.  The Board believes that the APMs used 
give a more representative view of the underlying performance of the 
Group.  APMs are identified in this glossary together with a reference 
to where the APM has been reconciled to its nearest statutory 
equivalent.  APMs which are also KPIs are indicated as such.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets – amortisation 
costs relate to the amortisation of the Group’s intangible assets, 
including the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in relation 
to the acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc by Just 
Retirement Group plc. 
Auto-enrolment – new legal duties being phased in that require 
employers to automatically enrol workers into a workplace pension.
Buy-in – an exercise enabling a pension scheme to obtain an 
insurance contract that pays a guaranteed stream of income 
sufficient to cover the liabilities of a group of the scheme’s members.
Buy-out – an exercise that wholly transfers the liability for paying 
member benefits from the pension scheme to an insurer which then 
becomes responsible for paying the members directly.
Capped Drawdown – a non-marketed product from Just Group 
previously described as Fixed Term Annuity. Capped Drawdown 
products ceased to be available to new customers when the tax 
legislation changed for pensions in April 2015.
Care Plan – a specialist insurance contract contributing to the costs 
of long-term care by paying a guaranteed income to a registered care 
provider for the remainder of a person’s life.
Change in insurance liabilities – change in insurance liabilities 
represents the difference between the year-on-year change in the 
carrying value of the Group’s insurance liabilities and the year-on-
year change in the carrying value of the Group’s reinsurance assets 
including the effect of the impact of reinsurance recaptures.
Combined Group/Just Group – following completion of the merger 
with Partnership Assurance Group plc, Just Group plc and each of its 
consolidated subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings comprising 
the Just Retirement Group and the Partnership Assurance Group.
Defined benefit pension scheme – a pension scheme, usually backed 
or ‘sponsored’ by an employer, that pays members a guaranteed level 
of retirement income based on length of membership and earnings.
Defined contribution (“DC”) pension scheme – a work-based or 
personal pension scheme in which contributions are invested to build 
up a fund that can be used by the individual member to provide 
retirement benefits.
De-risk/de-risking – an action carried out by the trustees of a pension 
scheme with the aim of transferring investment, inflation and 
longevity risk from the sponsoring employer and scheme to a third 
party such as an insurer.
Drawdown – (in reference to Just Group sales or products) collective 
term for Flexible Pension Plan and Capped Drawdown.
Economic capital coverage ratio – an APM and one of the Group’s 
KPIs, economic capital is a key risk-based capital measure and 
expresses the Board’s view of the available capital as a percentage of 
the required capital.
Employee benefits consultant (“EBC”) – an adviser offering specialist 
knowledge to employers on the legal, regulatory and practical issues 
of rewarding staff including non-wage compensation such as 
pensions, health and life insurance and profit sharing.
Equity release – products and services enabling homeowners to 
generate income or lump sums by accessing some of the value of 
the home while continuing to live in it.
European embedded value (“EEV”) – an APM and one of the Group’s 
KPIs. EEV represents the sum of shareholders’ net assets and the 
value of in-force business, and is a key measure in assessing the 
future profit streams of the Group’s long-term business. It also 
recognises the additional value of profits in the business that has 
been written but not yet recognised under IFRS accounting. European 
embedded value is reconciled to IFRS net equity on page 27.
Finance costs – finance costs represent interest payable on 
reinsurance deposits and financing, the interest on the Group’s 
Tier 2 Notes, and, in the prior year, bank finance costs.
Flexi-access drawdown – the option introduced in April 2015 for 
DC pension savers who have taken tax-free cash to take a taxable 
income directly from their remaining pension with no limit on 
withdrawals.
Gross premiums written – gross premiums written are the total 
premiums received by the Group in relation to its Retirement Income 
and Protection sales in the period, gross of commission paid.
Guaranteed Guidance – see Pensions Wise on page 135.
Guaranteed income for life (“GIfL”) – retirement income products 
which transfer the investment and longevity risk to the company and 
provide the retiree a guarantee to pay an agreed level of income for 
as long as a retiree lives. On a “joint-life” basis, continues to pay a 
guaranteed income to a surviving spouse/partner. Just provides 
modern individually underwritten GIfL solutions.
IFRS net assets – one of the Group’s KPIs, representing the assets 
attributable to equity holders. 
IFRS profit before tax – one of the Group’s KPIs, representing the 
profit before tax attributable to equity holders.
In-force operating profit – an APM and one of the Group’s KPIs, 
capturing the expected margin to emerge from the in-force book of
