Financial performance and dividends
The group’s revenue was £21m higher than last year, at £919m 
(2016:	£898m).	While 	Airspace	customers	benefited	from	real	price	
reductions under the RP2 Performance Plan, the related reductions in 
revenue were more than offset by additional revenue from the increase 
in	flights	handled.
This	year	we	safely	handled	an	additional	7.6%	of	flights.	This	growth 	
was much higher than assumed in our RP2 Performance Plan set when 
jet	fuel	prices	were	much	higher	than	today	and	flights	were	projected 
to	grow	by	only	2%.	We	also	generated	additional	income	from	
supporting	the	UK	military	with	Project	Marshall,	which	helped	to	offset	
lower Airports income.
Profit	before	tax	and	goodwill	impairment,	at	£137m	(2016:	£137m) 
was in line with last year. After taking into account a reduced charge 
for	goodwill	impairment	of	£11m	(2016:	£93m),	profit	before	tax	at 	
£126m (2016: £44m) was £82m better.
The Board has reviewed the group’s dividend policy. This now aims 
to	pay	a	regular	and	progressive	dividend	that	reflects	NERL’s	cost	of	
equity	(as	reflected	in	the	RP2	Performance	Plan)	and	any	regulatory	
out-performance	as	well	as	a	pay-out	of	25%	of	profit	after	tax	for	
NATS Services. In addition, from time to time the Board will consider 
the potential for, and affordability of, returning any excess capital to 
shareholders taking into account NERL’s gearing and the overall 
liabilities of the NATS group.
The	Board	paid	dividends	of	£24.0m	in	2017	(2016:	£81.7m).	In	May 	
2017,	the	group	paid	a	first	interim	dividend	of	£28.5m	for	the	2018 	
financial	year.

Progress Defined benefit pension scheme
The	Trustees’	2015	triennial	valuation	reported	an	increase	in	the	deficit	
to £459m (2012 triennial valuation: £383m). As a result, the group 
has agreed to increase its contributions to the scheme and expects 
to meet this increase through an adjustment to NERL’s prices in the 
next	Performance	Plan	period	(based	on	the	EU	performance	scheme	
regulations)	and	from	NATS	Services’	operating	cash	flows.
The Trustees intend to bring forward their next valuation to 31 December 
2017. This will help inform NERL’s Initial Performance Plan for the 
next regulatory reference period (RP3: 2020-2024) on which we will be 
consulting customers and other stakeholders from spring 2018.
UK’s EU referendum decision
While	the	outcome	of	the	UK’s	EU	referendum	decision	and	the 
triggering of Article 50 has not had an adverse impact on the demand 
for	air	travel	to	date,	it	has	potentially	significant	implications	for	the	UK	
aviation sector. 
The company has provided input to the Department for Transport (DfT) 
on	the	regulation	of	Air	Traffic	Management	(ATM)	after	Brexit.	In	our	
view	the	logical	outcome	is	for	the	UK	to	re-establish	national	economic	
regulation	of	UK	ATM	and	to	retain	control	of	this	critical	part	of	the	UK’s	
national infrastructure. This would avoid the complexity and cost of 
having two regulators (the European Commission and the CAA) 
and enable NATS to be more agile in responding to changing  
customer requirements. This would also be the most reliable means 
of	ensuring	that	NERL	continues	to	be	able	to	finance	its	operating	and	
investing activities. 
The	UK	has	played	a	leading	role	in	the	development	of	SES	since	
its introduction and has every incentive to continue working with our 
European partners to maintain high standards of safety and to optimise 
the use of airspace. 
Capital investment
We are upgrading our operation by deploying new technology, to replace 
legacy systems and introduce more advanced systems which will support 
new and modern airspace designs, once approved, as well as improved 
service	resilience	and	operational	flexibility.	The	original	investment	plan	
developed	for	RP2	was	based	on	more	modest	flight	growth.	Following	
changes in the business environment and industry developments in 
technology, we have revised our investment plan for RP2 to accelerate 
the deployment of SESAR technology which, alongside the essential and 
overdue	modernisation	of	airspace	we	expect	to	form	part	of	the	UK	
Government’s aviation strategy, will provide more capacity to meet future 
demand.	The	growth	in	flights	last	summer	(2016)	put	pressure	on	the 	
service with some sectors reaching existing design capacity, resulting in an 
increase in ATC delay. 
HM Government’s shareholding 
Last	year,	I	reported	that	HMG	would	explore	the	sale	of	its	49%	
shareholding	in	NATS.	Since	then,	HMG	has	indicated	that	while 
it has no plans imminently to dispose of its shareholding, it will 
continue to keep its investment under review.
Governance
Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, Andy Lord and Tony Tyler retired 
from	the	Board	during	the	year.	Peter	Read	stepped	down	in	May	2017 	
and Will Facey at the end of June 2017.  Brenda Dean, Andy and Peter 
all played key roles on a number of Board committees over an extended 
period of service. I would like to thank them all for their advice and 
counsel to the Board. 
I	have	been	pleased	to	welcome	Maria	Antoniou	and	Andrew	Barker	to	
the	Board	in	the	year.	Mike	Campbell	joined	the	Board	in	May	2017. 
Each brings a relevant set of skills and experience to the company. 
Outlook 
The	first	two	years	of	RP2	have	been	challenging	as	we	have	faced	
much	higher	than	expected	air	traffic.	Next	year	we	will	be	consulting	
our customers on our Initial Performance Plan for RP3. As the RP2 ATC 
environment is turning out to be quite different to the one assumed, 
we will be making the case for a Performance Plan in RP3 with more 
financial	headroom	to	respond	to	changing	industry	conditions	(e.g.	to	
adjust the level of investment and resources) and to provide enhanced 
operational resilience. We think this is in the interests of our customers. 
Martin	Rolfe,	Chief	Executive,	has	built	a	strong	management	team. 
I would like to express my thanks to them and all of our employees for 
their hard work and dedicated service to the company.

Progress Provide a safe, efficient and reliable service every day
This	year	we	safely	handled	7.6%	more	flights	than	last	year.	We	saw 	
high	growth	rates	in	international	flights,	particularly	from	London	
airports,	and	the	volume	of	North	Atlantic	flights	exceeded	its	previous	
peak	in	2008.	The	number	of	flights	was	also	higher	than	projected	
by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in our Performance Plan for 
Reference Period 2 (RP2: 2015-2019) which, while challenging to handle 
operationally,	has	benefited	our	revenue.
The	basic	structure	of	the	UK’s	airspace	(its	routes,	sectors	and	holding	
patterns)	was	designed	over	50	years	ago	when	traffic	volumes	were	far	
lower than they are today. Airspace in the South East is now operating 
to its maximum capacity during the busiest times of the year. When 
the airspace is at capacity our service performance is very sensitive 
to	the	timing	and	distribution	of	traffic	flows	across	the	country.	This	
was evident last summer when periods of bad weather combined with 
industrial	action	in	neighbouring	countries	(causing	flights	to	divert	into	
UK	airspace)	changed	the	patterns	of	flight	across	the	UK.	We	faced	
similar operational challenges when particularly high demand coincided 
with the introduction of new systems (e.g. iTEC) into our operation.
Our primary objective is to ensure that, irrespective of the prevailing 
conditions,	all	flights	are	handled	safely.	For	this	reason,	on	certain	
days,	we	regulated	traffic	flows	in	some	sectors	of	airspace	to	maintain	
safety	which	resulted	in	more	air	traffic	delay	than	has	been	seen	in	
recent years, and slightly more than our regulatory targets anticipated. 
However, at no point did our performance fall outside of the bounds of 
the RP2 Performance Scheme targets which was very good, considering 
the	scale	of	traffic	growth.	Our	service	was	also	extremely	good	in	
comparison to Europe, with delay amounting to one third of the 
European average. 
Learning from last summer, we have been working closely with 
airlines, airports and the CAA over the winter to assess demand across 
the	UK	airspace	network	and	to	develop	a	strategy	to	minimise	delay 
this summer.
Deliver SESAR technology and transform the business 
for the future
The longer term solution to minimising delay during periods of high 
demand	is	the	combination	of	new	technology	and	modern	UK	airspace	
structures. The process of modernising airspace started in the previous 
financial	year	but	further	stages	have	been	paused	pending	Government	
consultation	on	a	UK	aviation	strategy	over	the	next	year.
We expect this strategy to include greater Government emphasis on 
airspace	modernisation	and	its	effect	on	those	who	are	overflown.	
Modernising	airspace	will	significantly	increase	its	capacity	but,	like	
runway	capacity	enhancement,	there	are	significant	social	and	political	
hurdles (such as public opposition to changing aircraft noise patterns) to 
be overcome, even when the noise impact is an overall improvement for 
a community. By engaging effectively with local communities, alongside 
airports and airlines, we can establish rules for respite and distribution 
that can help mitigate some of the noise impact on the ground. 
We also welcome Government’s clear decision on the location of a new 
runway and a faster planning process to deliver it. We have already 
started working with Heathrow Airport and other stakeholders to review 
the design of the local airspace, taking account of safety, noise and other 
environmental considerations. 
We consulted customers during the year on a revised capital investment 
plan for RP2. This follows changes that we have seen in the business 
environment	(such	as	higher	than	expected	traffic	growth)	and	progress	
made by the industry in developing SESAR technologies, such as iTEC. In 
a programme we refer to as Deploying SESAR
5
, we propose to accelerate 
the	deployment	of	new	technology	to	deliver	capacity	and	safety	benefits	
to customers more quickly while reducing our investment in legacy 
systems and their running costs. To achieve this, we expect to invest 
up to £160m more than the RP2 Performance Plan assumed. In order 
to mitigate the impact of this additional investment on prices in future, 
we	have	secured	£100m	of	EU	(INEA)	funding	and	we	are	applying	for	a	
further £30m.
As we deploy new technology we will be retiring our legacy systems. 
This	requires	significant	change	to	our	operation,	including	the	need	to	
train our people in the use of these new systems and in new methods of 
operation. While the transition will be challenging we will be doing all we 
can to minimise any operational impacts for our customers. 
This year we achieved key programme milestones, developing our ability 
to manage similar transitions in future: we delivered a new system to 
control upper airspace from our Prestwick Centre and we have started 
trial	operational	use	of	electronic	flight	strips	in	our	Swanwick	terminal	
control operation.

Win and retain commercial business
We are working hard to strengthen that part of our business which is not 
economically	regulated.	In	particular,	within	the	UK	we	face	increasing	
competition for the provision of airports ATC. Our response is to build 
trusting	and	sustainable	partnerships	with	UK	airport	customers,	
combined with a clear and compelling proposition for different airport 
market segments and to use advances in technology to improve price 
competitiveness.
During the year we were awarded the ATC contract by George Best 
Belfast City Airport and renewed ATC contracts with Aberdeen, Glasgow 
and Southampton airports, along with our engineering contract with 
Highlands and Islands Airports. However, the Edinburgh Airport ATC 
service	will	transfer	to	a	competitor	at	the	end	of	March	2018	and	we	
are working with the airport and its new provider on the transition of this 
service. This is evidence that we must continue to innovate and offer our 
service cost effectively. 
Digital	towers	(which	see	air	traffic	controllers	manage	aircraft	from	
remote facilities instead of in traditional airport towers) are becoming 
a demonstrably viable option for airports and have the potential to 
transform the way air navigation services at airports are delivered: 
London City has announced plans for a digital tower service in the future. 
In	April	2017,	we	invested	£5m	to	acquire	a	50%	interest	in	Searidge 	
Technologies, a Canadian provider of digital tower capability, and during 
the year we continued to develop a digital tower capability at Swanwick. 
Together these enable us to offer a wider choice of digital tower 
solutions to customers depending on their requirements.
We	are	supporting	our	Aquila	joint	venture	with	its	delivery	of	the	MOD’s	
Project	Marshall.	The	service	provision	element	of	this	contract	is	
performing extremely well. However, the asset provision element has 
faced schedule challenges. Together with our joint venture partner, 
Thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and 
execute on a delivery schedule for asset provision that will ensure our 
military customer has the capability required to perform its mission. 
We continue to develop our international activities, focusing on the 
Middle	East	and	Asia	Pacific.	Of	note	this	year	was	the	award	of	an	
airspace design contract in Thailand.
Our people
One	of	the	priorities	I	have	set	for	the	2018	financial	year	(see	below) 
is a focus on our people. 
We have a record of good relations with our employees and enjoy 
generally	constructive	relationships	with	our	Trades	Unions.	However,	
all parties faced a challenging pay round last summer and, on its 
conclusion,	we	jointly	reflected	that	our	ways	of	working	and	partnership	
approach needed to be reinvigorated and renewed. We are now working 
with union representatives to understand how we can work together 
more effectively; an objective which will take time but to which we 
are all committed.
As	noted	above,	a	large	part	of	our	strategy	over	the	next	five	years	is	
to replace much of our technical infrastructure. This infrastructure has 
served	us	well	but	is	coming	to	the	end	of	its	useful	life.	Updating	this	
technology	will	be	a	significant	change	for	everyone	working	for	NATS	
and this priority recognises that we will need to support our people 
through this transformation.
Our priorities for 2018
 > Provide	safe	and	resilient	air	traffic	services	from	our	airports 
and centres;
 > Focus on our people and employee relations as we transform our 
infrastructure;
 > Achieve Swanwick site acceptance testing for London City 
Digital Tower;
 > Deliver key Deploying SESAR milestones: expanding electronic 
flight	strips	in	Terminal	Control	and	fit	out	Combined	Operations	room 
at Swanwick;
 > Provide support to Heathrow and Hong Kong for their third runways; and
 > Enhance the Oceanic technical platform and Operations at Prestwick.
Our immediate focus is ensuring that we have the right resources to 
support this summer’s airline schedules so as to minimise the need for 
regulations that cause delay to the travelling public. We are also focusing 
on	continuing	the	delivery	of	electronic	flight	strips	which	transition	from	
trial to full operational use in our terminal control operation starting in 
January 2018. Finally, we are starting to turn our attention to developing 
next year’s business plan which will form our initial proposal to customers 
for RP3 (calendar years: 2020 to 2024). Our key objective in developing this 
plan	will	be	to	ensure	that	we	have	sufficient	resources	in	RP3	to	continue	
to	deliver	a	safe	and	efficient	service	to	the	travelling	public	which	is	
resilient to changing circumstances and operational conditions.

Progress The	group	reported	a	profit	before	tax	of	£125.5m	(2016:	£44.4m),	an 	
improvement	of	£81.1m	on	last	year	mainly	reflecting	a	reduced	goodwill	
impairment	charge	(by	£81.7m).	Profit	before	goodwill	impairment	was 	
in line with last year at £136.5m (2016: £137.1m). The factors impacting 
the results are as follows: 
Regulatory return
We assess the performance of NERL’s regulated activities by reference 
to the RP2 Performance Plan. In its second year of RP2 (calendar 
year	2016),	NERL	achieved	a	pre-tax	real	return	of	8.2%	compared 	
with	the	regulatory	return	of	5.8%	for	that	year.	This	mainly	reflected	
additional	revenue	from	faster	growth	in	air	traffic	volumes	than	the	
RP2 Performance Plan and which offset higher operating costs, which 
exclude staff pensions, than the economic regulator assumed.
While we have performed better in the early years of the reference period, 
we face higher costs in the latter years (from pay and the dual running of 
legacy and new systems during a transition period). Taking these factors 
into account we expect to achieve the regulatory rate of return over the 
five	year	period.	
Comparison of reported profit and regulatory return
Profit	reported	in	these	financial	statements	is	prepared	in	accordance	
with IFRS and policies described in note 2 to these accounts. As 
described below, the CAA applies an economic regulatory building block 
model	which	is	mainly	cash-based.	It	can	give	rise	to	some	significant	
differences	between	reported	operating	profit	and	regulatory	return,	
mainly due to: 
 > lower historical cost depreciation compared with regulatory 
depreciation	which	is	indexed	to	inflation;	and
 > lower accounting pension costs using best estimate 
assumptions prescribed by accounting standards compared 
with cash contributions agreed with Trustees, which include 
a margin for prudence.
This	difference	in	basis	explains	why	NERL’s	reported	operating	profit	
before goodwill impairment is some £60m higher than its regulatory 
profit,	on	the	calendar	year	basis	reported	for	its	regulatory	accounts.
Revenue
Revenue at £919.3m (2016: £898.1m) improved by £21.2m, including 
Airspace	UK	en	route	revenue	which	was	£19.3m	higher.	While	Airspace	
customers	benefited	from	RP2’s	real	price	reductions	this	was	more	
than	offset	by	additional	revenue	from	the	increase	in	flights	that	we	
handled. The latter mitigated a small service penalty of £0.4m (2016: 
£4.6m bonus), relating to increased delays largely due to capacity. Other 
Airspace revenue improved by £3.7m.
Airports revenue was £12.1m lower, following the transfer of the Gatwick 
contract	to	another	provider	in	March	2016.
Defence revenue increased by £15.7m as we continued to support our 
Aquila	joint	venture	with	the	MOD’s	Project	Marshall	contract.
Other	UK	Business	generated	lower	revenue	from	windfarm	mitigation	
services.	Our	International	business	reflected	a	stronger	performance	in	
the	Asia	Pacific	region.

Operating costs
Operating costs, before goodwill impairment and asset disposals, at 
£741.8m were in line with last year (2016: £743.4m).
Staff	costs	of	£415.3m	(2016:	£439.1m)	were	5.4%	lower,	mainly	due	to 	
lower accounting pension costs compared to such costs in the previous 
year.	Before	staff	salary	sacrifice	and	past	service	costs,	the	accrual	
rate	for	the	defined	benefit	scheme	this	year	was	36.0%	(2016:	45.4%)	of 	
pensionable pay. This offset a £9.1m increase in other staff costs.
The average number of staff employed during the year was 4,216 (2016: 
4,196)	and	there	were	4,247	(2016:	4,176)	staff	in	post	at	31	March	2017. 	
Non-staff costs at £177.9m (2016: £176.3m) were £1.6m higher than 
the	previous	year.	This	mainly	reflected	the	increase	in	activity	to	support	
Project	Marshall	which	offset	savings	in	network	communications	and	
staff relocation costs incurred in the previous year.
Depreciation and amortisation increased to £148.6m (2016: £128.0m) 
following	the	deployment	of	the	new	flight	data	processing	system	for	
Prestwick upper airspace.
The prior year result included gains of £7.1m, largely for the sale of the 
Gatwick control tower.
Goodwill impairment 
A goodwill impairment charge of £11.0m was recognised by NERL this 
year (2016: £92.7m), to write down the carrying value to the recoverable 
amount (see notes 2 and 3). This has reduced because, although NERL’s 
revenue	will	benefit	from	the	higher	traffic	forecast	for	the	remainder	of	
RP2, it will also face higher costs in those years. This charge does not 
impact	NERL’s	cash	flows	or	its	regulatory	return.
The carrying value of NERL’s goodwill is intrinsically linked to its 
regulatory settlements and its regulatory asset base (RAB) in particular. 
The	RAB	is	uplifted	annually	for	inflation	and	increases	with	capital	
expenditure and reduces by regulatory depreciation. Regulatory 
depreciation is a source of revenue allowances (explained in the 
description of NERL’s business model). During RP2, NERL’s capital 
investment is projected to be less than regulatory depreciation. 
As a result, the RAB is expected to contract in real terms over RP2, 
despite the additional investment described above.
In assessing the carrying value of goodwill, consideration is also given to 
opportunities to outperform regulatory settlements and any premium a 
purchaser would be willing to pay for a controlling interest, by reference 
to	the	projected	financial	return	indicated	by	the	company’s	business	
plan	and	recent	UK	and	European	market	transactions	in	utilities	and	
airport operators.
Net finance costs
Net	finance	costs	of	£43.2m	were	£17.0m	higher	than	the 	prior	year	
(2016:	£26.2m)	mainly	reflecting	the	change	in	market	value	of	the 	
index-linked swap contract. This swap was taken out in 2003 as an 
economic	hedge	for	NERL’s	revenue	allowance	for	financing	charges,	
which	is	linked	to	inflation.	It	does	not	qualify	for	hedge	accounting	under	
international accounting standards, and changes in its fair value are 
recognised in the income statement. The fair value varies with changes 
in	the	market’s	expectations	of	inflation	and	swap	discount	rates	over	
the time to expiry of the contract in 2026, and can be volatile. This year, 
market conditions resulted in an increase in the swap’s market value 
liability, resulting in a charge of £17.6m (2016: £2.6m credit).
Other	net	finance	costs	of	£25.6m	(2016:	£28.8m)	were	£3.2m	lower, 	
reflecting	a	reduction	in	net	debt.

Progress Share of results of joint ventures and associates 
The group recognised £2.1m (2016: £1.5m) for its share of the post-tax 
profits	of	its	two	joint	ventures:	FerroNATS	and	Aquila,	and	its	associate	
European Satellite Services Provider SAS (ESSP).
Taxation
The tax charge of £21.7m (2016: £16.8m) was at an effective rate of 
17.3%	(2016:	37.8%,	mainly	reflecting	the 	goodwill	impairment	charge).	
This	is	lower	than	the	headline	rate	of	20%,	mainly	reflecting	the	deferred	
tax	impact	of	the	reduction	in	the	corporation	tax	rate	to	17%	from	April 	
2020 and the lower tax rate on patent box income. This is partially offset 
by the goodwill impairment charge, which is not tax deductible. 
NATS’	taxes	generally	arise	in	the	UK,	though	it	undertakes	business	in	
other countries. Wherever we operate we organise our operations to pay 
the correct and appropriate amount of tax at the right time, according 
to relevant national laws, and ensure compliance with the group’s tax 
policies	and	guidelines.	During	the	year	the	company	paid	UK	corporation	
tax of £16.3m (2016: £29.8m) and foreign tax of £0.1m (2016: £0.6m). 
The group also pays other taxes such as employer’s national insurance 
contributions	and	business	rates,	which	are	significant	costs.
The group’s tax strategy is reviewed annually by our Tax Committee and 
covers the application of all direct and indirect taxes to our business 
including corporation tax, payroll taxes and value added tax. The Tax 
Committee reports to the Audit Committee and comprises the Finance 
Director,	the	Head	of	Tax	and	other	senior	finance	professionals	and	
takes	advice	from	a	professional	firm.
We	have	a	positive	working	relationship	with	HM	Revenue	&	Customs	
and we are committed to transparency in all tax matters. This includes 
annual	meetings	with	HMRC	to	review	the	group’s	performance	and	its	
business strategy.
Dividends
The	Board	considered	dividends	at	its	May	and	November	2016 	
meetings.	In	May	it	approved	a	dividend	of	£24.0m	while	in	November	
it	agreed	no	further	dividend	would	be	paid	for	the	year.	This	reflected	
challenging	financial	market	conditions	and	the	resulting	impact	on	UK	
defined	benefit	pension	scheme	liabilities.	Payments	in	the	prior	year	of	
£81.7m included some element for accumulated retained earnings not 
distributed in earlier regulatory reference periods.
In	May	2017	the	company	paid	a	first	interim	dividend	for	the	2017/18 	
financial	year	of	£28.5m.
Balance sheet
The	change	in	financial	position	since	the	start	of	the	year	mainly	reflects	
an	increase	in	the	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	IAS19	funding	deficit	
which offset retained earnings and the reduction in net debt, which is 
explained in this review.

Capital investment
Our revised capital investment plan for RP2 assumes that we invest up 
to £780m (in outturn prices), compared with £620m (in outturn prices) 
assumed in the RP2 Performance Plan. This plan is explained within the 
review of the Safety, regulatory and economic environment. 
This year we spent £156.4m (2016: £147.6m), including £107.2m for 
SESAR Deployment projects. 
Defined benefit pensions
The	group	operates	a	final	salary	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	in	
which	2,768	staff	participated	at	31	March	2017	(2016:	3,324).	The 	
scheme was closed to new entrants from 1 April 2009 and staff who 
are	not	members	of	this	scheme	are	able	to	benefit	from	a	defined	
contribution	scheme.	More	information	on	our	pension	arrangements	
and their governance is provided in note 30 to the consolidated 
financial	statements.
a. Accounting deficit under IAS19
At	31	March	2017,	measured	under	international	accounting	standards 	
(IAS19)	and	the	associated	best	estimate	assumptions,	the	defined	
benefit	scheme	was	in	deficit:	liabilities	(£5,786.3m)	exceeded	assets 	
(£5,435.5m) by £350.8m (2016: £77.4m).
Given	the	size	of	the	scheme	relative	to	the	group,	changes	in	financial	
market conditions can have relatively large impacts on the results and 
financial	position.	IAS19	requires	discount	rates	for	valuing	pension	
obligations to be based on AA corporate bonds. During 2017, while 
the scheme’s assets increased by £752.9m, its liabilities increased by 
£1,026.3m	reflecting	a	130	basis	point	reduction	in	the	real	discount	rate.
b. Trustee valuation and funding obligations
The	funding	of	the	defined	benefit	scheme	is	subject	to	agreement	
between the company and the scheme’s Trustees and is determined 
based on the conclusion of each triennial valuation conducted by 
the Trustees. This valuation uses a wide range of assumptions for 
measuring pension liabilities and legislation requires a margin for 
prudence. As a result the triennial valuation gives rise to a different 
valuation than that disclosed under international accounting standards. 
Last year the Trustees completed a triennial valuation as at 31 December 
2015	(the	2015	valuation).	This	reported	a	funding	deficit	of	£458.7m, 	
an	increase	of	£76.1m	from	their	2012	valuation.	This	mainly	reflected 	
a	deterioration	in	financial	market	conditions,	principally	from	lower	gilt	
yields, which was only partially offset by investment returns. In addition, 
the	scheme’s	actuary	determined	the	cost	to	NATS	of	staff	benefits	
accruing	in	future	at	31.8%	of	pensionable	earnings,	up	from	29.4% 
in 2012.

Progress Following the 2015 valuation, Trustees agreed to continue with the 
recovery	plan	for	the	2012	deficit	and	to	a	new	11-year	recovery	plan	
for	the	increase	in	deficit	at	31	December	2015.	As	a	result,	deficit	
contributions of £39.9m will be paid for the 2017 calendar year in 
addition	to	normal	contributions	at	31.8%	of	pensionable	pay.
The group paid contributions of £102.1m (2016: £104.8m), excluding 
salary	sacrifice,	equivalent	to	43.6%	(2016:	40.6%)	of	pensionable	pay 
of £234m (2016: £258m). 
NERL’s share of these contributions is higher than the regulator assumed 
for RP2 and we expect to recover these through higher prices in 
subsequent reference periods. NATS Services will meet its share of these 
obligations from cash reserves.
The Trustees intend to bring forward their next valuation to 31 December 
2017 to better inform NERL’s Initial Performance Plan for RP3.
Net debt
At	31	March	2017,	borrowings	were	£426.3m	(2016:	£560.4m)	and	cash 	
and investments were £293.6m (2016: £257.1m). Net debt decreased by 
£170.6m to £132.7m (2016: £303.3m).
NERL has bank facilities of £400m, with a maturity date of 31 July 
2021	and	an	option	to	extend	these	to	31	July	2022.	At	31	March 
2017,	NERL	had	no	outstanding	bank	loans	(2016:	£95.0m).	At	31	March 	
2017, the balance outstanding on NERL’s bond was £428.4m (2016: 
£467.4m).	More 	information	is	provided	in	note	17	to	the	consolidated 	
financial	statements.
Cash flow
Cash and cash equivalents increased by £26.0m to £254.2m (2016: 
£228.2m). The group generated £387.7m (2016: £341.7m) from its 
operating	activities.	This	mainly	reflected	higher	cash	receipts	and	lower	
redundancy	and	tax	payments.	The	cash	from	operations	financed	the	
group’s capital investment and debt service obligations.
Outlook for 2018
We expect our revenue next year to be broadly in line with 2017 as further 
price reductions for Airspace customers are offset by additional revenue 
from	the	growth	in	flights	and	from	Defence	services	provided	under	our	
contract	with	Aquila.	However,	overall,	we	expect	a	reduction	in	profit	
before	tax	as	we	incur	additional	costs	to	support	the	growth	in	traffic	
and as we start to bear the operating costs to support new systems, 
including operational staff training.

Progress Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its	performance	and	financial	position,	its	cash	flows,	liquidity	position	
and borrowings are set out in this Strategic report. In addition, note 19 
to	the	financial	statements	describes	the	group’s	objectives,	policies	
and	processes	for	managing	its	capital	and	its	financial	risks;	and	
details	its	financial	instruments	and	hedging	activities.
At	31	March	2017,	the	group	had	cash	of	£293.6m	and	access	to	
undrawn committed bank facilities of £400m that are available until 
July 2021 (with an option to extend to July 2022). The group’s forecasts 
and	projections,	which	reflect	its	expectations	for	RP2	and	taking	
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the group should be able to operate within the level of its existing 
facilities	for	the	foreseeable	future.	The	UK	en	route	business	also	
benefits	from	some	protections	against	traffic	volume	risk	afforded	
by its price control conditions. Other sources of income are generated 
mainly from long term contracts, some of which were renewed in the 
year. As a result, the directors believe that the group is well placed to 
manage its business risks.
The directors have formed a judgement that, taking into account the 
financial	resources	available,	the	group	has	adequate	resources	to	
continue to operate for a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of	approval	of	the	financial	statements,	and	have	therefore	adopted	the	
going	concern	basis	in	the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements.
Viability statement
The directors have assessed the viability of the group based on its 
current position and future prospects, its business strategy and available 
financial	resources.	The	directors	have	also	assessed	the	potential	
financial	and	operational	impacts	in	plausible	downside	scenarios	of	the	
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business set out on pages 28 
and 29. and the effectiveness of currently available mitigating actions. On 
this basis, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities falling due over the 
three	year	period	to	31	March	2020.	
This period of assessment is based on three years of the group’s 
business plan and represents a period for which there is greater 
certainty over forecasting assumptions. The business plan is updated 
annually	and	reflects	the	group’s	strategy	and	its	financial	plans.	This	
period of assessment covers the RP2 Performance Plan (calendar 
years 2015 to 2019) and assumes that a similar model of economic 
regulation will operate for RP3 (calendar years 2020 to 2024).
Specific	consideration	has	been	given	to:
 > Brexit: the directors considered the risk of lower revenue in RP2 from 
a	reduction	in	en	route	air	traffic	volumes	to	be	mitigated	by	the	traffic	
volume risk sharing provisions of NERL’s licence and EC Regulations. 
New	traffic	forecasts	will	be	agreed	with	the	economic	regulator	for	RP3;	
 > Recovery of capital investment: after extensive consultation with 
customers and the economic regulator in 2017, the directors 
considered that the increase in capital expenditure over the RP2 
Performance Plan would be recovered by NERL’s revenue allowances 
in RP3 and subsequently;
 > Airports revenue: the directors considered the competitive 
environment for airport ATC services and the terms of the group’s 
contracts, including their length and renewal prospects; and
 > Defined	benefit	pensions:	the	directors	considered	the	group’s	ability	
to fund the contributions agreed with Trustees following their 2015 
valuation and its resilience to a credible increase in contributions 
in 2019 following the Trustees’ 2017 valuation (see pages 28 and 
29). For NERL, the directors considered such an increase would be 
recoverable through prices in RP3 and subsequently, and for NATS 
Services,	from	the	company’s	cash	and	operating	cash	flows.

Progress Safety, regulatory and 
economic environment
Safety performance
Our main priority is the safety of aircraft and the travelling public. Our 
commitment to improving operational safety performance is embedded 
in our RP2 plan. 
We have continued to meet the three safety performance targets set 
by	the	UK	and	European	regulators	in	the	SES	performance	scheme	
for the end of RP2, which were based on: the effectiveness of safety 
management; the use of the Risk Analysis Tool (RAT) to assess the 
severity of safety events; and the extent of Just Culture training
10
. 
In	a	year	of	unexpectedly	high	traffic	growth,	particularly	at	some	
airports, and as we invested in changes to our operation, we safely 
handled	7.6%	more	flights.	However,	we	did	not	meet	the	self-imposed, 	
internal safety target we set for RP2 calculated using the RAT. This set 
a	RAT	score	which	represents	a	reduction	in	safety	risk	(defined	as	the	
accident	risk	per	flight)	of	13%	by	the	end	of	RP2	for	both	our	airport	
and en route ATC service. Our performance for the 2016 calendar year 
achieved a RAT score6 of 1,280 against a target of below 1,100. This was 
due to an increase in the number of low severity events within the RAT 
scoring scheme.
To address this, we are focusing on tactical activities that will target 
known	risks,	while	also	exploring	‘predict	and	prevent’	analysis	
techniques to help us to direct our efforts. These actions will ensure we 
maintain a safe operation as we Deploy SESAR.
For	the	2017	financial	year,	there	were 	no	category	A	or	B	Airprox
3
 events 
attributable to NATS (2016: nil). The overall number of Airprox events 
in NATS airspace was 106 (2016: 82), with 10 attributable to NATS. 
The increase in Airprox overall was driven by events involving Remotely 
Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS or drones), none of which are attributable 
to NATS (see graph).
This	pattern	is	consistent	with	the	rise	in	drone	activity	in	the	UK.	This	
will continue to evolve and grow and we are ensuring that we develop 
effective relationships and procedures to continue to operate safely in 
an	increasingly	complex	air	traffic	network.	In	the	third	quarter	of	the	
year we began a series of improvement activities focused on drones. We 
have partnered with the CAA on their integrated drone programme, which 
is largely targeting the hobby community. We developed a DroneSafe 
website, point of sale publicity for retailers and used social media to 
engage and educate users. Also, we created Drone Assist, a drone safety 
app which provides users with an interactive map of the airspace used by 
commercial	air	traffic	to	be	avoided	and	other	danger	areas	and	hazards.	
We	are	also	reviewing	the	process	for	approving	non-standard	flight	
applications in controlled airspace by drone operators, collaborating 
internationally on emerging regulation and conducting analysis to 
understand	the	changing	nature	of	drone	operations	across	the	UK.

Progress Managing safety and change
Our approach to safety is underpinned by a commitment to continually 
improve our operational safety performance and minimise our 
contribution to the risk of an aircraft accident. We do this through a 
formalised, explicit and proactive approach to safety management.
We prepare Safety Cases that analyse and assess the impact of changes 
in people, technology, operational software and airspace structures 
to provide assurance that such changes are safe to implement. For 
the same reason, we conduct hazard analysis on any changes to ATC 
procedures. We also seek to optimise operational staff performance 
through annual training, competency assessments and the development 
of new systems. This is particularly relevant as we introduce new 
technology and methods of operation as we Deploy SESAR and as 
airspace is modernised.
This last year we safely introduced iTEC into the Prestwick operation 
which	provides	additional	monitoring	capabilities	for	controllers.	‘Point	
merge’	was	introduced	into	Terminal	Control	to	sequence	arrival	flows	in	
Thames airspace. Both of these enhance safety performance.
Safety improvements
The	most	significant	operational	risks	we	deal	with	are	infringements	of	
controlled airspace, human performance, level busts
11
 and issues on the 
ground at airports, including runway-related events. 
We continue to focus on infringements of controlled airspace by engaging 
with	airfields	and	flying	clubs,	as	well	as	the	CAA	and	airport	operators.	We	
have	seen	an	11%	reduction	in	infringements	to	560	in	calendar	year	2016 	
(CY	2015:	630),	and	a	35%	reduction	in	risk	bearing	events. 	
During the year, we participated in the CAA’s Solent collaborative 
airspace trial to help reduce the risks of infringements in the 
Southampton and Solent areas. This increased the use by the general 
aviation	community	of	specific	transponder	codes,	enabling	an	air	traffic	
controller to identify an aircraft and to provide navigational assistance. 
In addition, we have continued working with the CAA on the development 
of a Low Power ADS-B Transceiver (LPAT) to provide the minimum 
functionality needed to make a general aviation pilot visible to other 
airspace users, as well as to provide warnings against other suitably 
equipped aircraft.
Effective	human	performance	is	a	critical	element	of	ATM	safety.	A	
key focus has been improving operational interactions internally and 
with international and military partners. This was supported by lesson 
learning and safety awareness activities including: defensive controlling 
simulations,	use	of	‘avoiding	action’	briefings,	safety	briefings	in	
preparation	for	summer	traffic,	and	the	sharing	of	knowledge	on	fatigue,	
visual scanning, and safety culture. Engineering safety days were also 
delivered to NATS engineers and stakeholders which highlighted the 
important safety role everyone plays in delivering a safe service.
The	number	of	level	busts	remained	flat	during	the	year.	We	have	
continued to work with the CAA and airlines to ensure best practice is 
followed by both pilots and controllers. We are providing data to airlines 
to improve their visibility of these incidents. 
Our	UK	Airport	service	participates	in	the	CAA’s	ground	handling	
operations safety activity. NATS is working alongside ground handlers to 
improve safety awareness and performance and to encourage effective 
regulation of ground handlers by the CAA. Also, to improve runway 
safety, NATS is contributing to the development of a European action 
plan for the prevention of runway incursions by sharing our experience of 
high	intensity	runways	in	the	UK.

Progress Single European Sky (SES)
SES is a European initiative to improve the way Europe’s airspace is 
managed. Its purpose is to modernise Europe’s airspace structures, 
air	traffic	management	technologies	and	associated	operational	
procedures	so	as	to	ensure	forecast	growth	in	air	traffic	can	be	
met, safely and sustainably, whilst reducing costs and improving 
environmental performance. 
From 2012 the EC introduced a regulatory framework to support SES 
which set targets for safety, environment, airspace capacity and cost 
efficiency	for	Functional	Airspace	Blocks	(FAB)
12
. NERL’s Performance 
Plan	for	RP2	contributed	to	targets	set	for	the	UK-Ireland	FAB.
The	UK	market	for	Terminal	Air	Navigation	Services	(TANS)	is	subject 
to the market conditions test within EC SES Regulations. If conditions 
are not met TANS are more heavily monitored and targeted by the EC. 
In	October	2016,	the	EC	agreed	with	the	UK	Government’s	assessment 	
that market conditions for TANS have been established for RP2. 
This will be subject to re-assessment for RP3.
On the technology side, SES is supported by the Single European Sky 
ATM	Research	(SESAR)	Programme	to	develop	technologies	and	
procedures	to	modernise	and	optimise	the	future	European	ATM	
network. Technologies and procedures have been developed and 
validated by a collaboration of airport operators, ANSPs and aviation 
industry suppliers and are now being introduced into operation across 
Europe. The deployment is being coordinated by an alliance of the largest 
European ANSPs (including NATS), four airlines and 25 airports. The EC 
is aiming for the initial SESAR projects (or Pilot Common Projects (PCP)) 
to be deployed by 2025.
NATS has deployed the tools of Time-Based Separation (TBS) and 
Extended	Arrival	Manager	for	Heathrow	operations	so	far.	TBS	
significantly	enhances	landing	rates	on	the	windiest	days.	Extended	
Arrival	Manager	(XMAN)	coordinates	with	neighbouring	ANSPs	to	slow	
down Heathrow arrivals when runway capacity delays of seven minutes 
or more are predicted, delivering fuel, cost and environmental savings to 
customers.	In	time,	TBS	will	be	delivered	at	Gatwick	Airport	and	XMAN	
introduced	for	Gatwick,	Manchester	and	Stansted.
European funding is available through INEA to support the deployment of 
SESAR technology. To date, NERL has secured INEA funding of £100m 
which ultimately reduces the cost to customers.
UK regulation
The	principal	UK	regulatory	development	in	the	year	relates	to	airspace	
strategy. In light of the challenges facing the industry to modernise 
UK	airspace,	the	CAA	has	enhanced	its	regulatory	oversight	and	the	
requirements relating to NERL’s annual service and investment plan 
consultation with customers, including an independent review of 
progress against plans. 
Also,	the	basis	for	a	specific	licence	requirement	for	NERL	to	set	out	
detailed	plans	to	raise	the	UK	Transition	Altitude
13
 to 18,000 feet by 2018 
and	implement	the	terminal	airspace	redesign	associated	with	LAMP
14
 
has been removed as these changes are not in NERL’s direct control 
and are dependent on public consultation and other stakeholders. As 
explained	below,	certain	aspects	of	LAMP	will	now	be	delivered	in	RP3.

Progress The objective of NERL’s capital investment programme is to sustain, 
develop and enhance operational capabilities to ensure the ability to 
provide on-going service performance, resilience to unplanned events 
(including system failure) and to improve performance and value to 
customers in line with agreed performance targets. 
The investment programme comprises two main areas: airspace 
and technology. This year NERL consulted its customers on a 
revised capital investment plan for RP2. This follows changes in the 
business environment and technological landscape since NERL’s RP2 
Performance	Plan	was	produced,	such	as:	higher	than	expected	traffic	
growth,	reduced	fuel	prices,	the	EU	requirement	to	implement	PCPs	and	
the development of SESAR capable systems such as iTEC. Increased 
traffic	volume	means	that	continuing	to	exploit	our	legacy	systems	is	
no	longer	cost-effective	or	efficient	and	accelerating	investment	in	new	
future	technologies	that	enhance	capacity	and	efficiency	is	necessary.	
Additionally, adverse public reaction to initial airspace changes coupled 
with uncertainty about new runway developments, led stakeholders to 
be wary about supporting changes to lower airspace assumed in NERL’s 
RP2 Performance Plan.
NERL’s technology programme updates its core ATC infrastructure, 
replacing legacy systems that are reaching end of life and deploying 
a modern and more advanced system to support new operational 
concepts and modern airspace designs. The new systems will not only 
further enhance safety, service performance and resilience but will also 
allow	us	to	meet	our	obligations	in	line	with	the	PCP	and	related	EU	
regulations. This programme will continue to sustain legacy systems to 
ensure	they	remain	resilient	and	fit	for	purpose	throughout	the	transition	
from old systems and operations to new ones.
The airspace programme delivers a number of independent airspace 
changes mainly at medium to higher level airspace, with the aim of 
enhancing	safety	performance,	capacity	and	fuel	efficiency.	This	
approach will help to ensure that each change can be successfully 
delivered without impacting other airspace changes. The programme will 
also deliver enhancements in London airspace to improve performance, 
recognising	the	need	to	deliver	some	aspects	of	the	LAMP	in	RP3,	which	
the aviation industry agreed. The revised airspace plan for RP2 includes 
enhancements	to	TBS,	XMAN	and	the	introduction	of	Independent	
Parallel Approach (IPA) for Heathrow. It will also modernise Prestwick 
lower	airspace	including	Manchester	and	Scottish	TMA	as	part	of	a	joint	
programme with airports.
The revised airspace and technology plans for RP2: 
 > Ensure	that	beneficial	airspace	changes	can	be	delivered	in	RP2	and	
the capability is in place to deliver subsequent changes in RP3;
 > Accelerate the deployment of SESAR capable systems and 
replacement of NERL’s ageing legacy systems essential to improve 
service performance and deliver airspace capacity;
 > Prioritise early replacement of technology that will soon become 
obsolete	and	increasingly	difficult	to	maintain,	to	avoid	the	risk	of	
service degradation;
 > Deliver a single, common technology platform and capability across 
both Prestwick and Swanwick to provide improved service resilience 
and	operational	flexibility;
 > Optimise the overall level of capital investment required over RP2 and 
RP3; and 
 > Secure the maximum European INEA funding to support deployment 
projects	and	benefit	customers	through	reduced	future	prices.
In summary, the focus of NERL’s RP2 Performance Plan is delivering 
airspace change that can largely be delivered using existing systems 
and transforming NERL’s systems and capabilities supporting upper 
airspace. The focus of RP3 will be transforming NERL’s systems 
supporting lower airspace and delivering airspace change dependent 
on these new systems including Free Route Airspace and modernised 
airspace	in	the	London	TMA

Progress Historically, the growth in demand for air travel has been closely linked 
to	the	strength	of	the	global	economy	and,	for	UK	air	traffic,	to	that	of	
the	UK,	US	and	Eurozone	economies.	The	UK	economy	is	forecast	to	
grow	by	1.9%	in	2017	(source:	Oxford	Economics),	with	growth	through 	
2017	expected	to	slow	as	higher	inflation	offsets	some	of	the	benefit 	
of	improved	trade	performance.	The	US	economy	is	expected	to	
grow	at	2.1%	during	2017.	Eurozone	economies	also	continue	to	build 	
momentum with a weaker euro supporting stronger exports. Continued 
low oil prices have reduced the cost of air travel and are contributing to 
passenger	demand.	The	Middle	East	market	continues	to	grow.
The	principal	risks	to	the	forecast	include:	the	impact	on	UK	growth	from	
its	decision	to	leave	the	EU;	the	possibility	of	protectionist	trade	policies	by	
the	US,	possibly	outweighed	by	a	more	benign	fiscal	agenda;	a	slowdown	
in growth in China, although IATA’s forecasts indicate strong demand for 
air	travel	there;	and	the	escalation	of	conflicts	in	the	Middle	East.

Progress We generate our income from the provision of ATC and related services. 
Our activities are mainly conducted through NERL and NATS Services.
NERL	is	the	sole	provider	of	air	traffic	control	services	for	aircraft	flying	en	
route	in	UK	airspace	and	the	eastern	part	of	the	North	Atlantic.	It	operates	
under a licence granted by the Secretary of State under the Transport 
Act 2000. The Act gives the CAA the role of economic regulator. En route, 
London Approach and North Sea helicopter advisory services are regulated 
by	this	licence.	NERL	also	provides	the	MOD	with	engineering,	surveillance	
and communications services. These activities are reported within Airspace.
The CAA establishes revenue allowances for NERL’s economically 
regulated services under SES legislation. These remunerate NERL’s 
efficient	investment	(capex),	operating	costs	(opex),	pensions	and	an	
allowed return on the capital invested in the Regulatory Asset Base 
(RAB) to recover the cost of capital. The RAB, which represents the value 
ascribed to the capital employed in the regulated businesses, is adjusted 
to	reflect	asset	additions,	disposal	proceeds,	regulatory	depreciation	and	
the	rate	of	inflation.	Income	generated	outside	of	NERL’s	economically	
regulated	activities	is	deducted	under	a	‘single	till’,	leaving	a	net	revenue	
allowance. A price per service unit is set to recover this based on forecast 
traffic	for	the	reference	period.	This	regulatory	model	is	illustrated	below.
The price control for RP2 was based on total revenues of £2.7bn 
(expressed by the CAA in 2012 prices) and provides for a real pre-tax cost 
of	capital	of	5.9%.	The	CAA	also	sets	targets,	and	provides	incentives,	
for service and environmental performance. If regulatory and other 
assumptions are borne out in practice, then NERL would earn a return 
of	5.9%	p.a.	It	can	earn	additional	returns	if	it	outperforms	the	CAA’s	
assumptions	by	being	more	cost	efficient,	by	financing	its	business	at	
lower	cost,	if	traffic	volumes	(after	risk	sharing	-	see	below)	are	higher	
than forecast or if it outperforms service targets. NERL would earn lower 
returns if the opposite applied.
The EC legislation provides: a risk-sharing mechanism to protect against 
certain	variations	in	traffic	volumes	from	the	level	assumed;	an	adjustment	
to	charges	for	differences	between	actual	inflation	and	assumed	inflation;	
and an adjustment to charges in subsequent reference periods where cash 
contributions	to	the	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	differ	from	those	
assumed	due	to	unforeseen	financial	market	conditions.	
The	CAA	also	sets	a	target	and	cap	on	the	level	of	NERL’s	gearing	at	60% 	
and	65%	of	net	debt	to	RAB,	respectively.	Charges	may	be	adjusted	on 	
a	year	‘n+2	basis’	for	service	performance	incentives,	traffic	volume	risk-
sharing	and	for	inflation.
NATS	Services	provides	services	to	UK	Airports,	to	the	UK	MOD	through	
its	Defence	services,	to	other	UK	customers	such	as	airlines	and	airspace	
users	and	to	international	customers,	mainly	in	Asia	Pacific	and	the	Middle	
East.	Services	to	UK	Airports	(including	engineering	support)	represent	
c.73%	of	its	revenue	and	Defence	c.16%.	Services	to	UK	customers 	
represent	c.	96%	of	its	revenue.
The	UK	Airports	service	provides	ATC	services	to	14	of	the	UK’s	major	
airports as well as engineering support and airport optimisation services to 
UK	airport	operators.	NATS	Services	operates	in	a	contestable	market	and	
faces competition from other Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). 
The	UK	airports	market	comprises	129	civil	licensed	aerodromes.	
NATS provides ATC at 14 of these, 111 self-provide the service and four 
airports outsource ATC to three other providers. The company’s strategy 
is	to	win	and	retain	UK	airport	ATC	customer	contracts	by	nurturing	
the relationship with customers and developing price competitive and 
innovative technological service solutions that deliver performance for 
our	customers.	As	noted	above,	large	UK	airports	fall	within	the	scope	of	
European SES regulations.
Engineering	support	services	for	UK	airport	customers	deliver	complex	
turnkey projects, mainly integrating new infrastructure at airports. 
Our competence is in maintaining and developing communications, 
navigation and surveillance solutions. Our principal competitors 
include systems integrators, equipment manufacturers and specialist 
engineering consultancies. 
Defence represents the provision of ATC and related engineering support and 
other	services	to	the	UK	MOD.	These	services	are	mainly	provided	through	the	
Project	Marshall	contract	which	is	being	delivered	in	partnership	with	Thales	
by	our	Aquila	joint	venture.	Under	this	contract,	NATS	provides	ATC	services	at	
Gibraltar,	RAF	Wattisham,	RAF	Middle	Wallop	and	RAF	Netheravon	air	bases.	
Other	UK	Business	includes	aeronautical	information	management	(AIM),	
design and data services, consultancy and ATC training. 
Our	International	activities	focus	on	the	Asia	Pacific	and	Middle	East	
markets	and	also	targets	specific	international	airports	and	ANSPs.	Our	
FerroNATS joint venture provides a service to nine airports in Spain.
We are uniquely placed to help airline and airport customers to realise 
value	by	making	both	airspace	and	airfield	services	more	efficient.	We	
understand	the	complex	interactions	at	each	stage	of	a	flight	between	
airlines, airport operators and ANSPs, including in some of the busiest 
airspace	in	the	world.	We	understand	the	benefit	we	can	provide	from	
fuel	efficient	flight	profiles,	approaches	and	departures,	minimising	delay,	
and through arrival and departure management. Our en route operation 
provides	a	seamless	transition	between	the	North	Atlantic	and	UK	en	route	
services. We recognise that airport tower services are an intrinsic part of 
overall performance and our experiences at Heathrow, latterly at Gatwick 
and other airports demonstrate our ability to optimise runway performance 
and	apron	efficiency.	This	benefits	airport	operators,	their	investors,	and	
the airlines.

Progress Principal risks and uncertainties
The operational complexities inherent in the business leave NATS 
exposed	to	a	number	of	significant	risks	and	uncertainties.	Our	risk	
management	process	has	identified	the	key	risks	that	the	Board	believes	
are	likely	to	have	the	most	significant	impact	on	our	business,	financial	
position, results and reputation based on the severity and likelihood of 
risk	exposure.	Risks	are	reviewed	and	re-assessed	regularly	and	reflect	
the Board’s assessment as at the date of this report. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive.
The group has maintained a focus on mitigating these risks, although 
many remain outside of our control – for example changes in regulation, 
security threats, environmental factors and the impact of longevity and 
financial	markets	on	pension	funding.
These principal risks have been considered in preparing the Viability 
statement on page 20. A summary of internal control and risk 
management processes is on pages 50 and 51.
Safety: the risk of an aircraft accident
A loss of separation attributable to NATS that results in an accident in the 
air	or	on	the	ground	would	significantly	impact	NATS	and	its	reputation	as	
a	provider	of	safe	air	traffic	services.	This	could	result	in	loss	of	revenue	in	
the short term as investigations take place and the loss of future contracts 
due to reputational damage. If notice was given by the Secretary of State 
requiring NERL to take action as a result of the accident and NERL was 
unable or failed to comply with the notice then ultimately this could result 
in	revocation	of	NERL’s	air	traffic	services	licence.	
As a provider of a safety critical service, safety is the company’s 
highest priority. To further embed our existing safety culture across the 
organisation and to mitigate safety risk, NATS has developed a Strategy 
for	the	Future	Safety	of	ATM	and	supports	this	with	a	three	year	rolling	
Safety	Plan.	The	group	also	maintains	an	explicit	Safety	Management	
System. The latter includes investigations and reviews of operational 
safety performance and individual incidents to identify and respond to 
contributors of safety risk.  
Maintaining continuous operations
a. Loss of service from ATC centre
A	loss	of	service	would	result	in	a	loss	of	revenue	as	flow	management	
procedures would be introduced to maintain safe separation. The 
extent of loss would depend on the time necessary to resume a safe 
service	and	the	resultant	level	of	air	traffic	delay.	To	this	end	NATS	
has contingency arrangements which enable the recovery of its 
service capacity. These arrangements were reviewed in light of the 
recommendations of the Independent Enquiry into the December 
2014 technical failure. 
b. Operational systems resilience
Operational service provision is increasingly dependent on the 
performance and resilience of engineering systems and communications, 
surveillance	and	flight	data	infrastructure.	A	number	of	mechanisms	
exist to identify systems resilience risks. These include regular reviews 
of system health through a series of structured questions with evidence-
based outcomes. In addition, tactical issues are assessed following 
engineering updates to NATS’ Safety Tracking and Reporting System to 
determine whether immediate escalation is required and to identify any 
emerging trends requiring investigation. 
Political environment and economic regulation
Policy	decisions	by	the	regulator,	the	UK	Government	and	the	European	
Commission directly affect our businesses. Changes in policy decisions 
may	impact	on	the	group’s	ability	to	meet	the	requirements	of	the	UK	
and EC’s aviation policies. We seek to mitigate this risk by providing 
independent input to policy studies (such as that conducted by the 
Airports Commission), lobbying for policy guidance and action where 
we	believe	this	is	required	(such	as	UK	airspace	policy	and	airspace	
modernisation) and responding to industry consultation. We outlined 
earlier in this report, the importance of proceeding with airspace 
modernisation.  If this does not proceed in a timely manner, supported 
by	clear	government	policy,	then	UK	airspace	will	reach	capacity	limits	
causing increasing delay and constraining aviation growth.
Also,	the	group’s	air	traffic	services	operate	under	a	European 
regulatory regime which requires key performance targets to be met. 
Failure	to	meet	these	safety,	service,	environment	and	efficiency 
targets could damage our reputation and lead to even more 
challenging regulatory arrangements. 
NERL’s current environment and capacity targets were based on an RP2 
investment plan that included the implementation of lower airspace 
change	in	the	London	area	as	part	of	LAMP.	Industry	consensus	was	
that this is not possible during RP2 due to factors beyond NERL’s control. 
The company is seeking to mitigate regulatory risk by aiming to achieve 
its	RP2	targets	through	equivalent	environmental	and	fuel	saving	benefits	
via a package of other airspace changes that have industry support.
Finally,	the	UK	market	for	TANS	is	subject	to	the	market	conditions	test	
within EC SES Regulations. If conditions are not met TANS are subject 
to economic regulation. In October 2016, the Commission agreed with 
the	UK	Government’s	assessment	that	market	conditions	for	TANS	have	
been established for RP2. This will be re-assessed for RP3.
Defined benefit pension scheme
Adverse movements in pension asset and liability values arising from 
factors such as lower investment returns, lower real interest rates 
and improving life expectancy may increase the size of the pension 
deficit	and	result	in	significant	contributions	to	fund	pension	benefits.	
Management	regularly	reviews	the	financial	position	of	the	defined	
benefit	scheme	and	is	consulted	by	Trustees	on	the	design	of	the	risk	
reduction strategies that are in place. The scheme was closed to new 
entrants in 2009, pensionable pay rises are capped and future service 
benefits	are	linked	to	the	Consumer	Prices	Index.	
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report   |  28
Progress The	Trustees	completed	a	formal	triennial	valuation	of	the	defined	
benefit	scheme	as	at	31	December	2015.	This	reported	an	increase	in	
the	funding	deficit	and	has	resulted	in	additional	contributions.	Subject	
to regulatory review, NERL is able to recover over subsequent reference 
periods	increases	in	contributions	from	changes	in	unforeseen	financial	
market conditions. NERL’s revenue allowances will also be re-assessed 
for RP3. NATS Services maintains adequate cash reserves to meet its 
share of pension contributions.
The Trustees will perform their next formal valuation at 31 December 
2017, to inform NERL’s Performance Plan for RP3. Financial market 
conditions since the 2015 valuation, characterised by historic low real gilt 
yields	in	particular,	have	continued	to	be	a	challenge	for	most	UK	defined	
benefit	pension	schemes.	If	today’s	financial	market	conditions	prevail	at	
31	December	2017,	the	group	expects	Trustees	to	report	a	larger	deficit 	
that will require the group to increase its contributions to the scheme. 
The directors are monitoring the funding position of the scheme and 
consider that further possible actions available to mitigate pension risk, 
the	group’s	financing	arrangements	and	cash	reserves,	its	projected	
operating	cash	flows	and	the	economic	regulatory	model	enable	the	
group to meet credible increases in contributions following the 
2017 valuation.
Industry outlook and the impact of the UK’s referendum 
on Europe
Poor market and economic conditions can reduce NERL’s revenues to 
levels below those assumed by the economic regulator in making the 
RP2 price determinations. This in turn could impair shareholder returns. 
NATS monitors the key industry indicators on a monthly basis against 
RP2 forecasts and has taken action in the past to realign its cost base 
with	lower	revenues.	As	explained	above,	NERL	has	traffic	volume	risk-
sharing arrangements that mitigate revenue reductions to a large extent. 
The	impact	of	the	UK’s	decision	to	leave	the	EU	has	not	had	a	material	
adverse impact on our revenue to date. In the short term the continuing 
uncertainty could affect the demand for air travel and the volume of air 
traffic	NATS	handles,	though	any	impact	would	be	mitigated	by	traffic	
volume risk-sharing arrangements. 
Over the longer term, the impact depends to a large extent on the type 
of	relationship	that	is	forged	between	the	UK	and	the	EU.	An	important	
consideration for NATS is the extent of participation in the SES and the 
legislation governing the economic regulation of NERL. 
Under	the	UK	Transport	Act	2000	the	CAA	has	a	duty	to	ensure	that	NERL	
does	not	find	it	unduly	difficult	to	finance	its	activities.	Such	a	duty	is	not	
provided	for	in	SES	legislation.	After	leaving	the	EU,	we	expect	that	the	UK	
will no longer be able to participate, with a vote, in the process of drafting 
and approving SES legislation. Therefore, in our view the logical outcome is 
for	the	UK	to	re-establish	national	economic	regulation	of	UK	ATM	outside	
of the SES. 
Security: electronic and other external 
and internal threats
Malicious	attack,	sabotage	or	other	intentional	acts,	including	breaches	
of	our	cyber	security,	could	damage	our	assets	or	otherwise	significantly	
impact on our service performance. NATS seeks to mitigate these 
risks through its business continuity controls, staff awareness training 
and cyber and physical security processes and procedures, including 
monitoring political stability and security risks in countries where it 
conducts its business. 
The company has enhanced the physical security of its principal 
sites and is continuing to enhance its cyber security processes and 
controls. The company maintains a close liaison with the relevant Home 
Office	Constabularies	as	well	as	Government	security	agencies	and	
departments including security advice from the Centre for the Protection 
of National Infrastructure (CPNI).
Employee relations
The deployment of SESAR technology and the group’s response to 
the	challenging	competitive	environment	in	the	UK	and	overseas	will	
require changes across our organisation. Industrial action could result in 
reduced	air	traffic	service	provision	which	adversely	impacts	on	service	
performance. Every effort is made to maintain good employee relations 
at all times, including through our Working Together programme 
and through joint working groups as part of an employee relations 
improvement	project,	to	ensure	the	delivery	of	an	efficient	operational	
service and associated support. 
Technology
The deployment of new SESAR technology and retirement of legacy 
systems could affect the group’s ability to maintain service levels 
during transition and require additional costs to sustain legacy systems 
and support deployment. NATS maintains programme and project 
governance and risk management processes which are overseen by the 
Executive and Board, including the Technical Review Committee.
Financial risks
In	addition	to	the	top	risks	set	out	above,	the	main	financial	risks	of	the	
group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs (including 
meeting obligations to the pension scheme), the risk of default by 
counterparties	to	financial	transactions,	and	fluctuations	in	interest	and	
foreign exchange rates. A detailed description of each of these risks and 
specific	mitigations	are	set	out	in	note	19.

Progress Service line performance
We	organise	our	activities	according	to	service	lines,	which	reflect	the	
customer groups to whom we provide our products and services. A brief 
description is provided under the section entitled Our business model. This 
service	line	structure	was	introduced	in	this	financial	year,	to	align	financial	
reporting with the group’s operational focus on its customers. Prior year 
service line information has been restated on a like for like basis. 
This	section	explains	the	financial	and	operational	performance	of	each	
service.	The	principal	financial	measures	are	revenue	and	contribution.	
The	former	includes	intra-group	revenue,	while	the	latter	reflects	the	
operating	costs	which	managers	are	able	to	influence	directly.	A	
reconciliation	of	service	line	contribution	to	operating	profit	is	provided	in	
the	notes	to	the	financial	statements.
Airspace
Overall,	the	volume	of	UK	flights	handled	by	NATS	increased	by	7.6%	this 	
year,	reflecting	strong	growth	in	transatlantic	arrivals	and	departures	and	
overflights.	The	growth	in	chargeable	service	units	(CSUs
16
)	reflected	
more	northerly	routes	taken	by	transatlantic	flights	due	to	the	jet	stream,	
resulting	in	longer	distances	flown	in	UK	airspace.	By	contrast,	the	RP2	
settlement	assumed	flight	volumes	and	CSUs	would	grow	by	1.9%	and	
1.8%	per	annum	on	average.
Airspace	generated	revenue	of	£733.5m,	a	2.6%	increase	on	the	previous 	
year.	Customers	continued	to	benefit	from	the	real	price	reductions	
required by the RP2 Performance Plan. This was more than offset by 
additional	revenue	earned	from	the	increase	in	UK	en	route	flights.	This	
flight	growth	also	mitigated	a	small	service	penalty	of	£0.4m	(2016:	£4.6m 	
bonus), explained below. Other Airspace revenue improved by £3.7m.
Service	line	contribution	of	£359.0m	(2016:	£323.1m)	was	11.1%	higher. 	
In	addition	to	revenue,	this	largely	reflected	lower	accounting	pension	
costs compared with such costs in the previous year, which offset other 
staff and non-staff cost increases.
As explained in the Chief Executive’s review, during the busiest periods last 
summer,	we	regulated	traffic	flows	in	some	sectors	resulting	in	delay.	For	
the	financial	year,	delay	attributable	to	Airspace	increased	to	10.9	seconds	
per	flight	(2016:	4.3	seconds),	with	99.0%	of	flights	not	delayed	(2016: 	
99.6%).	Service	performance	incentives	are	assessed	by	the	economic 	
regulator on a calendar year basis. This delay performance for 2016 was 
just outside of the regulator’s target, resulting in a small penalty.

Progress During	the	year	we	provided	ATC	services	to	14	UK	airports	and	ATC	
related	engineering	services	to	a	further	19	UK	airports.
We continued to provide a safe service with no risk-bearing airprox 
during the year.
Revenue	was	6.8%	lower	at	£167.9m	(2016:	£180.2m),	mainly	reflecting 	
price reductions and the loss of the Gatwick contract. As a result of this, 
service line contribution was also lower at £32.0m (2016: £39.7m).
One	of	our	strategic	objectives	is	to	win	and	retain	UK	airport	contracts.	
During the year we were awarded the ATC and engineering contracts 
by George Best Belfast City Airport. We also renewed our contracts with 
Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton, agreed extensions with Luton 
and London City and renewed our engineering contract at Highlands and 
Islands Airports. The Edinburgh contract will transfer to another provider 
in	March	2018.
We completed a number of major engineering projects in the year 
including instrument landing systems for Heathrow and Belfast 
International. We are also upgrading voice communications for Bristol 
and Luton airports.

In	addition	to	measures	of	delay,	we	are	targeted	on	flight	efficiency	
(the environmental performance of our network), and for 2016 our 
performance at 30.3 was within the economic regulator’s service 
performance range.
This year we enabled fuel savings of 17,600 tonnes (2016: 11,000 
tonnes) worth c.£6.2m to our customers (based on an average fuel 
price of £353 per tonne over the year), generating associated 
environmental	benefit.
NATS	Airspace	invested	£151.4m	(2016:	£141.1m)	on	its	air	traffic

Progress Service line performance
Defence
Revenue grew by £15.8m to £36.4m (2016: £20.6m) in the year. This was 
mainly due to engineering support services provided to our Aquila joint 
venture	for	its	Project	Marshall	contract	with	the	UK’s	MOD.	Service	line	
contribution at £5.9m (2016: £2.7m) was £3.2m higher as a result.
Project	Marshall	is	a	22-year	concession	for	the	provision	of	ATC	
services	and	the	upgrade	of	MOD	ATC	infrastructure.	The	service	
provision element of this contract is provided by NATS Services and 
is performing extremely well. We now provide ATC services to RAF 
Wattisham and Gibraltar Airport and, after transferring to NATS Services 
in	the	year,	to	RAF	Netheravon	and	RAF	Middle	Wallop.	However,	the	
asset provision element has faced schedule challenges. Together with 
our joint venture partner, Thales, we are committing more resources in 
2017/18 to re-plan and execute the delivery schedule for asset provision.
Other service lines
UK	business	revenue	was	£4.0m	lower	this	year	at	£14.8m	(2016: 	
£18.8m)	mainly	reflecting	fewer	windfarm	mitigation	contracts.	We	
continue to support Tormywheel Wind Farm that will see a new radar 
system at Edinburgh Airport and surveillance solutions for Frodsham 
Wind Farm at both Chester and Liverpool airports. These and other 
contracts generated a service line contribution of £3.7m (2016: £2.7m).
Presently, we are implementing a new aeronautical data platform to give 
airlines access to enhanced data and analytic tools to optimise their 
operating performance.
International revenues grew by £1.6m to £9.6m (2016: £8.0m). The 
Asia	Pacific	region	performed	more	strongly	while	there	were	limited	
opportunities	in	the	Middle	East.	Of	note	this	year	was	the	award	of	
an airspace design contract in Thailand. At a contribution level our 
international activities reported a loss of £0.2m (2016: £1.5m loss). 
This	includes	a	share	of	the	FerroNATS	profit	which	was	offset	by	
losses	from	the	Asia	Pacific	and	Middle	East	where	we	continue	to	build	
our presence. FerroNATS secured ATC contracts at Andorra - La Seu 
d’Urgell,	Lleida	and	Córdoba	airports,	which	are	yet	to	transfer	from	the	
incumbent service provider.

Progress People and Responsible business
As explained in the Chief Executive’s review a focus on our people is 
a priority. Our People and Organisation Strategy will ensure that the 
company has the skills and workforce required to deliver the operational 
service today and the talent and capability mix to deliver an organisation 
that	is	fit	for	the	future.	Our	new	talent	strategy	is	particularly	important	
as the world of work is changing. As new technology and methods of 
operation are implemented we will need to develop and train our existing 
employees and ensure that we attract, and retain, the skills we need for 
this new environment.
After prolonged discussions, last summer the company agreed a two-
year pay deal with staff. This recognised their important contribution 
to the company’s performance and the the need to respond to the 
regulator’s	cost	efficiency	targets	and	the	pressures	from	rising	pension	
costs, all of which are critical to ensuring that our customers receive 
the right service at the right price. This agreement now enables us to 
move forward and engage with our people on future developments in the 
business, including our programme to deploy SESAR technology and the 
changing needs of our airport customers.
In support of this we have committed to creating an enhanced 
partnership	relationship	with	our	employees	and	Trades	Unions	to	
ensure NATS has a workforce that is prepared and equipped for future 
challenges. We have established an employee relations improvement 
project	to	identify	ways	to	work	more	effectively	with	the	Trades	Unions,	
enhancing our ability to jointly solve problems and deliver essential 
change. We have also created a series of one-day workshops for 
managers to better equip them to communicate with their teams and 
to improve their understanding of how the business works and the 
challenges we face. 
Our overall focus is to make NATS a great place to work, where people 
are motivated to deliver high levels of performance and are genuinely 
engaged in the business. This year we have built on a culture survey to 
leverage	the	beneficial	aspects	of	NATS	culture	and	enhance	aspects	
of our people practice; whether it is inducting new colleagues to the 
organisation more effectively; identifying how we can promote greater 
health and wellbeing in work; or looking at how we can improve the 
people aspects of new technology delivery.
We have also continued to support educational institutions. Our Prestwick 
Centre	is	collaborating	with	the	University	of	the	West	of	Scotland	across	
a range of projects embracing joint research and knowledge transfer 
activity, as well as collaborative education, placements and training 
programmes. A placement programme will provide opportunities to work 
on research and development projects that will make a real contribution to 
air navigation operations of the future. In return, NATS will gain access to 
academic expertise and research capability.

Responsible business
Our Responsible business report is available on our website.
Our Chief Executive is responsible for the company’s environment 
policy,	which	is	underpinned	by	an	Environmental	Management	System	
that	is	subject	to	internal	and	external	audit	as	part	of	ISO	certification.	
Key energy and environmental data has also been independently 
assured as per the table below. Our environmental policy describes our 
commitment	to	limit	and,	where	possible,	reduce	the	impact	of	ATM	on	
the environment. 
Aircraft noise
NATS currently holds the Chair of the Sustainable Aviation coalition in the 
UK	and	is	using	its	influence	across	industry	to	focus	on	improvements	
to continuous climb and descent operations at airports, which reduces 
noise and aircraft CO 2 emissions.
On	behalf	of	the	UK	Government,	NATS	is	leading	a	study	for	ICAO’s	
Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, which is gathering 
information on the contribution that performance based navigation 
makes in reducing noise, and aiming to explain best practice in a report 
to be published in 2019.
ATM related CO

 emissions
In	2008,	NATS	committed	to	reducing	average	fuel	per	flight	from	gate	to	
gate	by	10%	by	2020	(from	a	2006	baseline).	Airline	customers	value	this 	
support	to	fuel	efficient	flight	planning.
NATS has also been working with customers to minimise aircraft taxiing 
at airports to reduce CO 2 emissions and improve local air quality and 
reduce noise. 
In	the	2017	financial	year	NATS	enabled	further	savings	of	55.9kT	ATM 	
related CO 2	emissions	and	has	achieved	5.0%	towards	its	10%	target	for	
2020. These savings derive both from large projects and minor changes 
to airspace made in consultation with customers. This will continue in 
2018	as	part	of	NATS’	Flight	Efficiency	Partnership.

Airspace efficiency 
In	2012	we	adopted	the	3Di	metric	to	monitor	airspace	efficiency,	
which	is	now	used	by	the	CAA	to	set	airspace	efficiency	targets.	Airline	
customers value 3Di improvements as they support tactical fuel savings 
and are a proxy for good service delivery. For calendar year 2016 we 
achieved a 3Di score of 30.3, which was within the economic regulator’s 
service performance range. The regulator’s targets require a reduction in 
the score to 27.7 by the end of RP2. 
When these targets were set, it was assumed that airspace structures 
would be modernised in RP2. This process started in the previous 
financial	year	but	further	stages	have	been	paused	pending	consultation.	
For now we continue to focus on smaller airspace changes to improve 
the	fuel	efficiency	of	our	service,	aiming	to	achieve	a	similar	cumulative	
benefit	to	the	RP2	Performance	Plan.
Minimising the environmental impact of our estate
During	the	financial	year	our	Environmental	Management	Systems	was	
certified	to	ISO14001:2015	standard	for	our	head	office	in	Hampshire	
and	at	Glasgow	and	Manchester	airport	control	towers.	Further	sites	will	
be	certified	over	the	next	financial	year.	
We are actively taking steps to reduce our energy consumption and since 
the	2006	baseline	year,	our	energy	use	has	reduced	by	38%,	which	is	the 	
equivalent to 20,851 tonnes of CO 2.
We participate in the Government’s Carbon Reduction Commitment 
energy	efficiency	scheme	and	the	Energy	Savings	Opportunity	Scheme.	
Our	Swanwick	control	centre	is	also	part	of	the	EU	Energy	Trading	
System	and	subject	to	separate	verification.
We	have	a	close	working	relationship	with	the	Hampshire	&	Isle	of	Wight	
Wildlife Trust and jointly manage a 36 hectare nature reserve adjacent to 
our Swanwick control centre.
Supply chain
Our supply chain strategy aims to continue to build collaborations with our 
supplier base to enable the successful delivery of our Deploying SESAR 
programme. As our programme moves from a sourcing to delivery phase 
we have strengthened our contract management expertise and formed a 
dedicated team to support projects and suppliers.
During	the	year	we	were	one	of	the	first	six	companies	to	be	accredited	
to the new ISO44001 Collaborative Business Relationships standards. As 
part of our commitment to this type of relationship, our annual supplier 
conference was attended by over 25 supplier and partner organisations 
working on our largest programmes which provided an opportunity to 
work on shared challenges and opportunities. Our Director of Supply 
Chain also chairs the iTEC Board, a European forum to align the system 
and	operational	requirements	of	the	new	flight	data	processor	and	
minimise implementation costs.
We further strengthened our supplier due diligence processes through 
our membership of the Joint Supply Chain Accreditation Register 
(JOSCAR) and we published our position on combatting modern slavery 
and	human	trafficking	within	the	supply	chain.

NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  43
Progress Introduction
NATS was formed as a Public Private Partnership in July 2001. In addition 
to its memorandum and articles, a key element in its governance 
structure is the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between its main 
shareholders: the Secretary of State for Transport; The Airline Group 
Limited (AG); and LHR Airports Limited (LHRA) (previously BAA Limited).
The SPA sets out the relative responsibilities of the signatories and, 
in	particular,	requires	the	group	and	the	directors	to	adhere	to	the	UK	
Corporate Governance Code so far as reasonably practicable and save to 
the extent inconsistent with the other provisions of the SPA.
The Board and Directors
Ultimate	responsibility	for	the	governance	of	NATS	rests	with	the	Board	
of NATS Holdings Limited, which provides strategic direction and 
leadership and is responsible for ensuring that the NATS group is run 
safely,	efficiently,	effectively	and	legally,	with	appropriate	internal	controls	
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and group assets.
The boards of the subsidiary companies within the group are accountable 
to the NATS Holdings Board for all aspects of their business activities.
As at the date of approval of the accounts, the NATS Holdings Limited 
Board comprised a non-executive Chairman and 11 directors, as follows:
Executive Directors 
 > Chief	Executive	Officer	(CEO);	and
 > Finance Director.
Non-Executive Directors 
 > a non-executive Chairman, appointed by AG, subject to the prior 
approval of the Crown Shareholder;
 > five	further	non-executive	directors	appointed	by	AG;
 > three non-executive Partnership directors, who are appointed by the 
Crown Shareholder; and
 > one non-executive director appointed by LHRA.
Changes to the Directors
From 1 April 2016 to the date of approval of the accounts, the following 
changes to the directors were made:
The roles of the Chairman, Chief 
Executive	Officer	and 
executive management
The Chairman of the NATS group is responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and for its governance. He has no day-to-day involvement in the 
running of the group. Day-to-day management of the NATS group is the 
responsibility	of	the	CEO,	Martin	Rolfe,	supported	by	the	NATS	executive	
team. The NATS executive team is responsible for delivering NATS’ 
overall strategy. To achieve its strategic priorities the executive team has 
recently been structured as follows:
 > CEO;
 > Finance Director;
 > Operations Director;
 > Safety Director;
 > Commercial Director;
 > HR	&	Corporate	Services	Director;
 > Technical Services Director;
 > Communications Director; and
 > Legal Director.

Progress The responsibilities of the Board
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision 
and	has	put	in	place	arrangements	for	financial	delegations	to	ensure	
that	it	retains	overall	control	of	the	business.	Matters	reserved	for	
the Board include the monitoring of NATS’ safety performance, 
appointments to the NATS executive team, and issues with political, 
regulatory or public relations implications.
In	addition	to	the	schedule	of	matters	reserved	to	the	Board,	specific	
matters are reserved for Partnership directors, AG directors and the 
LHRA director. These include the following:
Partnership and AG directors
 > adoption of the business plan;
 > entry	into	significant	debts,	charges	or	contingent	liabilities;
 > major agreements outside the ordinary course of business; 
 > significant	litigation	proceedings;	and	
 > external investments, and acquisition and disposal of material assets.
LHRA director
 > acquisition	or	disposal	of	any	asset	representing	more	than	10%	of	
the total assets of the business; 
 > any aspects of the business plan which could adversely affect NERL’s 
service	to	UK	airports;	and	
 > disposal of NATS Services shares by NATS.
Access to legal and professional advice
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Legal Director, 
Richard Churchill-Coleman, who acts as Secretary to the Board. If 
necessary, in furtherance of their duties, directors may take independent 
professional advice at the group’s expense.
Board meetings
The	Board	routinely	meets	seven	times	per	year	in	January,	March,	May,	
June, July, September and November, and supplements these scheduled 
meetings with additional meetings as business priorities require. 
During this year, the Board met eight times with each member (who 
served as a director during the year) attending as follows:
The non-executive directors meet with the Chairman, but without the 
executive directors present, before and after each Board meeting.
Reports and papers are circulated to Board members in a timely manner 
in preparation for meetings, and this information is supplemented by any 
information	specifically	requested	by	directors	from	time-to-time.	The	
directors also receive monthly management reports and information to 
enable them to review the group’s performance.
The group’s performance is also reviewed monthly by the executive 
team. This includes reviewing performance against operational targets 
(including those relating to safety, delays, project performance and 
risk	management)	and	against	financial	targets	(including	revenue	and	
capital budgets).

Progress The Board’s performance
Board effectiveness review
The Board is committed to continuous improvement and a performance 
evaluation of the Board, its committees, and the Chairman is conducted 
each year. This year, the Board Effectiveness Review was administered 
by the Company Secretarial Department using structured questionnaires. 
The	results	were	assessed	by	the	Board	at	its	30	March	2017	meeting 	
and appropriate actions agreed.
Director induction
Following their appointment, the Company Secretary consults with new 
directors on the scope of induction to NATS which they require and a 
personalised induction programme is developed.
During	the	year,	such	a	programme	was	started	for	Maria	Antoniou	and	
Andrew	Barker.	This	programme	included	briefings	on	governance	and	
the NATS business, presentations from relevant executive management, 
and visits to key operational centres. In addition to an induction 
programme, all Board members are briefed on a continuing basis on key 
business issues.
The Board’s committees
The	Board	has	established	five	standing	committees	which	operate	within	
approved terms of reference. The committee structure comprises the:
 > Audit Committee;
 > Nomination Committee;
 > Remuneration Committee;
 > Safety Review Committee; and
 > Technical Review Committee.
The terms of reference for the Board and its committees are available 
to all staff and shareholders and can be made available externally with 
the agreement of the Legal Director. Reports from each of the standing 
committees are set out on pages 49 to 63. However, in addition to the 
standing committees, from time-to-time the Board may form committees 
on	an	ad	hoc	basis	to	deal	with	specific	business	issues.	During	the	year	
the Board formed a committee (comprising the Chairman and Chief 
Executive) to review non-executive director fees which will meet annually 
going forward.

NATS Governance framework
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  46
Progress Meetings	with	shareholders
A shareholders meeting is held once a year and provides the group with 
an opportunity to update the shareholders on the progress of the annual 
business plan and long term strategy. The meeting was the Annual 
General	Meeting	held	on	28	July	2016.	Shareholders	may	also	meet 	
informally with the Chairman, CEO, Finance Director and other members 
of executive management upon request.
Due to the manner in which non-executive directors are appointed by the 
shareholders under the SPA, there is no senior independent director.
 
Compliance	with	the	UK	Corporate	
Governance Code 
NATS is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The SPA requires the group and the directors to adhere to 
the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	so	far	as	reasonably	practicable	and	
save to the extent inconsistent with the other provisions of the SPA. For 
the	financial	year	ended	31	March	2017,	the	applicable	standard	is	the 	
2014	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	(the	Code).	
NATS has applied the principles of the Code to the extent considered 
appropriate	by	the	Board	throughout	the	year	ended	31	March	2017. 	
However, a number of principles and provisions in the Code are not 
relevant to the partnership nature of the NATS group’s ownership and 
the principal areas where NATS did not comply are summarised below.
Corporate Governance Code A.3.1: Independence 
of the Chairman
The Chairman is nominated by AG, his appointment being subsequently 
approved by the Secretary of State for Transport. He therefore does 
not fully meet the independence criteria as set out in the Code and this 
affects NATS’ compliance with a number of Code provisions.
Corporate Governance Code A.4.1, B.1: 
Independence of directors and appointment 
of Senior Independent Director 
The arrangements for appointing non-executive directors, as set out 
in the SPA, are such that none of the directors meet the Code’s criteria 
for independence. This affects NATS’ ability to comply with a number 
of the Code’s provisions, including the requirement to appoint a senior 
independent director.
Corporate Governance Code B.2.1, D.2.1: Composition 
of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees
Details of the work of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees 
are set out below. However, the manner in which directors are appointed, 
as noted above, means that these committees’ processes do not fully 
comply with the Code as regards independence.
Corporate Governance Code B.3.2: The terms 
and conditions of non-executive directors
As noted in the Remuneration Committee report, the AG Nominee 
directors and Partnership directors do not have service contracts with 
NATS and, as a result, the terms and conditions of appointment cannot 
be made available for inspection. The Partnership directors are engaged 
on	three-year	fixed-term	contracts	and	have	letters	of	appointment	from	
the Department for Transport. The Chairman has a service contract with 
NATS, details of which are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
Corporate Governance Code B.7: 
Re-election of directors
The non-executive directors are appointed by the shareholding groups 
and are therefore subject to the relevant shareholding groups’ selection 
processes, rather than those included in the provisions of the Code. 
They are therefore not subject to periodic re-election as stipulated by 
Section B.7 of the Code, although Partnership directors are appointed by 
the	Government	on	three-year	fixed-term	contracts.	This	aligns	with	the	
recommendation in B.7.1 that the maximum period between re-election 
is three years. 
NATS Governance framework
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  47
Progress The	tenure	of	non-executive	directors	at	31	March	2017	was	as	follows:
* Years of service to resignation, if earlier.
** Served until 28 July 2016.
*** Served until 28 September 2016.
The group is mindful of the principles behind the guidance in the Code 
relating to directors who have served longer than nine years.
Corporate Governance Code Section E: Relations with 
shareholders
Within the PPP structure, there are no institutional or public shareholders. 
However, the nature of the Strategic Partnership is such that the 
shareholders have representatives amongst the directors with whom 
they enjoy a close working relationship. All non-executive directors 
are invited to relay the views of their respective shareholders into 
Board discussions. The Board is therefore able to take decisions in 
the best interests of the group, having taken account of the views of 
the shareholders. The Chairman also has regular discussions with 
shareholders in addition to the formal meetings noted under the 
‘Meetings	with	shareholders’	section	above.

Progress The role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets four times per year. It is chaired by Richard 
Keys; Paul Golby and Harry Bush are the remaining two members of the 
Committee. The Committee members all have wide-ranging commercial 
and management experience and Richard Keys, a former audit partner 
at	PricewaterhouseCoopers	LLP	(PwC)	has	recent,	relevant	financial	
and audit experience. The Audit Committee members maintain their 
competence	in	the	sector	and	on	company	specific	issues	(such	as	
pensions)	through	targeted	training	and	briefing	at	Committee	meetings.
The CEO, Finance Director, Group Financial Controller, Head of Internal 
Audit,	NATS	Risk	Manager	and	the	external	auditors	are	invited	to	attend	
each meeting by standing invitation.
Part of each meeting is set aside as required for members of the Committee 
to hold discussions without executive management present, including 
holding separate discussions with the external and internal auditors.
The duties of the Committee include:
 > monitoring	the	integrity	and	compliance	of	the	group’s	financial	
statements;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of the external auditors and the Internal 
Audit department;
 > reviewing the scope and results of internal and external audit work; 
and
 > reviewing NATS’ systems of internal controls and risk management.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on matters 
relating to the appointment, independence and remuneration of the 
external auditors and, to ensure independence, monitors the extent 
of non-audit services provided by the external auditors (as explained 
below). The Committee also reviews whistleblowing arrangements under 
which	staff	may	confidentially	report	suspected	wrongdoing	in	financial	
reporting or other matters. 
Main	activities	of	the	Committee 
during the year
a. Financial reporting
The	primary	role	of	the	Committee	in	relation	to	financial	reporting	is	
to review with both management and the external auditors the annual 
financial	statements	of	the	group	and	its	subsidiaries	and	NERL’s	
regulatory accounts, having regard as appropriate to:
 > the suitability of accounting policies adopted by the group;
 > the clarity of disclosures and compliance with Companies 
Act	legislation	and	financial	reporting	standards,	including	the	
requirements	of	NERL’s	air	traffic	services	licence;	and
 > whether	significant	estimates	and	judgements	made	by 
management are appropriate.
In addition, the Committee assists the Board in its assessment of 
whether the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
To aid its reviews the Committee considers reports from the Finance 
Director and reports from the external auditors on the outcome of the 
annual audit.
The	Committee	considered	the	following	significant	accounting	
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty in the year:
The carrying values of goodwill, other intangible and tangible assets 
The group has goodwill of £198.3m, other intangible assets of 
£512.7m and tangible assets of £488.9m. As we explain in our 
accounting policies, goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are 
tested annually for impairment.
The judgement in relation to the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible and tangible assets relate to: the assumptions underlying the 
calculation of value in use, including the extent to which business plan 
cash	flow	projections	are	achievable	taking	account	of	the	outcome	of	
regulatory reference period reviews; and assessing fair values less costs of 
disposal, including the extent of any premium to regulatory asset values. 
The Committee addressed these matters by having regard to the higher 
of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal and considering: 
NERL’s revenue allowances from the Reference Period 2 (RP2) 
settlement	and	the	cash	flows	implied	by	its	latest	business	plan,	for	
determining value in use; the cost of capital assumption used to discount 
value in use; the value of NERL’s regulatory assets, including the scope 
for out-performance of regulatory settlements as well as premia to 
regulatory assets implied by market transactions in regulated entities, for 
determining value in use and also fair value less costs of disposal; the 
outcome of internal reviews of the carrying values of other intangible and 
tangible assets; and appropriate sensitivities. With respect to goodwill, 
the Committee considered value in use and fair value less costs of 
disposal and considered that an impairment charge of £11.0m was 
required. Further information is provided in notes 13, 14 and 15 to the 
accounts.
Retirement benefits
The pension funding position determined under international accounting 
standards requires a number of actuarial assumptions to be made, 
including	judgements	in	relation	to	long	term	interest	rates,	inflation,	
longevity and salary growth. The Committee reviewed the basis for 
determining	these	assumptions.	The	final	calculations	in	respect	of	the	
defined	benefit	pension	scheme	are	performed	by	a	qualified	actuary,	
independent of the scheme. Note 30 sets out the main actuarial 
assumptions used, including sensitivity analysis.
Reports from Board Committees
Audit Committee report
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  49
Progress Reports from Board Committees
Audit Committee report
The Committee had regard to the Trustees’ triennial valuation as at 31 
December	2015,	which	reported	a	larger	deficit	than	the	2012	triennial	
valuation. The 2015 triennial valuation requires higher contributions 
from the company and the Committee considered the adequacy of the 
group’s funding arrangements to meet the increase in contributions 
required by Trustees. 
The Committee also considered the adequacy of the explanations for the 
different basis of valuation for the Trustees funding assessment and for 
the balance sheet position under international accounting standards. 
Revenue recognition and the recoverability of revenue allowances
The	economic	regulatory	price	control	for	UK	en	route	services	allows	
for the recovery (or reimbursement) of revenue allowances where actual 
traffic	volumes	or	inflation	are	different	to	the	regulator’s	forecasts	made	
at the start of the reference period, where actual service performance is 
different to the regulator’s annual targets and for adjustments brought 
forward from the previous charge control period. NATS’ policy is to 
recognise these revenue adjustments in the year of service, based on 
traffic,	inflation	and	service	performance	experienced.	Where	regulatory	
revenue adjustments are assessed after the end of a reference period, 
their recoverability (or reimbursement) is dependent on the assessment 
of the economic regulator and recognised on this basis.
The Committee reviewed the nature and value of the regulatory revenue 
adjustments and considered the relevant EC Charging Regulations 
and	the	conditions	of	NERL’s	air	traffic	services	licence	for	RP2	in	
determining whether their recognition was appropriate. The recoverable 
and the reimbursable revenue allowances are reported in notes 16 and 
20 respectively.
Other matters
This year, the Committee also enquired as to the company’s plans 
for assessing the impact of IFRS15: Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, and the accounting impacts of contractual risks associated 
with	joint	ventures.	The	Committee	also	reviewed	financial	reports	issued	
to shareholders under the terms of the Strategic Partnership Agreement.
b. Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. 
NATS’	system	of	internal	control	is	designed	to	ensure	that	the	significant	
financial,	operational,	safety,	legal,	compliance	and	business	risks	faced	by	
the	group	are	identified,	evaluated	and	managed	to	acceptable	levels.	This	
system was in place during the year and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual	Report	and	Accounts	and	was	specifically	considered	for	the	year	
under review at its June 2017 Audit Committee meeting. However, as with 
all such systems, internal controls can provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee’s ongoing work in the area of internal control 
includes reviewing reports by the internal and external auditors, reviewing 
reports of any attempted or actual frauds, receiving reports from the 
management’s Tax and Treasury Committees, and consideration of the 
circumstances of whistleblowing reports.
In particular this year the Committee reviewed the results of internal 
audits of anti-fraud controls in areas of highest risk, and is monitoring 
management actions designed to ensure that NATS’ whistleblowing 
procedures continue to meet best practice and are understood 
throughout the company and amongst stakeholders and third parties. 
The Committee also considered cyber security risks including the 
establishment	of	an	Executive	Management	Committee	supported	by	
independent advice which will assist all the Board’s Committee’s in their 
understanding and governance of cyber security aspects across all of 
NATS’ top risks.
c. Risk management 
Risk management is essential in seeking to minimise the threat that an 
event or action might have on the group’s ability to achieve its objectives 
and to execute its strategies effectively. Successful risk management 
ensures that the group is able to consistently deliver services to its 
customers and meet the needs and expectations of its shareholders in a 
fast changing and uncertain environment.
The Board takes the management of risk very seriously, paying particular 
attention	to	areas	such	as	safety,	service	delivery,	operating	efficiency,	
pension	funding,	financial	control,	project	delivery,	regulatory	compliance,	
financing	and	IT	systems.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  50
Progress This	system	for	the	identification,	evaluation	and	management	of	risks	
is embedded within the group’s management, business planning and 
reporting	processes,	accords	with	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code,	
and is aligned with the ISO 31000 risk management standard. Detailed 
risk	identification	is	carried	out	at	business	unit	and	departmental	
levels and is recorded and measured in a controlled and managed 
enterprise-wide database. NATS’ risks are mapped against risk tolerance 
statements which have been agreed by the Board. Risk update reports 
are submitted to the NATS Executive team which address changes in 
risk tolerance, business controls and the progress of mitigating actions 
associated with NATS’ risks. 
The Audit Committee reviews the processes in place to identify, 
assess, mitigate and manage risk in order to satisfy itself that they 
are	appropriate	and	within	the	specified	risk	tolerance.	The	Board	
formally reviews the principal risks to NATS and the risk management 
processes and mitigations in place on a six monthly basis. The directors 
have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
business. In each monthly set of Executive reports to the Board, any 
changes	in	gross	or	residual	risk	of	a	‘top	risk’	will	be	highlighted	by	
exception, but particularly if the change means a risk falls outside of the 
agreed tolerance. The Audit Committee and Board have assessed the 
group’s principal risks and the performance against mitigation plans 
during	the	year	ended	31	March	2017,	and	agreed	the	actions	and 	
mitigations in place for the principal risks as at the date of this report. 
The Audit Committee and the Board also review the extent of 
warranties and guarantees entered into by the company, with particular 
focus on any unlimited liability indemnities entered into as part of 
commercial arrangements. 
d. Internal audit
The group’s Internal Audit department reviews the controls in place 
to manage NATS’ business risks, which includes reviews of internal 
financial	control.	In	order	to	access	the	specialist	skills	required	to	
perform assessments across the wide range of areas in which NATS 
operates, the Internal Audit function is operated as a co-source 
arrangement, primarily with PwC but with other providers if required.
The results of internal audits and agreed actions are reported as 
appropriate to relevant directors, executives and managers. The 
Audit Committee also oversees and monitors the actions taken by 
management	to	address	Internal	Audit	findings	and	considers	the	
ongoing independence of Internal Audit. The Audit Committee oversees 
the performance of Internal Audit through the receipt of a report on its 
work presented to each Audit Committee meeting and agrees the annual 
work plan in the context of the group’s audit and assurance universe.
e. External audit
BDO LLP was re-appointed as external auditors at the Annual General 
Meeting	on	28	July	2016.	The	Committee	reviewed	the	performance 	
and the continuing independence of BDO at its June meeting and 
recommended to the Board that BDO are re-appointed. Accordingly, a 
resolution	recommending	their	re-appointment	will	be	tabled	at	the	AGM	
on 30 July 2017.
f. Non-audit work performed by the external auditors 
From time-to-time the external auditors perform non-audit services for 
the group. Part of the Audit Committee’s remit is to ensure that such 
engagements do not impair the auditors’ objectivity or independence. 
The Committee does this by implementing a policy on non-audit 
services.	It	monitors	the	level	of	non-audit	fees	against	a	limit	of	70%	of 	
the average statutory audit fee incurred over the prior three years and 
approves work by the external auditors in accordance with this policy.
The principal non-audit services performed by BDO in the year ended 
31	March	2017	were	an	assurance	certificate 	in	respect	of	NERL’s	
regulatory accounts and independent reviews of claims for European 
grant funding. The cost of non-audit services is disclosed in note 6 of the 
‘Notes	forming	part	of	the	consolidated	accounts’.	
The Committee considered the nature and cost of these services 
and concluded that they did not impair the independence of the 
external auditor.

Nomination Committee report
The role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Chairman Paul Golby and, 
during the year, comprised three further non-executive directors, Peter 
Read,	Richard	Keys	and	Maria	Antoniou.	The	Committee	meets	when	
considered necessary by its members and may invite executives and 
advisors to attend meetings as appropriate.
Appointments to the Board are made by the relevant sponsoring 
shareholder under the terms of the SPA. The Committee has the task of 
evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and expertise required on the 
Board and making recommendations to the shareholders with regard 
to Board appointments. It also reviews succession plans for executive 
directors and senior executives.
Main	activities	of	the	Committee 
during the year
During	the	year,	the	Committee	met	three	times:	in	May	2016,	September 	
2016 and February 2017 and considered Board and Committee 
composition and non- executive director appointment. The Committee 
also undertook a review of NATS’ talent strategy and succession plan. 
The	appointment	of	Maria	Antoniou	by	HMG	as	a	Partnership	Director	
and Andrew Barker by AG were made during the year. Peter Read 
announced his retirement as Chairman of the Airline Group and a director 
of	NATS	with	effect	from	25	May	2017.	Mike	Campbell	was	appointed	by 	
AG as his successor. Will Facey, an AG appointed director, resigned from 
the Board, on 30 June 2017. AG will begin the search for a successor.
The Committee’s terms of reference require it to give due regard to the 
benefits	of	diversity,	including	gender	on	the	Board.

Progress Remuneration Committee report
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and 
approved by the Board. The information in this report is not subject to audit.
Purpose and responsibilities
The Committee meets when necessary and is responsible for:
 > considering and approving, on behalf of the Board, the arrangements 
for	determining	the	remuneration,	benefits	in	kind	and	other	terms	
of employment for the Chairman and executive directors and the 
company’s Personal Contract Group (which comprises c.300 
senior managers);
 > considering and approving company incentive targets for executive 
directors and other members of the wider executive team;
 > considering and approving a statement of remuneration policy; 
 > confirming	details	of	the	remuneration	of	each	executive	director	for	
inclusion in the Annual Report and Accounts; 
 > confirming	reward	arrangements	for	all	executive	team	members;	
and
 > considering exit arrangements for executive team members.
The terms of reference for the Committee require it to ensure the 
company’s remuneration policy complies with the current Corporate 
Governance Code, as far as practicable under the SPA. No director is 
involved in decisions relating to his or her own remuneration.
Main	activities	of	the	Committee 
during the year
The	Committee	met	five	times	in	2016/17	and	its	main	activities	during 	
the year were to:
 > review and approve the annual performance related pay targets for 
executive directors, the executive team and Personal Contract Group;
 > review and approve achievement of the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) cycle 3 targets and resulting payments;
 > review and update the terms of the executive team contracts in line 
with best market practice; and
 > agree remuneration for new executive team roles and termination 
payments for departing executive team members.
Membership
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is comprised entirely of 
non-executive	directors.	It	is	chaired	by	Maria	Antoniou	(who	replaced	
Andy	Lord	as	Chairman),	Gavin	Merchant	and	Andrew	Barker	(who	
replaced Brenda Dean). Paul Golby also attends the meeting (but is 
absent for discussion about his own remuneration).
Advisers and other attendees
As	appropriate,	the	CEO	and	HR	&	Corporate	Services	Director	are	invited	
to attend Committee meetings.
The company also takes external advice on various aspects of 
remuneration policy and competitive pay levels from independent 
consultants. New Bridge Street (NBS), part of Aon Hewitt, are 
independent advisers to the Committee. NBS has no other commercial 
relationship with the company. NBS is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and is a signatory to its code of conduct.
Remuneration policy
It is the company’s policy to establish and maintain competitive pay 
rates that take full account of the different pay markets relevant to its 
operations. In return, employees are expected to perform to the required 
standards	and	to	provide	the	quality	and	efficiency	of	service	expected	
by	its	customers.	In	fulfilling	this	policy,	the	company	fully	embraces	the	
principles	of	and	complies	with	the	provisions	of	the	UK	Corporate	Code	
on directors’ remuneration as outlined below.
The level of executive directors’ remuneration takes into account 
competitive practice across comparator companies (which are based on 
organisations, as agreed with the Committee, from which NATS might 
seek to recruit employees or which are similar to NATS in other respects) 
together with the need to attract and retain talent. Executive directors are 
rewarded on the basis of responsibility, competence and contribution, 
and salary increases take account of pay awards made elsewhere in 
the group. Performance-related elements form a substantial part of 
the total remuneration package and are designed to align the interests 
of directors with those of shareholders and other stakeholders and to 
promote the long term success of the company. 
Performance is measured against a portfolio of key business objectives 
and payment is determined based on performance beyond that expected 
of directors as part of their normal responsibilities. In implementing 
this strategy the Committee adopts the principle that incentive scheme 
targets must be stretching and in line with the Board’s agreed strategic 
growth and business plans.
Executive directors
The remuneration package for executive directors is reviewed each year 
and consists of, but is not restricted to:
 > annual salary;
 > pension, life assurance and income protection or ill health;
 > annual performance related incentive scheme;
 > long term performance related incentive scheme;
 > All-Employee Share Ownership Plan; and
 > other	benefits:	including	company	car	or	car	allowance,	financial	
advice, private medical cover and health screening.
Full details of directors’ remuneration paid in relation to 2016/17 are set 
out on page 57.

Progress Salaries
Salary policy summary
The Committee determines, where appropriate, annual increases 
to executive directors’ salaries having regard to their experience, 
responsibility, individual contribution, market comparatives and pay 
increases elsewhere in the group.
Operation
Executive directors’ salaries are normally reviewed annually and 
fixed	for	the	12	months	commencing	on	1	April.	The	Committee 
takes into consideration:
 > role, experience and performance of the individual;
 > internal and external relative positioning for total reward; and
 > the average budgeted increase in base salaries elsewhere in the group.
Implementation for 2017/18
In determining the base salaries for 2017/18, the Committee has 
determined that following a benchmarking exercise there will be an 
increase	of	£30,000	in	Martin	Rolfe’s	salary	from	1	April	2017	in	order 	
to align more closely to the market position. His initial base salary, on 
appointment to the role in October 2015, was positioned below market 
median with a view to progression into the role. Nigel Fotherby’s salary 
was increased by £2,042.
Pensions and life assurance
Pension and life assurance policy summary
To provide income in retirement through either:
 > Defined	Benefit	Pension	Scheme	(pre	April	2009)	with	4	times	final	
pensionable earnings, death in service and ill health arrangements; or
 > Defined	Contribution	Pension	Scheme	(post	April	2009)	pension	
scheme with 8 x basic salary death in service and income protection 
arrangements; or
 > A cash alternative in lieu of employer pension contributions (for those 
impacted by the lifetime allowance tax regime)¹7. 
Operation
Executive directors’ pensions and life assurance are based on salary 
only,	with	performance-related	pay	and	other	discretionary	benefits	
excluded. There are two principal methods of securing pensions for 
executive directors:
 > the	Civil	Aviation	Authority	Pension	Scheme	(CAAPS),	a	defined	
benefit	scheme.	This	scheme	was	closed	to	new	participants	on	1	
April 2009; and
 > the	NATS	Defined	Contribution	Pension	Scheme	which	came	into	
operation on 1 April 2009.
NATS offers a company-wide cash alternative payment scheme in lieu 
of employer pension contributions for those with total pension savings 
close to the Lifetime Allowance, which is also available to eligible 
executive directors.
Implementation for 2016/17
The	schemes	will	operate	as	described	above.	Martin	Rolfe	is	a	member	
of	the	Defined	Contribution	Pension	Scheme	in	order	to	make	employee	
pension contributions only. During April 2016, the company paid 
employer	contributions	of	£20,346	relating	to	the	financial	year	ended	31 	
March	2016,	in	line	with	employee	entitlements	for	that	year.	In	2016/17 	
he was eligible for the cash alternative payment scheme in lieu of 
employer pension contributions. Cash alternative payments of £60,000 
are included in his salary and fees in the directors’ remuneration table.
Nigel Fotherby was a member of CAAPS during the year.
The salaries of both directors are reported net of employee pension 
contributions	made	under	salary	sacrifice	arrangements.
Annual incentive scheme
An	Annual	Management	Performance	Related	Pay	Scheme 
(AMPRPS)	is	in	place	for	the	executive	team	and	all	staff	in	the 
Personal Contract Group.
AMPRPS policy summary
The	AMPRPS	is	designed	to	reward	on-going	delivery	and	contribution	to	
strategic targets during a one-year period. Targets are set annually and 
are	a	mix	of	financial	and	personal	performance.
Operation
AMPRPS	payouts	are	determined	by	the	Committee	after	the	year	end,	
based	on	performance	against	pre-determined	financial	and	personal	
objectives. The Committee may apply discretion as appropriate.
AMPRPS	is	paid	entirely	in	cash.	The	Committee	may	determine	that	
vesting should not be applied for any particular participant(s) should the 
Committee consider that individual performance or other circumstances 
makes this an appropriate outcome.

Long-term incentive plan
A Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is in place for members of the 
executive team. Following the review last year the LTIP is now aligned 
to the market, retaining market comparative maximum award levels 
combined with greater stretch in target values with an overall aim of 
retaining broadly similar total reward levels to the previous scheme. A full 
description of how the revised LTIP structure operates is set out below. 
LTIP policy summary
The	LTIP	is	designed	to	reward	the	achievement	of	a	set	of	financial	and	
strategic targets for rolling three-year periods.
Operation
Awards of notional shares are made annually with vesting dependent 
on the achievement of performance conditions over the three 
subsequent years.
To the extent that performance conditions are met awards will 
normally	vest	in	three	tranches,	50%	in	the	third	financial	year,	25%	in	
the	fourth	financial	year	and	25%	in	the	fifth	financial	year.	Transitional	
arrangements are in place for the cycle 5 award which creates a shorter 
performance window for this cycle to allow for a delay in implementation 
whilst considering scheme design.
Notional shares are linked to the NATS All-Employee Share Ownership 
Plan share price and participants receive cash payments in relation to the 
value at the time of vesting.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply to the LTIP at the discretion 
of the Committee in the event of material misstatement of results, 
an error in the calculation of outcome or in instances of individual 
gross misconduct.
Performance metrics
Profitability,	growth	and	strategic	targets	will	be	set	out	(to	the	extent	
they are not commercially sensitive at the time an award vests). These 
will be subject to the overarching event clause and adjusted to take 
account	of	traffic	levels.

All-Employee Share Ownership Plan
The NATS All-Employee Share Ownership Plan is designed to give every 
member of staff (including executive directors but not non-executive 
directors) an equal opportunity to acquire a stake in the future success 
of	the	company.	The	share	plan	holds	5%	of	the	shares	in	NATS	and	
is administered by a special trustee company with three directors – 
one	each	appointed	by	HM	Government,	AG	and	the	Trades	Unions	
(collectively	known	as	the	Trustee).	Maria	Antoniou	chairs	the 
Trustee meetings.
At	the	date	of	this	report,	Martin	Rolfe	holds	624	shares	and	Nigel 	
Fotherby holds 3,101 shares.
The	current	HM	Revenue	and	Customs	approved	valuation,	for	the	period	
1 January 2017 to 30 June 2017, values the shares at £3.95 each.
Employment contracts
The	employment	contracts	of	Martin	Rolfe	and	Nigel	Fotherby	provide	
for 12 months’ notice in the event of termination by the company or the 
executive director. 
Non-Executive Directors
Charges for the services of non-executive directors are determined 
in agreement with the relevant sponsoring body - the Department for 
Transport in the case of the Partnership directors and AG in the case of 
AG directors.
The Partnership directors each received annual remuneration of £36,000 
in	the	financial	year.	AG	directors	received	no	remuneration	for	their	
services to the NATS Board. However, a payment of £180,000 per annum 
is made to AG in lieu of remuneration for these directors. This sum is 
used to fund the activities of AG. 
Derek Provan is employed and remunerated by LHRA as part of his contract.
During the year a sub-committee of the Board comprising the Chairman 
and Chief Executive, reviewed the fees paid to non-executive directors. It 
determined that the base fee of £36,000 p.a. should remain unchanged, 
but that a supplemental fee of £8,000 be paid (effective 1 April 2017) 
to those non-executive directors who chair the Audit, Remuneration, 
Safety Review and Technical Review Committees of the Board, to 
reflect	the	additional	work	involved	in	preparing	and	chairing	the	
Committees. For AG appointed non-executive directors, it was agreed 
that the supplemental fee would be covered by fees paid to AG. It 
also agreed that the fees paid to AG be increased from £180,000 to 
£204,000 in recognition of the full employer cost of the AG directors and 
recommended that non-executive director fees be reviewed on an 
annual basis.
Paul Golby has a contract specifying the remuneration he receives from 
the company, being £160,000 on an annualised basis.
The Partnership directors are normally engaged on three-year 
fixed-term	contracts	and	have	letters	of	appointment	from	the	
Department for Transport.
Annual management performance 
related pay scheme outcome for 2016/17
Targets	relating	to	the	company	element	of	the	AMPRPS	for	2016/17 	
were	only	partly	achieved	(yielding	52.8%	out	of	an	available	75%	of 
the award). 
The	AMPRPS	targets	feature	three	key	measures:
 > Group	EBITDA	–	c.82%	of	the	available	weighting	achieved;
 > Customer focus measures – year end delay performance was below 
threshold value, therefore no payout for this element;
 > Time Based Separation – savings created in excess of the stretch 
target, therefore full payout;
 > Operational measures relating to key airspace milestones 
were achieved; and
 > the Commercial milestone was not achieved.
The personal performance payouts for the executive directors were 
22.5%	(out	of	an	available	25%).
Overall	this	resulted	in	a	total	payout	75.3%	out	of	an	available 	100%.
Long-term incentive scheme outcome for 
LTIP Cycle 4 2016/17
This	results	in	a	total	payout	of	96.3%	of	the	maximum	achievable	for 	
cycle 4, which will be payable in June 2017.

Progress Directors’ remuneration (continued)
Interests of the directors in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
From April 2011, the company introduced a rolling three-year executive LTIP, entitling the executive directors to performance related pay contingent 
on	achieving	financial	and	strategic	targets.	Cycle	4	commenced	in	April	2014	and	vested	on	31	March	2017.	From	cycle	5	the	maximum	entitlement 	
is changed into Notional shares and therefore the amount available will also be linked to the movement in the share price. Due to the timing of the 
review of the LTIP structure, a transitional award (cycle 5) was implemented in April 2016 with a reduced two-year performance period. Effective from 
April	2018,	the	LTIP	schemes	will	vest	50%	at	the	end	of	the	performance	period,	and	25%	per	year	for	the	following	two	years,	resulting	in	an	overall	
five-year	term	for	each	plan	(with	the	exception	of	the	transitional	cycle	5	which	will	have	a	reduced	four-year	term).
The maximum entitlement of the executive directors for each cycle as a percentage of average annual salary is shown below:
The	outcome	of	the	LTIP	is	not	known	until	the	end	of	each	cycle.	Accordingly,	the	emoluments	table	will	reflect	amounts	when	qualifying	conditions	
in	relation	to	each	cycle	are	met.	The	table	values	above	reflect	the	outcome	of	LTIP	cycle	4.
Pension benefits
Nigel	Fotherby	was	a	member	of	the	CAA	Pension	Scheme,	a	defined	benefit	pension	scheme,	during	the	year.	The	value	of	his	accrued	pension	
benefit	in	the	year	was	as	follows:
The	pension	value	represents	the	additional	benefit	accrued	in	the	year	(excluding	inflation	as	measured	by	the	Consumer	Prices	Index	(CPI))	
multiplied	by	a	factor	of	20.	The	pension	value	includes	contributions	paid	by	the	employer	on	behalf	of	Nigel	via	a	salary	sacrifice	arrangement.
The	principal	terms	of	the	company’s	defined	contribution	scheme	(DC	scheme)	are	explained	in	note	30	to	the	financial	statements.	Martin	Rolfe	
is  a member of the scheme in order to make employee pension contributions only. During April 2016, the company paid employer contributions of 
£20,346	relating	to	the	financial	year	ended	31	March	2016,	in	line	with	employee	entitlements	for	that	year.	Under	the	company’s	pension	salary

Aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts for the value of shares awarded under the company’s All-Employee Share 
Ownership Plan. The directors did not sell any shares during the year.
Details of the shares held by directors during the year are as follows:
In October 2015 employees, including executive directors, were offered the option to participate in an award of 150 partnership shares at fair value 
(being the lower of the share price at the start of the accumulation period of £3.95 and the end of the accumulation period being £3.65 per share) by 
deductions from gross salary over a 12 month accumulation period which ended in September 2016. Due to the decrease in share price, under the 
terms of the scheme, 162 shares were awarded to staff members applying for 150 shares. Participants also received one free matching share for 
every partnership share purchased. Both of the executive directors participated in this offer and were awarded 324 shares on 31 October 2016.
The	executive	directors	received	dividends	during	the	financial	year	based	on	their	shareholdings	at	the	distribution	date.

Progress Safety Review Committee report
The role of the Safety Review Committee
The Safety Review Committee supports the Board in discharging its 
accountabilities	for	the	safe	provision	of	air	traffic	services	and	for	security	
arrangements across NATS. It meets quarterly as a formal committee and 
receives	separate	in-depth	briefings	as	required. 
Its remit includes the requirements to:
 > monitor and review the effectiveness of the safety arrangements in place 
in the group;
 > review the delivery of the group’s safety and security objectives through 
its operations, structures and processes;
 > review the group’s safety performance;
 > monitor the implementation of safety enhancement programmes; and
 > make recommendations to the Board for improving the group’s safety 
and security management systems. 
The	Committee	is	chaired	by	Iain	McNicoll	and	there	were	two	other 
non-executive directors as members in the year: Will Facey and Derek 
Provan. The following are invited to attend each meeting by standing 
invitation: 
 > Chairman of the NATS Board;
 > CEO;
 > Safety Director;
 > Operations Director;
 > Technical Services Director;
 > Commercial Director;
 > Directors Swanwick, Prestwick and Airports; and
 > Directors Safety Operations and Technical Services.
The	Head	of	Facilities	Management	and	the	Chief	Information	Officer	
formally report to the Committee on the security arrangements in NATS 
twice per annum.
During the year, the Committee took advice from the following special 
advisers, who were invited to each meeting by standing invitation:
 > Dr	Don	Lloyd,	Director	Health	&	Safety	and	Environment	for	Genel	Energy	
plc	and	Visiting	Professor	in	Risk	at	Brunel	University	to	September	2016; 	
 > Professor Don Harris, Professor of Human Factors, Faculty of 
Engineering	and	Computing	at	Coventry	University;	and
 > Captain	John	Monks,	Head	of	Aviation	Safety,	British	Airways.
The Committee would like to thank Dr Don Lloyd for his advice over the 
years	and	welcomes	George	Bearfield,	Systems	Safety	Director,	for	the	Rail	
Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) as the Committee’s new advisor from 
February 2017.
Main	activities	of	the	Committee 
during the year
a. Operational safety
As part of its safety governance and oversight of the NATS operations, 
the	Committee	receives	regular	in-depth	reports	and	briefings	on	safety	
performance and associated improvement activities. Key topics throughout 
the last year were:
Infringements of controlled airspace
The CAA has the lead responsibility and, whilst NATS can, and has, taken 
mitigating actions to protect aircraft operating within controlled airspace 
from infringing aircraft, solutions to the root causes require the inclusion of 
the regulator. The Committee has continued to support the NATS Board and 
Executive in engaging with the CAA.
The Solent Collaborative airspace trial was successfully completed. This 
proved	the	value	of	the	Frequency	Monitoring	Transponder	Codes	in	helping	
to reduce infringements.
We supported a CAA Infringements Seminar which had over 90 delegates 
from across the general aviation (GA) community. As a result of this and 
further	NATS	engagement	with	the	CAA,	a	five-point	plan	is	now	in	action	
covering the use of technology by GA pilots, improvements to navigation 
training, a review of airmanship skills, continuation of robust enforcement 
action by the CAA, and better use of the Airspace Infringement Working 
Group to deliver improvements.
We will continue to support these projects, and maintain a close dialogue 
with the CAA.
Safety Performance Targets Review
The Committee and the Safety and Airspace Regulation Group (SARG) 
requested that a review be conducted of the internal safety targets to 
confirm	they	remain	fit	for	purpose.	Whilst	it	was	agreed	that	NATS’	safety	
targets are challenging, the Committee and the Board fully supported the 
review recommendation to retain the existing targets and to introduce the 
monitoring of overall RAT points, and the addition of a count of NATS and 
overall A, B and C events as reported metrics. These changes will enable the 
Committee and the Board to continue to monitor the safety performance of 
NATS operations effectively.
Safety Strategy and Safety Plan
The delivery of the NATS Safety Strategy and Safety Plan has continued, with 
briefings	on:	Human	Performance	enhancement,	particularly	during	change;	
the	risks	and	benefits	from	the	technology	and	airspace	change	programme;	
and the existing and developing procedural and technical mitigations to the 
risk of inadvertent entry onto an active runway.
Understanding safety performance
To ensure the Committee remains fully informed of new developments it 
receives	regular	briefings	on	emerging	topics.	Of	specific	interest	this	year	
has been a range of activities related to the evolving understanding of safety 
performance. Key developments that were shared with the Committee 
were	three	‘in	house’	initiatives:	first,	testing	of	hypotheses	of	the	driving	
factors	in	our	performance;	secondly,	forecasting	benefits	from	our	change	
programme; and thirdly, the prediction of where safety events are likely 
to occur in our operations. We were also briefed on the application of the 
European	Accident	Incident	Model	to	NATS	data.	We	were	encouraged	
by these initiatives and will continue to monitor and promote the use and 
development of new methods.
Reports from Board Committees
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  60
Progress European Regulation
As part of the Committee’s assurance that future risks and opportunities 
are being managed, we have been briefed on emerging European aviation 
safety legislation. Whilst such changes are a longer term issue, the potential 
to affect the way in which we implement safety management in NATS is 
significant.	The	Committee	will	continue	to	monitor	the	developments	in	
safety regulation.
b. Cyber security
As	the	sole	provider	of	UK	en	route	air	traffic	management,	NATS	is	part	of	
the	UK’s	critical	national	infrastructure.	NATS	is	also	increasingly	diverse	in	
its	business	operations,	with	activities	underway	in	the	UK	and	expanding	
into overseas territories. NATS relies on effective digital operations to deliver 
all these services and therefore places a very high priority on cyber security. 
It is recognised that NATS must be prepared for a variety of threats from a 
multitude of sources. NATS remains committed to the active management 
of cyber security risks and has, over the past 12 months, kept the Committee 
informed of the continued progress in the following areas:
 > NATS	has	maintained	ISO27001	certification,	the	international	standard 	
of information security management, for elements of our business and 
has plans to increase the scope during 2017;
 > The cyber-aware culture of NATS has continued to improve. Staff take 
mandatory security awareness training which is supported by innovative 
and engaging workshops, over 50 of which were run in calendar year 
2016. In addition, the staff security culture and awareness level was 
evaluated as part of the organisation wide Safety Culture survey (with 
methodology	developed	and	benchmarked	by	EUROCONTROL);
 > NATS continues to assess and improve the cyber security of all our 
services, including business, operational and airports;
 > NATS welcomed a variety of external reviews from experts such as top 
tier	professional	services	firms	and	Her	Majesty’s	Government.	The	
reviews demonstrated NATS commitment to continual improvement 
of our cyber capabilities; and
 > NATS has taken opportunities to strengthen relationships with the 
National Cyber Security Centre, Department for Transport and the Civil 
Aviation Authority.
However, cyber security is a major challenge for all industries; threats 
constantly develop, and attacks, both targeted and non-targeted, are 
frequent. Security therefore requires constant improvement, investment 
and vigilance. Through regular review of the strategy, and progress of 
the detailed cyber plan, the Committee has assured that a high level 
of protection of people, data, infrastructure and operations has been 
maintained and that NATS has an active security management system.
c. Corporate/physical security (external threats)
NATS’ Corporate Security department provides assurance reports, covering 
all aspects of physical security, internal and external threats to NATS, vetting, 
travel security, data protection and crisis management (incorporating 
business continuity). The principal focus for the Committee in the past year 
has been:
 
 
Governance
This ensures and maintains engagement at all levels of the business, from 
business area to Executive and Board level. Reporting to the Committee is 
on	a	bi-annual	basis,	in	June	and	December,	where	confirmation	is	provided	
that governance processes are in place and are robust.
Travel Security
The Committee has been briefed on the NATS response to security events 
in Paris and Brussels, including appropriate travel restrictions, and on the 
established approval and escalation procedures following any major incident. 
Further assurance of the travel security risk assessments for locations 
that NATS staff travel to, the use of Hostile Environment training, and the 
development of an online travel risk tool that will quickly identify the location of 
NATS staff have been provided. The NATS Travel Security Governance Group 
and the NATS Travel Steering Group have been combined to form the NATS 
Travel and Travel Security Steering Group. Formal Terms of Reference for the 
new Steering Group have been approved.
Crisis/Incident Management
The Committee has supported the continued work of the Executive 
and operational leadership teams in fully embedding Crisis/Incident 
Management	policies	and	procedures	in	the	culture	of	the	organisation.	
Detailed Gold, Silver and Bronze Team procedures are in place and regular 
exercising of Gold and Silver Teams has taken place. In addition, exercises 
are also undertaken with many outside agencies including the emergency 
services, DfT and CAA.
Vetting
Security vetting continues to be the foundation of our protection from the 
‘insider’	threat.	Vetting	clearance	times	during	calendar	year	2016	averaged 	
26	days	and,	although	a	very	slight	increase	on	2015,	this	is	still	significantly 	
better than the majority of vetting agencies.
Security Awareness
Face to face security awareness presentations to staff and contractors 
have been conducted across NATS sites. Police and security agencies have 
commented	favourably	on	the	content	and	delivery.	The	RUN,	HIDE,	TELL	
methodology has been well received by staff. Corporate Security played 
an	active	part	in	the	‘Safe	in	Everything	We	Do’	campaign	and	received	
extremely positive feedback on both the content and method of message 
delivery. 
Physical Security
Following the increase of the CPNI security status of CTC, Prestwick and 
Swanwick, considerable work was undertaken to ensure that all plans, 
procedures	and	response	measures	were	up	to	date	and	fit	for	purpose.	
External validation of all physical security measures was undertaken by 
specialist staff from CPNI and fully endorsed by them. Work has continued 
to build on the excellent working relationships with Police and Security 
Agencies.

Technical Review Committee report
The role of the Technical Review Committee
The role of the Technical Review Committee is to support the Board in 
monitoring the development and introduction of cost effective technical 
systems and services in support of its operations. Its remit includes:
 > ensuring	that	business	objectives	are	clearly	reflected	in	the	
requirements laid on technology programmes;
 > reviewing the technical strategies proposed to meet the agreed 
requirements, with appropriate regard to other (European and 
worldwide) initiatives and developments, and the likely impact on 
service provided to customers; 
 > reviewing the effectiveness of the operations, programmes, 
structures and processes employed in delivering the group’s technical 
objectives; and
 > making recommendations to the Board on means for improving the 
group’s technical systems, their implementation and performance.
The	Committee	is	temporarily	chaired	by	Iain	McNicoll	following	Peter	
Read’s retirement from the Board, until the appointment of a permanent 
chairman. There are two other non-executive directors as members: 
Mike	Campbell	and	Richard	Keys.	The	NATS	Chairman,	Paul	Golby,	also	
attends. The following are invited to attend each meeting by standing 
invitation:
 > Chief	Executive	Officer;
 > Technical Services Director;
 > Director Service Design and Transition;
 > Director Service Strategy and Transformation;
 > Director Strategic Assurance; and
 > Chief Systems Architect.
Main	activities	of	the	Committee 
during the year
As part of its governance and oversight of the NATS operations, the 
Committee	receives	regular	in-depth	reports	and	briefings	on	the	existing	
and	planned	investment	programmes,	and	the	technical	risk	profiles. 
The following issues have received focus by the Committee.
Deploying SESAR
SESAR is the European-wide standard for future systems, designed to 
produce	a	step	change	in	safety,	performance,	and	efficiency.	The	main	
challenge in the years ahead is the introduction of SESAR compliant 
systems. Each of the main programme components represents a 
significant	change	to	the	operation	and	to	the	systems.	The	size	and	
complexity of the composite programme brings an additional scale of 
risk to the business as a whole, which the Committee is committed to 
review on a continuing basis, in order to provide the necessary levels of 
reassurance to the Board. 
At the heart of the programme is iTEC. This is the new generation of 
core	flight	data	processing	systems	which	will	underpin	all	NATS	future	
operations and will operate on a common modern architecture to 
support	all	of	UK	airspace.
Significant	progress	has	been	made	this	year	in	developing	and	refining	
the plans and improving the reporting and oversight of the programme. 
Key elements of the programme during RP2 are:
a. Prestwick Centre (PC) Upper Airspace
Transition into Full Operational Service (FOS) of iTEC within Prestwick 
Upper	Airspace.	This	represents	the	first	deployment	of	a	new	Flight	Data	
Processing	(FDP)	System	in	UK	upper	airspace	for	over	40	years,	and	a	
key	first	step	to	roll	out	through	NATS	airspace.
b. Terminal Control (TC): Electronic Flight Strips
TC	moves	off	paper	flight	strips	onto	electronic	flight	strips,	providing	
safety	and	efficiency	benefits	and	enabling	the	necessary	stepping	
stones towards a full tool-based interface with iTEC and FourSight 
(advanced controller tools).
c. Area Control (AC): Voice Communications 
AC moves over to a new Voice over IP communications system together 
with a higher performance backup system. This reduces the risk 
associated with the existing voice system which is end of life, provides 
increased	resilience	to	failure	and	increases	flexibility	of	operations.
d. En Route: AC and PC Upper
AC and military move into the combined operations room at Swanwick 
supported	by	iTEC	and	FourSight.	Prestwick	Upper	Airspace	moves	onto	
the latest version of iTEC with FourSight, common across both centres.
This transition provides a 4D trajectory based FDP with the technology 
to	support	Free	Route	Airspace	and	more	flexible	airspace	designs.	
Additionally, it provides improved resilience and contingency, and the 
capability to support new ATC concepts e.g. dynamic sectorisation. 
It also removes legacy assets from service.
Airspace Change 
The second key element of NATS’ investment programme is airspace 
change,	which	will	allows	the	opportunity	to	deliver	significant	customer	
benefits	by	redesigning	airspace	routes	and	procedures	whilst	at	
the same time making use of the latest airborne and ground-based 
technology. However, a number of developments in the industry 
environment had given rise to challenges in the delivery of the airspace 
programme, particularly in lower level airspace. These include: 
 > Unprecedented	public	reaction	to	a	change	in	noise	patterns;
 > Planned public consultation on both the Airspace Change process 
and	the	UK	Government	policies	including	the	treatment	of	noise;
 > Government decision timeline on runways in the South East; and
 > Negative public reaction linked to uncertainty about runway expansion, 
severely	limiting	airports’	willingness	to	support	LAMP	developments.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  62
Progress As a result NATS engaged with key stakeholders around the impact 
of these challenges and subsequently consulted customers around 
revisions to the planned delivery of major airspace changes. The new 
plan focuses on the inclusion of mainly higher level airspace changes 
during RP2 with the intention of delivering the necessary lower level 
airspace changes in RP3. The key aspects of the revised airspace 
programme	during	RP2	are	identified	below:
 > Delivery	of	a	‘Point	Merge’	approach	system	for	London	City	Airport	
and a number of related changes completed in February 2016;
 > The redesign of certain aspects of the London Area Control operation 
to optimise performance and reduce emissions/fuel usage;
 > A single vehicle to develop and deliver consistent and systemised 
airspace in the North of England and Scotland through the Prestwick 
Lower Airspace Project;
 > The	delivery	of	Free	Route	Airspace,	where	traffic	will	not	be	
constrained	by	existing	route	structures	and	will	be	able	to	fly	user-
preferred direct routes across large swathes of airspace to optimise 
route	profiles;	and
 > Independent Parallel Approaches at Heathrow, subject to HAL 
completing some key dependencies (i.e. successful outcome of 
public consultation and securing CAA approval of the Airspace 
Change Proposal).
Resilience
Resilience of operational systems results from a combination of 
reliability and powers of recovery. Over many years NATS has been 
successful in implementing highly resilient systems, necessary to the 
fulfilment	of	its	mission.	The	Committee	is	considering	the	subject	in	
more	depth	as	a	result	of	a	small	number	of	significant	events	in	recent	
years. The objective is to balance the levels of investment against 
realistic expectations of resilience in a complex systems environment.

the workforce, including such matters as corporate performance and 
business plans. The NATS CEO maintains high visibility with staff 
through visits to NATS sites where he talks to them about current 
business issues and takes questions in an open and straightforward 
manner. Also, employees’ views are represented through an open 
dialogue	with	Prospect	and	the	Public	and	Commercial	Services	Union	
(PCS), the recognised unions on all matters affecting employees. This 
has been enhanced through the Working Together programme aimed at 
working towards partnership principles as the basis for our relationship. 
Formal arrangements for consultation with staff exist through a local and 
company-wide	framework	agreed	with	the	Trades	Unions.	
It is the group’s policy to establish and maintain competitive pay rates 
which take full account of the different pay markets relevant to its 
operations. In return, employees are expected to perform to the required 
standards	and	to	provide	the	quality	and	efficiency	of	service	expected	
by its customers.
The group is an equal opportunities employer. Its policy is designed to 
ensure that no applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment 
than any other on the grounds of sex, age, disability, marital status, 
colour, race, ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation, nor is 
disadvantaged by conditions or requirements applied to any post which 
cannot be shown to be fair and reasonable under relevant employment 
law or codes of practice.
The group is also committed to improving employment opportunities 
for disabled people. The group will continue to promote policies and 
practices which provide suitable training and retraining, and development 
opportunities for disabled staff, including any individuals who become 
disabled, bearing in mind their particular aptitudes and abilities and the 
need to maintain a safe working environment.
The group strives to maintain the health and safety of employees 
through	an	appropriate	culture,	well-defined	processes	and	regular	
monitoring. Line managers are accountable for ensuring health and 
safety is maintained and responsibility for ensuring compliance with both 
legal	requirements	and	company	policy	rests	with	the	HR	&	Corporate	
Services Director.

Progress Going concern, viability statement and 
subsequent events
The directors’ assessment of going concern and their viability statement 
are set out on page 20. Subsequent events are disclosed in note 34 to 
the	financial	statements.	
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	laws	and	regulations.
Company	law	requires	the	directors	to	prepare	financial	statements	for	
each	financial	year.	Under	that	law	the	directors	have	elected	to	prepare	
the	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	
Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union.	Under	
company	law	the	directors	must	not	approve	the	financial	statements	
unless	they	are	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state 
of	affairs	of	the	group	and	of	the	parent	company,	and	of	the	profit	or	
loss of the group and the parent company for that period. In preparing 
these	financial	statements,	International	Accounting	Standard	1 
requires that directors:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 > provide	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	with	the	specific	
requirements	in	IFRSs	are	insufficient	to	enable	users	to	understand	
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on 
the	entity’s	financial	position	and	financial	performance;	and
 > make an assessment of the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that	are	sufficient	to	show	and	explain	the	group’s	transactions	and	
disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	position	
of	the	group	and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	financial	statements	
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each	person	who	is	a	director	at	the	date	of	approval	of	these	financial	
statements	confirms	that:
 > so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the group’s auditors are unaware; and
 > the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the group’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with 
the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate	and	financial	information	included	on	the	group’s	website.	
Legislation	in	the	United	Kingdom	governing	the	preparation	and	
dissemination	of	financial	statements	may	differ	from	legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
We	confirm	that	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge:
 > the	financial	statements,	prepared	in	accordance	with	International	
Financial	Reporting	Standards	as	adopted	by	the	EU,	give	a	true	and	fair	
view	of	the	assets,	liabilities,	financial	position	and	profit	of	the	group;
 > the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; 
and
 > the	annual	report	and	financial	statements,	taken	as	a	whole,	are	fair,	
balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Progress Opinion on financial statements of NATS 
Holdings Limited
In our opinion:
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
 > the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) adopted by the European Union;
 > the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The	financial	statements	comprise	the	consolidated	income	statement,	
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
and company balance sheets, the consolidated and company statement 
of	changes	in	equity,	the	consolidated	cash	flow	statement	and	the	
related notes.
The	financial	reporting	framework	that	has	been	applied	in	their	
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union	and,	as	regards	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	as	
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB
As	explained	in	note	2	to	the	financial	statements,	in	addition	to	
complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the 
European	Union,	the	group	has	also	applied	IFRSs	as	issued	by	the	
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In	our	opinion	the	group	financial	statements	comply	with	IFRSs	as	
issued by the IASB.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the	directors	are	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	the	financial	
statements	and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view.	
Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	and	express	an	opinion	on	the	financial	
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	standards	require	us	to	
comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
As a result of a contractual agreement between the company’s 
shareholders	requiring	compliance	with	certain	aspects	of	the	UK	
Corporate Governance Code, the directors have included a corporate 
governance	statement	relating	to	the	company’s	compliance	with	the	UK	
Corporate Governance Code, a statement in relation to going concern, 
longer term viability and a directors’ remuneration report and have asked 
us to report on these statements as if the company were listed. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement and 
overview of the scope of our audit
A	description	of	the	scope	of	an	audit	of	financial	statements	is	provided	
on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group 
and its environment, including the group’s system of internal control, and 
assessing	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	in	the	financial	statements	
at the group level. 
We	carried	out	full	scope	audits	on	all	significant	components	which	
covered	99%	of	the	group’s	revenue.	We	performed	limited	procedures	
on	the	remaining	components.There	has	been	no	significant	change	in	
the group’s operations nor in our assessment of materiality, therefore 
the assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are 
those that had the greatest effect on the audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the audit team, are the 
same risks as in the prior year.
We set out below the risks that had the greatest impact on our audit 
strategy and scope.The Audit Committee’s consideration of these 
matters is set out on pages 49 to 51.

Revenue recognition and the 
recoverability of the regulatory assets:
The group generates revenue in relation 
to Airspace, Airports, Defence and 
other services.
In determining the revenues recognised, 
management makes key judgements 
about material revenue allowances that 
are recoverable or payable in subsequent 
accounting periods.
We	have	reviewed	each	significant	revenue	stream	to	ensure	that	we	concur	with	the	accounting	
policies applied.
We have reviewed and tested each of the revenue streams to ensure that the revenue is being 
recognised in line with the group policy and, in the case of Airspace, to ensure that it is in line 
with	the	provisions	of	the	air	traffic	services	licence,	the	regulatory	charging	mechanisms	for	the	
reference period and the RP2 settlement. 
We	have	specifically	considered	and	challenged	management	over	the	amounts	recoverable 
or payable as revenue allowances under the EC Charging Regulation. 
We have also reviewed individual judgements including the margin assumptions on 
Project	Marshall,	and	contract	accounting	judgements	in	relation	to	percentage	of 
completion and margin.
Pension scheme valuation: 
The NATS Holdings Limited group 
operates	a	defined	benefit	pension	
scheme, which is accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 19: Employee 
Benefits which requires complex 
calculations and disclosures.
Management	make	a	number	of	judgements	
and actuarial assumptions which have 
a	significant	impact	on	the	valuation	of	
pension scheme assets and liabilities shown 
in the balance sheet and hence on the 
amounts shown in the consolidated income 
statement and the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
We have reviewed the pension scheme data and accounting treatment and disclosures and 
considered them in light of the pension assumptions made. 
We have worked with our pension specialists to assess the validity of assumptions applied, 
in	particular	discount	and	inflation	rates	and	mortality	assumptions	and	performed	a	detailed	
review of the scheme actuary’s annual valuation report. 
In addition we have performed audit procedures in order to substantiate the value of the scheme 
assets. This included selecting a sample of investments held at the balance sheet date and 
comparing their value to supporting documentation.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of goodwill: 
In accordance with the group’s accounting 
policies, management has undertaken 
an impairment review of the carrying 
value of goodwill by comparison with the 
recoverable amount. This has resulted 
in a charge to the consolidated income 
statement of £11.0m. 
In calculating an appropriate valuation for 
the recoverable amount of the regulatory 
business, the premium applied to the 
Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) continues to 
be a key judgement, alongside the estimate 
of	future	cash	flows.
We have reviewed and tested management’s current assessment of the carrying amount 
of goodwill. 
We have reviewed, with the assistance of our own specialists, the overall methodology, cash 
flow	forecasts,	discount	rate	assumptions	and	benchmarking	available	to	support	the	RAB	
premium applied in determining terminal values and the fair value less costs to dispose. 
Our	audit	testing	of	operating	cash	flows	included	comparing	forecasts	to	recent	financial	
performance and budgets approved by the Board.
We tested the integrity of the model and considered the impact of management’s 
sensitivity calculations.
Capital investment programme:
The	group	invests	significant	sums	in	the	
sustainment	and	development	of	air	traffic	
control infrastructure.
A substantial proportion of the costs 
incurred are the amounts charged by 
staff employed by the group which are 
capitalised	to	specific	projects.
A key judgement is that either time is not 
appropriately capitalised or the quantum of 
the labour rate used could be misstated.
In addition management makes 
judgements around the useful economic 
lives of currently deployed systems, 
assesses indicators of impairment and 
considers feasibility.
We	have	worked	with	the	project	managers	outside	of	the	group	finance	team	in	order	to	gain	an	
understanding of the capital projects, and assessed them for impairment factors.
We have tested a sample of capitalised projects which included reviewing the appropriateness 
of the labour rates being used and the amount of labour time being capitalised per project.
We have assessed management’s judgement of the useful economic lives of currently deployed 
systems to ensure that the position taken is reasonable. 
We have considered management’s assessment of any indicators of impairment for a sample of 
current	capital	projects	carried	forward	as	either	tangible	or	intangible	fixed	assets.
In addition we have tested a sample of externally generated assets to test existence and that 
costs are materially accurate.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance report   |  68
Progress Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For planning, 
we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, 
including	omissions,	could	influence	the	economic	decisions	of	
reasonable	users	that	are	taken	on	the	basis	of	the	financial	statements.	
In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any 
misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, 
performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. 
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily 
be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of 
identified	misstatements,	and	the	particular	circumstances	of	their	
occurrence,	when	evaluating	their	effect	on	the	financial	statements 
as a whole.
The	materiality	for	the	group	financial	statements	as	a	whole	was	set	at	
£9.1m. This was determined with reference to a benchmark of revenue 
of which it represents one per cent which we consider to be one of the 
principal considerations for members of the company in assessing the 
financial	performance	of	the	group.	
Performance	materiality	was	set	at	seventy	five	per	cent	of	the	above	
materiality levels.
Materiality	levels	are	not	significantly	different	from	those	applied	in	the	
previous year. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
committee all individual audit differences in excess of £273,000. We 
also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 > the information given in the Strategic report and the Report of the 
directors’	for	the	financial	year	for	which	the	financial	statements	are	
prepared	is	consistent	with	the	financial	statements;	and
 > the Strategic report and the Report of the directors’ have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Opinion on other matters
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
that would apply if the company was a listed company.
Statement regarding the directors’ assessment of 
principal risks, going concern and longer term 
viability of the company
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 > the	directors’	confirmation	in	the	annual	report	that	they	have	
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
 > the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated; and
 > the	directors’	statement	in	the	financial	statements	about	whether	
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting	in	preparing	them	and	their	identification	of	any	material	
uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of	at	least	12	months	from	the	date	of	approval	of	the	financial	
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
have	not	identified	material	misstatements	in	the	Strategic	report	or	the	
Report of the directors’.
Under	the	ISAs	(UK	and	Ireland),	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	
opinion, information in the annual report is:
 > materially	inconsistent	with	the	information	in	the	audited	financial	
statements; 
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
 > is otherwise misleading.
In	particular,	we	are	required	to	consider	whether	we	have	identified	
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if, 
in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 > the	parent	company	financial	statements	are	not	in	agreement	with	
the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain	disclosures	of	directors’	remuneration	specified	by	law	are	not	
made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.

1. General information
NATS Holdings Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England 
and	Wales	and	domiciled	in	the	United	Kingdom	and	acting	under	the	
Companies	Act	2006.	The	address	of	the	registered	office	is	on	page 	65. 
The nature of the group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the Report of the directors and in the Strategic report.
These	financial	statements	are	presented	in	pounds	sterling	because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
group operates.
2. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently both in the 
current and prior years in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation	to	the	group’s	financial	statements.
Basis of preparation and accounting
The	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	on	the	going	concern	
basis.	For	further	detail	please	refer	to	page	20.	The	financial	statements	
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee	(IFRIC)	interpretations	as	endorsed	by	the	European	Union	
(EU)	and	therefore	the	group	financial	statements	comply	with	Article	4	of	
the	EU	IAS	Regulation.	The	financial	information	has	also	been	prepared	in	
accordance with IFRSs.
In the current year, the group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IAS 1 (amendments): Disclosure Initiative
IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendments): Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
IAS 27 (amendments): Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 (amendments): Applying the 
Consolidation Exemption
The application of these amendments has not resulted in any material 
impact	on	the	financial	statements	of	the	group.
At	the	date	of	authorisation	of	these	financial	statements,	the	following	
Standards	and	Interpretations	which	have	not	been	applied	in	these	financial	
statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not 
yet	been	adopted	by	the	EU):
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16: Leases
IAS 7 (amendments): Disclosure Initiative
IAS 12 (amendments): Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets 
for Unrealised Losses
IFRIC 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments	deals	with	classification,	measurement	
and	derecognition	of	financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities,	hedge	
accounting and introduces a new expected loss impairment model. 
The standard is expected to have two main impacts on the group: the 
adoption of the expected loss impairment model in assessing the fair 
value of trade and contract receivables and loans to joint ventures; and 
the option to recognise the impact of changes in own credit risk in other 
comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
The group expects to recognise lifetime expected credit losses (i.e. losses 
arising	from	default	over	the	life	of	a	financial	instrument)	for	its	trade	and	
contract receivables and loans to joint ventures. In general, the directors 
anticipate that the application of the expected credit loss model of IFRS 9 
will result in earlier recognition of credit losses.
The group is also assessing whether the new standard will be implemented 
with a restatement of the previous period. If this is deemed impracticable 
at	the	date	of	initial	application,	an	adjustment	will	be	reflected	in 
retained earnings.
The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018.
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers will replace IAS 18: 
Revenue and IAS 11: Construction Contracts, and provides enhanced detail 
on	the	principle	of	recognising	revenue	to	reflect	the	transfer	of	goods	and	
services to customers at a value which the group expects to be entitled to 
receive. The standard also updates revenue disclosure requirements.
The group’s principal sources of revenue are Airspace, Airports, Defence, 
Other	UK	Business	and	International	as	described	in	note	5.
The group is undertaking a preliminary assessment of the impact of the 
standard by reviewing major contracts from each source of revenue. This 
assessment	is	subject	to	change.	The	principal	impact	identified	from	
this	assessment	to	date	is	the	reclassification	of	airport	ATC	revenue.	A	
number of airport ATC contracts require the group to rent the airport control 
tower buildings from the airport operator and to recover the property costs 
through the fee charged to the airport operator for ATC services. The 
fees for recovering property costs amount to c.£17m per annum and are 
recognised	as	revenue	under	IAS	18.	Under	IFRS	15,	the	provision	of	the	
air	traffic	control	tower	is	not	considered	to	be	distinct	from	the	provision	
of ATC services. Accordingly, the fee for recovering property costs would 
be	reclassified	from	revenue	and	netted	in	operating	costs	against	rental	
charges in the income statement, with no impact to the result.
The major part of the group’s revenue is derived from service contracts 
which	include	performance	obligations	which	are	satisfied	over	time	as	
customers	simultaneously	receive	and	consume	the	benefits	provided	
by the group’s performance as the group performs or which include 
enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date. In 
addition, the transaction price for NERL’s economically regulated services 
and	certain	airport	ATC	contracts	include	variable	consideration	for	traffic	
volume	risk	sharing,	inflation	adjustments,	service	performance	incentives	
and	financing	components.	The	group’s	preliminary	assessment	is	that	
the nature, timing and amount of revenue for these service contracts is not 
materially different under IFRS 15.

Progress Notes forming part of the 
consolidated accounts
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018. The directors do not intend to adopt the standard earlier 
and expect to use the full retrospective method upon adoption which 
requires	the	restatement	of	comparative	financial	information.
IFRS 16: Leases	specifies	how	a	company	will	recognise,	measure,	
present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee 
accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities 
for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying 
asset has a low value.
As	at	31	March	2017,	the	group	has	non-cancellable	operating	lease 	
commitments of £94.5m as disclosed in note 28. A preliminary 
assessment	indicates	that	these	arrangements	will	meet	the	definition	
of a lease under IFRS 16, and hence the group will recognise an increase 
to total property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability in 
respect of all these leases, unless they qualify for low value or short-term 
leases upon the application of IFRS 16.
The group’s preliminary assessment is that property, plant and 
equipment is likely to increase by c.£100m, lease liabilities by c.£110m 
and accruals are likely to decrease by c.£10m (relating to the balance 
of rent free period incentives not recognised on transition) as at 31 
March	2020.
Over	the	life	of	leased	assets,	there	will	be	no	profit	impact	from	adopting	
IFRS	16	but	profit	will	vary	between	financial	years	as	interest	charges	on 	
finance	leases	are	higher	at	the	beginning	of	the	lease	term	and	reduce	
as	the	lease	principal	is	repaid.	Profit	before	tax	for	the	year	ending	31	
March	2020	is	expected	to	be	c.£1.5m	lower	following	adoption	of 
this standard.
The directors are still in the process of assessing the full impact of the 
application	of	IFRS	16	on	the	group’s	consolidated	financial	statements 	
and as a result the above preliminary assessment is subject to change. 
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January	2019,	subject	to	EU	endorsement.	The	directors	do	not	intend	
to apply the standard earlier and have not yet assessed the transition 
accounting method to be used upon adoption.
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the other standards and 
interpretations	listed	above	will	have	a	material	impact	on	the	financial	
statements in future periods.
The	financial	information	has	been	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	basis.	
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The	consolidated	financial	statements	incorporate	the	financial	
statements of the company and entities controlled by the company (its 
subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the company has the power over 
the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from involvement with 
the investee and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the 
amount of an investor’s returns.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods or services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and 
other sales related taxes. Revenue is recognised as follows:
 > Income from the rendering of services is recognised when the 
outcome can be reliably estimated and then by reference to the stage 
of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date and in 
accordance	with	NATS	(En	Route)	plc’s	air	traffic	services	licence	
(including volume risk sharing, service performance incentives, costs 
exempt	from	risk	sharing	and	inflation	adjustments)	and	airport	
contracts and other contracts. Amounts receivable (and payable) 
include revenue allowed under the charge control conditions of the air 
traffic	services	licence	and	EC	Charging	Regulations.
 > Sales of goods are recognised when they are delivered and title 
has passed.
 > Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to 
receive payment have been established.
 > Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. This is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial	asset	to	that	asset’s	net	carrying	amount.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the group’s Executive team, which is considered to 
be the chief operating decision maker. An operating segment represents 
a service line organised by customers who receive common products or 
services. Operating segment operating results are reviewed regularly by 
the Executive team to make decisions about resources to be allocated 
to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete 
financial	information	is	available.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the 
normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to 
unrelated third parties.
Segment performance is assessed by service line revenue and 
contribution, where contribution represents revenue less costs directly 
attributed to individual service lines. Segment results that are reported to 
the Executive team include items directly attributed to a segment as well 
as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Costs that are not 
attributed to service lines include the cost of central support functions, 
depreciation and amortisation (net of Government grants), goodwill 
impairment, employee share scheme (costs)/credits, redundancy and 
relocation	costs,	above	the	line	tax	credits	and	any	profit	or	loss	on	
disposal of non-current assets.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements   |  80
Progress Exceptional items and goodwill impairment charges
Exceptional items deemed as such by the directors by virtue of their 
nature or size, and goodwill impairment charges which may recur, are 
included	under	the	statutory	classification	appropriate	to	their	nature	but	
are separately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist in 
understanding	the	financial	performance	of	the	group.
Operating profit
Operating	profit	is	stated	after	charging	restructuring	costs	but	before	
the group’s share of results of joint ventures and associates, investment 
income, the fair value movement in the index-linked swap contract, 
finance	costs	and	taxation.
Goodwill
Goodwill in relation to NATS (En Route) plc, being the excess of 
consideration over the values of the net assets acquired at the date 
of the Public Private Partnership (PPP), is recognised as an asset and 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing NATS assesses the carrying value 
of goodwill against the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to 
which goodwill has been allocated. Where the recoverable amount is less 
than the carrying value, the impairment loss is allocated to goodwill.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 
value in use. Fair value less costs of disposal is assessed by reference 
to the Regulatory Asset Bases (RABs) of the economically regulated 
activities and costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future	cash	flows	(with	a	RAB	terminal	value,	as	a	proxy	for	future	cash	
flows)	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	the	pre-tax	nominal	
regulated rate of return. A premium is applied to the RAB (see note 3).
Leases 
Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	lease	
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee.	All	other	items	are	classified	as	operating	leases.
Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	recognised	as	assets	of	the	
group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a	finance	lease	obligation.	Lease	payments	are	apportioned	between	
finance	expenses	and	the	reduction	of	the	lease	obligation	so	as	to	
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability.	Finance	expenses	are	recognised	immediately	in	profit	or	loss,	
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets in which case 
they are capitalised in accordance with the group’s policy on borrowing 
costs (see below).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a 
straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	relevant	lease.	Benefits	received	
and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. The cost of 
property, plant and equipment includes internal and contracted labour 
costs directly attributable to bringing the assets into working condition 
for their intended use. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis 
to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of property, plant and 
equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:
 > Leasehold land: over the term of the lease
 > Freehold buildings: 10-40 years
 > Leasehold buildings: over the remaining life of the lease to a 
maximum of 20 years
 > Air	traffic	control	systems:	8-15	years
 > Plant and other equipment: 3-15 years
 > Furniture,	fixtures	and	fittings:	10	years
 > Vehicles: 5 years
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction and installation 
are not depreciated.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Borrowing costs
Following the amendments of IAS 23: Borrowing Costs, the costs of 
borrowings directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the 
asset (i.e. there is no longer a choice to expense such costs). Qualifying 
assets are those which take a substantial time to get ready for intended 
use. These do not include assets which are ready for use when acquired.
For NATS this assumes qualifying assets relate to any additions to 
new projects that began from 1 April 2009, included in assets under 
construction, and excludes acquisitions that are acquired in a state 
ready for use.
When	funds	are	borrowed	specifically	for	the	purpose	of	acquiring	
or constructing a qualifying asset, the amount of borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation is the actual cost of borrowing incurred in the 
period. IAS 23 requires that where a qualifying asset is funded from 
a pool of general borrowings, the amount of borrowing costs eligible 
for capitalisation should be determined by applying an appropriate 
capitalisation rate (based on the weighted average of borrowing costs 
applicable to the general outstanding borrowings during the period) to 
the expenditure during the period, to determine the borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalisation.
Notes forming part of the 
consolidated accounts
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements   |  81
Progress Notes forming part of the 
consolidated accounts
For NATS, the percentage rate for interest capitalisation is calculated as 
a proportion of the interest costs to the average level of borrowings in the 
period that relate to qualifying capital expenditure. All qualifying capital 
expenditure	is	then	inflated	by	this	percentage	which	has	the	effect	of	
capitalising related interest costs.
Government grants and other grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated 
as deferred income and released to the income statement by equal 
annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives of the 
related assets. 
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income in the period to which 
they relate (and are reported on the face of the income statement).
Funding received from the Innovation and Network Agency (INEA) 
for SESAR deployment projects is deferred on the balance sheet and 
reported	as	a	liability	falling	due	after	more	than	one	year	(at	31	March	
2017).	Under	EC	rules,	this	funding	represents	a	contribution	towards 	
future revenue allowances.  For this reason, once the relevant assets 
are deployed, the relevant amounts of INEA funding will be recognised 
as revenue.
Investments in associates and joint ventures 
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise 
significant	influence,	but	not	control,	through	participation	in	the	financial	
and	operating	policy	decisions	of	the	investee.	Significant	influence	is	the	
power	to	participate	in	the	financial	and	operating	policy	decisions	of	the	
investee but is not control over those policies. 
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these 
financial	statements	using	the	equity	method	of	accounting.	
A joint venture is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint 
control. The investors in the joint venture have rights to the net assets of 
the jointly controlled entity. The results of joint ventures are incorporated 
in	these	financial	statements	using	the	equity	method	of	accounting.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the balance 
sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments.
Internally-generated intangible assets - research and 
development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the group’s 
development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions 
are met:
 > the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it 
will be available for use or sale;
 > the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
 > the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
 > how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic 
benefits;
 > the	availability	of	adequate	technical,	financial	and	other	resources	to	
complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
 > the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the 
intangible asset during its development.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful lives, typically over 3 to 12 years. Assets in the 
course of construction are not amortised until ready for use. Where no 
internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets, including those in the course of 
construction, to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate	cash	flows	that	are	independent	from	other	assets,	the	group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 
the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	the	pre-tax	nominal	
regulated rate of return for NERL (with a RAB terminal value as a proxy 
for	future	cash	flows)	and	for	NATS	Services	the	weighted	average	cost	
of capital.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss on an intangible or tangible asset, excluding 
goodwill, subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income 
statement immediately.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements   |  82
Progress Amounts recoverable on contracts
Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue 
and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by 
the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date 
bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not 
be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, 
claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have 
been, or are more likely than not to be, agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract 
revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is 
probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses 
in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Share-based payments 
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: 
Share-Based Payments.
In 2001, the company established an All-Employee Share Ownership 
Plan	for	the	benefit	of	its	employees	to	hold	5%	of	the	share	capital	
of NATS Holdings Limited. The Plan was initially established through 
the transfer of shares by the Crown Shareholder at the PPP to NATS 
Employee Sharetrust Limited (NESL) for £nil consideration. Following 
financial	restructuring	in	March	2003,	further	shares	were	transferred	to	
NESL by The Airline Group Limited (AG) for £nil consideration and NESL 
was gifted cash of £279,264 to acquire additional shares to maintain the 
Plan’s	interest	at	5%	of	the	share	capital	of	NATS	Holdings	Limited.	This	
amount	is	reflected	in	the	AESOP	reserve.	The	Plan	is	administered	by	
NESL, a trustee company. The employee ordinary shares may only 
be owned by employee shareholders and can only be sold to the 
trust company.
Shares awarded by the Plan are treated as cash-settled liabilities. A 
liability is recognised for shares awarded over the period from award to 
when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares and 
are measured initially at their fair value. At each balance sheet date until 
the liability is settled, as well as at the date of settlement, the fair value of 
the liability is re-measured based on independent share valuations with 
any	changes	in	fair	value	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	for	the	year.
In	respect	of	the	award	schemes,	the	group	provides	finance	to	the	NESL	
to enable the trust company to meet its obligations to repurchase vested 
or eligible shares from employees.
The costs of running the employee share trust is charged to the 
income statement.
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in 
the	financial	statements	and	the	corresponding	tax	bases	used	in	the	
computation	of	taxable	profit,	and	is	accounted	for	using	the	balance	
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	that	taxable	profits	will	be	available	
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction	that	affects	neither	the	tax	profit	nor	the	accounting	profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient	taxable	profits	will	be	available	to	allow	all	or	part	of	the	asset	
to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current liabilities 
and when they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and 
the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
Under	the	Finance	(No.2)	Act	2015	which	was	enacted	on	18	November	
2015,	the	corporation	tax	rate	was	reduced	to	19%	with	effect	from	1	
April	2017.	Under	the	Finance	Act	2016,	the	corporation	tax	rate	will 	
be	reduced	to	17%	with	effect	from	1	April	2020.	The	future	main	tax 	
rate reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the group’s 
financial	statements	as	outlined	above,	subject	to	the	impact	of	other	
developments	in	the	group’s	tax	position	which	may	reduce	the	beneficial	
effect of this in the group’s tax rate.

Foreign currency translation
The	individual	financial	statements	of	each	group	company	are	
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated 
financial	statements,	the	results	and	financial	position	of	each	group	
company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the holding company, and the presentation currency for 
the	consolidated	financial	statements.	For	the	purpose	of	presenting	
consolidated	financial	statements,	the	assets	and	liabilities	of	the	
group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated 
at	the	average	rates	for	the	period,	unless	exchange	rates	fluctuate	
significantly	during	the	period,	in	which	case	the	exchange	rate	at	the	
date of transactions is used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in 
the Translation reserve (and attributed to non-controlling interests 
as appropriate).
In	preparing	the	financial	statements	of	the	individual	companies,	
transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair 
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains 
and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement 
for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the 
group enters into forward contracts (see below for details of the group’s 
accounting	policies	in	respect	of	such	derivative	financial	instruments).
Retirement benefit costs
The	Civil	Aviation	Authority	Pension	Scheme	is	a	funded	defined	benefit	
scheme. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee 
administered	fund.	The	cost	of	providing	benefits	is	determined	using	the	
Projected	Unit	Credit	Method,	with	actuarial	valuations	being	carried	out	
at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and return on 
scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the 
balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in 
the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits	are	already	vested,	and	otherwise	is	amortised	on	a	straight-line	
basis	over	the	average	period	until	the	benefits	become	vested.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined	benefit	liability	or	asset.	Defined	benefit	costs	are	split	into 
three categories:
 > current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on 
curtailments and settlements;
 > net interest expense or income; and
 > remeasurement.
The	retirement	benefit	obligation	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	
represents	the	deficit	or	surplus	in	the	group’s	defined	benefit	scheme.	
Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value 
of available refunds or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Since 2009, the group and Trustees have introduced a number of 
pension reforms, as explained in note 30. These include: closing the 
defined	benefit	scheme	to	new	entrants	with	effect	from	1	April	2009,	
and	establishing	a	defined	contribution	scheme	for	new	entrants	from	1	
April 2009, limiting the rate of increase in pensionable pay and changing 
the indexation reference rate for future service. 
Contributions	to	the	defined	contribution	pension	scheme	are	expensed	
as incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as 
a result of a past event, and it is probable that the group will be required 
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best 
estimate of expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
Financial instruments
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	on	the	group’s	
balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Detailed disclosures are set out in notes 
16 to 21.
Financial assets 
Financial assets, other than hedging instruments, can be divided into the 
following categories: 
 > loans and receivables;
 > financial	assets	at	fair	value	through	the	profit	and	loss;	
 > available	for	sale	financial	assets;	and
 > held to maturity investments.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements   |  84
Progress Financial assets are assigned to different categories on initial 
recognition.	The	classification	depends	upon	the	nature	and	purpose	
of	the	financial	asset.	A	financial	instrument’s	category	is	relevant	to	
the way it is measured and whether the resulting income is recognised 
through the income statement or directly in equity. Subsequent to 
initial	recognition	financial	assets	are	measured	at	either	fair	value	or	at	
amortised	cost	according	to	the	category	in	which	they	are	classified.
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where 
the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the time frame established 
by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs.
The	group	has	financial	assets	in	the	categories	of	other	loans	and	
receivables	and	financial	assets	at	fair	value	through	the	profit	and	loss.	
The	group	does	not	have	financial	assets	in	other	categories.
Loans and receivables
Trade	receivables	and	other	receivables	that	have	fixed	or	determinable	
payments	that	are	not	quoted	in	an	active	market	are	classified	as	loans	
and receivables. Receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are rigorously assessed for indicators of impairment at 
half year and year end. 
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a 
result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition of the 
financial	asset,	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	of	the	investment	have	
been impacted.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised using allowance 
accounts. When a trade receivable is considered irrecoverable, it is 
written off against the allowance account, any subsequent recoveries are 
credited to the allowance account. Changes in the allowance account are 
recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits and other highly liquid investments (with a maturity of 3 months 
or less) that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject	to	an	insignificant	risk	of	changes	in	value.
Financial liabilities 
Financial	liabilities	are	classified	according	to	the	substance	of	the	
contractual arrangements entered into. Financial liabilities are either 
financial	liabilities	at	‘fair	value	through	the	profit	and	loss’	or	‘other	
financial	liabilities’.
Fair value through the profit and loss 
Financial	liabilities	at	fair	value	through	the	profit	and	loss	are	measured	
initially at fair value and subsequently stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement. The net gain 
or loss recognised in the income statement incorporates any interest 
paid	on	the	financial	liability.
Other financial liabilities: including bank, other 
borrowings, loan notes and debt securities 
Interest-bearing bank loans, other borrowings, loan notes and debt 
securities are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue 
costs. Finance charges, including premia payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating amortised cost 
of	a	financial	asset	or	financial	liability	and	of	allocating	interest	income	
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the 
financial	asset.
Equity 
Equity	instruments	are	also	classified	according	to	the	substance	of	
the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the group are 
recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Reserves 
The consolidated statement of changes in equity includes the following 
reserves not otherwise explained in this note:
 > Other reserves, which arose on the completion of the PPP transaction 
in July 2001; and
 > Non-controlling interest, which represents the share of equity 
attributable to the minority investor in NATS Services LLC.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The	group’s	activities	expose	it	primarily	to	the	financial	risks	of	changes	
in	interest	rates,	inflation	and	foreign	currency	exchange	rates.	The	group	
uses interest rate and index-linked swap contracts and forward foreign 
exchange contracts to hedge these exposures. These are disclosed in 
notes 18 and 19 to the accounts.
Under	IFRS	derivatives	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	on	the	date	
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or 
loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The	use	of	financial	derivatives	is	governed	by	the	group’s	policies	
approved by the Board of directors, which provides written principles on 
the	use	of	financial	derivatives.	The	group	documents	at	the	inception	
of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and the 
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions. The group also documents 
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly	effective	in	offsetting	changes	in	fair	values	or	cash	flows	of 
hedged items.
Changes	in	the	fair	value	of	derivative	financial	instruments	that	are	
designated	and	effective	as	hedges	of	future	cash	flows	are	recognised	
directly in equity (in the Hedge reserve) and the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the 
recognition	of	a	financial	asset	or	a	financial	liability,	the	associated	gains	
or	losses	that	were	recognised	directly	in	equity	are	reclassified	into	the	
income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset 
acquired	or	liability	assumed	affects	profit	or	loss.	For	hedges	that	do	
not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recycled to the income statement in the same period in which 
the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes	in	the	fair	value	of	derivative	financial	instruments	that	do	not	
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires 
or	is	sold,	terminated,	or	exercised,	or	no	longer	qualifies	for	hedge	
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedging transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net income or expense for the period.
Derivatives	embedded	in	other	financial	instruments	or	other	host	
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the 
host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.

Progress 3. Critical judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible and tangible 
assets (including assets in the course of construction), a number of 
significant	assumptions	have	to	be	made	when	preparing	cash	flow	
projections and assessing fair values less costs of disposal. These 
include	air	traffic	growth,	future	cash	flows,	the	value	of	the	regulated	
asset bases, market premia for regulated businesses, NERL’s licence 
period and the outcome of the regulatory price control determinations. 
The market premium was assessed at the balance sheet date to be 
5-6%	(2016:	5-6%).	If	the	actual	outcome	should	differ	or	changes	in 	
expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would 
materially impact on operating results. Refer to notes 13, 14 and 15.
Retirement benefits
The	group	accounts	for	its	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	such	that	
the net pension scheme position is reported on the balance sheet with 
actuarial gains and losses being recognised directly in equity through the 
statement of comprehensive income.
A number of key assumptions have been made in calculating the fair 
value	of	the	group’s	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	which	affect	the	
balance sheet position and the group’s reserves and income statement. 
Refer to note 30 of the notes to the consolidated accounts for a 
summary of the main assumptions and sensitivities. Actual outcomes 
may differ materially from the assumptions used and may result in 
volatility in the net pension scheme position.
Recoverability of revenue allowances
The	economic	regulatory	price	controls	for	UK	en	route	services	
established annual revenue allowances that are recovered through a 
price	based	on	the	economic	regulator’s	forecasts	of	traffic	volumes	
and	inflation	made	at	the	start	of	the	price	control	period.	Where	traffic	
volumes	or	inflation	differ	from	the	regulator’s	forecasts,	revenue	actually	
recovered may be higher or lower than the revenue allowance. Where 
this is the case, the EC Charging Regulation requires an adjustment to be 
made	to	the	price	two	years	later	to	reflect	any	over	or	under-recovery.	
At the balance sheet date there were £3.5m of net payable allowances 
relating to previous regulatory reference periods (2016: £63.2m of 
recoverable allowances) and £47.4m of payable allowances relating to 
the current regulatory reference period (2016: £14.3m of net payable 
allowances). The legal right to recover or the obligation to rebate the 
revenue adjustments discussed above is provided by the EC Charging 
Regulation	and	NERL’s	air	traffic	services	licence.
Capital investment programme
The	group	is	undertaking	a	significant	capital	investment	programme	
to	upgrade	existing	air	traffic	control	infrastructure.	This	programme	
requires the group to enter into substantial contracts for the 
development of infrastructure assets and information systems. Whilst 
covered by contractual arrangements, it is in the nature of such complex 
projects	that,	from	time-to-time,	variations	to	the	original	specifications	
may necessitate the renegotiation of original contract scope or price and 
affect amounts reported in these accounts.

4. Revenue
An analysis of the group’s revenue is provided as follows: 
All revenue is derived from continuing operations. Note 5 summarises the source of revenue by operating segment. Other revenue is described on the 
face of the income statement and is included in note 8.
A	portion	of	the	group’s	revenue	from	the	provision	of	services	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	is	cash	flow	hedged.	Included	in	revenue	is	the	
recycling of the effective amount of foreign currency derivatives that are used to hedge foreign currency revenue. The amount included in revenue is a 
£3.5m gain (2016: £7.4m loss).
5. Operating segments
The	group’s	Executive	team	is	considered	to	be	the	chief	operating	decision	maker	as	defined	by	IFRS	8.	The	segmental	analysis	is	based	on	the	
information that the Executive team uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource 
allocation	between	segments.	The	business	is	organised	into	service	lines,	aligned	with	our	customers:	Airspace,	Airports,	Defence,	Other	UK	Business	
and International, and the products and services provided to each.
The performance of operating segments is assessed based on service line revenue and contribution. Service line contribution represents the revenue 
and costs which are directly attributed to a service line. Costs which are not directly attributed to a service line include: costs managed outside 
of	service	lines,	depreciation	and	amortisation	(net	of	Government	grants),	goodwill	impairment,	profit/(loss)	on	disposal	of	non-current	assets,	
employee share scheme (costs)/credits, redundancy and relocation costs and above the line tax credits. A reconciliation of service line contribution to 
operating	profit	is	set	out	below.

Principal activities
The following table describes the activities of each operating segment:
Airspace - This includes all of the group’s economically regulated activities and encompasses services to en route, oceanic and terminal customers 
provided from our Prestwick and Swanwick centres, together with all the supporting communications, navigation and surveillance infrastructure and 
facilities.	Airspace	includes	air	traffic	services	for	helicopters	operating	in	the	North	Sea,	approach	services	for	London	airports,	infrastructure	services	
to	the	Ministry	of	Defence	for	their	en	route	operations	and	European	projects	in	conjunction	with	other	air	traffic	organisations.
Airports	-The	provision	of	air	traffic	control,	engineering	support	and	airport	optimisation	services	to	UK	airport	customers.
Defence	-	The	provision	of	air	traffic	control,	engineering	support	and	other	services	to	the	UK	MOD	and	to	our	joint	venture	for	the	UK	MOD’s 
Marshall	contract.
Other UK Business -	Other	services	provided	to	UK	customers	including:	consultancy,	offering	airspace	development,	capacity	improvement	and	
training;	and	information,	providing	data	to	enable	future	efficiency	and	flight	optimisation. 
 
International	-	The	provision	of	air	traffic	control	and	related	services	(including	consultancy,	engineering,	training	and	information	services)	to	
overseas customers.
A change to the service line management reporting structure was introduced from 1 April 2016. The effect of this is to change the reporting of 
operating segments based on the principal products and services provided by the group to one based on key customers.  As a result the prior period 
comparatives	for	the	year	ended	31	March	2016	have	been	presented	on	a	consistent	basis. 	
Revenue

13. Goodwill
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Fair value 
less	costs	of	disposal	is	determined	by	reference	to	the	value	of	the	regulatory	asset	bases	of	UK	Air	Traffic	Services	and	North	Atlantic	Air	Traffic	
Services, representing the relevant cash generating units, including opportunities for out-performance of regulatory settlements and market premia 
for	economically	regulated	businesses	(assumed	at	5%-6%,	2016:	5%-6%)	and	estimated	costs	of	disposal.	The	key	assumptions	for	value 	in	use	
calculations	are	the	discount	rate,	future	cash	flows	to	the	end	of	Reference	Period	2	(31	December	2019)	for	both	cash	generating	units	as	assumed	
in	the	group’s	business	plans,	and	a	terminal	value	at	that	date,	reflecting	the	projected	regulatory	asset	bases	and	a	market	premium,	which	is	
assessed	annually.	The	group’s	business	plans	reflect	the	outcome	of	the	RP2	price	control	review	and	include	forecasts	of	traffic	volumes,	inflation	
and	pension	costs	reflecting	the	current	economic	environment.	The	discount	rate	is	a	pre-tax	nominal	rate	of	9.10%	(2016:	9.08%)	for	cash	flows 	
arising in Reference Period 2. The value of the regulatory asset bases at the balance sheet date were £1,037.8m (2016: £1,127.4m). Goodwill is 
allocated to the Airspace service line. The impairment charge arose in the year following a reduction in value in use. Further details are provided in the 
Strategic Report. See also note 3.

Progress 15. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The group conducts annual reviews of the carrying values of its property, plant, equipment and intangible assets. During the year, impairment charges 
of	£0.5m	(2016:	£0.7m)	were	made	in	respect	of	operational	assets	and	assets	in	the	course	of	construction	reflecting	a	reassessment	of	certain 	
projects	and	assets,	and	the	likelihood	of	benefits	being	realised	in	full.
During	the	year	the	group	capitalised	£1.1m	(2016:	£1.1m)	of	general	borrowing	costs	at	a	capitalisation	rate	of	1.9%	(2016:	2.2%),	in	accordance	with 	
IAS 23: Borrowing Costs, relating to both property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.
During	the	prior	year,	the	group	entered	into	a	finance	lease	for	certain	network	related	assets.	The	fair	value	of	the	assets	held	under	finance	lease	are	
£1.8m	(2016:	£2.0m)	and	are	included	within	the	cost	for	air	traffic	control	systems,	plant	and	equipment	above.
The	average	credit	period	taken	on	sales	of	services	is	30	days	(2016:	30	days).	Interest	is	charged	by	Eurocontrol	to	UK	en	route	customers	at 	
9.88%	(2016:	10.30%)	on	balances	outstanding	after	more	than	30	days.	All	other	balances	are	non-interest	bearing.	An	allowance	has	been	made 	
for	estimated	irrecoverable	amounts	from	sales	to	customers	of	£4.4m	(2016:	£4.6m).	Full	provision	is	made	for	receivables	from	UK	en	route 	
customers that are overdue as, based on past experience, this is an indicator of impairment. Debts that are neither impaired nor overdue are assessed 
for	credit	quality	and	reviewed	periodically.	Receivables	in	respect	of	other	customers	are	provided	for	where	there	is	an	identified	loss	event,	such	as	
administration,	receivership	or	liquidation	or	where	there	is	evidence	of	a	reduction	in	the	recoverability	of	the	cash	flows.
Accrued	income	which	is	non-current	represents	regulatory	revenue	adjustments	for	the	previous	control	period,	which	will	be	repaid	after	31	March	
2018.	Accrued	income	which	is	current	includes	unbilled	revenue	for	services	provided	in	March	2017.	Prior	year	accrued	income 	included	unbilled	
revenue	for	services	provided	in	March	2016	and	regulatory	adjustments	for	calendar	year	2014	which	were	recovered	by	31	March	2017.

16. Financial and other assets (continued) 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially 
granted up to the reporting date. The directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of £2.4m (2016: £2.8m) which are in 
administration, receivership or liquidation. The impairment recognised represents the carrying amount of these trade receivables. The group does not 
hold any collateral over these balances.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The 
directors consider that the carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value. 
Overall, the maximum credit risk for the items discussed above and loans to joint ventures , excluding prepayments, would be £475.2m (2016: £502.1m).

assets.	Any	drawings	made	by	NERL	under	its	£400.0m	committed	bank	facilities	are	similarly	secured.	Total	assets	of	NERL	as	at	31	March	2017 	
were £1,472.3m (2016: £1,510.6m), including goodwill of £198.3m (2016: £209.3m). Further security provisions are also provided by NATS Holdings

Further	details	on	derivative	financial	instruments	are	provided	in	note	19.	The	index-linked	swap	is	classified	under	international	accounting	
standards as held for trading as it does not qualify for hedge accounting. 
The	index-linked	swap	was	taken	out	in	August	2003	to	hedge	against	the	risk	of	low	inflation	and	previously	qualified	as	a	hedge	under	UK	generally	
accepted accounting principles prior to the group’s adoption of international accounting standards.

Capital risk management 
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group are able to continue as going concerns, to ensure that NERL is able to meet its 
obligations	under	the	air	traffic	services	licence,	for	NATS	Services	to	meet	obligations	to	its	customers,	and	to	fund	returns	to	shareholders.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt as disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, as shown in this 
note, and equity attributable to shareholders as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
External capital requirements 
NERL’s	air	traffic	services	licence	requires	the	company	to	use	reasonable	endeavours	to	maintain	an	investment	grade	issuer	credit	rating	(BBB-/
Baa3	or	better).	Separately,	it	is	the	objective	of	the	group	to	target	a	credit	profile	for	NERL	that	exceeds	BBB-/Baa3.
As	at	31	March	2017,	NERL	had	a	corporate	rating	of	A+	from	Standard	&	Poor’s	(2016:	AA-)	and	A2	from	Moody’s	(2016:	A2).
Gearing ratio
The group does not seek to maintain a target gearing level at group level but rather sets a gearing target for NERL, the economically regulated 
subsidiary,	based	on	a	ratio	of	net	debt	to	its	regulatory	asset	base	(RAB).	In	addition,	the	CAA	has	set	NERL	a	gearing	target	of	60%	and	a	cap	of 	
65%	of	net	debt	to	RAB	with	a	requirement	for	NERL	to	remedy	the	position	if	this	cap	is	exceeded.	NERL’s	gearing	ratio	at	31	March	2017	was	35.9% 	
(2016:	49.1%).
Significant accounting policies
Details	of	the	significant	accounting	policies	and	methods	adopted,	including	the	criteria	for	recognition,	the	basis	of	measurement	and	the	basis	on	
which	income	and	expenses	are	recognised,	in	respect	of	each	class	of	financial	asset,	financial	liability	and	equity	instrument	are	disclosed	in	note	2

The index-linked swap is categorised as held for trading. During the year, £3.8m (2016: £nil) was repaid as semi-annual amortisation payments 
commence from 2017. The charge arising from the change in fair value of £17.6m has been recorded in the income statement in the year (2016: 
£2.6m credit).

Financial risk management objectives
The	group’s	Treasury	function	is	mandated	by	the	Board	to	manage	financial	risks	that	arise	in	relation	to	underlying	business	needs.	The	function	
provides	services	to	the	business,	co-ordinates	access	to	financial	markets	and	monitors	and	manages	financial	risks	relating	to	the	operations	of	
the group. The function has clear policies and operating parameters. The Treasury Committee provides oversight and meets three times a year to 
approve	strategy	and	to	monitor	compliance	with	Board	policy.	The	Treasury	function	does	not	operate	as	a	profit	centre	and	the	undertaking	of	
speculative	transactions	is	not	permitted.	The	principal	financial	risks	arising	from	the	group’s	activities	include	market	risk	(including	currency	risk,	
interest	rate	risk	and	inflation	risk),	credit	risk	and	liquidity	risk.	The	principal	financial	risk	in	these	entities	is	credit	risk.	Specific	policies	on	interest	
rate and liquidity risk management apply principally to NERL.
Market risk
The	group’s	activities	expose	it	primarily	to	the	financial	risks	of	changes	in	foreign	currency	exchange	rates,	interest	rates	and	inflation	rates.	These	risks	
are	explained	below.	The	group	enters	into	a	variety	of	derivative	financial	instruments	to	manage	its	exposure	to	these	risks,	including:
 > forward	foreign	exchange	contracts	to	hedge	the	exchange	risk	arising	on	services	provided	to	UK	en	route	customers	that	are	billed	in	euro,	and	
purchases from foreign suppliers settled in foreign currencies;
 > interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
 > an	index-linked	swap	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	low	inflation.
Foreign currency risk management
The	group’s	principal	exposure	to	foreign	currency	transaction	risk	is	in	relation	to	UK	en	route	services	revenue,	accounting	for	65%	of	the	group’s 	
turnover	(2016:	64%).	Charges	for	this	service	are	set	in	sterling,	but	are	billed	and	collected	in	euro	by	applying	a	conversion	rate 	determined	monthly	
by	Eurocontrol,	who	administer	the	UK	en	route	revenue	collection.	The	conversion	factor	used	is	the	average	of	the	daily	closing	rates	for	the	month	
prior to the billing period. To mitigate the risk that exchange rates move between the date of billing and the date on which the funds are remitted to 
NERL,	forward	foreign	currency	contracts	are	entered	into.	NERL	seeks	to	hedge	95%	of	the	UK	en	route	income	that	is	forecast	to	arise	by	entering	
into forward foreign exchange contracts on a monthly basis.
The	group’s	international	activities	account	for	1.0%	of	external	revenue	(2016:	0.8%).	The	group	trades	with	and	provides	finance	to	its	overseas	joint 	
ventures and subsidiaries. Where appropriate the transactions are conducted in sterling.
The group also enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of goods and services with overseas suppliers and customers who operate in foreign 
currencies.	To	mitigate	currency	risk	the	contract	value	is	hedged	when	a	firm	commitment	arises,	either	through	the	use	of	forward	foreign	currency	
contracts or by purchasing foreign currency at spot rates on the date the commitment arises or by setting aside already available foreign currency.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The	group	has	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	including	cash	balances	of	£12.9m	at	31	March	2017	(2016:	£5.6m)	in	euro, 	
US	dollars,	UAE	dirham,	Swedish	krona,	Canadian	dollars,	Omani	rial,	Qatari	riyal,	Singapore	dollars,	Hong	Kong	dollars,	Norwegian	krone	and	Kuwaiti	
dinar. Furthermore, the group has entered into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exchange risk relating to customer receipts and supplier 
costs	which	will	arise	in	future	periods.	These	contracts	are	not	reflected	on	the	balance	sheet	but	are	reported	in	the	table	below.
The	following	table	details	the	group’s	sensitivity	to	a	10%	increase	or	decrease	in	the	value	of	sterling	against	relevant	foreign	currencies.	10%	is	the	
sensitivity	rate	that	represents	the	reasonably	possible	change	in	foreign	currency	exchange	rates	in	a	financial	year.	The	sensitivity	analysis	includes	
foreign currency cash balances, trade receivables, trade payables and forward foreign exchange contracts and adjusts their translation at the period 
end	for	a	10%	change	in	foreign	currency	rates.
The	table	below	shows	the	effect	of	a	10%	strengthening	of	sterling	against	the	relevant	currency	(to	the	nearest	£0.1m).	A	positive	number	below	
indicates	an	increase	in	profit	and	equity	and	a	negative	number	a	reduction	in	profit	and	equity.	There	would	be	an	equal	and	opposite	impact	on	
profit	and	equity	if	sterling	devalues	by	10%	against	the	relevant	currency.

Interest rate risk management
The	group	is	exposed	to	interest	rate	risk	to	the	extent	that	it	holds	borrowings	at	fixed,	floating	and	index-linked	interest	rates.	Its	interest	rate	risk	
management	policies,	which	are	kept	under	continuous	review,	are	specific	to	NERL.	Except	for	NERL,	no	other	entity	within	the	NATS	group	had	
borrowings	at	31	March	2017	(2016:	NATS	Limited	£0.4m).
The	group	seeks	to	minimise	NERL’s	exposure	to	movements	in	interest	rates	by	ensuring	NERL	holds	an	appropriate	balance	of	fixed,	floating	and	
index-linked debt as a percentage of its net debt by the use of interest rate swap contracts and index-linked swap contracts.
The	group’s	exposure	to	interest	rates	on	financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	is	detailed	in	the	liquidity	risk	management	section	of	this	note.	The	
group	held	no	interest	rate	swaps	at	31	March	2017	(2016:	none).
At	31	March	2017,	the	aggregate	amount	of	the	unrealised	gain	under	forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the hedge reserve relating to 
the	exposure	on	these	future	transactions	was	£3.3m	(2016:	£nil).	The	majority	of	these	contracts	will	mature	within	the	next	financial	year	at	which 	
stage the amount deferred in equity will be realised in the income statement.
In	addition	to	the	above,	NERL	has	entered	into	average	rate	forward	agreements	with	a	fixing	date	after	31	March	2017	to	sell	euro	anticipated	to	be 	
received	in	July	2017	in	respect	of	UK	en	route 	revenues.	The	value	of	these	cash	flows	is	£60.0m.	These	contracts

Overall	the	group’s	sensitivity	to	interest	rates	is	slightly	higher	than	prior	year,	reflecting	net	changes	in	cash	and	borrowing	levels.
Inflation rate risk
The	regulatory	charge	control	conditions	that	apply	to	NERL’s	UK	en	route	and	North	Atlantic	services	determines	a	revenue	allowance	for	financing	
charges	that	is	linked	to	inflation	(now	CPI	but	previously	RPI).	To	achieve	an	economic	hedge	of	part	of	this	income,	in	August	2003	coincident	with	the	
issue	of	its	£600.0m	5.25%	fixed	rate	bond,	NERL	entered	into	an	amortising	index-linked	swap	with	a	notional	principal	of	£200.0m	for	the	period	up	to 	
March	2017	reducing	semi-annually	thereafter	and	expiring	in	March	2026.	As	at	31	March	2017	the	notional	principal	had	reduced	to	£192.0m.	Under 	
the	terms	of	this	swap,	NERL	receives	fixed	interest	at	5.25%	and	pays	interest	at	a	rate	of	3.43%	adjusted	for	the	movement	in	RPI.	The	index-linked	
swap	cannot	be	designated	as	a	cash	flow	hedge	under	IFRS,	although	it	provides	an	economic	hedge	of	certain	of	NERL’s	inflation-linked	revenues.
The value of the notional principal of the index-linked swap is also linked to movements in RPI.
Inflation rate sensitivity analysis
The	sensitivity	analysis	below	has	been	determined	based	on	the	exposure	to	breakeven	inflation	arising	from	the	index-linked	swap.	The	difference	
between	fixed	rate	and	index-linked	gilts	reflects	the	market’s	expectations	of	future	RPI	and	is	a	proxy	for	the	breakeven	inflation	rate.	The	analysis	
is	prepared	assuming	that	the	index-linked	swap	at	the	balance	sheet	date	was	in	place	for	the	whole	year.	A	1%	increase	or	decrease	in	breakeven	
inflation	is	considered	to	represent	a	reasonably	possible	change	in	inflation.	An	increase	in	the	rate	of	RPI	will	increase	the	future	index-linked	
payments that NERL is required to make under the swap contract and so impacts its mark to market value.
The	following	table	shows	the	effect	of	a	1%	increase	in	breakeven	inflation	on	the	amount	of	interest	payable	in	respect	of	this	swap	and	the	impact	
on	its	value	when	marked	to	market.	A	positive	number	indicates	an	increase	in	profit	and	equity	and	a	negative	number	a	reduction	in	profit	and	
equity.	There	would	be	an	equal	and	opposite	impact	on	profit	and	equity	if	breakeven	inflation	falls	by	1%.

The mark to market value of the index-linked swap is also sensitive to the discount rates that are used to determine the net present value of the cash 
flows	under	the	swap	agreement.	The	discount	rate	is	determined	by	reference	to	market	yields	on	interest	rate	swaps.	The	effect	of	a	1%	increase	in	
the	discount	rate	would	be	to	increase	profit	and	equity	by	£7.5m	(2016:	£7.8m).	There	would	be	an	equal	and	opposite	impact	on	profit	and	equity	if

Credit risk management
Credit	risk	refers	to	the	risk	that	a	counterparty	will	default	on	its	contractual	obligations	resulting	in	financial	loss	to	the	group.	The	group’s	exposure	to	
credit	risk	arises	from	the	risk	of	default	by	customers	on	settlement	of	trade	receivables	and	from	the	risk	of	a	failure	of	a	financial	institution	in	which	
funds are invested for return or held for trading purposes or with whom derivative contracts are entered into. The risk of loss from default by customers 
and	the	mitigations	against	this	risk	are	explained	in	note	16.	With	regard	to	funds	or	contracts	held	with	financial	institutions,	the	group’s	policy	is	to 	
transact	with	counterparties	that	hold	a	minimum	credit	rating	as	supplied	by	independent	rating	agencies:	Standard	&	Poor’s,	Moody’s	and	Fitch	Ratings.
The group’s policy is to allocate limits to the value of investments, foreign exchange transactions and interest rate hedging transactions that may be 
entered	into	with	a	bank	or	financial	institution	and	to	allocate	an	aggregate	credit	risk	limit.	The	limits	are	based	upon	the	institution’s	credit	rating	with	
Standard	&	Poor’s	and	Moody’s;	the	Fitch	rating	is	only	used	if	one	of	these	agencies	does	not	provide	a	rating.	Where	there	is	a	difference	in	the	rating	
then the lowest rating is applied.
Currently, the group’s investments take the form of bank time deposits and money market fund investments. Investments in bank time deposits with 
maturities up to 3 months and between 3 and 6 months are only entered into with institutions holding a long term minimum credit rating of A- and 
A+	respectively	from	Standard	&	Poor’s	or	Fitch	Ratings	and	A3	and	A1	respectively	from	Moody’s.	However,	dependent	on	market	conditions,	tighter	
restrictions	on	rating	requirements	and	lower	limits	may	be	placed	on	the	duration	of	deposits.	Money	market	fund	investments	are	restricted	to	AAAm	
rated liquidity funds.

Liquidity risk management
The	responsibility	for	liquidity	risk	management,	the	risk	that	the	group	will	have	insufficient	funds	to	meet	its	obligations	as	they	fall	due,	rests	with	
the Board with oversight provided by the Treasury Committee. The group manages liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and borrowing facilities 
by	monitoring	actual	and	forecast	cash	flows,	including	contributions	to	the	defined	benefit	pension	scheme,	and	ensuring	funding	is	diversified	by	
source and maturity and available at competitive cost.
With regard to NERL, the group’s policy is to: 
a.	maintain	free	cash	equal	to	between	one	and	two	months	of	UK	en	route	services	revenues	(see	below).	Free	cash	is	defined	as	cash	and	cash	
equivalents and short term investments, excluding a debt service reserve account of £39.4m used to fund interest, fees and bond amortisation 
payments	scheduled	in	the	next	six	months	and	a	liquidity	reserve	account	of	£21.3m	held	to	provide	liquidity	in	the	event	of	certain	pre-defined	
circumstances,	particularly	to	ensure	compliance	with	financial	covenants;
b.	ensure	access	to	bank	facilities	sufficient	to	meet	110%	of	forecast	requirements	that	are	not	otherwise	covered	by	operating	cash	flows	or	other	
sources	of	finance	through	the	period	of	the	business	plan.	At	31	March	2017	NERL	had	access	to	bank	facilities	totalling	£400m	available	until	31 	
July 2021. The facilities comprise a £350m revolving term loan facility, a £45m revolving credit facility and a £5m overdraft facility;
c.	ensure	access	to	long	term	funding	to	finance	its	long	term	assets.	This	is	achieved	in	the	form	of	a	£600m	amortising	sterling	bond	with	a	final 	
maturity date of 2026;
d.	ensure	that	the	ratio	of	bank	funding	to	total	gross	borrowings	does	not	exceed	75%;	and	
e.	maintain	a	portfolio	of	debt	diversified	by	source	and	maturity.	This	is	achieved	through	the	issuance	of	a	£600m	sterling	bond	that	started	to 	
amortise	in	2012	and	has	a	final	maturity	date	of	2026	and	by	having	available	shorter	dated	committed	bank	facilities.

 > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on

Valuation techniques and key inputs
The	fair	value	of	the	financial	instrument	is	the	price	that	would	be	received	to	sell	an	asset	or	paid	to	transfer	a	liability	in	an	orderly	transaction	
between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The	fair	values	of	the	financial	instruments	held	at	fair	value	have	been	determined	based	on	available	market	information	at	the	balance	sheet	date	
and the valuation methodologies listed below:
 > the	fair	values	of	forward	foreign	exchange	contracts	are	calculated	with	reference	to	well	recognised	proprietary	financial	models	used	by	bank	
counterparties,	and	verified	using	discounted	cash	flow	modelling;
 > the fair value of the index-linked swap is calculated by adding a credit value adjustment to an amount provided by bank counterparties using 
proprietary	financial	models.	This	is	validated	using	discounted	cash	flow	modelling	and	observable	forward	inflation	indices	at	the	reporting	
date	and	contracted	inflation	rates,	discounted	at	a	rate	that	reflects	the	credit	risk	of	the	various	counterparties.	The	credit	value	adjustment	is	
determined	by	the	group	to	reflect	own	credit	risk	by	reference	to	bank	margins	appropriate	to	NERL’s	credit	rating;	and
 > the fair value of the £600m bond has been derived from its externally quoted price.

Special share
The authorised and issued share capital of NATS Holdings Limited includes one special rights redeemable preference share with a nominal value of 
£1.	The	share	is	redeemable	at	any	time	after	the	shareholding	of	the	Crown	falls	below	25%.	This	share	can	only	be	held	by	a	Minister	of	the	Crown,	
the Treasury Solicitor or any other person acting on behalf of the Crown. The special shareholder is entitled to attend and speak at meetings. The 
special share does not carry any rights to vote at general meetings except in the following circumstances:
 > alterations to the company’s share capital;
 > alterations to voting rights of any of the company’s shares; and
 > the removal of any director appointed by a Crown representative.
If an attempt is made to approve any of these events or to pass a resolution to wind up the company at a general meeting, on an ordinary resolution, the 
special shareholder will have no less than one vote more than the total number of all other votes cast, and on a special resolution, he shall have no less 
than	one	vote	more	than	25%	of	the	total	votes	cast.

30. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution scheme
The	group	provides	a	defined	contribution	scheme	to	all	qualifying	employees	who	are	not	members	of	the	defined	benefit	scheme.	The	assets	of	the	
scheme are held separately from those of the group in funds under the control of a board of Trustees.
The	group	operates	a	salary	sacrifice	arrangement	whereby	employees	sacrifice	an	element	of	their	salary	in	favour	of	contributions	to	the	scheme	
in	a	ratio	of	2:1,	up	to	a	maximum	employer	contribution	of	18%.	For	the	year	ended	31	March	2017	employer	contributions	of	£7.0m	(2016:	£5.8m), 	
excluding	employee	salary	sacrifice	contributions	of	£3.5m	(2016:	£2.9m),	represented	14.6%	of	pensionable	pay	(2016:	14.5%).
The	defined	contribution	scheme	had	1,043	members	at	31	March	2017	(2016:	825).
Defined benefit scheme
NATS	Limited	(formerly	National	Air	Traffic	Services	Limited),	the	company’s	wholly-owned	subsidiary,	entered	into	a	deed	of	adherence	with	the	
CAA and the Trustees of the Civil Aviation Authority Pension Scheme (CAAPS) whereby the company was admitted to participate in CAAPS from 1 
April	1996.	CAAPS	is	a	fully	funded	defined	benefit	scheme	providing	benefits	based	on	final	pensionable	salaries.	At	31	March	2001,	the 	business	of	
NATS	was	separated	from	the	CAA.	As	a	consequence,	NATS	became	a	‘non	associated	employer’	which	requires	the	assets	relating	to	the	liabilities	
of	NATS	active	employees	at	31	March	2001	to	be	separately	identified	within	the	CAAPS.	CAAPS	was	divided	into	two	sections	to	accommodate	
this, namely the CAA section and the NATS section, and a series of common investment funds was established in which both sections participate 
for investment purposes. The assets and membership of the scheme prior to transfer were allocated between these sections in accordance with 
Statutory Instrument 2001 Number 853, Transport act 2000 (Civil Aviation Authority Pension Scheme) Order 2001. The assets of the scheme are held 
in a separate trustee administered fund. CAAPS is governed by a board of Trustees which is responsible for implementing the funding and investment 
strategy. The board comprises 6 employer (NATS and CAA) and 6 member-nominated trustees, as well as an independent chairman.
During	2009	the	group	introduced	a	number	of	reforms	to	manage	the	cost	and	risk	of	pensions.	The	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	was	closed	to	
new	joiners	with	effect	from	31	March	2009.	In	addition,	from	1	January	2009,	annual	increases	in	pensionable	salaries	were	limited	to	a	maximum	
increase	in	the	retail	prices	index	(RPI)	plus	0.5%.	A	defined	contribution	scheme	was	also	introduced	for	new	joiners	(see	above).	Finally,	pension	
salary	sacrifice	arrangements	were	introduced	with	effect	from	1	April	2009.

Progress 30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
During 2013 the group consulted on further pension reforms to mitigate rising pension costs. These included a change to the limit on increases in 
pensionable	salaries	to	a	maximum	of	the	consumer	prices	index	(CPI)	plus	0.25%.	In	addition,	the	Trustees	consulted	members	of	the	scheme	on	a	
change to the indexation of future service at CPI, rather than RPI. These reforms were agreed by staff. 
Pensionable pay awards made for calendar years 2016 and 2017 were in line with CPI.
The	defined	benefit	scheme	had	the	following	membership	at	31	March:
Trustees’ funding assessment
A Trustees’ funding assessment of the NATS section is prepared at least every three years by the pension scheme actuary at the request of the Trustees 
in	order	to	establish	the	financial	position	of	the	NATS	section	and	to	determine	the	level	of	contributions	to	be	paid	by	NATS	in	the	future.
The last Trustees’ funding assessment of the NATS’ section was carried out at 31 December 2015 and used the projected unit credit method. The 
assumptions	which	have	the	most	significant	effect	on	the	result	of	the	valuation	are	those	relating	to	the	rate	of	return	on	investments	and	the	rates	
of increase in salaries and pensions.
The market value of the NATS’ section’s assets as at 31 December 2015 was £4,544.0m. For the purpose of the Trustees’ funding assessment 
assets	were	taken	at	market	value.	The	shortfall	of	assets	relative	to	the	value	of	benefits	that	had	accrued	to	existing	members	was	£458.7m, 	
corresponding	to	a	funding	ratio	of	90.8%.
The	2015	valuation	showed	that,	based	on	long	term	financial	assumptions,	the	contribution	rate	required	to	meet	future	benefit	accrual	was	36.9% 	
of	pensionable	salaries	(31.1%	employers	and	5.8%	employees).	In	addition,	NATS	makes	payments	to	the	scheme	to	cover	administration	costs,	
including	the	Pension	Protection	Fund	(PPF)	levy,	of	0.7%	of	pensionable	salaries.
Contributions to the pension scheme
Following	the	2015	valuation,	NATS	and	the	Trustees	agreed	a	recovery	plan	which	would	see	the	funding	deficit	repaid	by	2026.	Under	the	schedule 	
of	contributions,	normal	contributions	were	paid	at	29.4%	of	pensionable	pay	until	31	December	2016	and	are	being	paid	at	31.8%	from	1	January 	
2017	to	31	December	2026.	Deficit	recovery	contributions	were 	made	at	£2.4m	per	month	for	calendar	year	2016	and	increase	by	2.37%	annually 	
thereafter until 31 December 2023. An additional £825,000 per month is payable from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2026 and this also increases 
by	2.37%	annually	until	31	December	2026.
During the year the group paid cash contributions to the scheme of £115.8m (2016: £120.3m). This amount included £13.3m (2016: £14.7m) of 
wages	and	salaries	sacrificed	by	employees	in	return	for	pension	contributions.	Excluding	the	effect	of	salary	sacrifice	and	past	service	costs,	
employer	cash	contributions	were	paid	at	a	rate	of	43.6%	(2016:	40.6%)	of	pensionable	pay.
The	estimated	contributions	expected	to	be	paid	to	the	scheme	during	the	financial	year	ending	31	March	2018	is	£115.3m,	including	salary	sacrifice	
contributions estimated at £11.4m.
Contributions to the scheme are ultimately funded by NATS’ two principal operating subsidiaries: NERL and NATS Services, in proportion to their 
pensionable payrolls.

30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
Company’s accounting valuation under international accounting standards
For	the	purpose	of	accounting	for	the	scheme	in	these	financial	statements,	the	company	obtains	an	updated	valuation	from	a	qualified	independent	
actuary that is prepared in accordance with IAS 19: Employee Benefits.
This valuation differs from the Trustees’ funding assessment explained above in a number of critical respects, including for example, differences in 
timing and frequency as well as in valuation assumptions. The Trustees’ last funding assessment was prepared as at 31 December 2015, whereas 
the	company’s	accounting	valuation	is	prepared	annually	at	31	March.	As	a	result,	at	each	valuation	date,	the	market	conditions	on	which	the	
assumptions are based will be different. Also, the assumptions adopted for the Trustees’ funding assessment are set by the Trustees and include 
appropriate margins for prudence, whereas those adopted for the company’s accounting valuation are prescribed by international accounting 
standards	and	reflect	best	estimates.
If an accounting valuation reveals a surplus at the balance sheet date, this is recognised in full to the extent that it can be realised in full by 
the company.
The	Trustees’	funding	assessment	carried	out	as	at	31	December	2015	was	updated	to	31	March	2017	for	the	company’s	accounting	valuation 	
under	IAS	19.	The	major	assumptions	used	by	the	actuary	for	the	purposes	of	the	IAS	19	figures	at	the	relevant	year	ends	are	set	out	in	the	table	and	
narrative below:
The	mortality	assumptions	have	been	drawn	from	actuarial	tables	95%	S2PMA	light	and	93%	S2PFA	light	(2016:	101%	S1PMA 	light	and	99%	S1PFA	
light)	with	future	improvements	in	line	with	CMI	2014	(2016:	CMI	2011)	projections	for	male/female	members,	subject	to	a	long	term	improvement 	
of	1.5%	p.a.	(2016:	1.5%	p.a.).	These	tables	assume	that	the	life	expectancy,	from	age	60,	for	a	male pensioner	is	29.4	years and	a	female	pensioner 	
is 30.8	years.	Allowance	is	made	for	future	improvements	in	longevity,	such	that	based	on	the	average	age	of	the	current	membership	(45),	when	
these	members	reach	retirement,	life	expectancy	from	age	60	will	have	increased	for	males to	31.0	years	and	for	females	to 32.6	years.

Progress Each sensitivity above is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and 
changes	in	some	of	the	assumptions	may	be	correlated.	When	calculating	the	sensitivity	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	to	variations	in	significant	
actuarial	assumptions,	the	same	method	(present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	calculated	with	the	projected	unit	credit	method	at	the	end	of	
the reporting period) has been applied as for calculating the liability recognised on the balance sheet.
30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
The	principal	risks	to	the	financial	performance	of	the	group	arising	from	the	scheme	are	in	respect	of:
a. asset volatility: for accounting purposes, scheme liabilities are determined using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond 
yields.	If	scheme	assets	under-perform	relative	to	this	yield,	this	will	create	a	deficit.	As	explained	below,	NATS	and	Trustees	are	reviewing	measures	
to de-risk the scheme by investing more in assets which better match the liabilities. 
b. changes in bond yields: a decrease in the yield on high quality corporate bonds will increase scheme obligations, although this is partly mitigated by 
an increase in the value of the scheme’s holdings of bonds.
c.	inflation	risk:	the	scheme’s	benefit	obligations	are	linked	to	inflation,	and	higher	inflation	will	lead	to	higher	liabilities.	The	majority	of	the	scheme’s	
assets	(such	as	equities)	are	real	in	nature	and	so	provide	some	inflation	protection,	but	overall,	an	increase	in	inflation	will	adversely	impact	on	the	
funding position. 
d.	life	expectancy	(mortality):	the	majority	of	the	scheme’s	obligations	are	to	provide	benefits	for	the	life	of	a	member,	so	an	increase	in	life	expectancy	
will result in an increase in the scheme’s obligations.
Sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate (bond yields) Increase/decrease	by	0.5% Decrease	by	11.5%/increase	by	13.5%
Rate	of	inflation Increase/decrease	by	0.5% Increase	by	13.3%/decrease	by	11.4%
Rate of pensionable salary growth Increase/decrease	by	0.5% Increase	by	3.5%/decrease	by	3.2%

The scheme assets do not include any investments in the equity or debt instruments of group companies or any property or other assets used by 
the group.
Virtually	all	equity	and	debt	instruments	have	quoted	prices	in	active	markets.	Investments	are	well	diversified,	such	that	the	failure	of	any	single	
investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A large portion of the assets consist of equities and bonds, although the 
scheme also invests in property, cash and investment (private equity and hedge) funds.
NATS	and	Trustees	implemented	a	liability	driven	investment	(LDI)	programme	in	2012	in	order	to	hedge	the	impact	of	changes	in	inflation	and	
interest	rates	on	the	value	of	the	scheme’s	obligations,	which	are	sensitive	to	inflation	and	movements	in	yields	in	the	gilt	market.	The	strategy	
includes	establishing	trigger	levels	which	define	the	rates	of	interest	and	inflation	rates	at	which	hedging	transactions	will	be	executed.	In	addition,	
and	as	an	acceleration	of	the	existing	strategy,	NATS	and	Trustees	agreed	during	2014	to	increase	the	level	of	hedging	of	interest	rates	and	inflation	
to	50%,	as	measured	on	the	Trustee	funding	basis.	Swap	transactions	are	executed	with	carefully	scrutinised	banks	and	collateral	is	provided	in	the	
form of index-linked gilts to protect against the unlikely event of default by a counterparty bank.
NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements   |  132
Progress 30. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
At NATS’ request, Trustees have also considered further de-risking over time to protect the scheme from the impact of volatility in the value of return-
seeking assets. This would involve progressively converting from return-seeking assets into hedging assets to increase the level of matching of the 
scheme’s liabilities. As changing the mix of assets changes the returns achieved, this would impact on contributions payable. Before changing this 
strategy, NATS and Trustees are likely to consult with CAA on the implications for customers. The strategy will aim to maintain an appropriate balance 
between the potential impact on contributions and the reduction in volatility of return-seeking assets, and therefore reduced investment risk.
Derivative instruments are used by investment managers to reduce risk or gain exposure to investment classes without the requirement to hold the 
underlying investment. Trustees monitor derivative positions to ensure that, when combined with the underlying physical position, the aggregate falls 
within	specified	investment	guidelines.
The	actual	return	on	scheme	assets	for	the	year	ended	31	March	2017	was	£1,263.0m	(2016:	£16.8m).
31. Related party transactions
The NATS group has four shareholders - the Crown, The Airline Group Limited (AG), LHR Airports Limited and the NATS Employee Sharetrust Limited.

Airlines	Limited,	Thomson	Airways	Limited,	Virgin	Atlantic	Airways	Limited	and	USS	Sherwood	Limited.	AG	has	a	42%	stake	in	NATS	Holdings	Limited.	
The	directors	of	NATS	Holdings	Limited	are	satisfied	that	the	eight	members	of	AG	have	not	exercised	undue	influence	on	the	group	either	acting	
individually or in concert and therefore the individual transactions with each member of AG have not been disclosed in this set of accounts.
Contractual arrangements existed during the year between LHR Airports Limited and NATS Services in relation to air navigation services provided at 
Heathrow Airport.
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this

The	associate	is	accounted	for	using	the	equity	method.	Pursuant	to	the	shareholder	agreement,	the	group	has	the	right	to	cast	16.67%	of	the	votes

Progress Explanatory notes
1 Project	Marshall	is	a	22	year	contract	to	transform	the	military’s	terminal	Air	Traffic	Control	technical	services. It	was	initiated	by	the	MOD	to	
modernise	ATM	for	over	100	MOD	locations,	of	which	over	60	are	airfields	or	ranges,	including	overseas. It	provides	the	foundation	to	deliver	
efficient	and	cost	effective	terminal	ATM	services	and	ensures	that	this	capability	keeps	pace	with	modern	regulatory	demands	and	Single	
European Sky standards.
2 Single	European	Sky	ATM	Research:	a	programme	to	modernise	Europe’s	airspace	structure	and	air	traffic	management	technologies.
3 An Airprox is a situation in which, in the opinion of a pilot or controller, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and 
speeds have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved was or may have been compromised. The severity of these incidents is 
assessed	periodically	by	the	UK	Airprox	Board,	an	independent	body,	in	the	interests	of	enhancing	flight	safety.
4 interoperability Through European Collaboration.
5 References in this document to Deploying SESAR relate to NERL ’s investment programme which implements a number of SESAR compliant 
techologies	and	methodologies,	rather	than	the	European	Sky	ATM	Research	programmes	that	are	defining	and	driving	the	deployment	of	
technologies and methodologies at the European-wide level.
6 The severity of ground and airborne incidents is scored against six criteria: minimum separation achieved; rate of closure; detection of 
potential	conflict;	plan	to	achieve	required	separation;	execution	of	the	plan;	and	recovery	when	separation	is	lost.
7 Impact score is a measure of delay placing greater weight on long delays and departures in the morning and the evening peaks.
8 Variability score is a daily excess delay score based on weighted delays exceeding pre-determined thresholds on a daily basis.
9 3Di	score	measures	airspace	efficiency	with	reference	to	the	deviation	from	the	preferred	profile	to	the	actual	radar	track	of	each	flight	in	 
UK	airspace.
10 Training to promote an atmosphere of trust where front line staff feel encouraged to provide essential safety-related information and with clear 
lines drawn between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
11 An aircraft deviation of 300 feet or more from its assigned level.
12 EU	Member	States	are	required	by	SES	legislation	to	form	Functional	Airspace	Blocks	with	neighbouring	ANSPs.	FABs	are	blocks	of	airspace	
based on operational requirements and established regardless of State boundaries.
13 The transition altitude is a published height above sea level at which pilots climbing to their cruising level change their barometric altimeter 
from the regional pressure setting to a common international standard setting.
14 London	Airspace	Management	Programme.
15 London	Terminal	Manoeuvring	Area:	the	designated	area	of	controlled	airspace	surrounding	London	airports	and	which	forms	part	of	the	
London	Airspace	Management	Programme	(LAMP).
16 Chargeable	service	units	are	the	billing	unit	for	recovering	UK	en	route	revenue	allowances	and	a	function	of	aircraft	weight	and	distance	flown.
17 Death	in	service,	ill	health	and	income	protection	arrangements	may	be	restricted	or	cease	if	benefits	are	transferred	out	of	NATS	pension	
arrangements.
