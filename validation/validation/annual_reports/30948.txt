Key strengths
continued Significant growth opportunities aligned with electrification 
and our strength in thermal management 
– Opportunity to increase content per vehicle in growing HEV 
and EV markets compared to the content for more traditional 
internal combustion engine (‘ICE’) vehicles
– Ability to leverage pressurised fuel tank technology for HEVs
– Potential addressable market could increase substantially by 
2025, given that EVs would typically require battery, chassis, 
electric motor and electronics thermal management (heating 
and cooling) in addition to traditional passenger cabin heating 
and cooling lines 
– Well positioned for growth in thermal management for HEVs 
and EVs due to:
 ‑ HEVs and EVs require more fluid handling content than 
ICE vehicles
 ‑ Our developed technology in nylon lines with significant 
weight savings over aluminium and rubber
 ‑ Existing nylon extrusion capabilities and capacity in each 
major region
 ‑ OEM relationships and competitive global footprint 
 ‑ Use of existing materials and know‑ how

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report we delivered strong operational and 
financial performance during a year of important strategic 
initiatives. In addition to our successful listing on the London 
Stock Exchange, we continue to make progress against our 
strategic objectives. Our continued focus on strong customer 
relationships, engineering excellence and growing our business 
in markets where we have deep experience and capabilities lies 
at the heart of our success. 
2017 performance overview
The Group has delivered positive annual results for 2017, 
which were fully in line with the Board’s expectations. Reported 
revenue grew by 4.2% to €3,491 million (2016: €3,349 million) 
and by 5.4% at constant currency. Profit for the year grew by 
€71 million to €115 million (2016: €44 million). Adjusted Free 
Cash Flow was €119 million (2016: €83 million). 
Corporate developments
We were extremely pleased with the success of our Global 
Offer and the listing of our shares on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Global Offer raised net proceeds of approximately €360 million, 
which together with positive free cash flow generation were 
used to reduce financial leverage to facilitate achievement of 
a 1.8 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and reduce the cost 
of financing. Our strengthened balance sheet positions us well 
to continue delivering our strategy and strong stakeholder returns. 
Governance 
Sound corporate governance structures have always formed 
part of the culture of TI Fluid Systems. The business is run by 
an experienced and well respected management team including 
Bill Kozyra, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Timothy 
Knutson, Chief Financial Officer. Together they have advanced 
the business through changing markets. 
The Corporate Governance report on pages 32 to 43 sets out 
and explains the processes we have put in place that will assist 
the Board in the delivery of long‑ term, sustainable value to our 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Becoming a listed company has necessitated some governance 
enhancements, including changes to our Board. We were 
pleased to strengthen the Board with the appointment of two 
new Independent Non‑ Executive Directors, John Smith and 
Jeffrey Vanneste. 
Dialogue with shareholders
I would like to thank all our shareholders for their support during 
and following our IPO. This is our first Annual Report as a public 
company and over time our reporting will evolve to encompass 
a broader range of issues related to your Company.
Dividend
The Board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a dividend 
pay‑ out ratio of approximately 30% of the Group’s Adjusted 
Net Income. Accordingly, the Board is recommending an initial 
dividend of 1.31 euro cents per share, to cover the period from 
the date of listing on 25 October 2017 to 31 December 2017. 
Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid on 
1 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
Our people
The progress we made in 2017 was due to the commitment of 
all our employees. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our employees for their hard work and contribution to this 
year’s performance. We are proud of our record of investing in 
our people, giving them the skills they need to deliver for our 
customers and advance their careers.
Outlook
While still relatively early in 2018, we are encouraged by the 
continued progress of the Group. TI Fluid Systems has a strong 
track record of delivering sustained growth, strong profitability 
and cash flow generation. As the megatrend of hybrid electric 
vehicle (‘HEV’) and electric vehicle (‘EV’) growth begins to 
accelerate, we expect success addressing those markets with 
our existing and new product offerings. Global markets continue 
to be strong and the Board is confident about our prospects 
for continued success in 2018 and beyond.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive Officer’s statement 2017 Performance
Global light vehicle production has a significant influence on 
our financial performance. In 2017, global light vehicle production 
volume increased in all markets except North America and 
reached 95.1 million vehicles, representing an increase of 2.1% 
compared to the same period the prior year. 
We continued to deliver revenue growth above global light 
vehicle production growth with solid profitability and cash flow 
generation. We generated revenue of €3,491 million (+5.4% at 
constant currency), Adjusted EBIT of €384 million (11.0% margin) 
and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of €119 million. 
We have continued to grow revenue in excess of global light 
vehicle production growth as a result of being a global market 
and technology leader in highly engineered automotive fluid 
systems, our strong customer relationships, and our global 
low cost manufacturing footprint including our wholly owned 
operations in China. We are well positioned with our products 
and process capabilities to benefit from the continuing demand 
for light vehicles and the megatrend of electrification.
Strategy update
The Group’s strategy of organic revenue growth, financial 
performance and focus on megatrends remains at the core 
of the business.
Continue with the Group’s market position strengths 
in key products 
We continue to be the #1 supplier of brake and fuel lines 
in all key regions globally and #3 supplier of plastic fuel tanks. 
Our customer and product focus has served to develop our 
strong market positions.
Together with our established global manufacturing footprint 
and level of vertical integration, we have achieved expansion 
by securing new business awards including on global vehicle 
platforms. This success is carrying through to our thermal 
management products, systems and plastic pressurised tank 
modules where we are strongly positioned for the HEV, EV 
and autonomous vehicle growth trends. 
Maintain balanced customer, platform, regional and 
product diversification 
With manufacturing facilities and assembly plants in 118 
locations across 28 countries and a balanced customer portfolio, 
we continue to mitigate the impact of regional market cyclicality 
and customer concentration.
In addition, our expertise across a range of fluid handling 
products has supported our ability to efficiently expand into 
complementary components and systems with high growth. 
We specifically target vehicles and platforms that support 
our strong diversification.
Continue enhancing the Group’s position as an advanced 
technology leader in automotive fluid systems to meet 
industry megatrend changes
We have continued to invest in R&D to develop products that 
facilitate our OEM customers meeting regulated emissions 
and fuel economy requirements. We have industry recognised 
innovation awards for plastic fuel tank technologies addressing 
emissions regulations and continue to see demand for our 
gasoline, diesel and turbocharger lines that support increasing 
regulatory requirements.
Continued focus on automotive megatrends
The growing HEV and EV market provides significant growth 
opportunities aligned with our strength in thermal management 
products and systems, plastic pressurised fuel tank modules 
and light weight (including nylon) materials.
Our addressable market could increase substantially especially 
for thermal management, given that EVs would typically require 
battery, chassis, electric motor and electronics thermal 
management (heating and cooling) in addition to traditional 
passenger cabin heating and cooling lines. Additional thermal 
management products and systems are expected for autonomous 
vehicles. We continue to pursue, with increasing confidence, 
organic HEV and EV opportunities with our existing customers 
on the larger volume EV programmes.
Our business model continues to be successful and we believe 
further progress can be achieved by meeting our goals in 2018.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Capitalise on the Group’s strong customer relationships, 
global footprint and excellent position in China 
With significant presence in all of the major geographies for 
OEM vehicle production and a well established global footprint 
within close proximity to OEM assembly facilities, we aim to 
be the supplier of choice on OEM global platforms.
A significant amount of our revenue was generated from OEM 
global platforms (i.e. platforms produced in three or more regions) 
and we expect this global platform growth trend to continue. 
19% of our 2017 revenue was from operations in China where we 
have a long established presence and wholly‑ owned operations.
Deliver strong growth, profitability and cash flow generation 
For a long period of time, this management team with the 
strength of our people worldwide has achieved excellent and 
consistent financial performance with strong revenue growth, 
profitability and cash flow generation. Our proven track record 
of financial performance has continued in 2017.
Looking ahead
As promised during the IPO, our dedicated team has continued 
to strengthen our global position by driving new technologies 
and products and enhancing our outstanding relationships with 
customers worldwide. The Group remains well placed to 
capitalise on the automotive megatrends of reduced emissions 
and improved fuel economy and we continue to have confidence 
that the trend towards HEV, EV and autonomous vehicles is 
positive for the Group.
We look forward to executing our plan and delivering attractive 
returns as a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Key performance indicators We operate in a complex 
global environment where 
risks offer both opportunities 
and challenges.
Effective risk management 
is critical to the achievement 
of our strategic objectives.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal controls. The Audit & Risk Committee 
supports the Board by advising on the Group’s overall risk 
appetite, tolerance and strategy, current risk exposures and 
future risk strategy. Further information on the Group’s approach 
to risk management is set out on page 43.
A review of the Group’s risk management framework used to 
collate, report and manage business critical risks was presented 
to the Audit & Risk Committee in March 2018. The Board has 
concluded that a robust assessment of the Group’s principal 
risks had been undertaken.
TI Fluid Systems’ global operations are exposed to a number 
of risks which could, either on their own, or in combination with 
others, have an adverse impact on the Group’s results, strategy, 
business performance and reputation which, in turn, could 
impact upon shareholder returns. The following section 
highlights the major risks that may affect the Group’s ability to 
deliver the strategy, as set out on page 18 to 19. The mitigating 
activities described below will help to reduce the impact or 
likelihood of the major risk occurring, although the Board 
recognises it will not be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. 
The Board recognises there could be risks that may be unknown 
or that may be judged to be insignificant at present, but may later 
prove to be significant.
Global light vehicle production volumes
Description
TI Fluid Systems has 118 manufacturing locations in 
28 countries on five continents and a substantial amount 
of its revenue is closely linked to the economic cycle 
and the general macro‑ economic environment.
Impact
Historically, there has been close correlation between 
economic growth and the global light vehicle production 
volumes. The high‑ fixed costs nature of the business, 
operating across manufacturing facilities in 118 locations, 
means that a reduction in revenue will have a significant 
impact on profitability.
Controls and mitigation
– TI Fluid Systems’ presence in 28 countries supplying 
a wide range of customers acts as a hedge to neutralise 
localised economic volatility.
– The Group has an extensive manufacturing presence in 
emerging and other low‑ cost markets which currently have 
relatively low rates of light vehicle penetration per head of 
population and are believed to have strong growth potential.
– Although the Group’s products are primarily for light vehicles, 
it operates across both a broad geographic footprint and a 
diversified range of vehicle platforms, brands and models.
– A proportion of the Group’s workforce in a number 
of local markets are employed on temporary contracts, 
which provides some flexibility in the cost‑ base.
– The Group monitors closely and responds to any changes 
in customer demand on a local or group‑ wide basis.
Product quality
Description
TI Fluid Systems’ business is based on the repeatable 
supply and delivery of components and parts to an agreed 
specification and time.
Impact
Failure to meet customer requirements or specifications 
can cause long‑ term damage to the Group’s reputation and 
have financial consequences, such as the loss of a customer, 
warranty claims and product liability.
Controls and mitigation
– TI Fluid Systems operates rigorous quality control systems 
designed to ensure a high‑ quality standard for all products.
– The Group collaborates with key customers to evaluate 
and improve quality control standards and to confirm the 
compliance of its manufacturing processes with customers’ 
quality standards.
– Quality systems and processes operated at local 
manufacturing level are subject to oversight by divisional 
quality teams.
– Where necessary, the Group’s manufacturing facilities 
maintain relevant industry accreditations, such as TS 16949.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks and uncertainties Business continuity
Description
TI Fluid Systems’ business is based upon achieving assurance 
in quality and reliability across all our locations and their 
products. Business continuity encompasses a number of areas 
of risk to the Group, including key supplier failure, sourcing of 
raw materials, exposure to price fluctuations of key raw 
materials, maintaining stable labour relations, and ensuring 
the reliability of the Group’s management systems and IT 
infrastructure. In addition, the Group is exposed to risks from 
accidents and incidents arising from health and safety failures.
Impact
A loss of production capability at a facility, or quality failings in 
products, could affect reputation and accreditation, lead to an 
inability to supply customers, reduce volumes and/or increase 
claims made against the business under warranties. In periods 
of high demand or in the event of supplier difficulties, 
availability of raw materials may be constrained which could 
result in rapid movements in price and have an impact on the 
profitability of the Group’s operations. In certain circumstances 
the loss of a supplier, or supplier quality failing, could lead to an 
inability to supply products in a timely or efficient manner or 
risk impacting adversely on engineering quality. 
The loss of systems capability at a Group facility as a result 
of IT failure, or other events such as strike action by employees, 
could affect the reputation and impact the Group’s ability 
to supply customers. Injuries arising from health and safety 
incidents could result in lost time, reduce employee morale and 
possible changes in working practices. Serious incidents can 
also have a detrimental impact on the Group’s reputation.
Controls and mitigation
– The Group operates a localised continuity planning strategy 
and its global network of facilities provides a degree of 
backup capacity. 
– The Group maintains a scheduled programme of maintenance 
and inspection of all equipment.
– The wide geographic spread of operations, purchasing 
and supply chain functions allows the Group to use a range 
of techniques to address potential supply disruption, 
such as long‑ term purchase contracts, dual sourcing and 
ongoing research and development into alternative materials 
and solutions.
– In certain markets the Group uses preferred suppliers 
for major materials.
– The Group maintains business interruption insurance.
– The Group participates in a number of works councils and 
other represented employee forums and seeks to establish 
and maintain good relationships with its employees and unions.
– The Group’s cyber security programme and decentralised IT 
systems worldwide provide some resilience against the loss 
of production or systems capability to the Group as a whole.
– The Group has an embedded health and safety culture and 
operates a global health and safety policy, with local health 
and safety operations in place in each manufacturing facility.
– Health and safety performance is monitored regularly by each 
division and by the Group.
Competition and customer pricing pressure
Description
This risk encompasses a number of identified global trends 
in the markets in which TI Fluid Systems operates. The Group 
operates in a dynamic competitive environment and faces 
competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of 
automotive components in each of the market segments 
in which it operates. The Group may be subject to pressure 
from customers to reduce costs on current contracts. 
The environment for bidding and securing new contract 
awards from OEMs is competitive.
Impact
The Group’s customers face constant pressure to lower their 
selling and production costs to be competitive against their 
peers and may require reductions in the selling price of the 
Group’s systems and components over the term of a vehicle 
platform or model. Commercial activity by competitors, 
or changes in their products or technologies, could impact 
upon the Group’s market share and profitability.
Controls and mitigation
– The Group seeks to offset pricing pressure by achieving 
improved operating efficiencies and cost reductions.
– A growing trend by customers to standardise and globalise 
vehicle platforms has the potential to minimise the Group’s 
exposure to the cancellation of any single vehicle platform 
or model.
– TI Fluid Systems has a strong brand and industry leading 
technology which supports its Tier 1 supplier status with 
its key customers.
– The Group engages in extensive and regular dialogue 
and has strong commercial and engineering relationships 
with key customers.
– The Group uses market intelligence and competitor 
analysis to support its market activities and inform 
investment decisions.
– Across the Group there is an emphasis on research 
and development and improving the technical content 
of products.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks and uncertainties
continued Product development and changes in technology
Description
The automotive industry is subject to changes in technology 
and the Group’s products are subject to changes in regulatory 
requirements to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy. 
Operating across numerous markets and territories requires 
compliance with a wide variety of regulations. Changes in 
consumer demand, e.g. the popularity of a particular vehicle 
type, model, platform or technology such as HEVs and EVs 
may also impact on demand for the Group’s products. In 
addition, the Group’s products have performance‑ critical 
applications and have high levels of technical content 
and know‑ how.
Impact
Failure to keep up with changes in technology in the light 
vehicle automotive industry or in competitive technologies 
may render certain existing products obsolete or less attractive 
as well as damaging the Group’s market position and brand 
strength. Failure to comply with all relevant regulatory 
requirements could affect the Group’s reputation and/or its 
ability to operate in certain markets or territories. Changing 
environmental regulations could affect demand for certain 
products. The Group’s technologies and intellectual property 
rights need to be kept current through continuous improvement 
and research and development and are susceptible to theft, 
infringement, loss and/or replication by competitors.
Controls and mitigation
– The Group is engaged in continued investment in alternative 
engineering solutions and the development of more advanced 
designs and innovative products to ensure compliance with 
changes to environmental regulations and customer demand.
– TI Fluid Systems has an international network of five technical 
centres which focus on research and development.
– The Group seeks to maintain close relationships and technical 
partnerships with key customers.
– The Group has established seven regional application centres 
which focus on applications engineering worldwide.
– Both Group and divisional management monitor and assess 
relevant regulatory requirements and the likelihood and 
impact of any changes.
– The Group’s products, materials and processes are continually 
developed and enhanced through research and development 
and technical input.
– TI Fluid Systems actively registers, manages and enforces 
its intellectual property rights.
Operating globally
Description
TI Fluid Systems has operations globally, with manufacturing 
facilities in 28 countries across five continents. The markets in 
which the Group operates are covered by a range of different 
regulatory systems and complex compliance requirements and 
may also be subject to cycles, structural change and other external 
factors, such as changes in tariffs, customs arrangements and 
other regulations. In addition, operating across a number of 
territories exposes the Group to currency variations.
Impact
A substantial downturn in one or more key markets could have 
a material adverse impact on the Group’s profitability, cash flow 
and carrying value of its assets. Significant changes to the 
different regulatory systems and compliance requirements 
in and between the countries and regions in which the Group 
operates may have a negative impact on the Group’s operations 
in a particular country or market. The risks associated with 
Brexit are not considered material to the Group. High foreign 
exchange volatility may increase financing costs.
Controls and mitigation
– The Group’s international footprint provides some protection 
against a downturn in particular territories or regions.
– The markets and any changes to the regulatory environment 
in which TI Fluid Systems operates are continually monitored 
and assessed. 
– Changes to the Group’s investment strategy and cross‑ border 
relocation might result from a significant change in the 
regulatory environment in a particular country or region.
– The Group’s treasury policy covers, inter alia, the use of 
currency contracts, investment hedging policy and regular 
reporting of foreign exchange exposure.

of Business Conduct (COBC).
Key personnel dependencies
Description
The future success of TI Fluid Systems is dependent upon the 
continued services of key personnel. Succession is a routine 
consideration given some of the Group’s key global positions 
at all levels, including business unit, division and Group.
Impact
TI Fluid Systems competes globally to attract and retain 
personnel in a number of key roles. A lack of new talent, the 
inability to retain and develop existing talent, or replace retiring 
senior management could hinder the Group’s operations and 
strategy. A loss of key personnel, with associated intellectual 
property and know how, could disrupt our business and 
strategy. In a number of local markets the Group may 
experience a shortage of skilled and experienced personnel 
for certain key roles.
Controls and mitigation
– The Group applies bespoke terms and conditions 
of employment for key personnel where appropriate.
– The Group has in place incentive arrangements, including 
bonuses, pensions and long‑ term incentive plans.
– The Group operates established recruitment and 
development programmes.
– Succession plans have been developed for relevant 
key positions.

strong and long‑ standing relationships we have with our customers 
all around the world. In 2017, as in past years, we received 
dozens of awards from our customers in every region recognising 
our commitment to quality, delivery, safety and innovation.
Employees
Our commitment to customer service is embedded in 
our recruitment, selection, development and compensation 
arrangements with our employees across the Group. We seek 
to attract, motivate and retain the best talent we can, and this 
underpins our delivery of consistently high customer service.
Our people are considered for employment, training, career 
development and promotion on the basis of their abilities and 
aptitudes, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, religion 
or ethnic origin. 
Our gender split in 2017 across salaried employees of the Group 
was 2.62:1.00 (Male:Female) with a total global salaried work 
force of 4,777, as shown in the table below:
Salaried employees (as at 31 December 2017)

community and charitable projects and programmes. These took 
place in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and North America. 
Environment, Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees and environmental 
guardianship remain central to everything we do. We focus on 
safe working environments and eliminating work‑ related injuries 
and illnesses. 
Leadership
The Group has a global Health and Safety Policy which is

health and safety matters in each geographic area.
Continuous improvement
Since 2016, we have implemented enhanced systems designed 
to measure and benchmark health and safety performance and 
accident frequency rates at each manufacturing facility and 
within each geographic area. We use this information to compare 
injury rate, safety culture and levels of engagement for each 
location. As part of our health and safety strategy, we are in 
the process of developing more robust reporting and control 
measures in order to further improve our safety practices.
Our environment
We have procedures and policies in place to monitor compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations related to the environment, 
including air and water discharges and the handling and disposal 
of waste. We have a global energy monitoring programme which 
we use to calculate our CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions 
with a long‑ term goal of implementing efficiency programmes 
to reduce energy consumption and our carbon footprint.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial review Revenue in 2017 increased €142.3 million, or 4.2% compared to 
2016. The increase is driven primarily by new business, volume 
and mix. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by 
5.4%, which exceeded growth in global light vehicle production 
by 330 basis points. 
In Asia Pacific, our revenue at constant currency grew 9.3%, 
or 6.7% above light vehicle production volume growth.
Despite the slight decline in North America light vehicle 
production volumes, we saw our revenue in this region increase 
6.6% on a constant currency basis, or 10.9% above the light 
vehicle production volume growth. 
In Europe and Africa, our revenue at constant currency grew 
1.5%, which was below light vehicle production growth due to 
the timing gap of certain vehicle programmes approaching end 
of life and new programmes launching. 
In 2017, we generated 40% of our revenue in Europe and Africa, 
29% of our revenue in Asia Pacific, 29% in North America and 
2% in Latin America. 
The Fluid Carrying Systems (‘FCS’) division revenue grew 5.8% 
to €2,057.1 million with strong growth in North America and Asia 
Pacific (at constant currency the growth was 6.9%). The Fuel 
Tank and Delivery Systems (‘FTDS’) division revenue grew 2.2% 
to €1,433.8 million, which included new business growth in Asia 
Pacific (at constant currency the growth was 3.3%). 
Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted EBIT* and Profit for the Year
We use both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT, which are 
non‑ IFRS measures, as a measure of profitability and as a metric 
in certain of our compensation plans. The table below shows a 
reconciliation between profit for the year and Adjusted EBITDA 
and Adjusted EBIT.
Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBIT* €m
2017 2016
Profit for the year 115.2 43.9

  Income tax expense – after exceptional items 42.8 88.9
  Net finance expense – after exceptional items 115.3 105.1

Adjusted EBIT 383.5 362.1
* See Non‑ IFRS measures.
**  Other reconciling items include restructuring charges, the Bain management 
fees and adjustments for associate income.
We continue to see absolute growth in both of these measures 
as well as improved margins. Our revenue mix and ability to 
favourably convert on the higher volumes have been the 
catalysts for these increases. 
While we saw increases in certain commodity costs 
(namely steel and resin) we were able to largely offset these 
with customer pricing and other efficiencies in order to minimise 
the impact on our profit and cash flow. 
Adjusted EBIT was €383.5 million, an increase of €21.4 million 
or 5.9% compared to 2016. Adjusted EBIT margin was 11.0%, 
a solid 20 basis point improvement. By division, FCS Adjusted 
EBIT increased €8.7 million to €271.1 million with Adjusted 
EBIT margin of 13.2%, and FTDS Adjusted EBIT increased 
€12.7 million to €112.4 million with Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.8%.
Profit for the year grew by €71.3 million to €115.2 million. 
The increase is due to higher operating profit, lower income tax 
expense offset partially by an increase in net finance expense. 
Operating profit increased primarily due to net foreign exchange 
gains in the year, higher gross profit offset partially by an 
increase in administrative expenses. 
IPO Costs
In support of the October 2017 listing of the Company’s shares 
on the London Stock Exchange, we incurred €64.6 million in 
costs, of which we capitalised €19.7 million, while expensing 
€44.9 million. All costs recorded as an expense were considered 
exceptional and recorded as either administrative or finance costs.
Cash payments of €22.1 million associated with IPO costs 
have been classified within cash generated from operations. 
Cash associated with capitalised costs of €19.7 million and 
cash associated with the repayment of the unsecured senior 
notes of €17.7 million are shown within cash generated from 
financing activities. 
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue 
of their nature, size and expected frequency, warrant separate 
additional disclosure in the financial information in order to fully 
understand the underlying performance of the Group. 
During 2017 and 2016, the substantial majority of exceptional 
costs were in relation to the IPO. Exceptional administrative costs 
in 2017 included net IPO costs of €25.7 million, share option 
costs prior to the IPO of €11.1 million and restructuring costs 
of €3.4 million related to the exit of our operations in Australia. 
In addition to IPO costs of €13.4 million in 2016, exceptional 
administrative costs included €2.4 million in acquisition and other 
transaction costs, which were primarily related to the February 
2016 acquisition of Millennium Industries and €7.4 million of 
share option costs. 
In 2017 we also incurred exceptional finance costs of 
€17.7 million associated with the repayment premium related 
to the unsecured senior notes and an €8.7 million non‑ cash 
charge associated with previously capitalised debt issuance 
fees in connection with the debt principal amounts paid down 
with a portion of the IPO proceeds.
As a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we 
recognised an exceptional deferred tax asset of €25.4 million.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Net Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses
Net foreign exchange gains were €24.6 million in 2017 compared to 
losses of €2.0 million in 2016. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
include non‑ trade items related to foreign currency translation 
and fair value movement in foreign exchange forward contracts. 
We aim to naturally hedge our operational transactions by 
earning revenues and incurring costs in the same currency to 
the extent possible, but will engage in forward foreign exchange 
contracts to mitigate a portion of our remaining exposure. 
Our primary exposure, net of hedge arrangements is related 
to the Group’s external borrowings that are denominated in US 
Dollars and are largely loaned to subsidiaries in the UK, whose 
functional currency is euro. Following the use of a portion of the 
IPO proceeds to repay €363.6 million (or $423.5 million) of the 
US Dollar debt, the exposure has been significantly reduced.
Net Finance Expense
Net finance expense of €115.3 million in 2017 increased 
€10.2 million, or 9.7% compared with 2016. The increase 
was driven by exceptional finance costs of €26.4 million, which 
included €17.7 million of repayment premium and €8.7 million 
of debt issuance fees written off following the debt repayment 
from the IPO proceeds. 
The increase in finance costs was partially offset by €16.3 million 
interest savings resulting from the repricing of the term loan debt 
in January 2017 and reduction in debt following the IPO. 
Taxation
Income tax expense before exceptional items decreased 
to €68.2 million from €88.9 million in 2016.
The 2017 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate decreased to 28.8% 
(2016: 34.0%) due to the partial release of the provision on 
uncertain tax positions and the recognition of tax incentives 
in certain jurisdictions. The rate was calculated by adjusting for 
the impact of UK losses, the prior year tax adjustments and the 
impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, where we have 
recognised €25.4 million of exceptional deferred tax benefit in 
the income statement that reflects the new US corporate tax 
rate of 21%.
Pro forma Adjusted Basic EPS*
As the IPO occurred in October 2017 and led to a significant 
change in the shares in issue, and given the one‑ off costs 
incurred in the year, an Adjusted Basic EPS calculation is a more 
appropriate measure as it is based on Adjusted Net Income and 
the 519.4 million ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2017. 
Accordingly, 2017 saw an Adjusted Basic EPS of 26.18 euro 
cents up from 14.27 euro cents in 2016 on a pro forma basis.
The calculation of Adjusted Net Income is shown below: 
Adjusted Net Income* €m
2017 2016
Adjusted EBITDA 490.7 464.7
Less:
  Net finance expense before 
exceptional items (88.9) (105.1)

  Depreciation and impairment of PP&E (98.8) (102.0)
  Amortisation and impairment 
of intangible assets (96.1) (92.9)
  Non‑ controlling interests share of profit (2.7) (1.7)
Adjusted Net Income 136.0 74.1
* See Non‑ IFRS measures.
Dividend
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 1.31 euro 
cents per share, amounting to €6.8 million. The amount is 
calculated based on Adjusted Net Income and has been pro rated 
to reflect the period since the Company’s shares were listed. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting 
on 17 May 2018, the final dividend will be paid on 1 June 2018. 
The dividend will be converted to Sterling at a fixed rate on 
27 April 2018, the Dividend Record Date.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow*
We also use Adjusted Free Cash flow as operating measure 
of our cash flows.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow* €m
2017 2016
Net cash generated from operating activities 237.4 204.0
Net cash used by investing activities (140.9) (258.4)

  Payment for intangible assets (25.1) (26.5)
  Movement in working capital (26.2) (45.5)

  Payment for acquisition of subsidiary – 125.0
  IPO cash costs in Net Cash from Operations 22.1 11.9
Adjusted Free Cash Flow 118.6 82.5
* See Non‑ IFRS measures.
In 2017, our Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased by €36.1 million 
compared to 2016, or 43.8%, to €118.6 million. The increase is 
a result of higher profits before tax and lower interest paid, and 
lower working capital movements that offset higher payments 
for property, plant and equipment and taxation.
Retirement Benefits
We operate funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes 
across multiple jurisdictions with the largest being the US 
pension and retiree healthcare schemes. We also have significant 
schemes in the UK, Canada and Germany. While all of our 
significant plans are closed to new entrants, certain of them 
do allow for future accruals. Our schemes are subject to periodic 
actuarial valuations. Our net unfunded position decreased 
€30.6 million from 2016 to €162.4 million at the end of 2017. 
Net Debt and Net Leverage
Net debt as at 31 December 2017 was €891.1 million, 
which is a reduction of €608.5 million since 31 December 2016. 
Cash generated from operations and the IPO was used to repay 
€376.3 million of borrowings. There was also favourable foreign 
exchange movement of €143.5 million and a reduction in 
capitalised fees of €17.6m. The reduction in net debt resulted in 
a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times Adjusted EBITDA at the end of 
2017, compared to 3.2 times Adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2016.

Financial review
continued Liquidity
Our principal sources of liquidity have historically been cash 
generated from operating activities and commitments available 
under our credit facilities, which currently consist of a revolving 
facility under our cash flow credit agreement of $125 million 
(€104.1 million) and an asset backed loan (ABL) facility of 
$100 million (€83.3 million). The availability under both facilities 
as of 31 December 2017 was €173.5 million.
Outlook 
For 2018, excluding the impact of currency movements, 
we expect continued revenue growth in excess of global light 
vehicle production volume growth with Adjusted EBIT margin 
and Adjusted Free Cash Flow consistent with prior year levels. 
We plan to reduce net leverage through earnings growth and cash 
flow generation and to maintain a consistent dividend policy.
Non-IFRS Measures
In addition to the results reported under IFRS, we use certain 
non‑ IFRS financial measures to monitor and measure performance 
of our business and operations and the profitability of our divisions. 
In particular, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted 
Net Income, Adjusted Basic EPS, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and 
Adjusted Effective Tax Rate. These non‑ IFRS measures are not 
recognised measurements of financial performance or liquidity 
under IFRS, and should be viewed as supplemental and not 
replacements or substitutes for any IFRS measures. Such 
measures are also utilised by the Board of Directors as targets 
in determining compensation of certain executives and key 
members of management.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit for the year adjusted 
for income tax expense, net finance expense, depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment of PP&E and intangible assets, 
net foreign exchange gains/losses and other reconciling items. 
Other reconciling items include adjustments for restructuring 
charges, the Bain management fees and adjustment for 
associate income. 
Adjusted EBIT is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation 
(including PP&E impairment) and amortisation (including intangible 
impairment) arising on tangible and intangible assets before 
adjusting for any purchase price adjustments to fair values arising 
on acquisitions. 
Adjusted Net Income is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net 
finance expense before exceptional items, income tax expense 
before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation 
(including PP&E and intangible asset impairments) and non‑ controlling interests share of profit.
Adjusted Basic EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by 
the number of shares in issue at the current balance sheet date. 
Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as cash generated from 
operating activities, less cash used by investing activities, adjusted 
for acquisitions and cash payments related to IPO costs.
Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Adjusted Income 
Tax before exceptional items as a percentage of Adjusted Profit 
before Income Tax.

Going concern and viability statement
The Directors have concluded after reviewing the future funding 
requirements for the Group over the next eighteen months by 
reference to the headroom on the committed banking facilities and 
the expected performance of the Group, that it is appropriate for 
the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis. 
In accordance with provision c2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over a three year period to 31 December 
2020. The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference 
to the Group’s current position and prospects, the Group’s 
existing committed finance facilities, the Group’s strategy and 
the potential impact of the principal risks and how these are 
managed, as detailed in this strategic report. 
The Group has a formalised process of budgeting, reporting and 
review along with procedures to forecast its profitability, capital 
position, funding requirement and cash flows. These plans 
provide information to the Directors which are used to ensure 
the adequacy of resources available to the Group to meet its 
business objectives, both in the short‑ term and on a strategic 
basis. The plans for the period commencing on 1 January 2018 
were reviewed and approved by the Board on 12 December 2017. 
In making their assessment the Directors’ have stress tested the 
Group’s financial projections to 31 December 2020 by modelling 
the impact of lower global production volumes and the effect of 
operating margin reductions caused by operational and quality 
issues, which best reflect the likely impact from the principal 
risks facing the Group. The Directors’ also considered the 
beneficial impact arising from potential mitigating actions. 
Considering the Group’s current financial position, the 
geographic spread of its operations, its established customer 
relationships, its principal risks, headroom under the committed 
banking facilities and the Board’s assessment of the Group’s 
future, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be viable and able to continue in operation meeting 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of at least three 
years to 31 December 2020.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present TI Fluid Systems’ 
Corporate Governance report for the year ended 31 December 
2017, our first year as a listed company. This report aims to 
provide shareholders and other stakeholders with an appreciation 
of how our Group is managed and the governance and control 
framework in which TI Fluid Systems operates. Good governance 
is essential for enabling our Board to operate effectively in the 
leadership of the Group and in promoting the success of the 
Company in the long term.
TI Fluid Systems listed its Ordinary Shares on the Main Market 
of the London Stock Exchange on 25 October 2017. The Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), have therefore only applied to 
the Company since that date.
Inevitably, there has been a particular focus this year on 
establishing governance structures, risk and control frameworks 
and policies and procedures that are appropriate for a company 
of our size and reputation. Sound governance structures were 
in place at TI Fluid Systems prior to the Global Offer and Listing, 
but we have welcomed the opportunity to strengthen these 
where necessary. I am delighted to be able to report close to 
full compliance with the Code for the period since we became 
a listed company.
Having been appointed as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director of the Company in September 2016, I was appointed 
as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company in October 2017. 
In the lead-up to the Global Offering and Listing, the Company 
appointed two new Independent Non-Executive Directors, John 
Smith and Jeffrey Vanneste, both of whom bring a wealth of 
experience and knowledge to the Board. In addition, Neil Carson, 
who was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director 
of the Company in September 2016, was appointed as Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director in October 2017. 
Furthermore, Paul Edgerley and Stephen Thomas, who were 
both Directors of the Company, were formally appointed as 
Non-Executive Directors in October 2017. Biographies of each 
of the Directors are set out on pages 34 to 35.
To assist the Board in its oversight functions, during the year 
we established the Audit & Risk, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. I am pleased to report the Board and its Committees 
are operating effectively. We intend to keep the Board and its 
Committee performance under close review and it is the Board’s 
intention to conduct a formal performance review exercise during 
the course of 2018.
Following the successful outcome of our Global Offering

A key priority for the Board is communicating effectively with 
the owners of the business.

The Company adopted the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 on 25 October 2017 on admission to the UKLA’s 
Official List and Listing on the Main Market of the London

complied with the provisions of the Code save as 
noted below:

comprise non-executive directors determined by the Board 
to be independent.
Explanation of non-compliance – The Board comprises 
eight directors, including the Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, two Independent  
Non-Executive Directors, two Executive Directors and two 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company regards this as an 
appropriate Board structure. However, the Company intends to

The Division of Responsibilities between the Chairman and

The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board 
of Directors of a company with a premium listing on the Official 
List should appoint one of the Non-Executive Directors to be the 
Senior Independent Director to act as a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to support him in the delivery of his objectives. 
The Senior Independent Director is also responsible for leading 
the Non-Executive Directors in monitoring and evaluating the 
performance of the Chairman and being available to shareholders 
if they have any concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or the

The Nomination Committee is comprised of the Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Director and a Non-Executive Director. 
The Nomination Committee Chairman is Manfred Wennemer. 
The Nomination Committee will meet not less than two times 
a year.
The main roles and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee 
are set out in written terms of reference and are available on the 
Company’s website at:

Details of the Nomination Committee’s activities can be found 
in the Nomination Committee report on page 40.
Balance and independence
In accordance with the main principle B.1 of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board and its Committees have an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience and knowledge of the 
Group to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. The size and composition of the Board 
is kept under review by the Nomination Committee to ensure 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience is maintained.
The Code recommends, in the case of a FTSE 350 company, 
that at least half the Board of Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
should comprise ‘independent’ Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, who is 
considered to be independent, two Executive Directors and 
five Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors 
comprise Neil Carson, Senior Independent Director, Paul 
Edgerley, John Smith, Stephen Thomas and Jeffrey Vanneste. 
The Non-Executive Directors, Neil Carson, John Smith and 
Jeffrey Vanneste, are considered to be independent in character 
and judgement, and free of any business or other relationship 
which could materially influence their judgement. 
The Company intends to appoint additional independent 
Non-Executive Directors within a reasonable period of time 
to comply with the requirements of the Corporate Governance 
Code concerning the number of independent Non-Executive 
Directors the Company should have. As the Board composition 
changes over time and when evaluating candidates for the Board 
membership, candidates are considered on merit, taking account 
of their relevant skills and experience as well as recognising the 
benefits of Boardroom diversity including gender, nationality, 
ethnicity and age. 
Disclosure of relationship agreement with Bain
Details of substantial shareholdings in the Company’s ordinary 
share capital is set out in the Directors Report on page 59.
On 25 October 2017 the Company entered into an agreement 
with its largest shareholders, the funds managed by Bain Capital 
and BC Omega Holdco, Ltd. (the ‘Institutional Shareholders’). 
The principal purpose of the agreement is to ensure that 
following the Company’s Admission and Listing, the Company 
is able to carry on its business independently of the Institutional 
Shareholders and that transactions and relationships between 
the Company and the Institutional Shareholders are conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. The Board 
confirms that so far as it is aware in the period to 29 March 2018 
the Institutional Shareholders have complied with the 
undertakings in the agreements and the obligations therein. 
Inter alia, the Institutional Shareholders have a right to nominate 
for appointment to the Board (a) two directors for so long as the 
Institutional Shareholders and their associates’ shareholding in 
the Company is equal to or more than 25% and (b) one director 
for so long as the Institutional Shareholders and their associates’ 
shareholding in the Company is equal to more than 10% but 
less than 25%.
The terms of the appointment of the Non-Executive Directors 
does not specify the amount of time they are expected to devote 
to the Company’s business. However, it is estimated they will 
commit a minimum of one day per month which is calculated 
based on the time required to prepare for attending Board and 
Committee meetings, and additional duties such as attendance 
at the Annual General Meeting and meetings with shareholders.
Length of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for terms of three years, 
subject to the particular Director being re-elected by shareholders, 
for up to the normal maximum of three terms (nine years).
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association set out the policy for 
dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest and are in line with 
the Companies Act 2006. The Board has a formal system in 
place for Directors to declare conflicts of interest and for such 
conflicts to be considered for authorisation.
Training and development
In preparation for admission, all Directors received an induction 
briefing from the Company’s legal advisers on the duties and 
responsibilities as Directors of a publicly quoted company. 
In addition, upon their appointment all Directors receive an 
induction programme arranged by the Company Secretary, 
including plant visits and meetings with key members of senior 
management in order to familiarise themselves with the Group.
Information and support
To enable the Board to function effectively and to assist the 
Directors in discharging their responsibilities, full and timely 
access is given to all relevant information to the Board. In the 
case of Board meetings this consists of a formal agenda and a 
comprehensive set of papers including regular business progress 
reports. An established procedure is in place to ensure that such 
information is provided to Directors in a timely manner in advance 
of meetings. Specific business-related presentations are given 
by senior management when appropriate.
The Company Secretary works closely with the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive Officer and the chairs of the Board Committees 
to ensure that Board procedures, including setting agendas and 
the timely distribution of papers, are complied with and that 
there are good communications flows between the Board 
and its Committees, and between senior management and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company Secretary is also 
available to all Directors to provide advice and support, including 
facilitating induction programmes. All Directors are able to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in 
the furtherance of their duties where considered necessary.
Re-election of Directors
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2018 
all the Directors will be offering themselves for re-election. 
Whistleblowing
The Company has established procedures by which employees 
may, in confidence, raise concerns relating to some danger, 
fraud, or other illegal or unethical conduct in the workplace. 
The Whistleblowing Policy applies to all employees of the Group. 
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
Group’s whistleblowing arrangements and the policy is reviewed 
periodically by the Board.

continued Dialogue with shareholders
Prior to the IPO the Company’s shareholders comprised

As part of the IPO ‘roadshow’ in 2017 and in the period since 
the IPO, the Executive Directors have met with a large number 
of investors and have engaged in active discussions with 
shareholders and investors, both on an individual basis and 
through roadshow events. The Company aims to maintain an 
active dialogue with key stakeholders, including institutional 
investors, to discuss issues relating to the performance of the 
Group, including strategy and new developments. As indicated 
above, the Senior Independent Director is available to discuss 
any matter shareholders might wish to raise and attends 
meetings with shareholders as required.
The Company has an investor relations website which is publicly 
available and provides relevant information to both institutional 
investors and private shareholders, including performance 
updates and announcements by the Company.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will take place on

resolution. At the Annual General Meeting, after the formal 
business has been concluded, the Chairman will welcome 
questions from shareholders. All Directors attend the meeting, 
at which they have the opportunity to meet with shareholders. 
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 17 May 2018 and an explanation of the items of

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder,
The Nomination Committee was formed prior to the listing 
of TI Fluid System plc shares to the London Stock Exchange 
on 25 October 2017.
This is TI Fluid Systems’ first year in public life and consequently 
there has been considerable focus on establishing a robust 
Board with the necessary mix of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity to drive the strategic objectives of the business. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for leading this 
process and making recommendations to the Board.
The Nomination Committee will also lead the process of Board 
Evaluation which will commence in 2018, our first full year as 
a public company.
Membership of the Nomination Committee and attendance 
during the year
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the 
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director, Neil Carson, 
and the Non-Executive Director, Paul Edgerley. The Board 
considers the majority of the members of the Nomination 
Committee to be independent.
The Terms of Reference of the Nomination Committee 
are available to view at 
http://investors.tiautomotive.com/~/media/Files/T/Tiautomotive-
IR/documents/nomination-committee-terms-of-reference.pdf
The terms and conditions of ‘appointment’ of Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and at the Annual General 
Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during 
the meeting).
Recruitment process
In preparation for the IPO and prior to the appointment of 
a Nomination Committee, the Board undertook a thorough 
process, with the assistance of advisers, to identify appropriate 
Non-Executive Directors with the correct balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience to be relevant to the Group and to 
drive the Company forward and the process included candidates 
meeting ongoing Directors prior to the recommendation for 
appointment to the Board.
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that at least 
half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise non- 
executive directors determined by the Board to be independent. 
The Board comprises eight Directors, including the Independent 
Non-Executive Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, two Executive Directors 
and two Non-Executive Directors. The Company regards this as 
an appropriate Board structure. However, the Company intends 
to appoint additional independent Non-Executive Directors within 
a reasonable period of time to comply with the requirements of 
the Corporate Governance Code.
Diversity
The Board acknowledges that diversity extends beyond 
the boardroom and supports management efforts to build 
a diverse organisation. The Company believes in promoting 
diversity at all levels of the organisation. 28% of TI Fluid 
Systems’ employees are women. At present 14% of our senior 
management are women. However, we currently do not have 
any female directors on the Board. In the coming year, when 
reviewing the composition of the Board, we will endeavour to 
achieve appropriate levels of diversity, while at the same time 
ensuring appointments are made on merit and there is an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Board.
Key issues reviewed by the Committee in the year
In the period since the year ended 31 December 2017 
the Nomination Committee has met and considered 
the following issues:
 – Review the balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity on the Board
 – Establishing an induction programme for Non-Executive 
Directors
 – Planning for Board evaluation and review of succession 
planning
 – Review of the skills and independence of each of the 
Non-Executive Directors and recommendation that each 
of them be re-elected at the Company’s first Annual General 
Meeting on 17 May 2018.
Action plan for 2018
2018 will be TI Fluid Systems’ first full year as a public company. 
It is intended the Nomination Committee will meet twice a year. 
Below are some of the issues that the Nomination Committee 
plan to consider as part of an Action Plan for the year:

reporting and the external and internal audit, including:
 – reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the Group’s annual 
and interim financial statements
 – advising on the appointment of the external Auditors and

provided to the Board
 – external financial reporting procedures, audit arrangements 
and reporting standards

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Significant accounting matters
The significant issues and accounting judgements considered by the Committee in the preparation of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements were:
Key accounting judgements Work undertaken
Warranty provision
The Group is subject to warranty claims in the event that 
its products fail to perform as per specifications. Warranty 
provisions are made to cover potential exposures that relate 
to specific customer claims. 
Key judgements are made in calculating the provision and these 
are dependent on the customer, complexity of the issue and the 
negotiation process. The outcome of claims is often difficult to 
predict and quantify. 
We considered the judgements made by management 
in assessing the likelihood and quantification of material 
exposures. This included: 
 – understanding the nature of the specific claims and 
correspondence with customers
 – assessing management’s evaluation of the likelihood 
and quantum of exposure and the status of negotiations 
with the customer
We concluded the judgements were reasonable.
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
All cash generating units (CGUs) containing goodwill 
and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually. 
The determination of CGUs and the recoverable amount 
requires judgement by management in both identifying 
and valuing the relevant CGUs.
Key judgements and estimates are involved in completion 
of impairment reviews including cash flow forecasts, discount 
rates and long-term growth rates. A change in these 
assumptions can result in a material change in the valuation 
of the assets.
As part of the annual impairment review, we considered a 
summary report from management explaining the methodology, 
assumptions and results of the impairment test. 
There were no indications of impairment as there was 
headroom over the carrying value of the CGUs. 
The impairment reviews were also an area of focus for 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and we considered their report. 
We concluded that the judgements and estimates used 
in the impairment test were reasonable.
Accounting for hedging arrangements
The Group has exposure to movements in interest rates 
and exchange rates and uses financial derivatives to mitigate 
the risk.
Significant judgement and estimation are involved in assessing 
whether the financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
and in determining the fair value of forward exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps. 
We considered management updates and the assistance 
provided by Chatham Financial, a specialist financial 
instruments company, in assessing the management 
of hedging arrangements.
We also noted PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s work and use 
of subject matter experts in relation to hedging arrangements.
Having considered the use of specialists and the external 
auditors report, the Committee was satisfied with the 
judgements and estimates used.
Deferred tax asset recognition and provision for uncertain 
tax positions
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to tax 
laws in many jurisdictions. 
Provisions are made for uncertain tax positions which involve 
judgement and estimates by management as to the likelihood 
of their realisation. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets also involves judgement 
as to their realisation, including whether there will be sufficient 
taxable profits in future periods to support recognition.
We reviewed summary reports from management in respect 
of estimates of tax exposures to assess the reasonableness 
of the Group’s tax provisions. Information provided has included 
specialist tax advice in applicable jurisdictions and updates on 
specific ongoing audits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets have been reviewed 
to support recognition.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also reported to the 
Committee its findings in this area which have been reviewed 
and considered.
The Committee was satisfied with the judgements, estimates 
and that disclosures were reasonable and appropriate. 
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made are reasonable and appropriate disclosures have been included 
in the accounts. 
Other Financial Reporting Matters
Presentation of financial statements
The Audit & Risk Committee has reviewed the presentation of the financial statements, in particular the presentation of non-GAAP 
measures. The Committee has concluded that this presentation is appropriate.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance report
continued External Auditors
A principal duty of the Audit & Risk Committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment 
of the external auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were first 
appointed as auditor to the Group in 2001 and as auditor to 
TI Fluid Systems plc in September 2015. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP are subject to annual reappointment by shareholders.
The Audit & Risk Committee are very aware the effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditor is central to ensuring 
the integrity of the Group’s published financial information. 
The effectiveness and independence of the external auditor 
has been assessed by the Board and confirmed. Prior to the 
commencement of the audit, the Audit & Risk Committee 
reviewed and approved the audit plan to ensure it was 
appropriately focused.
In order to ensure the external auditors’ independence, the 
Committee annually reviews the Company’s relationship with 
its auditors and assesses the level of controls and procedures 
in place to ensure the required level of independence and that 
the Company has an objective and professional relationship with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Auditor rotation rules for a listed 
Company require the Group audit partner and audit partners of 
material components to rotate off after five years in the role unless 
there are circumstances that justify an extension. Chris Hibbs and 
the audit partners of components in the US, Korea and Germany 
have been in their roles for more than five years. To ensure the 
audit quality and the level of service as the Group transitions 
to a listed Company, professional standards allow Chris Hibbs 
to continue as the Group audit partner up to the year ending 
31 December 2018 and for the audit partners in the US, Korea 
and Germany for the year ending 31 December 2017. The matter 
was discussed and agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 a competitive audit 
tender process was undertaken and following a formal process 
of proposal documents and presentations the decision was 
taken to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external 
auditor to the Group. In order to meet the requirements set out 
by the Competition and Markets Authority and the European 
Commission, the Company will hold an audit tender at the latest 
after the current external auditor has been in place for a period 
of 10 years.
The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions 
of the Competition and Markets Authority order for the financial 
year under review.
Non-Audit services
The Audit & Risk Committee has adopted a formal policy 
governing the engagement of the external auditors to provide 
non-audit services. This policy describes the circumstances in 
which the auditor may be engaged to undertake non-audit work 
for the Group. The Committee recognises that the auditors may 
be best placed to undertake certain non-audit work and 
engagements for non-audit services that are not prohibited are 
subject to formal review by the Audit & Risk Committee based 
on the level of fees involved. In the year to 31 December 2017, 
non-audit fees totalled €3.0 million and audit fees totalled 
€2.4 million. Non-audit fees represented 56% of the total fees 
paid to the external auditor of €5.4 million. Non-audit fees in part 
reflect the services and advice provided, including as Reporting 
Accountants, in connection with the Global Offering. Non-Audit 
Fees in the year to 31 December 2017 are detailed in the 
following table:
Nature of service €m
Global-offer related corporate finance services 2.3
Tax compliance and advisory fees 0.6
Other 0.1
Total non-audit services 3.0
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Group has updated its internal control framework and 
continues to refine its processes and controls globally to reflect 
changes to the framework. The Group’s system of internal 
controls, along with its design and operating effectiveness, is 
subject to review by the Audit & Risk Committee, in addition to 
review by the Internal and External auditors. Control deficiencies 
identified are followed up with action plans that are reviewed by 
the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board has established policies 
and procedures, including delegations of authority, which have 
been communicated across the Group.
The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
financial reporting process and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and we can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Board has established 
a clear organisational structure with defined authority levels. 
The day-to-day running of the Group’s business is delegated 
to the Executive Directors of the Group.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk appetite 
and ensuring there is an effective risk management framework. 
The Board has delegated responsibility for review of the risk 
management programme and effectiveness of internal controls 
to the Audit & Risk Committee. In its first year as a public 
company, the Group is implementing a formal risk management 
programme and has adopted the methodology and process 
design. As part of the preparation for the Global Offer and Listing, 
an assessment of the Group’s principal risks and mitigating 
activities was undertaken. The Audit & Risk Committee has 
reviewed the assessment of the Group’s principal risks, the 
impact on the prospects for the Group and the mitigating actions 
and the Board has confirmed that a robust assessment of the 
Group’s principal risks had been undertaken.
Further information on the Group’s risk management programme 
and the risks and uncertainties which are judged to have the 
most significant impact on the Group’s long-term performance 
and prospects are set out on pages 21 to 23.
Internal Audit
Internal audit plays an important role in assessing the 
effectiveness of internal controls by a programme of reviews of 
key business risks across the Group. The Group has a dedicated 
Internal Audit function and a formal audit plan is in place to 
address the key risks across the Group. 
The Audit & Risk Committee considers and approves the internal 
audit plan, which is based on an assessment of the key risks 
faced by the Group. Progress in respect of the plan is monitored 
throughout the year and care is taken to ensure that the internal 
audit function has sufficient resource to complete the plan. 
The audit plan may be reviewed during the year as a result 
of the ongoing assessment of the key risks or in response to 
the needs of the Group. The Director of Internal Audit reports 
ultimately to the Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee, 
although he reports on a day-to-day basis to the Chief Financial 
Officer. He attends most meetings of the Committee. A report 
on completed internal audits is presented to the Committee and, 
where appropriate, action plans are reviewed.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual statement by 
the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Neil Carson OBE 
Deputy Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director
Dear Shareholder,
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased 
to introduce our first Directors’ Remuneration report as a 
listed company. 
The Remuneration Policy which is set out on pages 46 to 54 of 
this report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at our 
Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2018 and is consistent with 
the disclosure in the IPO prospectus issued in October 2017.
Our approach to the Remuneration Policy
As this is the first Directors’ Remuneration report for TI Fluid 
Systems as a listed company, the Remuneration Committee 
have sought to put into place a remuneration structure consistent 
with UK corporate governance requirements and guidance, whilst 
focusing on attracting, retaining and motivating an international 
management team. We started our work as a Remuneration 
Committee prior to the IPO and, since the listing, have built 
on this work to develop our first Remuneration Policy.
TI Fluid Systems has in place a senior leadership team 
with significant experience and a long-proven track-record 
of performance in the competitive automotive industry. 
The Remuneration Committee’s aim is to have a Policy which 
supports the Company’s key strategic objectives described 
on pages 18 to 19.
This Remuneration Policy aligns the Executive Directors’ 
interests with the long-term interests of shareholders and 
is designed to attract, retain and motivate a global talent base 
with key senior management based in the US. 
The Policy: 
 – maintains a UK listed company remuneration structure, 
while recognising the need to maintain competitive benefits 
in the Directors’ country of residence, which at this time 
is the United States; 
 – supports a high-performance culture with appropriate 
reward for superior performance without creating incentives 
that encourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable 
Company performance; and
 – recognises the significant equity ownership position held 
by the current Executive Directors.
This is underpinned through the implementation and operation 
of our two incentive plans: the Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan 
(‘ABP’) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’).
This Report lays out the core principles of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and details of our pre-IPO remuneration 
practice as a private company. I trust we have done this with 
the transparency and clarity that aids your understanding 
of both our intent and our actions.
The Remuneration Policy
In anticipation of Admission, the Company commissioned a 
review of its Remuneration Policy. The objective of the review 
was to ensure that our remuneration structures for Directors 
and other senior employees would be fit for purpose as a listed 
company whilst also retaining certain key features, such as 
simplicity and transparency. We believe that the incentive plans 
that form part of our new Remuneration Policy fit within UK 
corporate governance requirements. The plans in summary are:
Base salary Set at a level which is market competitive 
to attract and retain executives and at a level 
which reflects an individual’s experience, 
role, competency and performance.
Benefits Access to existing health insurance, car and 
perquisite allowance.
Pension Our Executive Directors have a nominal 
matching defined contribution retirement 
savings plan customary in the United States 
which, contrary to UK norms, is subject to 
a cap of approximately €10k annually.
Annual and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (‘ABP’)
Annual incentives of up to 300% of base 
pay may be awarded for the achievement 
of financial and strategic targets linked to our 
strategy. Consistent with UK governance 
and guidance, bonus of up to the first 100% 
of salary is paid in cash, with any element 
above 100% of salary deferred into ordinary 
shares and held for two years. Previously, as 
a private company, the short-term incentive 
plan was uncapped and paid in full in cash.
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’)
Executive Directors will receive annual 
share awards of up to 300% of base pay 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the first 
of which is proposed to be awarded prior to 
the Annual General Meeting in May 2018. 
Vesting of these shares is subject to 
performance conditions measured over 
a three-year period; with an opportunity 
to earn up to 133% of maximum award 
for exceptional performance (400% of base 
salary in total). Similar US-based automotive 
companies have maximum long-term 
incentive opportunities of up to 595% base 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer.
Recovery and 
withholding 
provisions
These are in place for the ABP and LTIP 
to safeguard shareholders’ interests in 
the event of an overpayment.
Shareholder 
Guidelines
At the 2017 year end and at the time of 
publishing this report, the CEO and CFO 
held shares equivalent to approximately 
24 times and 19 times of base salary 
respectively; however, a requirement 
primarily for new Executive Directors to 
build up and retain a significant holding of 
TI Fluid Systems shares has been introduced.
Further details on the Remuneration Policy can be found 
on page 46.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration report Remuneration Committee decisions made and activity 
following the IPO
The Group’s remuneration policies and practices were reviewed 
in preparation for the IPO to ensure appropriate remuneration 
arrangements were in place to support the Group’s strategy 
following the listing of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee’s key activities during 2017 
and in the period since the IPO were focused on:
 – agreement of the Remuneration Committee’s terms 
of reference; 
 – formulation and finalisation of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy as a listed company;
 – setting the policy for Non-Executive Directors’ fees;
 – designing the Company’s new ABP and LTIP;
 – determining the level of short and long-term bonus payments 
in respect of the 2017 financial year; and
 – drafting the Company’s first Annual Report on Remuneration 
as a listed company.
Shareholder engagement
We are committed to active engagement with our shareholders. 
As part of the preparation for the IPO we clearly disclosed 
remuneration details in the Global Offer prospectus. We have 
also sought feedback from our major shareholders in advance 
of the publication of the Remuneration Policy, to explain our 
approach in addressing Executive Directors’ remuneration.
The remainder of the Remuneration report is split into two parts 
in line with legislative reporting requirements:
 – Remuneration Policy. This sets out the Remuneration 
Policy for the Directors. The Remuneration Policy is subject 
to a binding vote of the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. If approved by shareholders, the Remuneration 
Policy will come into effect on 17 May 2018, and will be 
effective from the beginning of the current financial year. 
If there is any change to the Remuneration Policy, a new 
policy will be submitted to shareholders for approval.
 – Annual report on remuneration. This sets out payments 
made to the Executive Directors during the year and details 
the link between Company performance and remuneration 
for that period. This is subject to an annual advisory vote 
of shareholders. For clarity, the remuneration for the period 
prior to IPO, detailed in the Annual report on remuneration, 
was not subject to the Remuneration Policy set out on 
the following pages.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration report sets out the 
details of the Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors of the Company and will be proposed 
for approval by shareholders by way of a binding vote at the 
Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2018. It is proposed that 
the Policy will apply for the period of three years from the date 
of approval. Unless it is changed before then and subject to 
shareholder approval, it is proposed the Policy as set out below 
will operate up until the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
to be held in 2021.
Remuneration Policy summary
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the 
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors, Non-Executive 
Directors and Chairman for current and future years. In setting the 
Policy, the Remuneration Committee has sought to ensure that 
it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the 
Company’s business environment and in remuneration practice. 
The Policy is designed around the following key principles:
 – alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders;
 – competitive remuneration which is set at an appropriate level 
to attract, retain and motivate executive management in the 
United States, United Kingdom and other countries;
 – strategic alignment – having regard to the risk appetite 
of the Company and alignment to the Company’s long-term 
strategic goals; 
 – encouraging and supporting a high-performance culture 
with appropriate reward for superior performance; and
 – avoiding the creation of incentives that will encourage 
excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance.
The Remuneration Committee will review and approve annually 
the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and 
review for alignment the remuneration arrangements of other 
key senior management taking into consideration:
 – overall corporate performance;
 – market conditions affecting the Company;
 – the recruitment market;
 – business strategy over the period; and
 – changing practice in the markets where the Company 
competes for talent.
The following table sets out each element of remuneration 
for Executive Directors and how it supports the Company’s 
short and long-term strategic objectives.
Remuneration Policy table

Base salary 
Provide salaries that 
support the Company 
to acquire and retain the 
Executive Directors with 
the experience and 
expertise required to 
develop and implement 
the Company’s strategy.
An Executive Director’s basic salary is set on 
appointment and reviewed annually or when 
there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, 
the Committee considers:
 – individual degree of responsibility and 
experience of the Director;
 – remuneration structures in companies 
that are comparable in terms of business 
activities, complexity and size; and
 – wider remuneration practices within 
the Company.
The Committee ensures that maximum salary and 
fee levels are positioned with consideration of:
 – the need to acquire and retain Executives 
with the skills and experience to develop 
and implement the Company’s strategy;
 – companies that are comparable in terms of 
business activities, complexity and size to the 
Company, which the Company would compete 
for talent against; and
 – the norms within the country in which the 
executive resides.
In general, increases for Executive Directors 
will be in line with the increase for employees.
The Company sets out in the section headed 
‘Implementation of Remuneration Policy’ the 
salaries for the next year for each of the 
Executive Directors.
Benefits
Provide a benefits 
package in line with 
practice relative to the 
Company’s comparator 
group to enable the 
Company to recruit and 
retain Executive Directors 
with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
Company-provided benefits coverage in the 
jurisdiction they reside in. These benefits include: 
medical, life and disability income protection 
insurance, executive medical assessments, 
perquisite allowances, car allowance/Company 
paid vehicle lease, relocation support and benefits 
when applicable, tax advice and tax return fees, 
incremental overseas tax of the Executive 
Directors as well as other customary benefits 
which are afforded to employees in the same 
jurisdiction. In some cases, the Company may 
pay the tax on these services.
The Remuneration Committee recognises 
the need to maintain flexibility in the benefits 
provided to Executive Directors to ensure it is 
able to support the objective of attracting and 
retaining key personnel in order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy. Additional benefits may 
therefore be offered at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Benefits do not generally represent a significant 
portion of the total remuneration package of 
Executive Directors.
Medical benefits cover is provided through the 
Company’s US-based self-insured medical plan 
and is available to all US-based employees. The 
cost of providing this benefit varies on utilisation.
Perquisite allowances will not exceed €28k 
per year.
Car allowances will not exceed €17k per year.
Tax advice and tax return fees are met by the 
Company.
Qualified disability cover is 100% of base pay 
for six months. Qualified long-term disability 
cover is 60% of base pay (up to €15k per month) 
until the age of 65.

Pensions
Provides a pension 
provision in line with 
competitive practice 
to enable the Company 
to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors 
with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
Pension arrangements are provided in line 
with practice relative to the country in which 
the Executive Director resides.
The Company operates a defined contribution 
(DC) scheme for all US employees. Employees 
who contribute into the Company’s 401(k) 
pension scheme receive matching Company 
contributions subject to limits.
If appropriate and at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee a competitive pension 
arrangement or cash alternative may be 
implemented provided that the terms and value 
of the arrangements are consistent with custom 
and practice of the jurisdiction in which it is to 
be applied.
The Company’s 401(k) pension scheme includes 
a Company matching defined contribution 
customary in the United States which is subject 
to a cap of approximately €10k per year. The cap 
is subject to change in accordance with US IRS 
Code 401(k).
In the event that a non-US-based Executive 
Director is engaged, a pension arrangement or 
alternative cash scheme may be implemented 
consistent with custom and practice in the 
jurisdiction in which the Executive Director is 
employed and will not exceed 20% of base salary.
The Company sets out in the section headed 
‘Implementation of Remuneration Policy’ the 
pension contributions for the next year for each 
of the Executive Directors.

The ABP provides an 
incentive to the Executive 
Directors linked to 
achievement in delivering 
goals that are closely 
aligned with the 
Company’s strategy 
and the creation of value 
for shareholders.
The Remuneration 
Committee, at its 
discretion, can further 
align (when appropriate) 
the Executive Directors 
with shareholders 
through deferral 
and the increased 
equity ownership 
of management 
in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will determine 
the bonus to be awarded following the end 
of the relevant financial year based on the 
performance measures set at the beginning 
of the performance period.
The Company will set out in the Remuneration 
report in the following financial year, the nature 
of the targets and their weighting.
Details of the performance conditions, targets 
and their level of satisfaction for the year being 
reported on will be set out in the Annual report 
on remuneration to the extent that they are not 
commercially sensitive. 
The Committee can determine that part of the 
bonus earned under the ABP is provided as an 
award of shares.
Typically, the first 100% of salary bonus will 
be paid fully in cash, with any element payable 
above 100% of salary deferred into ordinary 
shares of the Company, for two years with 
no further performance conditions.
The Company will set out in the Remuneration 
report in the following financial year, the nature 
of the deferral mechanism being operated for the 
annual bonus for the awards to be made in that 
financial year. 
The Committee may at its discretion award 
dividend equivalents on those deferred shares 
to plan participants to the extent and until vesting.
The maximum bonus (including any part of the 
bonus that is deferred) will not exceed 300% 
of an Executive Director’s annual base salary.
The Remuneration Committee may use different 
performance conditions and weightings for each 
performance cycle as appropriate, in line with 
the strategic needs of the business.
The percentage of the bonus earned for levels 
of performance will be:
 – Threshold: 30% of maximum bonus award
 – Target: 70% of maximum bonus award
 – Maximum: 100% of maximum bonus award
The performance measures for 2018 will be 
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes 
(weighted 40%), Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
(weighted 40%) and strategic measures 
(weighted 20%). Awards will be calculated 
using a straight-line scale between Threshold 
and Target, and Target and Maximum.

Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’)
The purpose of the 
LTIP is to incentivise 
and reward Executive 
Directors in relation to 
long-term performance 
and achievement of 
the Company’s strategy 
and to act as a retention 
mechanism. 
The Award is designed 
to incentivise Executive 
Directors to grow their 
shareholding in the 
Company and create 
value by successfully 
delivering the Company’s 
strategy and increasing 
total shareholder value, 
assessed via share price 
and earnings growth.
Awards are granted annually to Executive 
Directors in the form of either a conditional share 
award, nil cost option or restricted share award. 
Details of the performance conditions for grants 
made in the year will be set out in the 
Remuneration report.
These awards will vest over three years subject to:
 – the Executive Director’s continued employment 
at the date of vesting; and
 – satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The Committee may award dividend equivalents 
on awards in either shares or cash to the extent 
that these LTIP awards vest.
The Committee will apply a holding period 
of two years post vesting to the LTIP unless 
exceptional circumstances arise.
The Committee will include an override provision 
in each LTIP grant, which will give the Committee 
the discretion, acting fairly and reasonably, to 
determine that vesting can be reduced if there are 
circumstances (relating to the Company’s overall 
performance or otherwise) which make vesting 
when calculated by reference to the performance 
conditions alone inappropriate.
The Committee reserves the right to amend 
the performance conditions where there is a 
significant change in economic circumstances 
or accounting standards and also reserves the 
power to adjust the number of LTIP shares on 
the occurrence of a corporate event or other 
reorganisation and are not materially less 
challenging to satisfy the original conditions.
Normal maximum grant value of up to 300% of 
salary based on the market value at the date of 
grant set in accordance with the rules of the Plan.
100% of the LTIP award will vest based on the 
achievement of the performance target with up 
to 133% vesting (i.e. 400% of salary) based on 
exceptional performance as measured by the 
achievement of the outperformance target.
The maximum grant, in exceptional circumstances 
(such as recruitment) can be 450% of base salary, 
however this does not apply to the current 
Executive Directors given their agreed terms.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion 
in exceptional circumstances to change 
performance measures and targets and the 
weightings attached to performance measures 
part-way through a performance period if there 
is a significant and material event which causes 
the Remuneration Committee to believe the 
original measures, weightings and targets 
are no longer appropriate.
The performance measures for 2018–2020 will 
be Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share Growth 
(weighted 80%) and Relative Adjusted Total 
Shareholder Return against the FTSE 250 
(weighted 20%). Vesting will be calculated 
using a straight-line scale between Threshold 
and Maximum.
The outperformance measure for 2018–2020 
will be Basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share Growth 
and will fully trigger on the outperformance 
achievement.
Malus and clawback The Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan (‘ABP’) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) include standard 
practice malus and clawback provisions. 
Malus is the adjustment of unpaid bonus and deferred share awards under the ABP and outstanding 
LTIP awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. The adjustment 
may result in the value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of payments or vested awards under the ABP and vested LTIP awards as a 
result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. Clawback may apply to all or part 
of a participant’s award and may be effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, 
payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows:
 – discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group 
or any Group company,
 – discovery that the assessment of any performance condition or condition in respect of an ABP and 
LTIP award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information, 
 – the discovery that any information used to determine the cash payment under the ABP or the number 
of shares subject to an ABP or LTIP award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information;
 – action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud or gross misconduct, or 
 – events or the behaviour of a participant have led to the censure of a Group company by a regulatory 
authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group company 
provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant participant was responsible for the censure or 
reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to the participant.
Malus provisions may be applied to the ABP up to the date of payment of a cash bonus and to the end 
of the two-year deferral period. This provision may also be applied to the end of the three-year vesting 
period of the LTIP.
Clawback provisions may be applied to the LTIP for the two years post vesting.
The Committee believes that the rules of the plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus 
and clawback where required.

Discretion The Remuneration Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report. The Remuneration Committee may also exercise operational and administrative 
discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend the Policy with regard to minor or administrative 
matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, disproportionate to seek 
or await shareholder approval.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage Executive Directors 
to build up over a five-year period and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage 
of the Executive Director’s base salary. Adherence to these guidelines is a condition of continued 
participation in the Company’s equity incentive arrangements. This policy ensures that the interests 
of Executive Directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned. 
The following table sets out the minimum shareholding requirements:
Role Shareholding requirement (percentage of salary)
Executive Directors 300%
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirement.
Non-Executive 
Director fees
Provides a level of fees to 
support recruitment and 
retention of high-calibre 
Non-Executive Directors 
with the necessary 
experience to advise and 
assist with establishing 
and monitoring the 
Company’s strategic 
objectives.
The Board is responsible for setting the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors. 
Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee, 
paid quarterly in arrears.
Fees are reviewed annually in line with the review 
policy for the Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
variable remuneration or benefits arrangements. 
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are 
competitive and are outlined on page 58.
In general the level of fee increase for the 
Non-Executive Directors will be set taking into 
account any change in responsibility and the 
general increase in Non-Executive Director’s 
fees in the UK market.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses 
incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and 
may settle any tax incurred in relation to these. 
The Company may also assist with the fees 
for preparation of annual tax returns.
Historic awards
There are no outstanding share awards under any previous share schemes operated by the Company.
Selection of performance targets
The table below sets out the performance targets to be applied to the 2018 ABP and LTIP for Executive Directors.
Annual and Deferred 
Bonus Plan
Financial performance targets under the ABP are set by the Remuneration Committee, ensuring the 
levels to achieve threshold, target or maximum pay out are appropriately challenging. The performance 
targets for 2018 are set to ensure delivery of current operational plans and operational efficiency. 
Commercial sensitivity precludes the advance publication of the actual bonus targets, but these 
targets will be retrospectively published in the Remuneration report for 2018 to the extent that 
they are no longer commercially sensitive.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The targets under the LTIP are set to reflect the Company’s longer-term growth objectives at a level 
where the maximum and outperformance represents exceptional performance over the long term. 
Underlying Basic EPS is considered a simple and clear measure of absolute growth in line with the 
Company’s strategy. Total Shareholder Return versus a peer group is considered an important focus 
for the Company in order to align the management team with shareholders. 
The Company sets out in the section headed ‘Implementation of Remuneration Policy’ the specifics 
of the 2018 LTIP for the Executive Directors.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Group employee considerations
The Remuneration Committee considers the Executive Directors’ remuneration in the context of the wider employee population and 
is kept regularly updated on pay and conditions across the Group. Increases in base salary for Executive Directors will take into account 
the level of salary increases granted to employees within the Group and the competitive environment of the employing country. 
TI Fluid Systems seeks to pay a competitive package of base pay and benefits in each market and at all job levels to attract and retain 
high-quality employees. The proportion of variable pay increases with progression through management levels with the highest 
proportion of variable pay at Executive Director level, as defined by the Remuneration Policy. 
Selected senior management and key employees participate in formal short-term and/or long-term incentive programmes that are 
based on financial and other strategic outcomes. In a number of countries in which the Group operates, due to custom and practice 
or the Company’s desire to apply flexible compensation arrangements, an annual local bonus may be granted to employees based 
on the achievement of both financial and non-financial Key Performance Indicators.
The key element of remuneration for those below senior management grades is base salary and it is the Group’s practice to ensure that 
base salaries are competitive in the local markets. General pay increases take local salary norms and business conditions into account.
Recruitment policy
The section below sets out the Remuneration Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration of Executive Directors.
The Company’s principle objective is that the remuneration of a new Executive Director will be assessed in line with the same 
principles as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the Remuneration Policy table above. The Committee is mindful that it wishes 
to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure a preferred candidate with the appropriate calibre and experience needed 
for the role. 
In setting the remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment, 
when using its discretion, regarding one-off or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive payments, as well as giving consideration 
for the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
The Company’s policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of a new Executive Director is summarised in the table below.
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Salary, benefits and 
pension
These will be set in line with the Policy set on page 46.
Annual and Deferred 
Bonus Plan
Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s Policy on page 47 consistent 
with existing Executive Directors and will not exceed 300% of salary.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s Policy on page 48 or up to 450% 
of salary in circumstances the Board considers to be exceptional.
‘Buyout’ of incentives 
forfeited on cessation 
of employment
Where the Remuneration Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment 
justify the provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited 
on cessation of an Executive Director’s previous employment will be calculated considering 
the following:
 – the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive Director’s 
cessation of employment;
 – the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them 
being satisfied; and 
 – any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value (‘lapsed value’).
The Remuneration Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where 
possible, under the Company’s incentive plans. To the extent that it is not possible or practical 
to provide the buyout within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke 
arrangement will be used as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules (9.4.2). 
In the event relocation is required, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion in determining 
the financial limits of relocation assistance considering the needs and location requirements of the 
Executive Director and Company.
Where an existing employee is appointed to the Board as an Executive Director, the Policy set out above will apply from the date 
of promotion but there will be no retrospective application of the Policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration 
arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee will be honoured and form 
part of the ongoing remuneration of the person concerned. These will be disclosed to shareholders in the Remuneration report 
for the relevant financial year.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies 
to current Non-Executive Directors.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Service contracts and payment for loss of office 
The section below sets out the Remuneration Committee’s approach to service contracts and policy on termination payments.
The Remuneration Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. The Executive Directors’ service contracts 
do not contain liquidated damages clauses. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it 
considers fair and reasonable in each case. There is no agreement between the Company and its Executive Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a Change of Control. 
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge 
of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any 
claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 A ‘good leaver reason’ is defined as cessation in the following circumstances:
 – death;
 – ill-health;
 – injury or disability;
 – redundancy;
 – retirement;
 – employing company ceasing to be a Group company;
 – ‘good reason’; 
 – in other circumstances set forth in the LTIP agreement;
 – transfer of employment to a company which is not a Group company; and 
 – any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (as described above), except for dishonesty, fraud, misconduct 
or any other circumstances justifying summary dismissal.
Cessation of employment in circumstances other than those set out above is cessation for ‘other’ reasons.
Circumstances constituting ‘good reason’ for an Executive Director are defined as including:
(i)  a material diminution in his title, duties or responsibilities (including reporting responsibilities) or removal from the Board; 
(ii)  a material reduction in his annual basic salary or target annual bonus opportunity (in each case, other than a reduction of not more 
than 10% pursuant to an across-the-board reduction applicable to all similarly situated executives); 
(iii)  a significant relocation of his principal place of employment; or 
(iv)  TI Group Automotive Systems L.L.C.’s failure to fulfil certain obligations under the service agreement. 
Upon resignation for ‘good reason’, each Executive Director generally is entitled to the same payments and benefits as upon 
a termination without ‘cause’, provided that: (a) in the case of Mr Kozyra, his outstanding and unvested annual performance share 
grants will fully vest for time, if he resigns due to not being re-nominated to the Board; and (b) in the case of Mr Knutson, his cash 
severance will be increased to an amount equal to two times the sum of his annual basic salary and his target annual bonus, payable 
in equal instalments over an 18 month period, if the Board’s first appointment of a Chief Executive Officer following the termination 
of Mr Kozyra’s service as Chief Executive Officer is unacceptable to him.
If Mr Kozyra resigns from his position as Chief Executive Officer after 30 June 2019 and before 1 July 2021, without ‘good reason’, 
he will be entitled to a payment of salary up to the termination date, any unpaid annual bonus for the prior fiscal year, a pro rata bonus 
for the fiscal year of termination, and a pro rata portion of any outstanding and unvested annual performance share grants (provided 
that, if he continues to serve as a Board member following his resignation, all of his outstanding and unvested annual performance 
share grants will remain outstanding, and will continue to vest during such Board service; provided, further, if his resignation occurs 
simultaneously therewith or at some point thereafter as a result of: (a) the Group’s request for him not to serve on the Board or to 
resign from the Board; or (b) any action (or inaction) by the Board to remove him from the Board or not to re-nominate him to the 
Board, his outstanding and unvested annual performance share grants will fully time vest). In all cases, vesting of the annual 
performance share grants remains subject to achievement of the applicable performance metrics.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors of the Company do not have service contracts, but are appointed by letter of appointment. 
Each Non-Executive Director’s term of office runs for an initial period of three years unless terminated earlier upon written 
notice or upon their resignation.
The terms of the Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held on 17 May 2018 and to re-election at any subsequent Annual General Meeting

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration scenarios 
The charts below illustrate the remuneration that would be paid to each of the Executive Directors, based on current salaries under 
five different performance scenarios: (i) Below Threshold; (ii) Threshold; (iii) Target; (iv) Maximum; (v) Outperformance Maximum. 
The elements of remuneration have been categorised into three components: (i) Fixed; (ii) ABP; and (iii) LTIP.
In accordance with the regulations share price growth has not been included. 
Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Committee considers pay and employment conditions across the Company when reviewing the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and other senior employees. The Remuneration Committee considers the range of base pay increases 
across the Group. While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay 
and formulating the Remuneration Policy set out in this report, the Company does receive updates from the Executive Directors 
on their discussions and reviews with senior management and employees. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Company welcomes dialogue with its shareholders, and the Remuneration Committee will consult with key shareholders prior 
to any significant changes to its Remuneration Policy.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual report on remuneration 
Introduction
This section sets out details of the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors received during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017 and also describes the operation of the Remuneration Committee. 
For clarity, some elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration set out in the following report includes payments made prior 
to the Company’s listing and were not subject to the Remuneration Policy.
The Annual report on remuneration will, together with the Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
on pages 44 to 45, be proposed for an advisory vote by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on 
17 May 2018. In preparing this report consideration has been given to the GC100 and Investor Group Directors’ Remuneration 
Reporting Guidance.
Remuneration Committee 
Membership
The Remuneration Committee was established on 24 October 2017. Neil Carson is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The other members of the Remuneration Committee are John Smith and Jeffrey Vanneste. There were no formal meetings 
of the Committee during the year and the Committee has met once between IPO and the publication of this report. 
The Board considers each of the members of the Committee to be independent in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’). The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive and/or other persons may also attend meetings of the Committee 
by invitation but will not be present when matters relating to their own remuneration are discussed. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference which are available to shareholders on request 
and on the Company’s website (www.tiautomotive.com). Its role includes:
 – setting the Remuneration Policy for all Executive Directors of the Company, the Chairman of the Board and senior management;
 – within the terms of the Remuneration Policy and in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and/or Chief Executive Officer, 
as appropriate, determine the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director, Non-Executive Director and the 
Chairman including bonuses, incentive payments and share option or other share awards;
 – approve the design of, and determine targets for, the ABP and LTIP and approve total annual payments made under such schemes; and
 – ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual, and the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
In carrying out its duties the Remuneration Committee takes into account any legal and regulatory requirements, including the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the UK Listing Rules. Determining the fees of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman as a whole.
Advisers to the Committee 
The Committee receives advice and guidance on Executive Directors’ remuneration from the Chief HR Officer, and the Company 
Secretary in respect of the UK Corporate Governance Code and share schemes. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee and ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its Terms of Reference and provides regular 
updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK.

  As part of the successful IPO, awards were granted on Admission to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to recognise their contribution to the 
business in the lead up to Admission. William Kozyra and Timothy Knutson were provided with a cash award of €2,500,000 and €1,666,667 respectively. 
In addition, a one-off reimbursement of €857,457 and €454,897 for the CEO and CFO respectively was paid. 
3
  As part of the reorganisation of the share capital of the Company prior to the IPO, the Executive Directors agreed to waive their interests in options previously 
granted in 2015 to them in connection with the acquisition of the Group by funds managed by Bain Capital (the ‘Historic Pre-IPO Options’). As a result, the 
Historic Pre-IPO Options were cancelled, and ordinary shares with an equivalent economic value were issued to the Executive Directors as consideration for 
such cancellation. At the time of issue, these ordinary shares had a market value, at Offer Price, of approximately €21.9 million for Mr Kozyra and €10.9 million 
for Mr Knutson. (If the value of these shares is included as remuneration in 2017, total remuneration for 2017 would have been €29.9 million and €16.1 million, 
respectively.)
4
  A portion of the Historic Pre-IPO Options vested in 2016 having a value of €2.0 million for Mr Kozyra and €1.0 million for Mr Knutson, based on 2016 fair market 
valuation and using a € to £ exchange rate of 0.88.
5
  In conjunction with the IPO, Mr Wennemer received a bonus payment of €1,022,722 and Mr Carson, Mr Smith and Mr Vanneste each received a bonus 
payment of €340,909. Each of these Directors use the net (after tax) proceeds of their bonus to purchase shares at the offer price.
6
  Paul Edgerley and Stephen Thomas represent funds managed by Bain Capital, the Company’s largest shareholders, and are not remunerated and receive 
no payment from the Company with respect to their qualifying services as Non-Executive Directors.
7
  Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s share schemes and are not eligible to join a Company pension scheme. 
Executive Directors’ pension (audited information)
See table above for Executive Directors pension information. Neither of the Executive Directors are entitled to a defined benefit pension.
Executive Directors
Annual bonus for 2017 performance (audited)
In respect of the 2017 financial year, the bonus awards payable to the Executive Directors were agreed by the Remuneration 
Committee having reviewed the Group’s results. Bonus awards in 2017 were based on a share of Adjusted EBITDA, payable at a 
rate of 0.75% and 0.5% to William Kozyra and Timothy Knutson, respectively. Based on the above, in the year to 31 December 2017 
annual bonus awards of €3,681k ($4,417k) will be paid to William Kozyra and €2,453k ($2,944k) will be paid to Timothy Knutson, 
based on Company reporting Adjusted EBITDA of €490.7m. 
The 2017 bonus scheme was put in place prior to the IPO with the entire bonus to be paid in cash, consistent with previous year’s 
practice as a private company. The structure of the 2018 bonus scheme is set out in the Remuneration Policy.
Payments to past Directors 
During the year, the Company has not made any payments to past Directors; neither has it made any payments to Directors for loss 
of office.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to benefits or pension arrangements in 2018, with the exception of the defined contribution match 
cap increasing by €188 (exchange rate €1 = $1.2).
Annual bonus (‘ABP’)
The operation of the bonus plan for 2018 will be consistent with the framework detailed in the Remuneration Policy section of 
this report. The maximum opportunity for the year ending 31 December 2018 will be 300% of salary for all Executive Directors. 
Up to the first 100% of salary will be paid in cash, with the remainder of any bonus payment under the ABP deferred into an award 
of shares to be held for two years and will also be subject to malus and clawback provisions as detailed in the Policy. 
The proposed target levels are challenging with performance conditions comprising of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and 
Taxes (40%), Adjusted Free Cash Flow (40%) and Strategic Measures (20%). Specific targets will not be disclosed because the 
Remuneration Committee consider forward-looking targets to be commercially sensitive. However, the Committee intends to 
disclose these retrospectively in next year’s Remuneration report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
LTIP Awards
It is intended the Executive Directors will receive an LTIP award in 2018 of 300% of salary (which can increase to 133% 
if outperformance is achieved), i.e. 400% of salary in total.
Consistent with the framework detailed in the Remuneration Policy section of this report the performance measures (and weighting) 
of the 2018 LTIP are Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share Growth (80%), Relative Adjusted Total Shareholder Return versus the FTSE 
250 (20%). The sole outperformance measure for up to 133% of maximum is Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share Growth.
The Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share Growth performance conditions are 4% Compound Annual Growth Rate at Threshold 
which will vest at 20% of Maximum; and 10% Compound Annual Growth Rate which will vest at Maximum. Vesting will occur 
on a straight-line basis between Threshold and Maximum.
The Relative Adjusted Total Shareholder Return performance conditions are Median Rank at Threshold which will vest at 25% 
of Maximum; and Upper Quartile Rank at Maximum. Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis between Threshold and Maximum.
The Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share Growth outperformance condition is 12% Compound Annual Growth Rate, which will trigger 
an award of 133% of the award earned under the previous two performance measures.
All measures are assessed over a three-year performance period.
The LTIP contains malus and clawback provisions. Please refer to page 48 for further details.
External Board appointments
Subject to Board approval, the Company will permit its Executive Directors to hold non-executive positions outside of the Company 
that complement and enhance their current role. Any fees received by the Executive Director may be retained by the Director. 
William Kozyra has been a non-executive at American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc since January 2015 and he retains fees 
in respect of this appointment. Fees for the year 2017 were €197,935 including an equivalent value of restricted shares.

Directors’ report
continued The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group and Parent Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 – state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Parent Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Parent Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in the Board of Directors section of this report confirm that, 
to the best of their knowledge:
 – the Parent Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and loss of the Company;
 – the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
 – the Strategic Review includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Parent Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

of Directors on 29 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, TI Fluid Systems plc’s (‘the Group’) group financial statements and Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
and Company statements of cash flows, and the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; 
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in Note 31 to the financial statements, we have not provided any other non-audit services to the Group 
or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Audit 
scope
Key audit 
matters
 – Overall group materiality: €11.0 million (2016: €7.0 million), based on 5% of profit before tax, 
adjusted for exceptional items.
 – Overall company materiality: €8.9 million (2016: €4.9 million), based on 1% of net assets.
 – There were no significant components within the Group;
 – We performed full scope audit work on 15 components (2016: 16 components) and specified procedures 
over certain balances on eight components (2016: eight components). Areas that are centralised at the US 
and UK head offices have been audited by the group audit team; and
 – This provided coverage of 66% (2016: 65%) for revenue, 61% (2016: 66%) for operating profit, 
and 82% (2016: 83%) for net assets.
 – Warranty provision (Group).
 – Goodwill and intangible assets impairment (Group).
 – Accounting for hedging arrangements (Group).
 – Deferred tax asset recognition and provision for uncertain tax positions (Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the Group, which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit 
procedures at group and component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise 
to a material misstatement in the Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, 
the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to component teams. Our tests included, 
but were not limited to, enquiries of management, review of correspondence with legal advisors, review of component auditors’ 
work and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit 
procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  65

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the Auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the Auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results 
of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Warranty provision
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 42, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting policies including 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) and Note 27 
(Provisions).
The Group is exposed to warranty claims in the event that 
its products fail to perform to specifications. Warranty provisions 
are made to cover potential exposures that relate to specific 
customer claims. The warranty provision at 31 December 2017 
to cover potential exposures on existing claims is €19.8 million 
(2016: £21.0 million).
As the settlement of specific issues is dependent on the 
customer, complexity of the issue and the negotiation process, 
the outcome of claims is often difficult to predict and quantify. 
Due to this, warranty provisions involve significant judgement.
We focused on the judgements made by management in 
assessing the likelihood and quantification of material exposures. 
Our procedures were designed to ensure reasonableness of 
the warranty provision included:
 – Understanding the nature of the specific claims through 
discussions with management and review of correspondence 
with the customers;
 – Assessing management’s evaluation of the likelihood and 
quantum of exposure which is based on the terms of the 
contract with the customer, underlying issue with the relevant 
product and the status of negotiations with the customer;
 – Discussions with senior divisional executives and personnel 
involved in the negotiation of the specific issues and making 
enquiries to ensure all material open issues have been 
assessed for warranty provisions;
 – Review of internal management reporting to ensure all 
material open issues have been considered for completeness 
for warranty provisions;
 – Discussions with Executive Directors to understand the status 
of negotiations on the specific issues; and
 – Challenging management and the executive directors on the 
reasonableness of the warranty provision based on information 
available and evaluating possible scenarios of settlement of 
the issues.
Based on the work performed the warranty provisions are 
reasonable in the context of the status of the open claims.
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 42, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting policies) and 
Note 14 (Intangible assets).
The Group holds goodwill of €724.9 million (2016: €767.2 million) 
and intangible assets of €549.0 million (€645.6 million) as at 
31 December 2017.
All cash generating units (CGUs) containing goodwill must be 
tested for impairment annually. Assets are grouped at a CGU 
level, the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows. The determination of CGUs and the recoverable 
amount requires judgement by management in both identifying 
and valuing the relevant CGUs.
There are judgements and estimates involved in management’s 
impairment review including cash flow forecasts, discount rates 
and long-term growth rates. A change in these assumptions can 
result in a material change in the valuation of the assets.
We reviewed management’s impairment model and 
focused our audit on the key judgements and estimates. 
Procedures performed included:
 – In respect of the identification of CGUs, we confirmed 
that this is the lowest level at which management monitors 
goodwill for internal purposes and that it is consistent with 
the way in which the Group’s results are reported to the 
Board and the Executive Team;
 – Testing the underlying calculations in management’s 
impairment model and agreeing the cash flow forecasts 
to the latest medium-term plan approved by the Board;
 – Evaluating the reasonableness of forecast cash flows by 
ensuring consistency with the latest Board approved medium-
term plan, discussions with the Group’s commercial and 
financial management, challenging material changes to the 
forecasts year on year, assessing reasonableness of growth 
assumptions with reference to market information and 
assessing the accuracy of historical cash flows to build in 
reasonable sensitivities into our overall impairment assessment;
 – Engaging our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness 
of discount and long-term growth rates considering the risk 
profiles of the CGUs being tested for impairment; 
 – Evaluating management’s sensitivity analyses to ascertain 
the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
and performing independent sensitivity calculations to quantify 
the downside changes to management’s models required to 
result in an impairment; 
 – For FCS Latin America, assessing the carrying value under 
the fair value less costs of disposal model to further support 
the carrying value; and
 – Assessing the appropriateness and completeness of the related 
disclosures in Note 14.
We noted no material exceptions and considered management’s 
key assumptions supporting the asset values to be reasonable. 
The related disclosures are deemed acceptable. 66

Accounting for hedging arrangements
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 42, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting policies), 
Note 3 (Financial risk management), and Note 25 
(Fair values of financial assets and liabilities).
The Group has exposure to movements in interest rates 
and exchange rates and uses financial derivatives to mitigate 
the risk of these exposures.
Significant judgement and estimation are involved in assessing 
whether the financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
and in determining the fair value of forward exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps. The fair value of forward exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps is determined by discounting 
the future cash flows using market rates prevailing at the 
reporting date. 
We engage subject matter experts to consider the accounting 
treatment of new and continuing derivative arrangements 
including a review of the appropriateness of the disclosures 
included in the financial statements.
Our procedures to audit the appropriateness of hedge accounting 
included the following procedures, on a sample basis:
 – Reviewing hedge documentation to ensure compliance 
with IAS 39;
 – Reviewing the hedge effectiveness tests performed by 
management to ensure the hedging arrangements meet 
the criteria for the application of hedge accounting; and
 – Independently valuing the derivative fair values.
We have considered management’s accounting, valuation 
and presentation of derivative financial instruments and have 
not noted any material issues
Deferred tax asset recognition and provision for uncertain 
tax positions
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 42, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and 
Note 12 (Income Tax).
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to 
tax laws in a number of jurisdictions. The Group has recognised 
provisions against uncertain tax positions, the valuation of 
which is an inherently judgemental area. At 31 December 2017, 
the Group has recorded provisions of €44.1 million in respect 
of uncertain tax positions (2016: €53.6 million).
At 31 December 2017, the Group has recognised €51.0 million 
(2016: €69.9 million) of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet, 
the recognition of which involves judgement and estimates by 
management as to the likelihood of their realisation. The 
expectation that the benefit of the assets will be realised is 
dependent on a number of factors including appropriate taxable 
temporary timing differences and whether there will be sufficient 
taxable profits in future periods to support recognition. 
In conjunction with our tax specialists, we evaluated and 
challenged management’s judgements in respect of estimates 
of tax exposures to assess the reasonableness of the Group’s 
tax provisions. This included obtaining and evaluating certain 
third party tax opinions that the Group has obtained to assess 
the appropriateness of any assumptions used. 
In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, 
we considered recent correspondence with relevant tax 
authorities, complexity and developments in the tax environment 
in the relevant territories and positions taken by the Group in the 
tax returns. We assessed the appropriateness of provisions 
recorded in the financial statements, or the rationale for not 
recording a provision, by using our specialist tax knowledge, 
reading the latest correspondence between the Group and the 
various tax authorities and advisors. 
These procedures assisted in our corroboration of management’s 
position in respect of significant tax exposures, and with our 
assessment that the disclosures and provisions recorded in the 
financial statements, including whether any provisions sufficiently 
addressed probable penalties and interest, were appropriate and 
reflected the latest developments in the reporting standards.
We evaluated the Directors’ assessment as to whether there 
will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support the 
recognition of deferred tax assets by evaluating the future cash 
flow forecasts, and the process by which they were drawn up, 
including testing the underlying calculations and comparing the 
forecasts to historical performance. 
Based on the evidence obtained we considered the level of 
provisioning for uncertain tax positions, recognition of deferred 
tax assets recognised and the related disclosures are acceptable 
in the context of the Group financial statements taken as a whole. 
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
The Group operates across four geographical territories of Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America and two divisions 
of Fluid Carrying Systems (FCS) and Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems (FTDS). Each division consists of a large number of components 
spread across a number of countries. Overall, the Group operates in 118 manufacturing locations across 28 countries. 
We did not identify any individually significant components within the Group. We scoped our work to ensure that overall we have 
sufficient coverage to express the required opinion in compliance with applicable Auditing Standards. In 2017, we have revised the 
components in scope for a full-scope audit to ensure we cover components with specific risks, and rotate the components in scope 
to cover a number of components over time.

TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
We have performed full scope audits on the financial information of 15 components (2016: 16 components) and specific audit 
procedures based on risk and materiality on the financial information of eight components (2016: eight components). Areas that are 
centralised at the US and UK head offices, including hedging arrangements, goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment and 
accounting for head office companies have been audited by the group audit team. This is supplemented by analytical procedures across 
the remainder of the Group. The coverage for both the current and prior year is sufficient for us to comply with auditing standards.
Where component auditors performed work, we determined the appropriate level of involvement we needed to have in that audit 
work to ensure we could conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained for the Group financial statements 
as a whole. We issued written instructions to all component auditors and had regular communications with them throughout the audit 
cycle. The group audit team maintained supervision and oversight of the local audit teams, which included review of component team 
reporting, and visits to local audit teams in the US, China, Belgium, Spain and the UK to review relevant working papers and attend 
meetings with local management.
The group audit team has performed the audit of the Company.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality €11.0 million (2016: €7.0 million). €8.9 million (2016: €4.9 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for 
exceptional items.
1% of net assets
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks used in the 
Annual Report, profit before tax adjusted 
for exceptional items is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in 
assessing the performance of the Group, 
and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark. Adjusting for exceptional 
items provides us with a consistent year 
on year basis for determining materiality.
There is no trading activity within the 
Company and net assets is therefore 
an appropriate benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between €1.1 million and €5.2 million. 
We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €550,000 
(group audit) (2016: €350,000) and €450,000 (company audit) (2016: €250,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect 
of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements 
and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. 68

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 (CA06), 
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors’ report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 – The Directors’ confirmation on page 21 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
 – The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 – The Directors’ explanation on page 29 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
 – The statement given by the Directors, on page 61, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
 – The section of the Annual Report on pages 41, 42 and 43 describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit & Risk Committee.
 – The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the Auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06) 69

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 61, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee, the Directors appointed us on 11 September 2015 to audit the 
financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2015 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is three financial years, covering the years ended 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2017.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.1. Basis of Preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the European Union, and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(‘IFRIC’) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these accounts.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the fair valuation of assets 
and liabilities of subsidiary companies acquired, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) 
(including derivative instruments not in hedging relationships).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from 
those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1.4.
1.1.1. Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its consolidated financial statements. The Group therefore continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given 
in Note 24.
1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which each entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The functional currency of each Group company has been 
assessed against the underlying transactions and economic conditions in which it operates.
These financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Group’s presentation currency. All financial information presented 
in euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise.
1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures are set out below:
1.1.3.1. New and Revised IFRS Affecting Amounts Reported in the Current Year (and/or Prior Years)
There are no amendments to standards or new standards where adoption by the Group for the first time has had a material impact 
on the Group’s financial statements for the financial reporting year beginning 1 January 2017.
1.1.3.2. New Interpretation
During September 2017, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income 
taxes. The decision refers to previous agenda decisions regarding what is an income tax and also states that any interest and penalty 
related to income tax should be accounted for in accordance with either IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ or IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent 
liabilities and contingent assets’. Following a review of the Group’s uncertain tax positions and taking into consideration the comments 
from the agenda decision, the Group determined that €4.8m of interest payable related to the uncertain tax positions should be 
reclassified on the balance sheet from the current tax payable account to the interest payable account. Therefore, the balance sheet 
at 31 December 2017 reflects this position. 76

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 issued in November 2009 was revised in July 2014 and finalised the reform of financial instruments accounting. It will supersede 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ in its entirety.
Key requirements of IFRS 9 are:
 – All recognised financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value.
 – The impairment model reflects expected credit losses as opposed to incurred credit losses.
 – The types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments are broader, and the effectiveness test has been revised and is now 
subject to the principle of an economic relationship.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2018 consolidated financial statements is not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ establishes a single comprehensive model to account for revenue arising 
from contracts with customers, and supersedes IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and related interpretations. 
The new standard has a single model to account for revenue. The main implications are:
 – A customer is a party that has contracted with the entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity’s ordinary 
activities, in exchange for consideration.
 – Unlike IAS 18 the recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity investments 
are not within the scope of IFRS 15 and are instead within the scope of IFRS 9.
 – There is a new five-step approach to revenue recognition and measurement:
 - Identify the contract with the customer
 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract
 - Determine the transaction price
 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 - Recognise revenue when the entity satisfies the performance obligations.
 – IFRS 15 has more prescriptive guidance as to how and when revenue should be recognised. Revenue is recognised either at a point 
in time or over time depending on when control transfers.
 – Variable consideration, such as a transaction price affected by discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, 
performance bonuses, penalties and contingency arrangements, is required to satisfy specific criteria to be recognised as revenue.
 – Costs incurred to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract may only be capitalised in certain situations.
 – Extensive disclosures are required to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognised, and revenue that is 
expected to be recognised in the future from existing contracts.
IFRS 15 becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2018 consolidated financial statements. Having reviewed key customer contractual 
frameworks, management have concluded that the new standard will have an immaterial impact on the recognition, measurement 
and timing of revenue, resulting in the majority of the Group’s revenue continuing to be recognised at the point in time customer 
release orders are satisfied. As required by the standard, the Group expects to make additional revenue related disclosures.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC 4, ‘Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains 
a Lease’. IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016, and eliminates the dual accounting model for lessees. The standard removes the 
accounting distinction between finance and operating leases and requires that right-of-use assets and liabilities be created for 
all leases on the balance sheet, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value.
Under the new standard, operating lease charges will be replaced with interest payable and depreciation charges. On an individual 
lease basis, this will result in higher expenses in the Income Statement earlier in the lease term, and correspondingly lower expenses 
later in the lease term. It is expected that application of the standard will have a significant impact on the Group. The full impact of 
future adoption is still being assessed.
IFRS 16 becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2019 consolidated financial statements.
There are no other standards or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group. 78

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
1.2. Consolidation
1.2.1. Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred to the former owners 
of the acquiree for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any equity 
interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany 
transactions that are recognised in assets are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
A list of subsidiaries and their countries of incorporation is presented in Note 4 of the Parent Company’s financial statements. 
The term ‘Group’ means the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and undertakings.
1.2.2. Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, 
under which the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the 
investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in Other Comprehensive Income is recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, both with a 
corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals 
or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an investment in an associate is impaired. 
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment, which is recognised in the Income Statement, as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value.
1.3. Foreign Currencies
1.3.1. Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are converted to the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are converted using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
All transactional foreign currency differences are included in the Income Statement.
1.3.2. Foreign Operations
Foreign operations are those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not euro. For the purposes of consolidation, income and 
expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro at average exchange rates for the year, and assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated to euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. Foreign currency translation differences are recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The average and year-end exchange rates for the Group’s principal currencies were:

1.4. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise judgement in 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. Assumptions and accounting estimates are subject to regular review, governed by Group 
wide policies and controls. Any revisions required to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the revisions are made 
including all future periods affected.
The areas involving critical accounting judgements or estimates which are significant to the financial information are disclosed below. 
These are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial period.
1.4.1. Critical Accounting Estimates
 – Costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit plans are calculated on the basis of a range of assumptions, including discount 
rates, inflation rates, salary growth and mortality assumptions. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis illustrating how 
changes in the principal assumptions would impact the total defined benefit obligation are included in the Retirement Benefit 
Obligations Note. See Note 26.5.
 – Fair value estimates of derivatives are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments, 
which are subjective in nature. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to 
net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the reporting date, which is a proxy for market price. See Note 25.1.
 – The Group is required to estimate income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation of the 
current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences, which arise because of differing accounting and tax 
treatments. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are measured using substantively enacted 
tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and 
tax rules because of its geographic spread and is subject to tax audits, which are often complex and can require several years 
to conclude. Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions for uncertain tax positions. 
As amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent years, 
which may have a material impact on the Group’s Income Statement. See Note 12.
 – Costs of project engineering are capitalised as development intangible assets when there is an indication from a customer or 
market that costs will be recoverable from future business. Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, 
and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Estimates are used in apportioning costs 
that are directly attributable to each development project. Estimates are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability 
of costs is reasonably certain. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised. 
See Note 14.
 – Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. The impairment review requires estimation of the discount rate, long-term growth rate, EBITDA multiple and 
components of forecast cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15.
 – Estimation techniques are employed in the calculation of the amount required to settle product warranty claims, restructuring and 
other provisions, including determining how likely it is that expenditure will be incurred. This can be complex, especially when there 
is a wide range of possible outcomes. Reference is made to contractual considerations, historical data and other relevant factors 
such as specific events with an underlying product. See Note 27.
1.4.2. Critical Accounting Judgements
 – The Group is required to estimate income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation 
of both the current tax liability, and deferred tax assets or liabilities, which arise because of differing accounting and tax treatments 
for temporary differences. Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves the 
exercise of management’s judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which 
the deferred tax assets are recognised. The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules because of its 
geographic spread and subject to tax audits, which are often complex and can require several years to conclude. The total accrual 
for income tax in any year requires the exercise of management judgement in respect of the interpretation of country specific tax 
law and the likelihood of challenge of uncertain tax positions and their subsequent settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised 
unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable. As amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, 
adjustments may be required in subsequent periods, which may have a material impact on the Group’s Income Statement and/or 
cash tax payments. See Note 12.
 – Costs of project engineering are capitalised as development intangible assets when there is an indication from a customer 
or market that costs will be recoverable from future business. Development expenditure is capitalised where the costs can be 
measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and 
the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project and to use or sell the development asset. Assumptions 
underlying these judgements are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the recoverability of costs is reasonably certain. 
See Note 14.
 – As part of the annual impairment review, judgement is required in determining the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) of the Group. 
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which the non-financial assets are monitored for internal management purposes.
 – Judgement is required as to whether or not to apply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance 
sheet. See Note 25.1. 80

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
1.5. Goodwill
Initial measurement
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling 
interests over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the total of consideration transferred, 
non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets 
of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount 
of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated 
to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to impairment testing which is performed annually or when an impairment trigger event 
occurs. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination which generated the goodwill. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then 
to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. CGUs comprise the two operating 
segments each sub-divided into four geographic territories.
Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill 
are not reversed in subsequent periods.
1.6. Intangible Assets
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. 
Development expenditure is capitalised where the costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and 
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the 
project and to use or sell the development asset. Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and overhead 
costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Capitalised development expenditure is measured 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Development expenditure, which does not meet the criteria 
for recognition as an intangible asset, is recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
Computer software and licences
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific 
software. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Land use rights
Licences for the long-term use of land are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire.
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, 
other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current year are as follows:
 – Capitalised development costs  5-10 years (over the life of the production cycle)
 – Computer software  3-5 years
 –Technology   4-8 years
 – Customer platforms  11-25 years
Intangible assets that are under development are not amortised until they are brought into use. They are reviewed for indications 
of impairment to ensure that expectations of future economic benefits remain valid. Where there is any indication to the contrary, 
capitalisation ceases and costs are expensed.

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
1.7. Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)
PP&E is stated at historical cost, which includes expenses directly attributable to bringing assets into productive use including 
finance charges, less accumulated depreciation. Assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the Group are valued at fair value 
as part of the acquisition accounting. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their 
useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. 
When major components of an item of PP&E have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Depreciation of PP&E is calculated using the straight-line method reflecting expected patterns of consumption of the future economic 
benefits embodied in the assets to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
 – Freehold buildings   30-50 years
 – Leased buildings improvements  30-50 years or the period of the lease if shorter
 – Plant, machinery and equipment  3-12 years
Depreciation is not charged on assets in the course of construction. Once completed these are transferred to the relevant category 
above and depreciated accordingly. Spare parts are not depreciated until they are brought into use but are subject to annual 
impairment testing.
Enhancement expenditure of PP&E items is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of replaced parts is de-recognised. 
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals of PP&E are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount, 
and are recognised net within other income in the Income Statement.
Investment grants received against the cost of acquired PP&E assets are included in payables as deferred income and credited 
to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the relevant assets.
1.8. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at CGU level, the lowest level for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have previously been impaired are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
1.9. Leased Assets
Assets held under leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policy applicable to purchased assets of that asset type and depreciated accordingly.
Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The future rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the Income Statement over the lease 
period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Income Statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 82

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
1.10. Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at ‘fair value through 
profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL’)) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL 
are expensed as incurred.
1.10.1. Financial Assets
Financial assets are classified into financial assets at FVTPL, ‘available-for-sale’, and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also 
categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Contracts are marked to market by re-measuring to fair value 
at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that any financial asset is impaired 
because of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, which has an impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency 
in payments, the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data 
indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions 
that correlate with defaults.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that loss events since initial recognition 
of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
1.10.2. Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at ‘FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified at FVTPL when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not 
designated as hedging instruments. The Group enters into conventional derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure 
to foreign exchange rate risks, mostly foreign exchange forward contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are 
disclosed in Note 25. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and 
are subsequently marked to market by re-measuring to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 hedging requirements.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial liabilities not classified at FVTPL, including borrowings, and trade and other payables, are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and 
allocates interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments (including all issuance 
discounts and transactions costs) through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Borrowings
Borrowings, including extensions to existing agreements, are recognised initially at fair value, net of discounts and transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value 
is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Interest arising on 
financial instruments is recognised on an accruals basis.
In assessing whether a debt alteration is to be treated as a modification or an extinguishment and new arrangement, an evaluation is 
made of the qualitative factors such as the underlying parties to the transaction and quantitative factors such as the impact on the net 
present value of remaining cash flows.

1.10.3. Hedge Accounting
The Group enters into derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially 
recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value 
at each Balance Sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, 
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
 – Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge);
 – Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and variability 
in cash flows relating to US dollar borrowings. The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising from its 
borrowings, which fix the interest rate for a portion of the borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement, 
within finance income or expense.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement within finance income 
or expense.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument, relating to the effective portion of the hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income 
Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item 
is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The fair values of derivatives, which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, are classified as current assets or liabilities.
1.11. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including an appropriate proportion of overheads, and net realisable value, on the first 
in first out principle. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs necessary to make the sale.
Tooling that is being manufactured for an external customer or supplier is reported as an item of inventory until invoiced, and represents 
the gross amount recoverable from the customer in respect of costs incurred, less progress payments received.
For productive material, cost is standard cost, and for non-productive material (including consumables) cost is actual cost. The 
standard cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production 
overheads all at standard, based on normal operating conditions. Cash discounts, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the 
costs of purchase. Other costs are included only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing inventories to their present location 
and condition. Provision is made for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
1.12. Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Impairment is recognised when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due under 
the original contractual terms.
1.13. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
1.14. Share Capital
Ordinary shares of the Company are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options 
are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of any tax effects from the proceeds.
1.15. Trade and Other Payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced. Trade and other 
payables are recognised at amortised cost. 84
TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
1.16. Provisions
A provision is recognised if, because of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance expense. Provisions are not recognised 
for future operating losses.
Product warranties
A product warranty provision is recognised when specific events occur with the underlying product. The provision is based on 
contractual considerations, historical warranty data and expected outcomes against their associated probabilities. Specific claims 
are provided for reflecting management’s best estimates of potential exposure.
Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring 
either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Asset retirement obligations
Provisions are recognised for the estimated costs of dismantling and removing PP&E at the end of its operational life. Provisions 
for site restoration in respect of contamination and lease dilapidations are made in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are measured and recognised as provisions. An onerous contract exists where 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received. The provision 
is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing. 
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with the contract.
1.17. Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and volume rebates. Revenue is recognised when adequate evidence exists, usually 
in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, 
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no 
continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are derived from the supply of automotive components where the point of sale is generally 
ex-works from the Group. Where consignment arrangements apply, title to the goods passes depending upon which party is exposed 
to the principal risks and rewards associated with ownership.
Revenue from the supply of tooling, prototypes and product development is recognised at the points of sale as specified in each 
contract. Income from these activities is recognised no later than at completion of contract, except where it is evident that a loss 
will arise in which case the estimated loss on the contract is recognised immediately.
1.18. Other Income and Other Gains and Losses
Other income includes government grants, proceeds from insurance claims, gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets and 
other miscellaneous items. Other gains and losses includes net foreign exchange movements and movements in fair value on foreign 
exchange forward contracts. The Group’s reporting currency is the euro. A significant portion of the Group’s external borrowings are 
denominated in US dollars, and are largely on-lent to subsidiaries in the UK, whose functional currency is the euro. The net foreign 
exchange movement represents the impact of currency movements on intercompany loans after the effect of hedging arrangements.
1.19. Employee Benefits
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. 
Accrued paid absence such as holiday pay entitlement is charged to the Income Statement as earned. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under bonus plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount because 
of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Defined contribution plans
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions. A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts in respect of past service.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee will receive at a later date, usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, periods of service and compensation. Defined benefit arrangements in the Group include funded and unfunded 
pension plans, post-employment healthcare, statutory termination indemnities and long service awards.
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
(‘DBO’) at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present 
value of the DBO, an asset is recognised only to the extent of future economic benefits accruing to the Group either as cash refunds 
or as a reduction in contributions.
The service cost of providing benefits for funded plans accruing during the year and any past service costs are charged as an 
operating expense. The interest cost or credit arising from the unwinding of the discount on the net actuarial liability or asset is 
recognised in the Income Statement as finance expense or income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the year in which they arise.
The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms 
of the related benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans – funded
The Group operates funded pension plans in the US, Canada and UK. The US plans are subject to annual actuarial review, whilst 
the others are formally valued at least triennially. Assets are held in trusts and are separately administered from the Group’s activities. 
Assets include readily marketable equities, bonds and funds and qualifying insurance policies and are valued at fair value. The Group 
makes contributions based on actuarial advice sufficient to meet the liabilities of the plans.
Defined benefit plans – unfunded including healthcare
The Group operates unfunded employment benefit plans in certain countries of which the most significant are post-employment 
healthcare in the US, a closed arrangement, and pension plans in Germany. Other liabilities include statutory termination indemnities 
and long service awards.
Share-based compensation
The fair value of equity settled payments to employees is determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model and the expense is recognised in the Income Statement on the straight-line basis over the period that the employees become 
entitled to the awards. The credit entry relating to the awards is recorded in equity (Note 7).
The Group reviews the estimate of the number of shares expected to vest at each balance sheet date. The total amount expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, including any market performance and any non-vesting conditions, 
and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions. Non-market performance and service 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
1.20. Income Tax
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Uncertain tax positions
The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude. 
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions, which require estimates for each matter and the 
exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic positions. Management 
uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks. Where appropriate, estimates 
of interest and penalties are included in these provisions. As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, 
subsequent adjustments may arise which have a material impact on the Group’s tax rate and/or cash tax payments.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the 
countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profits. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 86
TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred 
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances on 
a net basis.
1.21. Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size and expected frequency, warrant separate 
additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group. 
These may include the costs of closure of locations or significant headcount reduction, costs arising from the acquisition or disposal 
of businesses including related contractual management incentive charges, transaction costs of a significant and non-recurring 
nature, debt-refinancing costs including early redemption premiums on voluntary repayments of borrowings, impairment charges, 
share option costs prior to the initial public offering, and the recognition of previously derecognised deferred tax assets.
1.22. Dividends
Receivable
Dividends from associates and other investments of the Group and dividends receivable by the Company are recognised when 
the right to receive payment is established.
Payable
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity in the period in which 
they are approved.
1.23. Deferred Income
Deferred income is recorded when consideration for goods or services provided by the Group is received before the revenue 
is recognised.
2. Segment reporting
Notes to segment reporting
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group’s segment reporting is based on the management 
approach with regard to segment identification; under which information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker 
(‘CODM’) for decision making purposes is considered decisive. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily on the basis of revenue, 
Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBIT, both non-IFRS measures.
Two operating segments have been identified by the Company: Fluid Carrying Systems (‘FCS’) and Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems 
(‘FTDS’).
Fluid Carrying Systems (‘FCS’)
FCS products include brake and fuel lines and bundles, tank top lines, vacuum booster lines, quick connectors, air-conditioning 
tube and hose assemblies, accumulators and receiver dryers, coaxial or tube-in-tube assemblies, thermal products and powertrain 
components. There is a high degree of vertical integration from the creation of steel strip from rolled steel, through tube 
manufacturing to the assembly of finished products.
Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems (‘FTDS’)
FTDS products include plastic fuel tanks, fuel filler pipes, fuel pumps and modules, level sensors and additive dosing systems. 
These products are sold as original equipment and in the aftermarket.
Allocation of corporate costs
Corporate costs comprise costs of stewardship of the Group. Costs incurred in administrative services performed at the corporate 
level are allocated to divisions in line with utilisation of the services. Where direct allocation is not possible, costs are allocated based 
on revenue for the year.

3. Financial Risk Management
The Board of Directors and key management have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk 
management policies, which are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group’s capital structure (comprising of debt (Note 24) and equity (Note 20)) is regularly monitored to safeguard its ability 
to continue as a going concern and to provide returns for shareholders and value added benefits for other stakeholders. The overall 
debt structure of the Group is designed to meet the strategic objectives of the Company and its shareholders. The level of debt 
is monitored on an actual and projected basis to ensure compliance with the covenants in the Group’s main borrowings facilities.
The Group has exposure to the following significant risks from its activities:
3.1. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The following categories comprise the main credit exposures of the Group:
 – Trade and other receivables
 – Cash and cash equivalent balances
 – Derivatives or other financial instruments
The credit risk for trade and other receivables is normally managed by the operating subsidiaries by reference to credit rating agencies 
and historic trading experience with customers (further details are available in Note 18).
Cash, which is surplus to normal working capital needs and any approved capital investments in the operating subsidiaries, 
is managed by Group Treasury.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policies and managed by Group Treasury. In most cases, the 
counterparties are investment grade banks. The portfolio of derivatives is spread across six counterparties with no one dominant 
financial institution. The credit ratings of the financial institutions used are Baa2 or better.
Guarantees issued by third parties comprise letters of credit and other bank guarantees, nearly all of which are of a stand-by nature. 
Most of the issuing banks are rated investment grade and these ratings are monitored. If any of these banks became unable to meet 
their obligations under a guarantee, it is expected that a similar guarantee could be issued by another bank or alternative security 
provided to the beneficiary.
3.2. Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. The Group has 
access to various forms of funding and these are considered sufficient to meet anticipated liquidity requirements. The Directors 
believe that there is currently no significant risk that the Group will be unable to fund its planned commitments.
Cash flow forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to ensure there is sufficient cash and undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities to meet operational needs of the Group over the medium term. Surplus cash generated by the 
operating entities over and above balances required for normal working capital and any approved investment is managed by 
Group Treasury. 90

3. Financial Risk Management continued
3.3. Market Risk
Market risk, is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income, expenditure or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The Group enters into derivative contracts, and incurs 
financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
3.3.1. Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on revenue, purchases, investments and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currencies of individual Group entities, which are primarily euro, US dollars, Chinese renminbi and Korean won. 
Where possible, business entities sell in prices denominated in the same currency as the majority of their costs, to produce a natural 
hedge. At the reporting date, the majority of cash and cash equivalents in the Group were denominated in Chinese renminbi, euro 
and US dollars.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage much of the residual transactional currency risk.
Derivative instruments used by the Group to manage foreign currency exposure fall under the following main categories:
Forward foreign exchange contracts – not designated in hedge relationships
The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was €135.9 million (31 December 2016: €186.9 million) and the aggregate 
fair value was €1.3 million payable (31 December 2016: €3.1 million payable).
Forward foreign exchange contracts – designated in cash flow hedge relationships
In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts and US dollar interest rate swaps with 
a number of financial institutions. In aggregate, these instruments converted a portion of the drawings under the main borrowing 
facilities of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%. The nominal value of the forward 
foreign exchange contracts in this arrangement as at 31 December 2017 was €616.6 million (31 December 2016: €642.3 million), 
and their aggregate fair value was €54.0 million payable (31 December 2016: €20.0m receivable). A fair value loss of €66.8 million 
(31 December 2016: €18.4 million gain), was recorded in other comprehensive income in the year, and a €76.3 million loss 
(31 December 2016: €30.7 million gain) was subsequently recycled to the income statement. An ineffectiveness loss of 
€3.2 million (31 December 2016: €1.9 million loss) was recorded in the Income Statement (Note 11).
Forward foreign exchange contracts – designated in net investment hedges
In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net investment in the Group’s 
Korean won subsidiary. The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was KRW 265,893 million (€186.2 million) 
(31 December 2016: KRW 265,893 million (€186.2 million); and their aggregate fair value was €10.0 million payable (31 December 2016: 
€6.9 million payable). A fair value loss of €3.2 million (31 December 2016: loss of €0.1 million) was recorded in other comprehensive 
income in the year for these contracts. No amounts were recycled during the year and there was no ineffectiveness.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group is primarily exposed to changes in euro/KRW exchange rates on its hedging derivatives and associated net investments 
and euro/US dollar exchange rates on its borrowings and associated hedging instruments.
The Group’s exposure to a +/- 1% change in euro/KRW exchange rate would be a €0.3 million profit/€0.3 million loss arising from 
those euro/KRW contracts that do not qualify for investment hedge accounting. Those euro/KRW contracts that qualified for hedge 
accounting impact equity; however, that movement would be offset by a substantially equal and opposite movement arising from 
the Group’s exposure to the net investment in KRW subsidiaries.
The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in the euro/US dollar exchange rates arises from US dollar denominated intercompany 
financial instruments, which are partially offset by forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges held at the 
Balance Sheet date. The profit and loss impact associated with these hedges and the related financial instrument exposure is not 
significant due to the application of hedge accounting.
The Group’s net Income Statement exposure to euro/US dollar contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the net 
unhedged intercompany loans subject to euro/US dollar risk is also insignificant. The sensitivity of the income statement to changes 
in the euro/US dollar exchange rate has significantly reduced compared to the sensitivity at 31 December 2016, of a €3.6 million 
profit/€3.6 million loss per 1% change in the euro/US dollar exchange rate. This is due to a large reduction in the Group’s unhedged 
US dollar denominated intercompany loans in the year, which were partially settled from the proceeds of the issue of new share capital.
The Group’s Income Statement exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not significant.

3.3.2. Interest Rate Risk
Most of the Group’s interest rate risk arises on its main external borrowing facilities. The interest expense arising from the secured 
term loans, denominated in US dollars and euro, are based on floating rates of respectively, one month US dollar LIBOR (minimum 
0.75%) +2.75% p.a. and three month EURIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +3.0% p.a. The interest expense arising from unsecured US dollar 
notes has a fixed coupon of 8.75%. On 23 January 2018, the Group met certain additional borrowings criteria which enabled it to 
further reduce the interest rate payable on the US term loan by 0.25% p.a. to US$ LIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.5% p.a., 
and the euro term loan by 0.25% p.a. to EURIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.75% p.a., both effective from 30 December 2017.
Interest rate swaps
As noted above, the Group has used interest rate swaps to manage the risk and used such contracts, together with the forward 
foreign exchange contracts to fix in €355.0 million of debt at 4.2%. The notional value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 
2017 was $400.0 million (31 December 2016: $400.0 million) and their fair value was €7.0 million receivable (31 December 2016: 
€5.2 million receivable). In aggregate, a fair value gain of €1.9 million (31 December 2016: €1.9 million loss) has been recorded 
in other comprehensive income during the year and a €0.7 million loss (31 December 2016: €2.9 million loss) was subsequently 
recycled to the income statement. No ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement.
Interest rate floors
The aggregate fair value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2017 was €3.9 million payable (31 December 2016: €4.5 million payable).
Sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 bps higher or lower with all other variables held constant, after taking account of hedging arrangements, 
the pre-tax profit or loss on an annual basis would be respectively, €3.7 million lower, or €3.0 million higher. There would be no 
significant impact on equity.

7. Share-based Compensation
The Omega Holdco II Ltd 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the ‘Plan’) was adopted on 30 June 2015 under which the Company granted 
options over its shares to selected key executives of the Group. The contractual life of an option is 10 years. The options are split 
equally between those with time-based vesting features and those with both time-based and performance-based vesting features. 
Time-based options have a five-year vesting period with 20% of the options vesting on the first anniversary of a grant made under 
the Plan and 1.6667% monthly thereafter. Performance-based options have the same vesting period as time-based options, subject 
to certain performance conditions occurring such that the sponsor, the ‘funds managed by Bain Capital’ (affiliates of and funds 
advised by Bain Capital LLC) achieves two times cash proceeds relative to its equity investment, provided that such return is 
measurable in cash or marketable securities.
Exercise of an option is subject to certain employment and other related conditions. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes 
option-pricing model.
At the start of the year total share options outstanding were 35,495,935. During the year 2,667,097 were granted and 980,550 
forfeited up to the Initial Public Offering (the ‘IPO’).
Prior to the IPO, the Plan was cancelled by form of an agreement with all option holders. At cancellation option holders were 
compensated by a mix of shares issued or replacement awards in the form of Restricted Stock Awards (‘RSA’) or Restricted Stock 
Units (‘RSU’).
A total of 2,623,412 RSAs and 1,054,838 RSUs were granted and outstanding at the end of the year and represent the only 
remaining element of the share incentive scheme. These replacement awards will vest in 50% equal allocations on 1 December 2018 
and 1 December 2019, subject to the participants continued employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Replacement Awards have been Fair Valued at date of replacement and compared to the Fair Value 
of the Plan options on cancellation. No incremental additional charge was required. The remaining share option cost will be charged 
over the vesting period of the Replacement Awards.
The total charge for the year for share option awards was €11.3 million (2016: €7.4 million). This included an accelerated cost 
€5.9 million on the cancellation of the Plan. All share option costs, including accelerated costs, up to the point of IPO are included 
in exceptional administrative expenses (Note 9), post IPO share option costs are treated as an operating expense. 94

the Income Statement and €15.0 million of exceptional deferred tax charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to reflect 
the new US corporate tax rate of 21% and other tax reform changes, offset by €0.6 million of one-time transition tax on accumulated 
foreign earnings. 95

Deferred tax assets originating from tax loss carry forwards mainly relate to Canada and France as at 31 December 2017. Forecasts 
for Canada and France demonstrate several years of continued future profitability and both have consistent expectations of future 
financial performance. As a result management believe that the current tax losses will be utilised.
As a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Group recognised €25.4 million of exceptional deferred tax benefit in

withheld on dividend, interest and royalty remittances totalling €7.3 million (2016: €3.8 million).
Factors that may affect future tax charges include the continued non-recognition of deferred tax assets in certain territories as well 
as the existence of tax losses in certain territories which could be available to offset future taxable income in certain territories and 
for which no deferred tax asset is currently recognised.

IFRIC agenda decision
During September 2017, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision on interest and penalties related to income 
taxes. The decision refers to previous agenda decisions regarding what is an income tax and also states that any interest and penalty 
related to income tax should be accounted for in accordance with either IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ or IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent 
liabilities and contingent assets’. Following a review of the Group’s uncertain tax positions and taking into consideration the comments 
from the agenda decision, the Group determined that €4.8 million of interest payable related to the uncertain tax positions should be 
reclassified on the balance sheet from the current tax payable account to the interest payable account. Therefore, the balance sheet 
at 31 December 2017 reflects this position.
Uncertain tax positions
The Group maintains a provision for uncertain tax positions. At 31 December 2017, the balance stands at €44.1 million after 
reclassification of €4.8 million of interest payable (2016: €53.6 million). As each uncertain tax provision is considered more likely 
than not to materialise, settlement of the issues that have been provided should not result in a material impact to the effective tax 
rate. In the event that a favourable/unfavourable conclusion is reached on an uncertain tax position, this would have a favourable/
unfavourable impact on the Group’s effective tax rate.

12.4. Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable. At 31 December 2017, the Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets (net of

14.3. Impairment Tests for Goodwill and Intangibles
The purchase of TIFS Holdings Ltd (‘TIFSHL’) on 30 June 2015, which was the previous Parent Company of the Group, and the 
consequent fair valuation of assets and liabilities, resulted in total goodwill recognition of €711.1 million and intangibles of €663.2 million. 
The purchase of Millennium Industries Corporation on 16 February 2016 resulted in total goodwill recognition of €57.1 million and 
intangibles of €72.6 million (see Note 29).
Goodwill and intangibles are monitored by management at the operating division level and then the geographic sub-division level. 
Goodwill and intangibles amount to €665.5 million and €351.5 million respectively for FCS (31 December 2016: €706.4 million and 
€439.2 million), and €59.4 million and €197.6 million respectively for FTDS (31 December 2016: €60.8 million and €206.4 million).
The geographic split by cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) of goodwill within FCS is: Asia Pacific €237.9 million (31 December 2016: 
€249.5 million), North America €209.2 million (31 December 2016: €238.5 million) and Europe €218.4 million (31 December 2016: 
€218.4 million).
Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life. It is currently carried at cost and reviewed annually for impairment. Intangibles 
assets are amortised over their useful economic life, which range from 3 to 25 years.
The annual impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the non-financial assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable 
amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the non-financial assets of the Group were tested for impairment, with all CGUs demonstrating a recoverable amount 
in excess of their carrying value and therefore no impairment charge has been recorded.
The recoverable amount for the CGUs has been determined based on a value in use calculation. These calculations use post tax cash 
flow projections from financial plans approved by the Board, covering a five-year period, plus a terminal value.
The range of discount and growth rates used were as follows:
Range of rates % 2017 2016
Discount rates
– FCS
– FTDS
11.75–20.25% 
12.00–19.25%
11.00–21.00% 
11.50–18.00%
Long-term growth rates
– FCS
– FTDS
2.50–8.00% 
2.50–6.00%
2.50–8.00% 
2.50–6.00%
For FCS Latin America, management also estimated the carrying value under the fair value less costs of disposal model, using industry 
bench-marked EBITDA multiples. The Group believes that any reasonably probable change in the assumptions would not cause the 
carrying value of non-financial assets within the respective CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount. 102

On 9 October 2017, the Board approved a special resolution to reduce the nominal value of the Company’s shares from £1.00 to 
£0.01 per share. This reduced the ordinary share capital by €488.7 million. This resolution was supported by a statement of the 
solvency of the Company (pursuant to section 641(1)(a) of the Companies Act).
On 25 October 2017, the Company’s entire ordinary share capital was listed on to the premium listing segment of the Official List of 
the FCA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities under the ticker ‘TIFS’. As part of the listing, 
the Company issued 148,333,333 ordinary shares of new share capital at an Offer Price of 255 pence per ordinary share, which 
raised €424.6 million (£378.3 million) before issuance costs.
On Admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, the Company also issued 20,657,233 ordinary shares as consideration for 
the cancellation of certain outstanding option awards granted to certain members of the Group’s management team under historic 
share plans. The Company also issued a further 365,016 ordinary shares to certain Non-Executive Directors.
On 16 January 2018, the Company undertook a court-approved capital reduction, which had the effect of cancelling the share 
premium account of €404.3 million and increasing the balance on accumulated profits by the same amount.
The Company is a public limited company which is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, with registered number 09402231. 106

24.4. Main Borrowing Facilities and Unsecured Notes
2015 agreements
The 2015 agreements comprise a package of secured loans (consisting of a term loan, an asset-backed loan, and a revolving credit 
facility) and unsecured senior notes.
The amounts outstanding under the agreements are:
 2017
€m
2016
€m
Principal outstanding:
US term loan 707.5 998.0
Euro term loan 317.7 320.9
Main borrowing facilities (term loan) 1,025.2 1,318.9
Unsecured senior notes 183.6 427.1
Total principal outstanding 1,208.8 1,746.0
Issuance discounts and fees (31.3) (51.9)
Main borrowing facilities and unsecured notes 1,177.5 1,694.1
The term loan initially comprised tranches of $1,065.0 million and €325.0 million. On 31 October 2017, the Group voluntarily repaid 
$194.0 million (€166.5 million) of its US term loan. No penalties were incurred as a result of the early payment. The principal 
outstanding of the US term loan in US dollars at 31 December 2017 is $849.7 million (2016: $1,051.7 million).
The US dollar tranche bore interest at US$ LIBOR (minimum 1.0% p.a.) +3.5% p.a., and the euro tranche bore interest at euro LIBOR 
(minimum 1.0% p.a.) +3.5% p.a. until 27 January 2017. On 27 January 2017, the Group concluded a repricing of its term loans. As a 
result of the repricing, the interest payable on the US dollar term loan was reduced to US$ LIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.75% p.a., 
and the interest payable on the euro term loan was reduced to EURIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +3.0% p.a.
The US dollar tranche was repayable in amounts of $2.7 million per quarter until 31 October 2017. On 31 October 2017, the Group 
made a voluntary repayment of this loan of $194.0 million as a result of which no further capital payments are due on the US dollar 
tranche until the balance falls due on 30 June 2022. The euro tranche is repayable in amounts of €0.8 million per quarter, with the 
balance also falling due on 30 June 2022.
On 23 January 2018, the Group met certain additional borrowings criteria which enabled it to further reduce the interest rate payable 
on the US term loan by 0.25% p.a. to US$ LIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.5% p.a., and the euro term loan by 0.25% p.a. to 
EURIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.75% p.a., both effective from 30 December 2017.
The initial principal amount of the unsecured senior notes was $450.0 million. On 10 October 2017, the Company announced 
a tender offer to redeem up to 51% of the Group’s unsecured senior notes. The tender offer was accepted by the noteholders and 
the Company redeemed $229.5 million (€197.1 million) of these notes on 31 October 2017. As part of the offer, an early redemption 
premium, in accordance with the terms of the senior notes, was made to the noteholders of $20.6 million (€17.7 million) in exchange 
for the offer. The aggregate principal amount of the unsecured senior notes at 31 December 2017 is $220.5 million (2016: $450.0 million). 
The notes carry an 8.75% coupon payable bi-annually (on a 360-day year basis) commencing on 15 January 2016, and are 
redeemable in full on 15 July 2023.
On 6 October 2015 the Group entered into hedging transactions with a number of financial institutions which effectively converted 
borrowings of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%, thereby reducing foreign 
currency exposure for future cash flows and locking in lower long-term euro fixed interest rates (Note 3.3.2).
Initial issuance discounts and fees of €63.3 million arising from the 2015 agreements were capitalised in 2015. Following the repricing 
of the term loans on 27 January 2017 (accounted for as a modification to existing agreements), new fees capitalised in the year ended 
31 December 2017 were €1.6 million; bringing the total fees capitalised under the 2015 agreements to €64.9 million. All capitalised 
fees are expensed using the effective interest rate method over the remaining terms of the facilities. As a result of the voluntary 
repayments of the US term loan and unsecured notes in October 2017, an additional acceleration of unamortised issuance fees was 
expensed in the income statement in the year of €8.7 million.
The asset-backed loan (‘ABL’) provides up to $100.0 million depending upon the level of inventories and trade receivables in 
the Group’s US and Canadian businesses. The facility is also available to be used to issue letters of credit on behalf of TIGAS LLC. 
Drawings under the facility bear interest at US$ LIBOR +1.75% p.a. unless the drawings are below $50.0 million when the rate 
is US$ LIBOR +1.5% p.a. The revolving credit agreement provides a facility of up to $125.0 million. Drawings under this facility bear 
interest in a range of US$ LIBOR +3.0% to US$ LIBOR + 3.5% p.a. depending on the Group’s leverage ratios. Both facilities are due 
to expire on 30 June 2020. 109

Fair value estimates of derivatives are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments, which 
are subjective in nature. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present 
values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the reporting date, which is a proxy for market price. 111
TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Fair values of financial instruments have been determined by reference to a hierarchy defined as follows:
 – Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 – Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All derivative items reported are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy specified in IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; their measurement 
includes inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of non-derivative amounts are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques based on 
discounted cash flow analysis. For the non-derivative items reported above, it is assumed that by their nature their carrying value 
approximates their fair value, with the exception of unsecured notes included within borrowings. At 31 December 2017, the 
borrowings figures above include unsecured notes carried at a book value of €183.6 million before deduction of issuance discounts 
and fees. The fair value of these notes excluding deduction of issuance discounts and fees is €196.0 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: book value of €427.1 million and fair value of €448.5 million). These fair values are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 
specified in IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.

26. Retirement Benefit Obligations
26.1. Defined Benefit Arrangements
Pension plans
The Group operates funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and the UK under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. 
All of the plans provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of pensions 
provided is determined by members’ length of service and, for most of these plans, pensionable remuneration. Plan assets are held 
in trusts from which all benefit payments are made. The plans are governed by local regulations and practice, including the nature of 
the relationship between their trustees and the Group. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment strategy and 
schedules of contributions, rests primarily with the trustees, some of whom who are appointed by the Group and the remainder by 
the members in accordance with the rules of each plan.
There are five plans in the US, four of which are closed to both new entrants and future accrual, and one of which is closed to new 
entrants but permit future accrual. The active members are not required to make contributions to the plans. Pensions in payment are 
not subject to inflationary increase. The plan in Canada remains open to new entrants, and is contributory. Pensions in payment are 
subject to discretionary inflationary increase. The UK plan is closed to new entrants but remains open to future accrual. Pensions 
in payment are subject to annual increase based on the UK Retail Price Index.
Independent accounting valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out as at 31 December 2017. 
The US pension plans are subject to annual actuarial valuation, and were most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as 
at 1 January 2017. The Canadian plan is subject to actuarial valuation at least triennially, and was most recently formally valued as at 
1 July 2017. The UK plan is subject to triennial actuarial valuation, and was most recently formally valued as at 6 April 2015. Employer 
funding contributions to the US and other pension plans are agreed at each formal valuation, and for the year ended 31 December 2017 
totalled €5.1 million (31 December 2016: €2.7 million). Contributions for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018 are expected to 
amount to €5.6 million.
In this note the US plans are shown separately as ‘US pensions’, and the Canadian and UK plans are aggregated as ‘other pensions’.
Post-employment healthcare
The Group operates post-employment medical benefit schemes in a small number of territories, principally the US where the scheme 
was closed to new entrants in 1992. These schemes are unfunded. The US scheme is subject to annual actuarial valuation, and was 
most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2017. In this note the US scheme is shown separately as 
‘US healthcare’, and the other healthcare liabilities are aggregated within ‘other post-employment liabilities’.
Other post-employment arrangements
The Group operates certain other pension and retirement plans primarily in Germany, France, Italy, Korea, Poland and Belgium, where 
obligations are either partially funded or unfunded. In this note these plans are aggregated within ‘other post-employment liabilities’.

26.5. Principal Assumptions
The principal assumptions in measuring plan liabilities are as follows:
US Pensions 2017 2016
Discount rate 3.56% 4.02%
Mortality assumptions: life expectancy from age 65
Retiring at the end of the current reporting year:
Males 22 21 
Females 23 23
Retiring 20 years after the end of the current reporting year:
Males 23 23 
Females 24 24 
For US Pensions, assumptions with regard to life expectancies from retirement at age 65 are based on RP-2014 collar- and gender-
specific mortality tables, adjusted and generationally projected by a modified MP-2017 improvement scale.
Other pensions 2017 2016
Discount rate 2.70% 3.08% 
Inflation rate 2.90% 3.16% 
Salary increases 2.96% 3.34% 
Benefit increases 2.32% 2.62% 
Mortality assumptions for other pensions: life expectancy from age 65
Retiring at the end of the current reporting year:
Males 22 22
Females 24 24
Retiring 20 years after the end of the current reporting year:
Males 22 23
Females 25 25
US healthcare 2017 2016
Discount rate 3.50% 3.95%
Healthcare cost trend: Initial rate 6.25% 6.50%
Other post-employment liabilities 2017 2016
Discount rate 2.10% 2.03% 
Inflation rate 1.29% 1.56% 
Salary increases 2.44% 2.50% 
Benefit increases 1.96% 1.90% 
Changes in the principal assumptions would decrease/(increase) the total defined benefit obligation (DBO) as follows:
Decrease/(increase) in DBO
Change in 
assumption
2017 2016
Increase
€m
Decrease
€m
Increase
€m
Decrease

Discount rate 0.5% 30.2 (34.7) 30.1 (34.5)
Inflation rate 0.5% (8.2) 7.6 (7.4) 7.4
Salary growth rate 0.5% (2.5) 2.3 (2.1) 1.9
Life expectancy 1 year (15.0) 15.0 (15.6) 15.5
Healthcare cost trend: Initial rate 0.5% (3.0) 2.7 (4.2) 3.7
The sensitivity analysis above illustrates the change in each major assumption whilst holding all others constant. The methods 
of calculating the defined benefit obligation for this purpose are the same as used for calculating the end of year position. 118

26.6. Pension Plans – Risk Analysis
Asset volatility Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If plan assets 
were to underperform this yield, this would create a deficit. All the funded plans hold a proportion of equities, 
which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, but which are also likely to experience greater 
price volatility and therefore risk in the short term. As plans mature, the Group’s strategy is to reduce the 
level of investment risk by investing more in assets whose risk profile is a better match for the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields has the effect of increasing plan liabilities, although this is partially offset 
by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk The Group’s pension obligations in Canada, the UK and Germany are inflation linked. Caps on the level 
of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against above normal inflation. The US pension 
obligations are not inflation indexed. The majority of the plan assets are not directly inflation indexed, 
meaning that an increase in inflation will tend to increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of each retired member and his/her 
spouse, so increases in life expectancy result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The investments of the funded plans are managed within an asset-liability matching framework that has been developed to achieve 
long-term investments that align with the obligations of the plans. One objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by 
investing in annuities and long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due in the 
appropriate currency. The plans actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments match the expected 
cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The processes used to manage the risks have not changed from previous years.
Investments are diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level 
of assets. A large portion of assets consist of bonds and equities, although the plans also hold investment funds and liability driven 
investments. Equities have been shown to offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.

29. Acquisitions
29.1. Acquisition of Millennium Industries Corporation
On 16 February 2016, the Group completed a transaction to acquire 100% of the ordinary share capital of Millennium Industries 
Corporation, a US-based provider of powertrain fuel rails and engine compartment components.
The acquisition was reported with fair values as below:
Notes
16 February

€m
Consideration 126.2
Intangible assets 14.2 72.6
Property, plant and equipment 15.1 11.2
Trade and other receivables 11.2
Inventories 14.5
Cash and cash equivalents 1.2
Trade and other payables (11.6)
Deferred income tax liabilities (30.0)
Net assets acquired 69.1
Total goodwill 14.1 57.1
The fair value of consideration was $139.0 million (€126.2 million) of cash paid, or €125.0 million net of cash acquired. There is 
no contingent consideration applicable to the transaction. The goodwill is attributable to the workforce and the profitability of the 
acquired business.
The Company applied purchase accounting to the acquisition and consolidated the activities of Millennium from the date of acquisition. 
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
29.2. Accounting for Acquisitions
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The Group applies the acquisition 
method to account for business combination.
The consideration transferred to the former owners of the acquiree for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value 
of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. Intercompany transactions 
and balances between Group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are 
recognised in assets are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
Fair values on acquisition
The fair values of intangible assets were estimated using various income approaches including the multi-period excess earnings 
method (customer platforms and aftermarket customer relationships) and the relief from royalty method (trade names, trademarks 
and technology).
Under the multi-period excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental 
after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, 
fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty 
rate to the revenue estimate. These intangible assets enable the Company to develop new products to meet the evolving business 
needs as well as competitively produce its existing products.
The fair value of rental properties and property, plant and equipment acquired was based on the consideration of their highest and 
best use in the market. A combination of sales comparison and cost approaches were used in determining the fair value of rental 
property. The fair values of property, plant, and equipment, other than rental properties, were based on the consideration that unless 
otherwise identified, they will continue to be used ‘as is’ and as part of the ongoing business. A combination of cost and market 
approaches was used to determine the fair values of property, plant and equipment.

counsel, appropriate provisions have been made to cover the related risks. While the outcome of any proceedings in progress cannot 
be predicted, the Company does not believe they will have a material impact on the Group’s financial position. 122

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.1. Basis of Preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the European Union, and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) 
interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these accounts.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from 
those estimates.
1.1.1. Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its financial statements. The Company therefore continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency
These financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented 
in euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise.
1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures
A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, or are not yet effective and have not been applied in preparing the Company’s financial statements. These are 
discussed further in the consolidated financial statements.
1.2. Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are converted to the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are converted 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
All transactional foreign currency differences are included in the Income Statement.
The average and year-end exchange rates for the Company’s principal currencies are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
1.3. Investments in Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when 
the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity.
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost. The investments are subject to a periodic 
impairment review, with any resulting diminution of the carrying value recognised in the Income Statement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.
1.4. Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at ‘fair value through 
profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL’) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL 
are expensed as incurred.
1.4.1. Financial Assets
Financial assets are classified into financial assets at ‘FVTPL’ and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification is determined at the time 
of initial recognition and depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified at FVTPL when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not designated 
as hedging instruments. 127
TI Fluid Systems plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The Company’s 
loans and receivables comprise ‘loans due from related parties’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that any financial asset is impaired 
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset which has an impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency 
in payments, the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate 
that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that 
correlate with defaults.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that loss events since initial recognition 
of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
1.4.2. Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at ‘FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified at ‘FVTPL ’ when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not designated 
as hedging instruments.
Other financial liabilities
All other financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Other financial liabilities including ‘loans due to related parties’ and trade and other payables, are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates 
interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs 
and premiums) through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
1.5. Trade and Other Payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced. Trade and other 
payables are recognised at amortised cost.
1.6. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
1.7. Share Capital
Ordinary shares of the Company are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options 
are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of any tax effects from the proceeds.
1.8. Taxation
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred 
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 128

1.9. Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size and expected frequency, warrant separate additional 
disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Company. These may include the 
costs of closure of locations or significant headcount reduction, costs arising from the acquisition or disposal of businesses including 
related contractual management incentive charges, transaction costs of a significant and non-recurring nature, debt refinancing costs, 
impairment charges and the recognition of previously derecognised deferred tax assets.
1.10. Dividends
Receivable
Dividends from investments of the Company and dividends receivable by the Company are recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established.
Payable
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity in the period in which 
they are approved.
2. Income Statement
