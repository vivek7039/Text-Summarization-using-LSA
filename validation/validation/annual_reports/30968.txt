4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We are pioneers in harnessing 
bacteria as a novel and 
revolutionary class of medicines: 
Live Biotherapeutics
World-class science is the foundation of medical discovery. To turn this into life-changing 
medicines: that requires something more. T o turn this into a whole new class of medicines: 
that requires something special. We are building something special at 4D pharma.
Live Biotherapeutics have the potential to transform the way in which many diseases 
are treated. But to realise that potential, the sector needs robust clinical data. We are 
well positioned to deliver that data.
In 2017, we laid foundations that have positioned 4D to transform the sector; with four 
clinical programmes set to deliver data and a number of development programmes 
heading towards the clinic, 4D will play the lead role in defining the sector.
What makes us different? We understand that bacteria in the human intestine – known 
as the gut microbiome – have an important function in health and disease, but importantly 
– we understand how they function, and how they function as a drug.
Understanding how they function means that our Live Biotherapeutics are potentially 
providing new and effective treatments for IBS and Crohn’s Disease and game-changing 
treatments for cancer, asthma and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and multiple sclerosis.
4D and the Live Biotherapeutics we develop have the potential to transform 
the way in which many challenging diseases are treated.

Live Biotherapeutics – disruptive new medicines
Live Biotherapeutics are a regulated, emerging 
and disruptive new class of medicines, which 
have the potential to transform the way 
in which we treat many diseases. 
Our Live Biotherapeutics are strains 
of gut commensal bacteria which 
have been originally isolated from 
healthy humans. These are then 
cultured and grown before being 
encapsulated, administered orally 
and delivered selectively to the gut 
where they exert their therapeutic 
effects on the patient.
Beyond gastrointestinal disease
Live Biotherapeutics are delivered to the 
gut, but can have far-reaching effects at 
anatomically distant sites of the body. 
Gut bacteria have evolved to manipulate 
the human immune system and we are 
harnessing this to develop Live Biotherapeutics. 
Utilising this, we are developing Live 
Biotherapeutics for diseases as diverse as 
cancer and asthma and even conditions 
of the central nervous system such as 
Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. 
Why mechanism matters
Human gut bacteria contain thousands 
of genes. Understanding which of these 
genes – and their products – interact with 
the human body in a beneficial way is key 
to identifying new Live Biotherapeutics. 
Our scientists have deep expertise in 
microbiology, immunology and bioinformatics, 
which allows us to select our candidates 
based on an understanding of interactions 
at the molecular level.

Highly attractive safety profile
Toxicity and unwanted side effects are a 
constant challenge in drug development. 
Safety concerns account for more than 
50% of drug programme terminations 
and can also lead to sub-optimal treatment 
regimens, a concern for both patients 
and clinicians.
Our Live Biotherapeutics are originally 
isolated from healthy human donors and 
consequently have excellent safety profiles. 
This allows us to safely expedite our 
products into the clinic, getting them to 
the patients that need them more rapidly.

STRATEGIC REPORT An integrated biopharma company
MicroRx – our proprietary discovery platform
Our discovery platform, MicroRx, allows us to rapidly 
identify strains of gut bacteria which may have a 
therapeutic effect in specific diseases. Using MicroRx, 
we interrogate our proprietary library of more than 6,000 
bacterial strains for pathway-specific effects on the 
host immune system. Importantly, we understand 
mechanism. We elucidate the mechanisms by which 
our Live Biotherapeutics exert their effects with exquisite 
detail, including the identification of bacterial effector 
molecules and their cognate human receptors. 
Unlike traditional drug discovery, which involves multiple 
rounds of hit and lead optimisation to identify a clinical 
candidate – a process which can take a number of 
years – we can progress from concept to clinic-ready 
product in as little as 24 months, helping us get our 
therapies to patients who need them more rapidly.
In-house development and manufacturing
We have a 1,500m2 GMP-certified development and 
manufacturing facility with the capacity to produce up 
to 100 million capsules of product per year. Our team 
has decades of expertise in anaerobic fermentation, 
and the know-how to scale and produce our Live 
Biotherapeutics ready for clinical testing and beyond.
Clinical operations
Our expanded clinical operations team is in place to 
manage our multiple clinical studies as we advance 
through the clinic. By the end of 2018, we plan to have 
four clinical programmes underway in parallel and with 
programmes in areas such as multiple sclerosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis in the final stages of development.

Strategic objectives
Since the Group’ s initial public offering, 4D 
has grown rapidly to become a world leader 
in the development of Live Biotherapeutics, 
an “end-to-end” microbiome company, from 
research to development and manufacture.
Our research teams continue to further the 
understanding, both of our programmes and 
their mechanisms, and of the microbiome 
generally. The past twelve months have seen 
the validation of MicroDx, our diagnostic 
platform enabling the stratification of IBS 
patients. Our GMP-certified facility in León, 
Spain, has enabled the development scale-up 
for our candidate strains and has increased 
clinical/production capacity to up to 100 
million capsules per annum. Meanwhile our

STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Executive Officer’s Report
In 2017, 4D has made significant 
progress towards its goal of 
delivering Live Biotherapeutics 
as safe and effective therapies
4D’s approach
If we step back and look at what 4D is 
trying to do (namely to bring to market 
not only new drugs but a new therapeutic 
modality), it is not an easy task. The FDA 
approved only 22 new drugs in 2016 and 
only eight of those were first in class. 
Nevertheless, we believe 4D is well 
positioned to achieve its goals.
With any new drug, whether or not first in 
class, or new modality there is risk. Any 
new drug or modality brings concern over 
safety, and it is rightly the top priority for the 
industry and regulators. More than 50% of 
traditional drug programme failures can be 
attributed to safety. 
Notwithstanding this, given the pull for new 
or better medicines, industry and investors 
are prepared to accept such risks and, as we 
have recently seen with the interest in CAR-T 
therapies, successfully bringing a new 
therapeutic class to market can deliver 
significant value to investors.
It is widely believed that Live Biotherapeutics 
and the microbiome will go some way to 
address such risks, by bringing a different 
approach to treatment regimes and to 
disease, and doing so safely. This puts a 
high expectation on Live Biotherapeutics 
and the field of microbiome research, 
and to date the field has fallen short 
of this expectation.
Building upon our work and investment 
in research, clinical progression and 
manufacturing capability, we believe 4D is 
well positioned to change this. During 2017 
we have laid the groundwork to take our 
products into patients across a host of 
disease areas with the aim to provide 
robust clinical data to demonstrate the 
potential of Live Biotherapeutics.
Current clinical programmes
We have worked with regulators and clinicians, 
both in Europe and the United States, to 
develop Blautix, our clinical programme in 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (“IBS”). Building 
on the patient data from the phase I trials, 
which both reinforced the safety of our 
Live Biotherapeutics and highlighted promising 
efficacy signals, we believe Blautix to address 
a key underlying cause of the disease and 
not just the symptoms, as is the case with 
current available treatments.
Consequently, we are looking to address 
the IBS subtypes (IBS-C (constipation) and 
IBS-D (diarrhoea)) in our upcoming phase II 
trial. Targeting commencement of dosing in 
the second half of 2018, the trial will be 
conducted in both Europe and the United 
States. The trial will look to dose up to 500 
patients, to give sufficient power to indicate 
efficacy, as well as providing further insights 
into a disease which is estimated to affect 
over 10% of the global population, but, 
irrespective of its prevalence, is not yet 
well understood.
We have completed dosing in the phase I 
study of Thetanix, our clinical programme 
in Paediatric Crohn’s Disease, and we will 
report the outcome of this study in the 
coming months. Moving to the next stage 
of the development of Thetanix, we have 
decided to initially focus our efforts on the 
adult population. The rationale for this is 
that, whilst the need for a safe and 
effective paediatric solution remains high, 
it is a reflection of the severe nature of the 
disease that our recruitment for the phase 
Ib trial was slow, with a number of eligible 
patients screened experiencing flare before 
they could enter the trial. 
We will explore opportunities to remain 
active with this group of patients and 
continue to involve those patients and 
clinicians we have been working with.
The Thetanix phase II study will recruit adult 
Crohn’s Disease patients and we anticipate 
making regulatory submissions for this 
study in the second half of 2018.
Oncology and other pending 
clinical programmes
An area of increasing interest in the 
microbiome field, and one 4D has long 
focussed on, is oncology.
In late 2015 our proprietary MicroRx 
discovery platform identified a bacterium, 
MRx0518, that had shown efficacy in 
pre-clinical cancer models. Through 2017, 
we have concentrated on two areas of 
MRx0518 development, firstly unpicking 
the mode of action and secondly preparing 
for clinical studies.
We believe understanding mechanism 
is critical to the development of Live 
Biotherapeutics as a therapeutic class; 
we do not believe the field can continue to 
take an “ecobiotic” approach to therapeutics, 
simply relying on a correlation of the presence/
absence of bacteria. We aim to understand 
how the bacteria influence disease by using 
MicroRx to pick out strains that have a 
functional effect on pathways that are known 
(by clinicians, regulators and industry alike) 
to be associated with disease. As recently 
announced, 4D has highlighted key aspects 
of the mode of action of MRx0518, identifying 
a specific component of the bacteria that 
stimulates pathways known to be associated 
with the body’s response to cancer; these 
findings are to be investigated further in 
upcoming clinical trials.
05 4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
4dpharmaplc.com
S Chief Executive Officer’s Report continued
on both microbiome and metabolite profiles, 
and the commonalities of the microbiome 
across all IBS subtypes. This observational 
study was completed in August and we 
are now well advanced in preparation for a 
larger, multi-centre trial, to further validate 
this work, at sites in the UK, Ireland and 
the US.
In tandem with research, we have focussed 
on developing our intellectual property estate, 
the largest in the microbiome sector, to 
help secure and consolidate our leading 
position in the field, having at year end 
207 granted patents and 320 patent 
applications, from 32 patent families. 
To enable this focus, we have had to 
postpone our desire to publish our work, 
but now, having gained a market-leading 
intellectual property position, over the 
coming year we will be actively seeking to 
publish our research in leading publications 
and at conferences.
Financial summary
In the year to December 2017, our cash 
and cash equivalents and short-term 
deposits reduced from £68.8 million to 
£50.0 million, with a loss before tax of 
£24.0 million (compared with £11.7 million 
in the year to December 2016), though this 
included £3.5 million of non-recurring costs 
arising from the revaluation of the contingent 
consideration on Cork after it achieved the 
first milestone. Our claim for research and 
development tax credit was £3.5 million 
(compared with £1.8 million in the year 
to December 2016).
Our cash burn for the year was in line with 
expectation, reflecting among other things 
the increased costs of taking our existing 
clinical programmes forward, and preparing 
our next wave of programmes for upcoming 
phase I and II trials.
In a similar way to the development of our 
cancer programmes, we are continuing 
to advance our programme in asthma. 
Targeting regulatory submission for the 
study in Q3 2018, 4D will investigate the 
use of MRx0004 in a phase I/II study in 
asthma patients with poorly controlled 
symptoms. The trial will primarily investigate 
the safety of MRx0004 and will additionally 
have a suite of secondary endpoints to give 
an indication of efficacy.
Development
Key to the success of our programmes is 
the ability to deliver therapies to patients. 
During 2017 4D further upgraded its 
development and manufacturing facility in 
León in Spain, and it is now a standalone 
fully operational GMP-certified facility for 
the production of Live Biotherapeutics.
The team at León has now provided 
multiple batches of clinical material across 
a number of programmes and, with 4D’s 
development team, is working on the 
development and scale-up of the next 
strains coming through the R&D platform.
Research and intellectual property 
Coming full circle back to research, and 
from where 4D started, our scientific teams 
continue to lead in the understanding of 
mechanisms of action of our existing 
programmes, to discover new potential 
disease areas of interest, and to support 
our clinical efforts.
2017 was particularly significant in the 
development of our understanding of how 
the microbiome and metabolite profiles of 
patients can be used in both the diagnosis 
of disease and the identification of patients 
likely to respond to our Live Biotherapeutics. 
In March 2017, we reported interim clinical 
data demonstrating our ability to differentiate 
IBS patients from healthy individuals based 
Oncology and other pending 
clinical programmes continued
Our approach to the clinical development 
of MRx0518 encompasses parallel studies 
to evaluate safety, efficacy and anti-tumour 
immunity in the monotherapy and 
combination settings.
Our first trial in oncology is a monotherapy 
study investigating the effect of MRx0518 
on patients with solid tumours in the 
neoadjuvant setting. We are treating patients 
between diagnosis, where a biopsy is taken, 
and resection, with a follow-up post-surgery.
In addition to the safety data this trial will 
generate for MRx0518, the study will provide 
4D the opportunity to investigate the impact 
on MRx0518 on a “clean” immune system. 
Patients enrolled in the study will have early 
stage disease and thus their immune system 
will not have been previously exposed to 
cycles of other cancer therapies. The early 
stage of intervention in this trial further 
demonstrates the lower risk our Live 
Biotherapeutics represent in terms of safety, 
but also provides potential insights into how 
MRx0518 may influence treatment regimes 
post-surgery.
Working with leading institutions as 
partners, such as Imperial College as well 
as the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 
Houston, one of the world’s most respected 
institutions focussed on cancer patient care 
and research, our work in oncology has led to 
the development of strategies to understand 
the potential of Live Biotherapeutics, whether 
as a single agent, adjuvant or in combination.
Furthermore, our involvement with these 
groups and in this space has led us to look 
at the potential of addressing other diseases 
associated with the side effects of cancer 
treatment with our Live Biotherapeutics, 
further demonstrating the impact we 
believe Live Biotherapeutics can have 
in the oncology space.

STRATEGIC REPORT Outlook 
Throughout 2017, 4D made significant 
progress towards its goal of producing 
Live Biotherapeutics as safe and effective 
therapies. Over the next twelve to 24 months, 
the Group will, through its clinical programmes, 
seek to lead the way in generating robust 
clinical data to support the use of this new 
class of drugs across multiple indications.

via patient stratification and provide better 
patient outcomes. 
Focus areas
4D focusses on understanding the 
functionality of Live Biotherapeutics and 
the mechanisms by which they affect host 
biology and influence disease, and to do 
so across a number of disease areas, to 
broaden the impact of the microbiome.
Rapid cost-effective development
Description
4D seeks to dramatically reduce the 
development timelines of its programmes by 
reference to traditional pharma, establishing 
accelerated development processes for 
its Live Biotherapeutics. 4D targets its 
programmes to be ready for patient trials 
within 24 months from concept.
Performance
4D exploits the enhanced safety profiles of 
therapeutics that originate from a healthy 
human. This reduces pre-clinical testing 
and lead optimisation timelines, and allows 
first-in-man clinical studies in patients as

4D was born out of innovation and this 
continues to be a cornerstone of the Group 
and in 2017 we continued to invest in people, 
facilities and technology. Our strategic aim 
is to commercialise Live Biotherapeutic 
products and as such a comprehensive 
portfolio of intellectual property is vital to 
the Group’ s ability to achieve this. The Group’ s 
portfolio of intellectual property is therefore 
a valuable asset and a significant amount of 
resource has been allocated to strengthening 
this portfolio during the year.

During the year the Group has continued to grow 
and with this growth the management and mitigation 
of risk has become more important. In line with the 
development of the business we have continued to 
develop our internal systems of risk management.
4D operates within a complex regulatory environment, which 
is subject to change. The nature of Live Biotherapeutic product 
development exposes us to a number of additional risks and 
uncertainties which could affect our ability to meet our strategic 
goals, our business model and our operating environment. 
The Board is accountable for carrying out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, and has developed a risk 
management framework which provides the structure within which 
the principal risks affecting our business are managed and sets the 
tone, culture and appetite for risk. 
The key objectives for this process are to ensure that the risk 
appetite of the Board is embedded throughout the Group and fully 
understood by all members of the team who have responsibility 
for managing the risk and making key business decisions. This will 
then be encoded in systems of internal controls, which will seek 
to mitigate the principal risks that could affect the strategy and 
operation of our business model and finally to ensure that identified 
risks are reported to the relevant stakeholders in a timely manner. 
We are continuously developing and improving our risk 
management process through ongoing review and evaluation of 
the risks, clarifying our risk appetite and reviewing the longer-term 
viability of the business to make sure that we fully understand our 
risks and are managing them appropriately. These systems can 
be summarised as follows:

S Why is it important?
A third-party patent could be granted that affects 
a 4D technology or product. This could lead to us 
having to negotiate a licence, seeking to revoke the 
patent in legal proceedings, or even being unable to 
commercialise the future product, materially affecting 
future revenues. 
Third-party patents could limit the Group’s freedom to operate
Current mitigating actions
4D is diligent in carrying out searches to 
identify potential third-party IP; a comprehensive 
freedom to operate strategy has been developed 
and implemented to ensure that no blocking 
patents owned by third parties are unexpectedly 
granted. The third-party patent landscape is under 
continuous review. The Group has developed 
and continues to develop comprehensive and 
wide-ranging filings of detailed patents across 
the Group’s technology portfolio. There have 
been a significant number of patents granted 
since the inception of 4D (including US and 
European patents on each of the lead projects) 
with a substantial year-on-year growth of the 
portfolio and an increasing number of new 
applications filed. 
Change in level of risk
 No change
Why is it important?
Live Biotherapeutic products are a novel and 
emerging technology; neither 4D nor anyone 
else has taken a product through development 
to the marketplace. We are currently working 
on a number of wholly owned development 
programmes of our pipeline which will provide the 
Group with the opportunity to self-commercialise. 
Failure to complete development activities to plan 
may impact on the Group’s ability to bring products 
to market on time which would affect the timings of 
future revenues and hinder the Group’s ability to 
deliver its strategic goals. 
Product development in a breakthrough technology could encounter 
unforeseen delays to programmes
Current mitigating actions
As we complete each stage of development 
and move through the clinic, we broaden our 
understanding of how to bring Live Biotherapeutic 
products to market. In addition, as we widen 
our programmes in different disease areas, 
we further mitigate the risk of failure of a single 
programme. While Live Biotherapeutic products 
are novel, the associated regulatory and clinical 
pathways are based on existing frameworks. 
During the year we have continued to make 
significant investments in our clinical team and 
we plan for this to continue in 2018 as we head 
into the clinic for both phase I and phase II trials. 
Change in level of risk
 Decrease
Why is it important?
In any business, but particularly in a business 
growing so readily in terms of staff and sites and 
in an emerging field, it is vital that we know that 
our systems are secure and efficient to protect 
our data and ensure efficient collaboration. 
Security and resilience of our IT systems and data
Current mitigating actions
We commissioned a review of our systems 
in 2016 and in 2017 these were successfully 
rolled out across the Group. These systems 
provide the Group with a secure, efficient 
platform through which we are able to share 
information and collaborate effectively across 
all sites and with external partners.

4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12
STRATEGIC REPORT Why is it important?
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets 
are highly regulated by government authorities 
in the UK, the US and Europe. These regulatory 
requirements are a major factor in determining whether 
a substance can be developed into a marketable 
product and the amount of time and cost associated 
with such development. Even if products are approved, 
they may still face subsequent regulatory difficulties 
which could result in delays and therefore financial loss. 
Failure to gain regulatory approval
Current mitigating actions
We have continued to invest in the clinical 
and regulatory team during the year. 
Change in level of risk
 Decrease
Why is it important?
Although 4D reports its results in Sterling, a significant 
proportion of our operations trade in local currency 
and as such the Group has a large exposure to 
the Euro and to a lesser extent the US Dollar. 
Fluctuations in these currencies could therefore 
impact the Sterling operating costs and therefore 
the cash flows of the Group. 
Current mitigating actions
We constantly monitor currencies and their 
movements against Sterling. As the Group 
is currently pre-revenue the exposure affects 
the cost of operations and although the size of 
the exposure is significant we have sufficient 
cash resources to manage these changes 
and have planned these prudently into our 
forward forecasts. 
Change in level of risk
 No change
Exchange rate movements
Why is it important?
The UK decision to leave the EU could have a 
significant impact on the way the Group operates, 
both in terms of our foreign subsidiaries, overseas 
suppliers and in eventual revenue from any products 
which get to market. At the moment we are not 
certain of the impact that this will have on trade tariffs, 
taxation, the impact on the nature of international 
trade including access to trade and the exchange 
rate which affects the relative cost and income 
that will be recognised in the accounts and in 
future planning.
Current mitigating actions
As the Group is currently pre-revenue the impact 
is currently limited to fluctuations in costs and 
as a result of the exchange rate and any cross 
border tariffs. Through constant monitoring 
of the situation the Group remains reactive 
and looks to adjust its policies accordingly to 
minimise any adverse factors resulting from 
the ongoing negotiations. The Group reviews 
its cash flow projections for changes in exchange 
rates and the impact it would have and manages 
its holdings in funds accordingly.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE This section of the Annual Report 
describes the Group’s corporate 
governance structures and 
processes and how they have 
been applied during the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
The Company’s ordinary shares have 
been admitted to trading on AIM of the 
London Stock Exchange and the Company 
is subject to the continuing requirements 
of the AIM Rules. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code sets out the principles 
of good practice in relation to corporate 
governance which should be followed by 
companies with a full listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. Although the Company 
is not required to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code by virtue of 
being an AIM-quoted company, the Board 
seeks to apply the QCA Corporate 
Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size 
Quoted Companies (“QCA Guidelines”) 
to the extent appropriate and practical 
for a company of its nature and size. This 
section provides general information on the 
Group’s adoption of the QCA Guidelines.
Board composition and responsibility
The Board consists of four Directors, two of 
whom are Non-Executive. The names of the 
Directors, together with their biographical 
details, are set out on page 14.
The Board has determined that Thomas 
Engelen is independent in character and 
judgement, and that there are no relationships 
or circumstances which could materially 
affect or interfere with the exercise of his 
independent judgement. Thomas previously 
provided ad hoc consultancy services to 
the Company’s subsidiary 4D Pharma 
Research Limited which were consequential 
to his former role as one of its Non-Executive 
Directors. Such services ceased in early 
2015, prior to 4D Pharma Research Limited 
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary, and 
the Board does not believe that such 
historical services compromise his 
independence in any way.
The Board has determined that David 
Norwood is not independent, by virtue 
only of his holding of ordinary shares in 
the Company, summarised on page 23. 
The Board has nevertheless determined 
that (save only for his holding of ordinary 
shares) there are no relationships or 
circumstances which could materially 
affect or interfere with the exercise of 
his independent judgement. 
The Board remains satisfied with its 
composition and the balance between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
which allows it to exercise objectivity in 
decision making and proper control of the 
Group’s business. The Board notes the 
recommendation in the QCA Guidelines 
that a company should have at least two 
independent non-executive directors and 
should not be dominated by one person 
or a group of people. The Board believes 
it meets this recommendation, save only 
in respect of the holding of ordinary shares 
in the Company by David Norwood.
Decision making
The Board’s primary objective is to focus 
on adding value to the assets of the Group 
by identifying and assessing business 
opportunities and ensuring that potential 
risks are identified, monitored and controlled. 
Material issues are reserved to a decision 
of the Board, including approval (and 
review of performance) of the Group’s 
strategic aims and objectives; approval 
of the annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets (and any material 
changes to them); approval of all financial 
statements and results; and maintenance 
of a sound system of internal control and 
risk management. The implementation 
of Board decisions and day-to-day 
operations of the Group are delegated 
to Executive Directors.
Corporate Governance Statement
Chairman’s introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present our Corporate Governance 
Statement for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Since the Company’s initial public 
offering, as the Company and the Group 
have grown, the Board has maintained 
a regular review and evaluation of its 
effectiveness, and that of the wider 
governance structure of the Group. 
As an AIM-quoted company, the 
Company is not required to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board has nevertheless always 
sought to apply policies and procedures 
which reflect the principles of good 
governance and best practice reflected 
in the Code, as appropriate to the size, 
nature and stage of development of 
the Company. 
We believe the Company’s governance 
structure has facilitated the growth and 
development of the Group. However, 
as set out in the Corporate Governance 
Statement, as the Group continues to 
grow, we will maintain this evaluation and 
take the governance steps necessary to 
support the Group’s development. 
David Norwood
Non-Executive Chairman

G Decision making continued
The Board meets both at regular 
intervals and also at short notice to 
consider specific matters (for example 
proposed material transactions). The Board 
receives appropriate and timely information 
prior to each meeting, with a formal agenda 
and Board and Committee papers being 
distributed several days before meetings 
take place. Any Director may challenge 
Group proposals, and decisions are 
taken democratically after discussion. 
Any Director who feels that any concern 
remains unresolved after discussion may 
ask for that concern to be noted in the 
minutes of the meeting. Any specific 
actions arising from such meetings are 
agreed by the Board and then followed 
up by management.
The Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy and bring strong, independent 
judgement, knowledge and experience to 
the Board’s deliberations. The Directors are 
given access to independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense when the 
Directors deem it is necessary in order for 
them to carry out their responsibilities.
The Group has effective procedures in 
place to deal with conflicts of interest. 
The Board is aware of other commitments 
of its Directors, and changes to these 
commitments are reported to the Board.
Appointment and re-election 
of Directors
All Directors of the Company have 
been appointed (or re-appointed) by 
shareholders; the Chairman was appointed 
to the Board by resolution of the shareholders 
of the Company on 5 February 2014 (prior 
to the admission of the Company shares 
to trading on AIM on 18 February 2014), 
and will offer himself for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting of 
the Company.
Corporate Governance Statement continued
Each of the Directors is subject to 
retirement by rotation and re-election in 
accordance with the articles of association 
of the Company. All Directors appointed 
by the Board are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment. 
Board evaluation 
Given its composition and flexibility, the 
Board has been able, since the admission 
of the Company’s shares to trading on 
AIM, to maintain a regular evaluation of its 
effectiveness and that of its Committees. 
It is believed that the Board and its 
Committees have functioned well 
throughout this period, meeting with 
appropriate regularity and with Directors 
free to voice differing opinions. In particular, 
the Board still considers its composition 
to be appropriate (in view of the size and 
requirements of the Group’s business, and 
the need to maintain a practical balance 
between Executives and Non-Executives). 
However, it also considers that the Group 
is nearing the position where the Board 
would benefit from additional independent 
input. The Board is actively considering 
potential candidates for a further 
independent Non-Executive Director. 
Committees
The Board has established an Audit 
and Risk Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee, with formally delegated duties 
and responsibilities. The Board has, since 
the admission of the Company’s shares to 
trading on AIM, kept under regular review 
the possible establishment of a nomination 
committee. The Board remains of the 
view that, given the current composition 
of the Board, it is not appropriate to have a 
nomination committee. This will continue to 
be kept under regular review by the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee 
comprises Thomas Engelen as Chairman 
and David Norwood as the other member 
of the Committee. Thomas Engelen is 
an independent Director and has recent 
and relevant financial experience. The 
Committee has primary responsibility for 
monitoring the quality of internal controls, 
ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Company is properly measured 
and reported on, and reviewing reports 
from the Company’s auditor relating to 
the Company’s accounting and internal 
controls, in all cases having due regard 
to the interests of shareholders. A report 
from the Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee is on pages 18 and 19.
The Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a formal and 
transparent procedure for developing policy 
on Executive remuneration and for fixing 
the remuneration packages of individual 
Directors and senior management. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises 
Thomas Engelen as Chairman and 
David Norwood as the other member 
of the Committee. The Committee reviews 
the performance of the Executive Directors 
and senior management and determines 
their terms and conditions of service, 
including their remuneration and the grant 
of incentives, having due regard to the 
interests of shareholders. A report from the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
is on pages 20 and 21. 
The Board believes that, in accordance 
with the QCA Guidelines, the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee have the necessary character, 
skills and knowledge to discharge their 
duties and responsibilities effectively; 
notwithstanding that (given the overall 
composition of the Board) there is not a 
majority of members who are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Each Committee 
is, however, chaired by an independent 
Non-Executive Director.

Approach to risk and internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining the Group’s systems of 
internal control. The primary responsibility 
for monitoring the quality of internal control 
has been delegated to the Audit and Risk 
Committee. Reference is made to the 
statement on Risk and Risk Management 
on pages 11 to 13.
Communicating vision and strategy
The Directors seek to visit institutional 
shareholders at least twice a year. In addition, 
all shareholders can attend the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting, where there is an 
opportunity to question the Directors as part 
of the agenda, or more informally after the 
meeting. Communication with shareholders 
is seen as an important part of the Board’s 
responsibilities, and care is taken to ensure 
that all price-sensitive information is made 
available to all shareholders at the same time.

G Report of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee acts independently of management to ensure the interests 
of shareholders are protected in relation to financial reporting, internal 
controls and risk management.
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, I am pleased to present our report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. The 
Audit and Risk Committee is a sub-committee 
of the Board and is responsible for reviewing 
all aspects of the financial reporting of the 
business and all aspects of internal control. 
The Committee represents the interests of 
our shareholders in relation to the integrity of 
information and the effectiveness of the audit 
processes in place. 
Key responsibilities 
The Committee acts independently of 
management to ensure the interests of 
shareholders are protected in relation to 
financial reporting, internal controls and 
risk management. 
The principal duties of the Committee are to:
 °
monitor the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting including the review of 
significant financial reporting judgements;
 °
advise the Board on whether, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report and Accounts 
are fair, balanced and understandable;
 °
advise the Board on principal risks, 
their mitigation and risk appetite; 
 °
review the robustness of our risk 
management and internal controls; 
 °
oversee the external audit process 
including monitoring the auditor’s 
independence, objectivity, effectiveness 
and performance; and 
 °
approve any engagement by the external 
auditor outside of the Group’s audit.
The Committee manages the relationship 
with the external auditor on behalf of the 
Board to ensure that the external auditor 
continues to be independent, objective and 
effective in its work, and also considers the 
re-appointment of the auditor each year. 
RSM UK Audit LLP was appointed as 
auditor in 2014 following a comprehensive 
tender process. Each year the Committee 
considers the continued independence of 
the external auditor and the effectiveness 
of the external audit process, to determine 
whether to recommend to the Board that 
the current auditor be re-appointed. 
The Committee has reviewed the external 
audit process in the year through meetings 
and reviewing the reports from the external 
audit team. The Committee has concluded 
that the external audit process was effective 
and is satisfied that the scope of the audit 
is appropriate and that significant judgements 
have been robustly challenged. 
Composition and meetings
The Audit Committee during the year under 
review has consisted of two Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee is chaired by me, 
Thomas Engelen, with David Norwood as 
the other member. I am an independent 
Director and have recent and relevant 
financial experience. 
There was one meeting held in the year 
ended 31 December 2017 in April. 
Committee meetings are also attended by 
Stephen Dunbar, the Finance Director, and 
representatives from the external auditor.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Significant issues relating 
to the financial statements 
The specific issues considered by the 
Audit Committee in the year under review, 
in relation to the financial statements, 
are shown below. 
Valuation of goodwill and other 
intangible assets
Testing of goodwill and other intangible 
assets for potential impairment is complex 
and requires a number of management 
estimates and sensitivities to be applied, 
which inevitably requires judgement and 
is a recurring matter. 
The forecasting tools developed by 
management to help assess the values 
of intangible assets and goodwill were 
updated for variables that were known 
to have changed. 
The Committee reviewed the reports 
together with the assumptions, judgements 
and sensitivities applied to the valuations 
and underlying models for impairment 
testing purposes. Following this review 
and after discussions with management 
the Committee is satisfied that no impairment 
charge should be recorded in the year to 
31 December 2017 and that the disclosures 
in the financial statements are appropriate.

G Report of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee aims to attract, retain and motivate the 
executive management of the Company, and set remuneration 
at an appropriate level.
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
our report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. 
This report does not constitute a Directors’ 
remuneration report in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. As a company 
whose shares are admitted to trading 
on AIM, the Company is not required 
by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare 
such a report. 
Key responsibilities 
The Remuneration Committee is a 
sub-committee of the Board. Its principal 
purpose is to determine and agree with 
the Board the framework and broad policy 
for remuneration, and to determine the 
remuneration packages and service 
contracts of the Executive Directors, 
the Company Secretary and such other 
members of the executive management 
as it considers appropriate. Among other 
things, the Committee shall approve the 
design of, and determine targets for, any 
performance incentive schemes operated 
by the Company and approve the awards 
made under such schemes.
Composition and meetings
During the year the members of the 
Committee were me, Thomas Engelen, 
an independent Non-Executive Director, 
and David Norwood, the Non-Executive 
Group Chairman. All members served on 
the Committee throughout the year and 
to the date of this report. I was Chairman 
of the Committee throughout this period.
There was one meeting held of 
the Committee in the year ended 
31 December 2017, held in April. The 
meeting was convened to consider and 
review the Group’s remuneration policy, 
and to approve annual awards to senior 
management under the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan. There were no changes to 
the remuneration or service agreements of 
the Executive Directors during the period.
Policy on Executive remuneration
The Committee aims to attract, retain and 
motivate the executive management of 
the Company, and set remuneration at an 
appropriate level to promote the long-term 
success of the Group, in line with its 
strategic objectives.
The overall policy of the Board is to ensure 
that executive management is provided 
with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for its 
contribution to the success of the Group.
The main elements of the remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors and 
senior management are as follows:
Basic annual salary
The base salary is reviewed annually. 
The review process is undertaken by the 
Remuneration Committee and takes into 
account several factors, including the 
current position and development of the 
Group, individual contributions and market 
salaries for comparable organisations.
The Company does not provide an 
occupational pension scheme for Executive 
Directors, nor does it make contributions 
into the private pension schemes of 
Executive Directors.

G Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
In relation to the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and Company financial 
statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange to prepare 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and have elected 
under company law to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU.
The Group financial statements are 
required by law and IFRS adopted by the 
EU to present fairly the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and the 
financial performance of the Group. The 
Companies Act 2006 provides in relation 
to such financial statements that references 
in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view 
are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group and the Company for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
a.  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
b.  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
c.  state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs adopted 
by the EU; and
d.  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
4D pharma plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Opinion
We have audited the financial statements 
of 4D pharma plc (the ‘parent company’) 
and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise 
the group statement of consolidated total 
comprehensive income, the group and 
parent company statements of financial 
position, the group and parent company 
statements of changes in equity, the group 
and parent company statements of cash 
flows and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting 
policies. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion: 
 °
the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the group’s 
loss for the year then ended;
 °
the group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union;
 °
the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
 °
the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the group and parent 
company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, 
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed entities and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 °
the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
 °
the directors have not disclosed in the 
financial statements any identified material 
uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the parent 
company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting 
for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and 
include the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) we identified, including those 
which had the greatest effect on the overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Impairment of intangible assets
(Refer to pages 38 and 39 regarding the 
accounting policy in respect of intangible 
assets, page 36 in respect of critical 
judgements and estimates applied by 
the Directors and note 11 to the financial 
statements on pages 48 and 49.)
The risk
No amortisation was provided against the 
intellectual property as whilst they were 
deemed to be separately identifiable under 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations, they are not 
yet generating economic benefit. Due to the 
regulatory and other uncertainties inherent 
in the development and the success of the 
Group’s programmes there is a risk that if 
programme scales are not achieved an 
impairment may need to be required.
Our response
We have challenged management’s 
workings and calculation by reference to 
the underlying valuation models and 
assumptions. We have assessed whether 
the models used in the prior year are still 
appropriate and have assessed the sensitivity 
analysis to consider whether there is 
appropriate headroom.
We highlight that management have used 
the base case valuation outcome in respect 
of the valuation models in each assessment 
which is considered to be prudent and 
appropriate given the stage of the programme 
lifecycles. We have assessed the adequacy 
of the financial statement disclosures.

Carrying value of intra-group balances 
(Refer to page 40 regarding the accounting 
policy in respect of investments, page 40 
regarding the accounting policy in respect 
of financial assets and note 12 to the 
financial statements on pages 50 and 51.)
The risk 
The Company has material receivables from 
subsidiary undertakings that are currently 
loss making. As a consequence, there is 
a significant risk that these are impaired 
and need to be written down. At the 
31 December 2017, the carrying value 
of amounts due from group undertakings 
amounted to £33,159k (2016: £24,114k) 
in the Company Statement of 
Financial Position. 
Our response 
As part of our procedures we obtained 
management’s impairment review and 
underlying calculations and challenged the 
assumptions used therein before concluding 
whether or not there are any indicators of 
impairment against the carrying value of 
amounts due from group undertakings. 
We reviewed forecasts and considered 
whether they were consistent with the 
forecasts prepared by management in 
relation to going concern. We challenged 
management and obtained explanations 
as to how future income estimates were 
calculated assessing whether they were 
reasonable and corroborated to 
supporting evidence. 
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, 
we set certain thresholds which help us to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures and to evaluate the 
effects of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole. 
During planning we determined a magnitude 
of uncorrected misstatements that we judge 
would be material for the financial statements 
as a whole (FSM). During planning FSM 
was calculated as £1,124,500, which was 
not changed during the course of our audit. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all unadjusted 
differences in excess of £10,000 as well as 
differences below those thresholds that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
As part of our planning we assessed the 
risk of material misstatement including 
those that required significant auditor 
consideration at the component and group 
level. Procedures were then performed to 
address the risk identified and for the 
most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement, the procedures performed 
are outlined above in the key audit matters 
section of this report. 
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we 
do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there 
is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
 °
the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 °
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and the parent 
company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 °
adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  °
the parent company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 °
certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
 °
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 24, 
the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements is 
located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General information
4D pharma plc (the “Company”) is an AIM-quoted company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The locations and principal activities 
of the subsidiaries are set out in note 12. The Company is incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is 9 Bond Court, 
Leeds LS1 2JZ. These Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
“Group” and individually as “Group entities”) for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The principal activities of the Group are the research and development of Live Biotherapeutic drug products.
The financial statements of 4D pharma plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue 
by the Board of Directors on 20 April 2018 and the Statement of Financial Position was signed on the Board’s behalf by Duncan Peyton.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 3.
2. Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRSIC”) interpretations as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(b) Basis of measurement
The parent company and Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the methods used 
to measure fair values of assets and liabilities, which are discussed in the respective notes and in note 3.
(c) Going concern
The Chief Executive Officer’s Report on pages 5 to 7 outlines the business activities of the Group along with the factors which may affect 
its future development and performance. The Group’s financial position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 6 and 7 along 
with details of its cash flow and liquidity. Note 24 to the financial statements sets out the Group’s financial risks and the management 
of those risks.
Having prepared management forecasts and made appropriate enquiries, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group 
and Company financial statements.
(d) Functional and presentational currency
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial information presented 
has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
(e) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of 
estimation means that actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. While every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and 
judgements are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain and, as such, changes in estimates and judgements may have a material 
impact on the financial statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting policies that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(i) Taxation
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level 
of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax-planning strategies. The value of the unrecognised tax losses 
for the Group at 31 December 2017 was £32.691 million. The value of the additional deferred tax asset not recognised at the year end is 
£5.645 million. Further information is included in note 8.
(ii) Research and development
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been 
met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain until such time as technical viability has been 
proven and commercial supply agreements are likely to be achieved. Judgements are based on the information available at each reporting 
date which includes the progress with testing and certification and progress on, for example, establishment of commercial arrangements 
with third parties. In addition, all internal activities related to research and development of new products are continuously monitored by 
the Directors. Further information is included in note 3.

(e) Use of estimates and judgements continued
(iii) Intangible fixed assets and goodwill
Estimated impairment of intangible fixed assets and goodwill
The Group tests annually whether intangible fixed assets and goodwill have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting 
policy stated in note 3. The potential recoverable amounts of intangible fixed assets and goodwill have been determined based on 
value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates both in arriving at the expected future cash flows and the 
application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these flows. There is a degree of judgement involved in 
making assessments of attributable values on acquisition and making impairment assessments. More detail is given in notes 3(h) and 3(i).
Valuation of intangibles on acquisition
Valuation of an early stage drug discovery pharmaceutical company is a notoriously difficult task. Analysis of financial history gives little 
indication of future performance. Despite this, for products currently in development, sales potentials can be estimated and management 
has used its own experience as well as consulting with external experts to establish best estimates of sales pricing and revenue forecasting 
and these can provide the starting point for valuing these products and ensuring that their value has not been impaired. In addition, clinical 
development risks, measured as product attrition failure rates, incurred as drugs progress through the clinic are reasonably well documented 
and can be applied as meaningful risk adjusters to account for the chance of development failure.
3. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below are applied consistently by Group entities.
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date – i.e. when control is transferred 
to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The Group measures 
goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 °
the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
 °
the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
 °
if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 °
the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with 
a business combination are expensed as incurred.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017
4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Basis of consolidation continued
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way 
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(b) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange 
ruling at the reporting date. All foreign currency transaction differences are recognised in the Income Statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the 
date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value was determined. These values are retranslated at the year-end rates with the movement between the original 
cost and retranslated cost being included in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve.
(c) Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker, being the Chief Executive Officer, to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is 
available. As at the reporting date the Group operated as a single segment.
(d) Lease payments
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases which are expensed directly to the Income Statement.
Assets held under hire purchase agreements and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is included 
in the Group Statement of Financial Position as a hire purchase obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges 
and a reduction of the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are charged to the Group Income Statement. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(e) Finance income and finance expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss. Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised using the effective interest method.

F 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(f) Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the Income Statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or 
paid to, the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements with the following exceptions:
 °
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and
 °
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the date and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
differences can be utilised. An asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer or economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost. After initial recognition, these assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any 
other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is computed by allocating the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life and is applied 
separately to each identifiable component.
The following bases and rates are used to depreciate classes of assets:
Plant and machinery   – straight-line over five to ten years
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – straight-line over three to five years
Leasehold improvements   – straight-line over five to ten years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
A property, plant and equipment item is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the Income Statement in the year 
of derecognition.
(h) Intangible assets
Intellectual property and patents
The carrying value of intangible fixed assets is reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(h) Intangible assets continued
Intellectual property and patents continued
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the assets is increased to the revised climate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Amortisation is provided on the fair value of the asset and is calculated on a straight-line basis over its useful life. Amortisation is recognised 
within the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Intellectual property and patents acquired as part of a business combination are only 
amortised once technical viability has been proven and commercial agreements are likely to be achieved.
Patents includes the costs associated with acquiring and registering patents in respect of intellectual property rights. Patents are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions, being the excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment testing 
goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units of 4D pharma plc, which represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Software
Software is recognised initially at cost. After initial recognition, these assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to 
acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Amortisation is computed by allocating the amortisation amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life and is applied 
separately to each identifiable component. Amortisation is applied to software over three to five years on a straight-line basis.
The carrying value of software is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable, and is written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually 
and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
A software item is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the 
asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the Income Statement in the year of derecognition.
Internally generated intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred. Expenditure arising from 
the Group’s development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
 °
an asset is created that can be identified;
 °
it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
 °
the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
 °
the Group has the intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell it;
 °
the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; and
 °
sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where these criteria have not been achieved, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the year in which it is incurred.
The Group has adopted the industry standard approach to the treatment of development expenditure by capitalising development costs 
at the point where regulatory approval is reached and the probability of generating future economic benefits is high.

(i) Impairment of assets
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and 
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, an appropriate valuation model is used; these calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, or other available fair value indicators. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Income 
Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
(j) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in and loans to subsidiaries are stated in the Company’s Statement of Financial Position at cost less provision for 
any impairment plus the cost of any share options issued to employees of subsidiary companies. See note 3(o) for further details.
(k) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost based on latest contractual prices includes all costs incurred in 
bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs 
expected to be incurred to disposal. Provision is made for slow-moving or obsolete items.
(l) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand and deposits with maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments 
comprise deposits with maturities of more than three months, but no greater than twelve months.
(m) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method.
(n) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as 
financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Group determines the classification 
of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold or cancelled or expires.
At the year end, the Group had no financial assets or liabilities designated at fair value through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(o) Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured with reference to the fair value at the date of grant, recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured 
using a suitable option pricing model.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the Group Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the remainder of the original vesting period. In addition, an 
expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the 
difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of 
modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where awards are granted to the employees of the subsidiary company, the fair value of the awards at grant date is recorded in the 
Company’s financial statements as an increase in the value of the investment with a corresponding increase in equity via the share-based 
payment reserve.

Adoption of IFRS
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, IAS and IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRSIC”) effective as at 31 December 2017. The Group and Company have not chosen to adopt any amendments or revised standards early.
IFRS issued but not yet effective
At the date of issue of these financial statements, the following accounting standards and interpretations, which have not been applied, 
were in issue but not yet effective. The potential effects for the implementation of IFRS 16 are currently under consideration as they are 
expected to be significant. However, for the remaining standards listed below, the Directors do not anticipate adoption will have a material 
impact on the financial statements or they consider the implementation too uncertain to speculate on the impact on the accounts at this 
point in time.

IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and 
lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identifiable asset is controlled by a customer. Distinctions 
of operating leases (off Statement of Financial Position) and finance leases (on Statement of Financial Position) are removed for lessee 
accounting, and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by 
lessees (i.e. all on Statement of Financial Position) except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as 
well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating 
lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows, whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split 
into a principal and interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.
In contrast, for finance leases where the Group is a lessee, as the Group has already recognised an asset and a related finance lease 
liability for the lease arrangement, the Directors of the Company do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 16 will have a significant 
impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
The Directors are currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 as the changes are likely to have a significant impact on the financial results.

5. Non-recurring costs
As detailed in other payables (see note 19) on 23 August 2017 contingent consideration became due following the achievement 
of 4D Pharma Cork Ltd’s initial milestone.
The contingent liability was initially calculated upon the acquisition based on the discounted probability of the potential liability at the 
time of acquisition. With the successful completion of the first milestone the management has had to reassess the probability of success 
of subsequent milestones and therefore increase the contingent liability. This has resulted in the non-recurring cost in the year to 
31 December 2017 of £3.474 million (31 December 2016: £Nil).

Tax income tax credit recognised in the year (3,541) (1,843)
The tax rate for the current year is lower than the prior year, due to changes in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% from 
1 April 2017. Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 on 
6 September 2016. These reduce the main rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 with the revised rate forming the basis for the UK portion 
of the deferred tax calculation noted below.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had tax losses available for carry forward of approximately £32.691 million (31 December 2016: 
£12.262 million). The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to such earned forward losses of approximately £5.645 million 
(31 December 2016: £2.452 million).
At 31 December 2017, the Company had tax losses available for carry forward of approximately £7.827 million (31 December 2016: 
£2.974 million). The Company has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to such earned forward losses of approximately £1.331 million 
(31 December 2016: £0.595 million).
Group’s management considers that there is insufficient evidence of future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and feasible 
tax-planning strategies to utilise all of the cumulative losses. If future income differs from current projections, this could significantly 
impact the tax charge or benefit in future years.
The management has therefore concluded that a deferred tax asset should not be recognised until such point that the probability 
of its realisation becomes more certain.

Goodwill amounting to £9.390 million, intellectual property amounting to £4.507 million and patent rights amounting to £1.081 million 
relate to a single cash-generating unit (“CGU”), contained in the acquisitions of 4D Pharma Research Limited, 4D Pharma Leon, S.L.U. 
and 4D Pharma Cork Limited (formerly Tucana Health Limited). These entities together provide the necessary facilities and resources 
to enable the Group to successfully research, manufacture, gain approval for and commercialise Live Biotherapeutic products.
Goodwill, which has arisen on the business combinations, represents staff and accumulated know-how after fair value has been attributed 
to all other assets and liabilities acquired. Intellectual property of £1.923 million recognised on the business combinations represents 
bacteria identified by the Group’s know-how and processes and at different stages of research and development, from early identification to 
patented strains of bacteria. Intellectual property of £2.584 million represents the methods and know-how in relation to the MicroDx platform 
acquired as part of 4D Pharma Cork Limited (formerly Tucana Health Limited).
During the year goodwill, intellectual property, patents and associated property, plant and equipment was tested for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill, intellectual property, patents 
and associated property, plant and equipment. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been measured using a value-in-use calculation 
and, as such, no impairment was deemed necessary. The key assumptions used, which are based on both management’s past experience 
as well as externally provided reports, obtained in the prior year, for the value-in-use calculations are those relating to the risk-adjusted net 
present value of candidates that have been identified as potential future products as at 31 December 2017 and for which estimated potential 
peak sales and future cash flows have been estimated. In addition, an external valuation of intellectual property contained via the acquisition 
of 4D Pharma Cork Limited (formerly Tucana Health Limited) has been used. Valuation of an early stage drug discovery pharmaceutical 
company is a notoriously difficult task and an analysis of financial history gives little indication of future performance. Despite this, for products 
currently in development, sales potentials can be estimated and management has used its own experience as well as consulting with 
external experts to establish best estimates of sales pricing and revenue forecasting and these can provide the starting point for 
valuing these products and ensuring that their value has not been impaired.
The recoverable amount of goodwill, intellectual property, patents and associated property, plant and equipment exceeds the carrying 
amount by 4,985%. The key assumption considered most sensitive for the value-in-use calculation is that regarding the discount rate 
applied to the net present value calculations. Management has performed sensitivity analysis on this key assumption and increased this 
from 10% to 20%. Due to the headroom which exists between the recoverable amount and the carrying value there is no reasonable 
possible change in this assumption that would cause the CGU’s carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

Share option schemes
The Group operates the following unapproved share option scheme:
4D pharma plc 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
Share options were granted to staff members on 10 November 2015, 11 May 2016 and 24 May 2017. Share options are awarded to 
management and key staff as a mechanism for attracting and retaining key members of staff. These options vest over a three-year 
period from the date of grant and are exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award. Exercise of the award is subject to the 
employee remaining a full-time member of staff at the point of exercise. 
The fair value benefit is measured using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share 
options were issued.

F 21. Share-based payment reserve continued
Share option schemes continued 
The range of exercise prices of share options outstanding at the end of the reporting period is between 321 pence and 771 pence 
per share option.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
No dividends were assumed to be paid in the foreseeable future. 
The model assumes, within the calculation of the charge, delivery of options that are dependent on a judgemental comparison to the 
total shareholder return against a specified comparator group of companies upon passing of the vesting period. 
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
22. Capital and reserves 
The components of equity are as follows:
Share capital
The share capital account includes the par value for all shares issued and outstanding.
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the premium arising on shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings 
where merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is composed of the exchange rate movements in non-cash assets for foreign subsidiaries which arise on the 
translation of foreign subsidiaries. Movements in the reserve are disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Other reserve
The other reserve represents the balance arising on the acquisition of the former non-controlling interest in 4D Pharma Research Limited. 
Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payment reserve accumulates the corresponding credit entry in respect of share-based compensation charges. 
Movements in the reserve are disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings includes the accumulated profits and losses arising from the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and certain 
items from other comprehensive income attributable to equity shareholders net of distributions to shareholders.

24. Financial risk management 
Overview
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to various kinds of financial risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Executive Directors report regularly to the Board on Group risk management.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken. 
Capital risk management
The Company reviews its forecast capital requirements on a half-yearly basis to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue 
as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 20 and in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity. Total equity was £69.786 million 
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £86.483 million).
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
57 4D pharma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

F 24. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk continued
The Group manages all of its external bank relationships centrally in accordance with defined treasury policies. The policies include the 
minimum acceptable credit rating of relationship banks and financial transaction authority limits. Any material change to the Group’s 
principal banking facility requires Board approval. The Group seeks to mitigate the risk of bank failure by ensuring that it maintains 
relationships with a number of investment grade banks.
At the reporting date the Group was cash positive with no outstanding borrowings, except for a hire purchase agreement secured 
against the assets to which it relates.

All categories of financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost with the exception of the contingent consideration which 
is measured at fair value through the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income using a level 3 valuation technique.
The values disclosed in the above table are carrying values. The Board considers that the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities 
approximates to their fair value.
Interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant borrowings the risk is limited to the reduction of interest received on cash surpluses held at bank which 
receive a floating rate of interest. The exposure to interest rate movements is immaterial.
Maturity profile
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the financial liabilities approximates to their fair value. 
As all financial assets are expected to mature within the next twelve months an aged analysis of financial assets has not been presented.

As all financial liabilities in the Company are expected to mature within the next twelve months no maturity of liabilities has been presented.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s principal functional currency is Sterling. However, the Group has two subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro 
and the Group as a whole undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional 
currency of the Company. These are primarily US Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR). Transactions outside of these currencies are limited.
The Group may use forward exchange contracts as an economic hedge against currency risk, where cash flow can be judged with 
reasonable certainty. Foreign exchange swaps and options may be used to hedge foreign currency receipts in the event that the timing 
of the receipt is less certain. There were no open forward contracts as at 31 December 2017 or at 31 December 2016 and the Group 
did not enter into any such contracts during these years.
The split of Group assets between Sterling and other currencies at the year end is analysed as follows:

45,237 55 (273) 45,019 66,582 (69) (1,499) 65,014 
Sensitivity analysis to movement in exchange rates
The Directors have considered the transactions in foreign currency and have concluded that, as there is no sales revenue and the 
majority of the Group transactions are denominated in Sterling, the exposure to exchange rate risk is negligible.
