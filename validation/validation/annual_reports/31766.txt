We give people the confidence to be 
whoever they want to be...
Our guiding beliefs 
Our purpose – to give people the confidence to be whoever they 
want to be – rests on some deep-rooted beliefs. We believe in a 
world where people have the freedom to explore and express 
themselves without judgement, no matter who they are or where 
they’re from. Where people value themselves and feel proud 
of who they are. Where individuality is a source of confidence, 
because difference makes the world a better place.
This mindset guides everything we do. The huge diversity 
of our product range. The inspirational content we share. 
The people and partners we choose to work with. At the 
heart of the culture we’ve created at ASOS you’ll find 
authenticity, bravery and creativity. Our people have all 
three, and this makes our business soar.

...we want to be the world’s number 
one destination for fashion-loving 
20-somethings...
Knowing our market
Our mission is to be the number one destination for fashion-
loving 20-somethings. But we specifically avoid defining 
what it means to be number one. We believe there’s always 
more we can do, and we don’t want our mission to have an 
end point. Instead, we strive towards a goal that’s always 
pulling us forward. There’s a necessary restlessness here 
that gives us a powerful edge in our market. 
Our customers move quickly, and so should we. We operate 
in a world that’s constantly changing – fashion, technology 
and 20-somethings themselves are in perpetual motion. 
So continuous evolution and innovation is fundamental to 
who we are as a business. ASOS is a perpetual work in 
progress, but one with a very specific market focus.

DETAILED MARKET POTENTIAL BY REGION
We continue to see considerable opportunity 
for material growth across our key markets. The 
apparel market is undergoing significant channel 
shift, with growth in the online apparel market 
outstripping growth in the overall market globally. 
Expectation is that online penetration will continue 
to increase, and we are well placed to capitalise 
on this shift in customer behaviour. In the UK, 
our home market, the online apparel market has 
grown at over twice the rate of the apparel market 
across the last five years. Our retail sales growth 
has continued to surpass growth in the online 
apparel market in all of our key territories.

...our market is hugely dynamic  
and fast-paced...
Our sustained concentration on the global 20-something 
fashion and beauty space gives us a constant stream of 
potential new customers. And this market focus is one of 
our biggest strengths, playing into our strategy, style and 
communications. 
With the worldwide reach of the internet and social media 
platforms, there’s much more of a common culture followed 
and enjoyed by 20-somethings. Fashion trends happen 
around the world, rather than market by market. Celebrities 
often have global appeal. And we want to engage our 
customers in much the same way.

...we understand our market by  
looking through our customers’ eyes...
Appealing to 20-somethings
ASOS was born in the UK – one of the most competitive, 
dynamic fashion markets in the world. This has made us 
sharp, focused and forward-looking. We may get inspiration 
from our competitors, but we’re not driven by what they’re 
doing. You don’t win a race by looking over your shoulder; 
you win it by focusing on the finish line and running hard. 
So we never take our eyes off our 20-something customers 
and where they’re going. 
This helps us to reach our customers with the next new thing 
quickly – often before anyone else. And the fact that we’re 
an online retailer allows us to be borderless and to tap into 
an enormous global market. 
ASOS AT A GLANCE ASOS COMMUNITY
Numbers tell part of our story. Ours are on the rise  
– here’s a snapshot of where we are now.
There’s a thriving community at the heart of our business. In both 
our bricks-and-mortar buildings and our digital spaces, we share, 
inspire, support, inform and encourage each other – and we do 
this at scale.
—  15.4m active customers
—  8 offices worldwide 
—  3 global warehouses
—  Curation of c.850 third-party brands 
—  Offering 85,000 SKUs
—  Over 20m social media followers

Our ambition is to be the destination for this market:  
a must-have app on people’s phones and tablets; the place 
they think of when it comes to fashion, style and beauty. 
By ‘destination’ we mean the entire ecosystem we create 
through our products, our content and our technology. We 
build relationships with our customers by offering them a 
collection of experiences and having authentic conversations 
with them. 
In the experiences we create, we take the role of a best friend 
– someone who knows exactly what you’d like and tells you 
about the next new thing. Our customers trust us to inspire 
them; and we can do this because we know them so well.

Our business model
Our business model captures our strategy for growing and 
evolving with our market. Some elements are cultural: having 
the right people, values and behaviour in ASOS. Some are 
logistical: making sure our infrastructure and technology 
allow us to continuously scale and improve. And some are 
about our proposition: the unique blend of fashion products 
and inspirational experiences we create for our customers. 
All of these elements need to work together at real pace to 
drive high growth through restless innovation in our products, 
technology and content, while strengthening our long-term 
sustainability. We put around 5,000 new items on our site 
each week – the equivalent of an entire Oxford Street shop. 
This year alone we’ll deliver over 1,300 technology releases 
– each an improvement to our customer experience. And

we’re publishing more than 60,000 pieces of content every 
month – every single one a moment to inspire our customers. 
This continual velocity is intrinsic to the way we operate. As 
is our commitment to delivering Fashion with Integrity. 
Fashion is one of the top five polluting industries on the 
planet. With profit comes responsibility, so we’re playing our 
part in lessening fashion’s impact. The beauty of our size and 
success is that they allow us to lead and influence how our 
industry works. We’re setting some ambitious targets in this 
area – and bringing partners along with us on the journey.

How we create value
We deliberately set our operating metrics to be disruptive. 
Pricing our EBIT margin at 4% allows us to innovate and 
invest much harder and faster than our competitors, while 
still staying sharp through the discipline needed to be a 
consistently profitable business. 
We’re looking for the right balance between longer-term 
investments, such as technology and logistics, and ones 
with more immediate benefit. We’ve also learnt the value of 
following our instincts – when you’re breaking the mould, 
there is no playbook. Backing mobile seven years ago 
seems like a no-brainer now, but it was innovative at the 
time. We knew that moving to free delivery and returns was 
the right thing to do, so we did it.
Our key planks for growth are technology, fashion, content 
and infrastructure – and we’re doing exciting things in all of 
these areas. Increasing our use of artificial intelligence to

enhance our customer experience and operating model. 
Creating new product ranges and brands, including our 
own non-ASOS brands. Amplifying our content so that  
we’re everywhere our customers are. Investing big in  
global logistics and in warehouses in Europe and the  
US to improve delivery speeds and our ability to scale. 
We are, of course, mindful of potential risks. One is simply 
getting the fashion wrong. We buy broad and shallow and 
turn over stock very quickly, which also creates a scarcity

The risk of growing complacent. We have to stay on our

We work hard behind the scenes to create the best 
possible experience for our customers. Here, we pull 
back the curtain to show some of the things we do to 
shape the ASOS experience at four key points on the 
customer journey.
THE ASOS EXPERIENCE
BEING INSPIRED
>20m
followers on our social media platforms ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 11
Inspiration is our heart and soul. When 
people buy from us, they’re buying a 
look, a trend, a lifestyle. So we bring 
our products to life through useful and 
inspirational online content – wherever 
our customers are.
We are social
Our customers expect us to be 
on whatever channel they’re on – 
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, 
YouTube, Twitter – and new ones yet 
to come. We move at the speed of our 
audience and are in constant dialogue 
with them: talking, showing, listening, 
understanding, improving. To keep 
up with 20-somethings’ huge appetite 
for video, we’ve more than trebled 
the amount of moving content on our 
platforms in the last 12 months, leading 
to almost 66 million views, a 100% 
increase year on year.
Our team of 80+ content producers are 
immersed on our social channels day 
in and day out. Their skill is in knowing 
what we want to say as a brand and 
saying this in a way that works for 
each audience on each channel and in 
each market. For example, we might 
showcase the same product line using live 
activity in Facebook and through stories on 
Instagram. 
ASOS Insiders
We understand our customers because so 
many of us are ASOS customers. It’s hard 
to find a better example of this than our 
ASOS Insiders. These 20-something online 
influencers work with us – offering styling 
tips to our global followers and showing off 
their latest ASOS buys on our website and 
dedicated social channels. 
Our 20 Insiders are the faces of our brand 
and are much loved by our community, 
with double the engagement of our 
branded channels. But this isn’t just about 
engagement. Customers who engage with 
Insiders shop at ASOS six times more than 
the average customer.
The ASOS magazine
Our flagship magazine has the highest 
circulation – 450,000 – of any fashion 
magazine in the UK. Adding in our 
other three main markets, US, France 
and Germany, takes our readership to 
710,000.
Products and packaging aside, our 
magazine is the only physical manifestation 
of our brand. We use it to reward our 
customers with fantastic content and 
fashion edits, and to nurture and champion 
fresh talent and ideas. It’s boundary-
pushing and inclusive, featuring diversity 
like no other magazine of its type – see 
page 41 for more. 
TECHNOLOGY ON THE MOVE
Our customers are mobile-native and eager for the 
next new thing. This means constant innovation when it 
comes to technology – and one way we stay ahead of 
the game is by holding hackathons to bring creativity 
and technology together. 
It also means an increasing focus on mobile, which 
brings over 70% of our traffic globally. Our app is our 
mobile powerhouse. Built from scratch by us to create 
the very best ASOS experience, it has a rare 5-star 
rating in global app stores. With features like Apple 
Pay and visual search – and video content and voice 
search coming soon – it keeps us in the palm of our 
customers’ hands.
“ I love ASOS. Ever since my 
first experience years ago 
I’ve never cared to shop 
anywhere else. If I see 
something I like the look of 
either on social media or 
out and about I immediately 
go straight to ASOS.” 
UK customer
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 12
Our 20-something customers are plugged 
into what’s going on around the world as 
it happens. And when they see something 
they fancy wearing, they don’t want to wait 
for it. So our absolute focus is on giving our 
customers everything they want and need 
at speed.
Our in-house label sits alongside a highly 
curated and diverse selection of third-party 
brands. We find and create products 
that are as unique and inspiring as the 
20-somethings who wear them. 
As we’re not restricted by store space, we 
can stock 85,000 products at any one time. 
This gives us the freedom to be creatively 
brave and to offer the biggest product 
ranges in the business. And this makes us 
one of a kind in our market: trend-setting 
and inclusive.
ASOS in-house design
Our in-house design team are some of the 
world’s best at discovering trends, finding 
the perfect fabric or print, and styling it 
in the most creative ways. We’re inspired 
by everything from magazines and music 
videos to street markets in Tokyo and Seoul 
to clubs in London and New York.
Our on-site pattern-cutting facility means 
we can create samples in days and take 
new products from ideas to shipping within 
weeks. This positions us ahead of the 
competition and results in much better stock 
sales at full price.
Inspirational fashion made from sustainable 
materials, such as cotton, is important to 
our customers – and finding new ways 
to provide this really matters to us. For 
example, 85% of our menswear range uses 
recycled polyester. And in womenswear, 
we’ll soon be using offcuts of previous 
dresses to make new ones.
Brand partners
We stock c.850 brands of all shapes and 
sizes: from big global names to virtually 
unknown local designers. We turn over 
roughly 20% of our partners each season 
to keep things fresh, and pride ourselves in 
finding and growing true fashion talent.
Our annual Fashion Discovery competition 
rewards two emerging brands with 
£50,000 each, a featured collection on our 
site, and support and mentoring from some 
of the best in the business. It also uncovers 
a rich seam of talent for our buyers and 
helps us tap into some of the most exciting 
new designers out there.
We are selective with third-party products. 
We know that 20-somethings trust us to 
choose brands and products that reflect 
who they are and what’s important to them 
– value, fashion and integrity. So when 
something appears on asos.com, people 
know it deserves its place there.
Our corporate responsibility section,  
pages 36 to 46, explains how we work 
with our brand partners on ethical trade 
and sustainable practices.
Inclusive design
We believe fashion should be for everyone. 
So we broke the mould by offering true size 
options for our entire range of styles – from 
normal everyday items to hot trends. Our 
womenswear specialist ranges include 
Curve, Tall, Petite and Maternity. And we 
have the entire spectrum of men’s sizes 
covered, from small to big to tall. We 
also have a pioneering unisex range. Our 
customers have shown their appreciation 
with their wallets – and where we’ve led, 
high street stores are starting to follow.

FINDING THE LOOK
FASHION AS A FORCE FOR GOOD
Since 2010 we’ve been working 
alongside a Kenyan clothing 
manufacturer to train and employ 
people in some of the country’s 
poorest communities. In 2017, 
we launched our second Made in 
Kenya collection under our flagship 
Eco Edit brand. The collection 
features designs inspired by the 
local environment and prints based 
on drawings by local primary 
school children. 
Our manufacturing partner, SOKO 
Kenya, now employs 50 people 
who cut and make the Made 
in Kenya pieces based on our 
designs. The ASOS Foundation 
and SOKO Community Trust also 
train local people to make clothes 
through a Stitching Academy 
and give graduates low-cost 
equipment to start their own 
businesses. We’ve also run a series 
of workshops on women’s health, 
family finance and eye care in 
rural villages around SOKO Kenya.
Find out more about how we’re using fashion as a force for good on pages 36 to 46.
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 14
There’s nothing quite like the moment a 
customer opens their ASOS package and 
takes in everything about the product 
they’ve bought. So we do all we can to 
help people get to this point as quickly and 
painlessly as possible. We believe there 
should be no barriers to getting things from 
ASOS, wherever people are. We’re making 
constant improvements to our technology 
and our delivery, returns and customer care 
services – enhancing our tech, logistics and 
people to deliver a frictionless experience, 
every time.
Easy ordering
We don’t want a single sticking point when 
it comes to ordering. So we’re ‘killing the 
keyboard’ on mobile. Customers can log 
in to our iOS app using Touch ID. We 
gather key details in the app, so there’s 
little or nothing to enter to place an order. 
Instead of typing in credit card information, 
customers can upload a photo of their card 
to the app. And they can use Apple Pay to 
buy in an instant. 
Hassle-free delivery and returns
Our mantra for delivery is faster, cheaper, 
better. We’re constantly making brave 
decisions for the good of our customers, 
and ultimately for the business – such as 
free delivery and returns, midnight cut-off 
times for orders and a year’s unlimited UK 
next-day delivery for £9.95. 
We listen to what our customers tell us. They 
want to know where their orders are, so 
we now have tracked services on 98% of 
global deliveries. People hate waiting in for 
parcels, so we’re trebling the size of our UK 
click & collect network and are launching 
new click & collect services in Italy, 
Germany and the US this calendar year.
Our ambitions and scale make us a coveted 
partner for carriers. In fact, innovative firms 
such as DPD come to us first when trialling 
and launching new services, such as Follow 
My Parcel. This means we can be first to 
market with ground-breaking offerings, 
like InPost parcel lockers where people 
can drop off their returns 24/7.
We’re also adding fulfilment centres 
around the world to bring down delivery 
times. And we’re increasing automation 
in our warehouses to get products to 
customers quicker than ever. 
The future of delivery and returns is 
smarter and ever more convenient. 
Same day delivery, quicker refunds, 
in-app communications for complete 
transparency. Constant innovation.  
Better services. Delighted customers.
Constant care
We’re here for our customers 24/7 and 
365 days a year, with native support 
in eight languages. And we respond 
wherever people contact us, whether 
it’s over the phone, through Twitter, 
Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger, by 
email or live chat. If customers switch 
channels, we switch seamlessly with them.
Being completely digital shouldn’t  
mean being faceless. We’re responsive, 
we’re human, we’re helpful. And we’re 
always finding ways to care for our 
customers better. 
CARBON CONTROL
Our ‘faster, cheaper, better’ delivery and returns mantra also 
means better for the planet. So we consider the environmental 
impact of every decision we make. This is one reason why we 
never split an order, but bundle multiple items into a single delivery. 
This is partly why we’re increasing self-service options like click & 
collect in key markets. It’ s also why we encourage customers to use 
our original packaging for returns, which we then recycle. We’re 
also making better use of data to streamline deliveries and reduce 
carbon emissions. As our customers will be the first to tell you, 
what’ s better for the planet is better for its people.

20-somethings are the selfie generation. 
With a sophisticated camera always in 
hand and friends in online communities 
everywhere, they live in a connected world. 
And it’s a global one too – we see the same 
trends and interests on the streets of Tokyo 
and Tyneside, Toronto and Tijuana.
Our customers love sharing how they look 
and inspiring each other. So we do all we 
can to encourage a community of creative 
ASOS-lovers. Like-minded people who style 
up for real life and just have to share the 
look straight away.
#AsSeenOnMe
Instagram is where our customers live – 
90% of its 800m users are under 35. It’s the 
perfect place for visual sharing. So in 2014 
we launched the hashtag #AsSeenOnMe to 
capture our customers’ photos and videos 
in one beautiful stream. Customers can 
also upload their #AsSeenOnMe images to 
other social platforms and to our website, 
where we have a gallery featuring the latest 
shots. 
It’s a great way for people to show off their 
creativity and styling nous while helping 
other customers edit our products and 
shop for themselves. This also gives us 
valuable data that we’re increasingly using 
to personalise our recommendations. The 
better we know our customers, the faster we 
can help them find that perfect look.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I’m pleased to be writing this as 
we mark another year of continued 
strong growth, with a 33% increase 
in sales across all markets. 
We’ve delivered this while making 
substantial improvements to our 
infrastructure to unlock more growth. It’s 
no small achievement to push through 
fundamental changes behind the scenes 
while growing at pace in an increasingly 
crowded marketplace – and continuing to 
keep a laser focus on meeting customers’ 
needs. Our performance is a tremendous 
credit to the commitment and passion of 
everyone at ASOS. 
Strategic opportunities and 
challenges
The ASOS mission hasn’t changed: to be 
the world’s number one destination for 
fashion-loving 20-somethings.
We still see huge potential for ASOS in 
every market. 20-something fashion is 
global; and online penetration still has lots 
of room to grow. Our focus continues to 
be on finding ways in each market to give 
customers more of what they want, using 
technology and data to provide customers 
with a more personalised, convenient and 
reliable service, as Nick talks about in his 
operational review on page 20. We also 
believe that delivering Fashion with Integrity 
at scale will be a powerful – and essential 
– differentiator within our industry, and you 
can read about how we’re doing this on 
pages 36 to 46.
We’re very aware of the possibility of 
disruption, having disrupted retail from the 
outside ourselves. There are some sizeable 
operations with huge resources that are 
extremely interested in our market space. 
But we also believe there are opportunities 
within any new disruptive force. This 
makes it all the more important that we 
truly understand our business model, and 
particularly our purpose – why we’re here 
and how we’re different – something that 
we’ve done a lot of work on in 2017. 
 
Behind the scenes
The past year has seen some fundamental 
changes to our infrastructure, with 
developments like the opening of our 
second full-scale warehouse, Eurohub 2. 
We’ve also upgraded our systems to enable 
more international growth, and have 
brought our entire global Customer Care 
team into one large centre in the UK. 
Other initiatives in progress include the 
expansion of our London head office to 
accommodate our ever-growing team, as 
well as a two-year programme to overhaul 
our retail system to more efficiently deliver 
a better customer experience while 
scaling as we grow. Importantly, we’ve 
managed these large-scale transformational 
programmes without slowing our growth.
Our people and culture
We could do none of this without the 
passionate, committed and talented people 
at ASOS all working towards our goals and 
purpose. I’d like to thank them on behalf of 
the Board and our shareholders for all they 
do. We know that we’re asking people to 
raise their game as the business grows, and 
that this becomes more challenging each 
year. We’re extremely fortunate to have 
people who are engaged and energised 
by the challenge. And we work hard to 
maintain our unique and inclusive culture 
that encourages authenticity, bravery, 
creativity and fun. 
Board update
The Board’s focus is to ensure ASOS 
continues to lead the way in customer 
experience and that we’re prepared for 
the growth ahead. We exercise diligence 
so that our long-term investments – such 
as new systems and warehouse facilities – 
don’t affect the agility of the business and 
the experience we deliver. We’re also very 
aware that customers are becoming more 
conscious of how businesses use their data. 
With new European data regulations on the 
horizon, we’re making sure we put the data 
we collect to good use and manage risks 
while giving customers the transparency 
and control they expect from the businesses 
they engage with.
This year, for the first time, we conducted 
an external review of Board effectiveness 
(see the summary on page 54). We all 
must raise our levels of performance as the 
Company grows, and the Board is  
no exception.
Dividend strategy
The Board has again decided not to 
declare a dividend. We generate a 
significant return on invested capital, and 
we firmly believe the right thing for the 
business and our shareholders is to invest in 
the opportunities that lie ahead. 
Looking ahead
We are looking to the future with 
confidence and are excited about the 
opportunities that lie ahead. We will remain 
restless and totally focused on the evolving 
expectations of our customers. And we will 
do everything we can to strengthen and 
clearly communicate what makes ASOS 
different – for our exceptional employees, 
partners and millions of customers around 
the world.
 
Brian McBride
Chairman
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 20
ASOS is delighted to report record sales 
and profit for the year to 31 August 
2017 in line to marginally ahead of 
expectations. The Group retail sales growth 
of 34% to £1,876.5m (2016: £1,403.7m) 
was once again driven by strong product, 
proposition improvements and further 
price investments across major markets. 
As previously noted, the continuing FX 
tailwind enabled reinvestment at a faster 
rate than initially planned. 
Retail gross margin increased by 10bps to 
48.6% (2016: 48.5%) as price investments 
in the US, Europe and some RoW territories 
were offset by a higher full price mix. 
Delivery receipts grew 18% aided by 
higher next-day delivery usage and the 
expansion of Premier globally. 
Continuing profit before tax and 
exceptional items grew by 26% to £80.0m 
(2016: £63.7m). 
The successful rollout of ASOS’s new 
technology platform delivers micro-service 
architecture with fully native mobile 
experience in android and iOS apps and 
a vastly improved all new checkout. The 
platform allows for significantly greater 
transaction volume at enhanced levels 
of stability. A critical benefit of the new 
platform is the increased ability to deliver 
technical change and innovation at pace; 
the number of technology releases this year 
surpassed expectations at 1,300 vs. 490 
in the prior year. The coming year will see 
a further acceleration in velocity, delivering 
many more customer enhancements, new 
payment methods, new language sites and 
stronger customer engagement. 
ASOS continued to increase capacity 
and efficiency at Barnsley, successfully 
transitioned to phase 1 of the new 
Eurohub 2 fulfilment centre with ongoing 
work to further double its capacity and 
automate its operations. In August ASOS 
signed a lease for a new fulfilment centre in 
the US, which is expected to be operational 
by Autumn 2018. The investments ASOS 
is making across logistics will lay the 
foundations for a c.60% increase in unit 
capacity and c.£4 billion of net sales. 
Our global potential 
ASOS continues to see considerable 
opportunity across key markets. The global 
apparel market continues to undergo 
significant channel shift, with growth online 
outstripping the overall market. Online 
penetration will continue to increase and 
ASOS is well placed to capitalise on this 
shift in customer behaviour. 
In the UK, the online apparel market has 
grown at more than twice the rate of the 
overall apparel market across the last five 
years. ASOS’s consistent double-digit sales 
growth has continued to surpass growth  
in the online apparel market in all of our 
key territories.
ASOS’s market share of online sales 
remains modest particularly in international 
markets. ASOS will continue to invest 
to grow the business at pace to take 
advantage of the global opportunity.
Our unique product — 
Creating and curating the most 
relevant product for fashion-loving-
20-somethings
ASOS offers customers the greatest, most 
relevant choice of fashion at the right price 
whatever their shape, size or style. The 
ASOS Brand is positioned alongside a 
curated edit of the best third party brands, 
sourced from across the globe. Sales of 
ASOS Brand account for c.41% of sales. 
Newness is important to our customers 
and is a key differentiator of the ASOS 
offering. Each week c.5,000 new styles are 
launched with c.85,000 products in stock 
at any one point in time. 
The brand portfolio continues to evolve. 
Almost 200 new brands were introduced 
during the year whilst a similar number 
where edited out. The combination of 
ASOS Brand and exclusive collaborations 
with brands leads to c.60% of ASOS 
product only being available to customers 
through the ASOS sites, an additional point 
of differentiation.
Building on last year’s launch, ASOS 
is accelerating its activewear offering, 
with football and golf ranges now 
accompanying a greater choice of true 
sports performance wear including gym, 
run and yoga. The ASOS 4505 activewear 
range will launch in 2018 along with range 
extensions into snow and surf.
Last month ASOS relaunched ‘Face + Body’ 
which establishes ASOS as a destination for 
all things face, body, skin and hair. Initial 
reaction has been very positive in a market 
that is predicted to be worth £450bn p.a. 
globally by 2020. 
ASOS’s longstanding ‘Fashion with 
Integrity’ initiative encompasses nine 
principal aspects of ethical trading. This 
initiative is ambitious and is driving 
behaviour across the business. This covers 
fundamental human rights and ASOS has 
published a statement on modern slavery, 
become a signatory to the UN’s Women’s 
Empowerment Principles and recently 
signed a global framework agreement 
with IndustriALL, the world’s largest trade 
union organisation representing 50 million 
workers in the retail sector. Publication of 
ASOS’s full factory list for the first time also 
improved transparency of the supply chain. 
‘Fashion with Integrity’ ultimately aims 
to ensure that the production of our 
products minimise negative impact on the 
environment. ASOS joined the Sustainable 
Apparel Coalition, giving ASOS insights 
CEO’S OPERATIONAL REVIEW ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 21
into environmental management systems 
across water and chemical management. 
The Group reached 70% full traceability 
across the viscose supply chain, allowing 
ASOS to identify risk hotspots associated 
with certain viscose producers. ASOS 
signed the Cotton Communique with the 
Clarence House International Sustainability 
Unit, committing to 100% sustainably 
sourced cotton by 2025 and are on track 
to hit a sustainable cotton target of 70% for 
2017. ASOS also signed the Commitment 
to a Circular Fashion System (Global 
Fashion Agenda, Copenhagen) to support 
in the transition to a ‘circular business’.
ASOS views its commitment to ‘Fashion 
with Integrity’ as a critical investment in the 
future of the business. Our twentysomething 
customers care deeply about ethical and 
environmental issues as does ASOS.
Our best-in-class proposition — 
Offering a friction-free experience 
at every stage of the journey
Brand experience
Significant investments during the year 
have driven strong engagement levels 
across ASOS’s customer base. Site visits 
increased by 24% year-on-year; average 
order frequency improved by 5%; average 
basket value increased by 2% alongside a 
20bps improvement in conversion. Active 
customers are now at 15.4m, representing 
a 24% increase since last year. ASOS 
continues to invest in and evolve its UK 
loyalty programme which is successfully 
driving increased purchase frequency and 
reduced rates of churn.
ASOS is continually striving for new ways 
to engage with its customer demographic, 
such as a focus on students with a calendar 
of acquisition and engagement activity 
aimed at growing penetration of this global 
population. ASOS’s ‘hero’ campaign 
successfully reached students on campus and 
online in the UK, USA, France, Germany, 
Australia and Italy. The student discount 
proposition was extended into eight new 
markets with plans to further develop this 
programme during the current year.
ASOS maintained investment in relevant, 
emerging content formats like cross-channel 
video. Our videos were viewed more than 
66 million times, a doubling on the prior 
year. ASOS continues to experiment with 
pioneering advertising trials across key 
international markets, on the platforms that 
matter most to fashion-loving-20 somethings. 
This activity is already driving heightened 
engagement across multiple territories.
ASOS is continually finding fresh ways 
to engage with both new and existing 
audiences, including two initiatives, 
‘Fashion Discovery’ and ‘ASOS Supports 
Talent’. ‘Fashion Discovery’ is an annual 
competition to discover and nurture the 
freshest UK fashion talent. ‘ASOS Supports 
Talent’ helps up-and-coming creatives to 
realise an important, culturally significant 
project by giving them funding, mentoring 
and a platform to showcase their skills. 
Delivery and returns
ASOS continually enhances delivery and 
returns options, maintaining a best-in-
class customer proposition with over 200 
improvements implemented over the last 
twelve months.
ASOS’s Click & Collect delivery proposition 
has now been expanded globally, UK total 
coverage increased to 9,000 locations 
with an improved Next Day order cut off of 
7pm, whilst Click & Collect launched into 
Italy and the United States in September, 
giving an additional 11,000 collection 
points across those two territories.
During the year improvements were also 
made to Next Day and Standard Delivery 
propositions. Internationally, ASOS now 
offers tracked Standard Delivery services 
to a total of 61 countries across the world, 
and within the UK, Saturday was added 
as a Standard Delivery promise. Next Day 
Delivery weekend ordering cut-off has been 
extended to 8pm in the UK and a Saturday 
order cut off for Monday delivery has been 
introduced into a number of key European 
territories, giving the customer an extra 
24 hours for Monday delivery. 
For the year ahead, an Evening Next Day 
Delivery service will be launched into 
Germany’s major cities whilst ASOS Instant, 
ASOS’ same day delivery service, has just 
launched in London, with further UK cities 
to follow. Nominated Day Delivery will also 
be launched throughout the EU, allowing 
customers to select their preferred delivery 
date. There will be continued expansion of 
Click & Collect points globally, targeting 
the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, 
Sweden and Australia. 
Customer care
A key differentiator for ASOS is providing 
best-in-class service for customers 
throughout their entire ASOS experience. 
ASOS offers customer support 24/7 365 
days a year across email, live chat, social 
media and telephony in nine languages. 
ASOS continues to maintain strong service 
levels, responding to all emails within one 
hour, all social media communications from 
customers within 15 minutes and all live 
chats or telephony calls within 30 seconds.
ASOS recently moved to a new 80,000 
square feet Customer Care site in 
Leavesden, North Watford and are on 
track to complete the site during the 
first half of the new financial year. This 
investment in infrastructure and technical 
capability cost £11m and supports the 
ever growing customer base and allows in-
sourcing of all Customer Care operations, 
improving the quality of the service and 
also reducing cost.
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 22
Warehousing
Investment in our site in Barnsley continues, 
with a fifth packing module currently being 
commissioned. Live testing is now underway 
and it will be fully operational for the 
start of the peak trading period. This will 
provide additional capacity for Black Friday 
volumes as well as supporting future growth. 
Planning permission for a small office 
extension has been granted and building 
works will commence in the next few weeks. 
Eurohub 2, our warehouse in Berlin, 
was opened at the beginning of March 
and has quickly grown its volumes, now 
fulfilling c.95% of all EU orders. The local 
stockholding is now over 7.5m units and 
will grow to around 9m units in readiness 
for peak trading this year. The Phase 2 
extension of Eurohub 2, which will double 
the square footage of the fulfilment centre, 
is on track with first deliveries of automation 
equipment expected shortly. The first phase 
of Automation is expected to go live by the 
end of 2018.
In addition to the existing US operation in 
Ohio, ASOS signed a lease for an existing 
1 million square foot building located 
near Atlanta, Georgia. Fit out commences 
shortly and the facility is expected to be 
operational by Autumn 2018.
Technology
During the year, ASOS significantly 
ramped up the pace of both technology 
investment and implementation. At the start 
of the year ASOS completed the roll out of 
a new digital platform across all territories. 
This new platform is the backbone of the 
ASOS customer experience on both sites 
and apps. The new platform delivers 
micro-service architecture with fully native 
mobile experience in android and iOS 
apps and a vastly improved, all new 
checkout. The new platform handled 
record volumes of transactions during 
peak trading period, which at one point 
reached 33 orders per second. 
A critical benefit of this new platform is the 
enhanced ability to deliver technological 
change and innovation at pace. During 
the year, ASOS developed and rolled out 
over 1,300 individual releases across the 
platform compared to 490 in the previous 
year. The pace of change has exceeded 
expectations, demonstrating the flexibility of 
the new platform and the power of ASOS’s 
growing engineering teams. During the 
year, ASOS added 120 engineers and 
technologists and plans to add a further 
c.200 over the next 12 months as velocity 
and momentum continue to accelerate.
During the first half of the year, ASOS 
completed the development of the global 
fulfilment software changes and technology 
required to open the Eurohub 2 fulfilment 
centre. This new fulfilment software 
was a major change, controlling which 
country sites have access to which stock 
pools, enabling further improvement of 
the delivery proposition for each of these 
countries. During the second half of the 
year this fulfilment logic was used to point 
the German, French, Spanish and Italian 
sites at the Eurohub stock pool. Improved 
conversion aided by better local inventory 
availability was achieved as a result.
Throughout the year ASOS delivered new 
capabilities for customers. Within the last 
six months these have included rolling 
out ApplePay globally; a fully rebuilt and 
refreshed My Account section on sites and 
apps; extension of product recommendation 
algorithms to international sites; a size and 
fit recommendation tool, and a new image 
search capability (Style Match) within 
the iOS app. The migration of content 
management to a cloud based solution has 
also delivered a richer and more efficient 
editorial experience as well as delivering 
content to customers quicker. 
ASOS has just developed and rolled 
out fully refreshed site navigation and 
search as well as category and brand list 
pages. These will improve how customers 
search, browse and explore products 
to support conversion and will further 
improve page download speeds globally. 
Looking forward, ASOS is continuing to 
leverage machine learning and experiment 
with augmented reality, in addition to 
progressing with a ‘Customer Privacy 
Programme’, focussed on delivering an 
open and transparent way for customers 
to manage their privacy needs, ahead of 
regulation that comes into effect in 2018. 
Good progress has been made with major 
transformation programmes including 
the new end-to-end merchandising and 
planning system ‘Truly Global Retail’ 
(TGR) and a new finance system, both of 
which will support ability to buy, sell and 
account for stock in multiple locations 
and currencies. The first output from these 
programmes has already been seen, with a 
new clearance optimisation tool deployed 
to the first wave of categories, in readiness 
for summer sale period. The new people 
and finance systems are expected to go live 
in the first half of 2018. 
ASOS will continue to evolve and innovate. 
Currently ASOS has seven country-specific 
websites. For the first time in four years, 
ASOS will add new local foreign sites, up 
to 13 by the end of FY18, ultimately giving 
the potential to cover all of ASOS’s 200+ 
markets. Additionally ASOS will extend 
its premier proposition to new countries, 
further personalising customers’ experience 
across sites and apps, improving the 
returns and refund experience, extending 
the student proposition to new countries 
and offering online gift vouchers to 
international customers. 
Finally, to further drive global growth, 
ASOS will also launch additional payment 
methods, new language sites and delivery 
propositions.

Power of our people —
Supporting our customers, our  
team and our partners to realise 
their potential
ASOS works hard to protect its special 
culture where colleagues feel valued, 
respected, enjoy their work, understand 
that they make a real difference each day 
and also have some fun along the way. 
ASOS aims to lead the way as a diverse, 
inclusive and inspiring place to work which 
attracts the very best talent. Being true to 
the ASOS values of being Authentic, Brave 
and Creative is at the heart of how the 
business works. 
Everyone who works for ASOS is central 
to the Group’s success. As at 31 August 
2017, ASOS employed 3,579 people, with 
the majority based at our headquarters in 
Camden, North London and the Customer 
Care site in Leavesden, with smaller teams 
in Paris, Birmingham, Berlin, New York 
and Sydney. In FY18 ASOS plans to add a 
further 1,000 people to its team to support 
its accelerating pace of growth.
Attracting talent and investing in 
our people
Attracting, developing and retaining 
the best talent that will thrive in ASOS’s 
fast-paced environment remains a number 
one priority. Over the past twelve months, 
ASOS has strengthened the senior team in 
critical areas with key appointments and 
promotions in Technology, Finance, People 
Experience Team, Supply Chain, Content 
and Engagement, Brand Experience, 
Corporate Responsibility and Legal. More 
widely across the business, apprenticeships 
and internships remain important ways of 
attracting and developing talent and ASOS 
continues to build partnerships with a 
variety of universities and colleges.
Once the best talent has been brought 
on board, the focus is on developing and 
retaining people by offering opportunities 
that match both their professional and 
personal aspirations. ASOS has a robust 
learning offer to support its people 
through their journey at ASOS, offering 
them support to achieve professional 
qualifications, as well as role and 
departmental-specific training in a variety 
of coaching, classroom, psychometric, 
informal and social learning opportunities 
specific to the ASOS culture. 
Investment 
ASOS’s investment in technology and 
logistics is delivering great results and 
is key to sustaining the strong growth 
momentum within the business. ASOS 
anticipates capital expenditure in FY18 to 
be between £200-£220m compared to the 
£168m invested during the year just ended, 
the second year of accelerated capex. As 
always, this investment will be funded from 
internally generated cash alongside existing 
robust cash balances. Whilst the group is 
likely to be free cash flow negative post 
capex in FY18, we expect the group to 
return to positive free cash flow post capex 
from FY19 onwards. 
This accelerated spend will include 
substantial investments into the warehouse 
portfolio including further optimisation 
of Barnsley, automating and extending 
Eurohub 2 and fitting out the US site. These 
investments will lay the foundation for 
c.60% more unit capacity and c.£4bn  
of net sales per annum.
Additionally ASOS will complete 
the implementation of a number of 
transformational technology programmes 
including the new retail and planning 
system TGR along with the finance and 
people systems. The extension and refit of 
the head office in Camden will continue, 
increasing space from 180,000 ft
2
 to 
243,000 ft
2
 which, when combined with 
the very latest technology, will provide 
sufficient flexibility to accommodate future 
headcount growth. 
The rollout of ASOS’s new technology 
platform has enabled deployment of 
enhancements to the customer experience 
at ever greater velocity. The number of 
technology releases this year and the 
positive customer impact it has generated 
has surpassed expectations and ASOS 
will continue to accelerate investment in 
this area over the coming year, delivering 
many more customer enhancements, new 
payment methods, new language sites and 
stronger customer engagement. 
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Our increased sales guidance is 25-
30% for FY18 inclusive of a modest FX 
tailwind, with EBIT margins stable at c.4% 
in line with market consensus. Medium 
term reported sales guidance of c.20%-
25% is unchanged. ASOS expects EBIT 
margins to remain at a similar level into the 
medium term, with operating leverage in 
payroll and distribution offset by ongoing 
investment in technology and warehousing 
infrastructure to support continued growth. 
We are confident we are positioning ASOS 
to be the world’s number one destination 
for fashion loving twenty-somethings.

STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 24
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Our performance indicators allow us to measure both 
the financial value we create for our stakeholders 
and the strategic value in growing our business and 
delivering on our purpose.
Key financial measures
This year is another year of strong overall trading performance, with revenue increasing, predominantly driven by strong international 
performance. Gross retail margin has held steady, leading to an increase in gross profit. The growth in operating profit is lower, due to 
increases in distribution costs driven by expansion of our delivery options. PBT margin is down slightly, as the increased distribution cost 
as a percentage of sales is largely offset by efficiencies in other areas. Profit after tax and diluted EPS have increased broadly in line with 
the increase in operating profit. The year-end net asset figure is 43% up on the prior year.
Our key financial measures give a clear indication of the overall financial performance and position of ASOS. In some cases, the figure is 
an alternative performance measure, i.e. not a statutory measure. In these cases, information is shown in the definition below to cross-
reference to the corresponding statutory measure.

Key strategic measures
We’ve invested substantially in our customer experience – these efforts are reflected in the significant growth in our customer base. Active 
customers and total visits are both up; and an increase in order frequency coupled with an increase in the conversion rate has led to a 
30% increase in total orders. Average basket value has shown a modest increase that is partly a reflection of changes in our product and 
country mix. The proportion of customers accessing our site through mobile devices continues to increase, supporting our decision to focus 
significant capital investment in our mobile offering. Net Promoter Score, an indicator of how likely customers are to recommend ASOS, 
has increased as shown below.

STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 26
RISK REPORT
Effective risk management is critical to the achievement of our 
strategic objectives and to the long-term growth of our business. 
At ASOS, we’ve developed a Risk Management Framework that 
applies to every part of our business in the manner needed to be 
effective within our unique culture. It enables us to determine what 
our key risks are and how to manage them appropriately.
How we manage risk 
At ASOS, we understand that risk is an 
integral part of realising our opportunity and 
reward, and that it’s only through effective 
risk management and internal controls 
can risk truly become part of our decision-
making process. Risk management is 
therefore critical to our day-to-day activities; 
failure to identify or manage risk could 
prevent us from achieving our strategic 
objectives and full growth potential. We 
seek to manage, not eliminate, risk – and 
to provide reasonable assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk 
management and application of control. 
This includes reviewing the robustness of 
our risk management and internal control 
process so that it remains fit for purpose in 
our fast-moving business. Responsibility for 
reviewing specific risk controls is delegated 
to the Audit Committee, while the Executive 
Board and management are responsible for 
implementing processes and controls within 
our risk appetite.
Our general counsel and company 
secretary has executive responsibility 
for Risk Management; and our Business 
Assurance department facilitates the 
day-to-day operation of the Group risk 
management process by ensuring there 
is a rigorous assessment of risk. Our Risk 
Management Framework and process 
continues to evolve in line with business 
change and is reviewed regularly by 
Business Assurance, the Executive Board 
and Audit Committee.

BOTTOM-UP REVIEW ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 27
Our risk management process:
Risks are owned, managed and formally reviewed across the business using the following process:
Assurance and oversight of risk
Our assurance and oversight echoes the ‘Three Lines of  
Defence model’:
—  First Line: Functional Assurance – day-to-day risk  
management in business operations including ownership  
and application of controls
—  Second Line: Management Oversight – Business Assurance 
facilitate the risk management process by providing oversight, 
guidance and challenge. The Executive Board and Audit 
Committee also support the second line
—  Third Line: Independent Assurance – internal and external 
audit provide independent assurance on our risk management 
activities and internal controls
Strengthening the way we manage risks
At ASOS, we strive to improve the ways in which we identify and 
manage risk and have made the following enhancements over the 
last 12 months:
—  Formation of the Business Assurance department after  
recruiting a Business Assurance manager as a dedicated 
resource to focus on Enterprise Risk Management and Business 
Continuity Planning
—  Increased our engagement with risk owners and improved 
monitoring of mitigation and action plans of key risks
—  Further defined our tolerance towards risks

Principal risks and uncertainties
We have undertaken a comprehensive assessment of our principal risks and uncertainties, recognising that as a global business, some 
risks can be dynamic and influenced by the macroeconomic environment.

MARKET RISKS
Disruption to the marketing 
dynamics
Fashion – in particular online 
fashion retail – is an increasingly 
competitive space, with relatively 
low barriers to entry. We therefore 
face increasing competition from a 
variety of e-commerce players who 
attempt to capture the loyalty of 
our customers via their proposition 
and product offering. This can 
potentially increase costs or reduce 
the effectiveness of key e-commerce 
drivers (in particular brand and 
digital marketing activities).
—  Our business model is specifically based around engagement with customers, including 
providing them with a range of fashion services and content as well as great fashion retail – 
which in turn reduces the reliance on e-commerce drivers such as digital marketing
—  Having been one of the first movers in online fashion retail, we have greater experience in 
how to best use e-commerce drivers such as brand and digital marketing in a fashion context 
than newer entrants to the market, and we continue to drive greater effectiveness through 
innovation and improving efficiencies with our platform
—  Investment in broader marketing channels while testing other new opportunities 
—  Continue to understand the drivers for loyalty and advocacy from our customers to further 
enhance our proposition
SAME
Core business model, as 
developed in the UK, not 
sufficiently profitable on 
a scalable basis in global 
markets
ASOS has developed a market-
leading, profitable business model 
based on customer engagement, 
using the UK as our core learning 
ground. As we continue to strive 
towards our global ambitions, 
structuring our international 
business correctly becomes more 
and more important to deliver the 
required proposition in country so 
we don’t stifle our top-line growth.
—  A proactive approach to monitoring consumer trends in key markets – including regular 
attendance at all major fashion weeks, catwalk shows, festivals, trips to fashion cities, 
signing up to blogs, as well as the use of freelance fashion experts to refresh internal 
knowledge to ensure we offer a well balanced, diverse product range to meet the demands 
of different customers and cultures
—  Employing and investing in experienced buyers, merchandisers and designers to tailor and 
align our products to our key territories
—  The use of a diverse, multifaceted sourcing and supply chain involving many different 
suppliers, so that products are produced at a range of prices, at rapid speed to our 
territories, in order to be able to get our customers the fashion they want when they want it
—  Use of zonal pricing to enable us to price appropriately for, and remain competitive in, each 
key market
—  A robust roadmap places a bigger emphasis on our journey towards internationalisation and 
growth in our key markets
—  Internal re-organisation of market structures and groups to provide an increased capacity to 
deliver our proposition in key markets
—  Our new warehouses in Europe and the US will expand our opportunity to fulfil key markets 
UP
Poorly engaging digital 
experience 
As an online retailer, our digital 
experience is our shop window 
and the core way we engage with 
our customers (whether that’s on 
a computer or any smart device). 
Failure to offer our customers the 
core user experience they expect 
in any given market or failure to 
innovate in response to market 
demands/trends will result in a 
poorer customer experience.
—  Our Brand Experience and Digital Product team continue to focus on creating and recreating 
a consistently engaging ASOS digital experience
—  Improving customer relationship management activities to bring about more engaging and 
relevant contacts with customers at more appropriate times
—  We have customer user groups to give direct feedback on all elements of our digital 
experience, and our internal team increasingly focuses on the latest market and tech 
developments to make sure we identify and adopt new developments as quickly as we can
—  Continued growth in our Data Science team and investing in specialist skills to drive digital 
innovation and enhance customer experience

REPUTATIONAL RISKS
Brand name 
Internet-only businesses depend 
on their brand name. Failure or 
inability to support, protect and 
defend our trademarks, brands and 
online domain names in all relevant 
business locations – given that they 
are the ASOS shop window and 
the primary mechanism by which 
customers buy our products – could 
have a materially detrimental 
effect on the Group’s performance, 
reputation and brand positioning in 
each of its key markets.
—  Being the first to use the ASOS brand name both for online retailing and on clothing labels
—  Global co-existence settlement agreed with the two material entities who had been trading 
in clothing in certain key markets prior to the business being formed under names that could 
have been interpreted as being similar to ASOS from a legal perspective
—  Robust strategy for actively pursuing and defending the ASOS brand name and all 
supporting trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property in all key markets in all 
relevant classes
—  Continue to expand our team of highly experienced intellectual property legal experts, 
headed by the group legal director and overseen by the general counsel and company 
secretary, to proactively execute that strategy and manage the ASOS trademark and domain 
name portfolios 
—  Ever-increasing number of trademarks and domain names applied for and registered across 
the world
DOWN
Security of customer data
As a pure play online retailer, 
ASOS needs to gather and use 
customers’ personal data for 
a diverse number of reasons, 
including to process orders, receive 
payment and effectively engage 
with our customers on a regular 
basis. Deliberate or accidental loss 
of data – either from external attack 
or an internal control weakness –
could lead to reputational damage, 
compliance issues including 
substantial regulatory fines, and 
a loss of customer or employee 
confidence.
—  Strengthened our internal capabilities via our dedicated Cyber Security team to consider and 
mitigate internal and external IT and data security threats
—  Prioritised work streams in Cyber Security that focus on technical, cultural and process 
change to strengthen our internal controls and increase awareness of the possibility of cyber 
threats and the importance of data privacy
—  Recruitment of a Customer Privacy team and creation of a privacy programme to further 
safeguard the handling and use of customer data to ensure compliance with all applicable 
laws and customer expectations
—  Our Customer Privacy team is focussed on the consent and use of our customers’ data so that 
we meet their expectations on how it’s controlled, without hindering our ability to interact 
and engage with them through opt-ins and the use of cookies
—  Investment in greater technical and physical security controls to mitigate unauthorised access 
to customer data held on the Group’s servers, including access restrictions and encryption of 
customer credit card data. Regular penetration testing takes place to identify any potential 
gaps in our controls
—  Continue to monitor threat intelligence on any unauthorised use of ASOS’s brand name
—  Enhanced alert systems, particularly in case of attempted unauthorised access
—  Cross-functional communication across the business between our Cyber Security team and 
relevant employees in all key departments, including members of our Executive Board and 
Audit Committee, to ensure IT and data security is more proactively considered in all relevant 
business decisions. This includes the Information Security Steering Group, chaired by our 
Chief Information Officer
UP
Inadequate or incorrectly 
adhered to product quality or 
ethical trading standards
Ultimately, ASOS depends on 
the products it sells. Having an 
engaging, exciting customer 
experience and a first-class 
customer proposition is worthless 
if products don’t match our 
customers’ expectations. Our 
fashion must make them feel 
great. That depends on us setting 
appropriate product quality and 
ethical trading standards, and our 
suppliers meeting and adhering to 
those standards – something which 
becomes more crucial the bigger 
our brand gets and the greater our 
customers’ expectations become 
in relation to the integrity of the 
brands they engage with.
—  Continued growth in our Sourcing and Ethical Trading teams, headed by our sourcing 
director and overseen by womenswear and menswear directors, as we continue to increase 
our capacity on product quality and ethical trading standards. This includes recruitment and 
application of our own sourcing teams in country
—  Sign-off of our Ethical Trading Programme, supported by our Fashion with Integrity 
governance structure, drives forward the ethical trading agenda 
—  Continue to develop our internal capability to deliver a stronger audit programme, including 
recruitment of a senior code of practice manager to improve audit methodology and practice 
across our product supply chains
—  Influence, collaborate, guide and train our suppliers to support them in achieving our 
sustainable sourcing and ethical trade principles 
—  Strengthening our existing sourcing manual and supply chain policies and standards, and 
establishing a cross-functional Modern Slavery Group as part of our long-standing ethical 
trade programme to protect workers against modern slavery within our product supply 
chains. Our suppliers are obliged to sign up to our policies
—  Increase capacity in our Garment Technology and QA testing teams while improving our 
product recall process to provide greater surety that the products we receive from our 
suppliers meet our product quality standards and expectations

FINANCIAL RISKS
Foreign exchange movement 
We are a UK-based global retailer 
that sells products to customers 
across the world in many different 
currencies, while recognising our 
revenues in pounds sterling. Rapid 
global growth will continue to drive 
greater FX exposure and the Group 
therefore has potential exposure 
to volatility in interest in foreign 
exchange rates. 
—  Taking out forward contracts to hedge key currencies in proportion to our calculated net 
exposure in line with our hedging policy, which is approved and overseen by the Audit 
Committee
—  Foreign currency balance re-translation, and forecasting of assets and liabilities, is performed 
regularly to prepare for any unexpected volatility. Our Executive Board frequently review 
margins so that adjustments can be made quickly when needed
—  Zonal pricing capability enables us to take into account the variability in costs including 
foreign exchange rates
DOWN
TECHNOLOGICAL RISKS
Robustness of IT systems and 
infrastructure 
As an online retailer, we’re 
particularly reliant on our IT 
infrastructure. Any system 
performance issues, failures or 
inadequacies could cause serious 
interruption, therefore resilience 
in our systems is crucial to protect 
them so that we can continue 
trading and avoid business 
interruption.
—  Continued investment in IT systems, infrastructure, security and people to ensure that they 
meet the needs of the business and don’t become obsolete or compromised
—  Our technology roadmap focuses on increasing resilience and capacity by re-platforming 
and moving a number of our key systems from our data centre into the Cloud 
—  Business recovery plans to minimise the effects of damage or denial of access to 
infrastructure or systems
—  Recruitment of experienced tech personnel to continue to increase the robustness of all 
services across systems and infrastructure
—  The use of two DNS providers so we can switch over quickly if there’s a failure
—  Clear strategies for decommissioning our legacy systems while increasing resilience in the 
interim
SAME
IT capacity and capability fail 
to keep pace with growth 
and increasing complexity of 
the business 
As we continue to grow at a 
fast pace, we require ever more 
complex and sizeable technological 
systems. At the same time, 
technology itself continues to 
develop. Any failure to ensure that 
IT capacity and capability keep 
pace with the business could restrict 
the Group’s ability to grow.
—  Detailed IT roadmap looking ahead across all areas, produced and agreed with the business 
to ensure capacity for growth
—  Cross-functional Truly Global Retail transformation project to upgrade retail technology 
systems to match ASOS’s future retail requirements
—  Continued use of third-party expertise where we do not have the internal capability or 
capacity to ensure all roadmaps and plans can be met
—  Continued substantial capital expenditure investment in tech
—  Frequent dialogue with our in-house recruitment team on skills and headcount requirements 
as we continue to develop our internal team capacity and experience through recruitment of 
a further 200 technologists next year

SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS
Key third-party supplier or 
service provider failure
Disruption to our business-critical 
operations caused by failure on 
the suppliers’ part or from an over 
dependency on one supplier in our 
supply chain may affect our ability 
to fulfil orders and tarnish our 
reputation.
—  We use a number of service providers and supply chain delivery service providers 
(particularly with the additional warehousing capacity in Germany and the US)
—  Contingency is built into all of our logistic carriers and shipping ports and any other key 
services where possible, to avoid single points of failure 
—  We have relationships with many more providers than we currently use in case we need 
extra support while continuing to monitor those existing carrier relationships
—  Our Procurement team continually review our suppliers’ performance and on-boarding process
SAME
Insufficient warehouse 
capacity 
ASOS continues to grow at 
pace, particularly internationally. 
This means we need ever 
more warehousing space and 
contingency that is close enough 
to customers to enable us to serve 
them in line with their expectations. 
Failure to align warehouse capacity 
and capability in order to keep 
pace with the business could limit 
our ability to grow.
—  We continue to maximise the available capacity in our main fulfilment centre in Barnsley by 
investing in more automation
—  Our warehouse in Germany has enhanced our capabilities to fulfil European orders and 
is currently going through the process of becoming fully automated to replicate Barnsley’s 
operations
—  Investment in our new US warehouse to increase stockholding capacity while enabling a 
better proposition for US fulfilment and returns
—  Opening an additional returns centre in Poland to support our already established returns 
facility at Selby
—  Improved collaboration and forecasting between the Retail, Supply Chain and Commercial 
Finance departments to adapt to the changing business needs
—  Our Retail department operate with a tighter stock model as we continue to identify and 
realise the opportunities and advantages of our e-commerce-only business model
DOWN
Warehouse disruption
Any disruption to the Group’s 
warehousing facilities due to 
physical property damage, 
disruption to systems, poor 
logistics management or staff-wide 
personnel issues could have a 
detrimental effect on our ability to 
fulfil customers’ orders.
—  All warehouses are managed by large multinational companies specialising in the provision 
of these services
—  Continuous monitoring of service levels and warehouse handling to ensure goods are 
handled, packed and delivered in a timely manner
—  Continued improvements to worker pay, conditions and practices in our warehouses
—  Frequent communication and engagement with workers in our warehouses, including active 
liaison with the formal Employee Forum at Barnsley
—  Business recovery plans in place to minimise the effects of material disruption in any of our 
warehouses and resilience continues to be built into Barnsley
—  The expansion of our international fulfilment centres in Germany and the US will provide 
alternative stock pools to which demand could ultimately be transferred if there’s long-term 
disruption at any fulfillment centre 
—  All products are on relatively short lead times, with a steady flow of products into the 
warehouse, enabling the supply chain to be diverted to alternative locations if necessary 
within a manageable timeframe
SAME
PEOPLE RISKS
Preserving our 
entrepreneurial culture  
as we continue to grow 
Protecting the entrepreneurial 
culture that ASOS has been built 
on is at the heart of what we do. 
As we get bigger we require more 
ways to manage and control the 
business without hindering our 
ability to foster our innovative, 
entrepreneurial, fast-moving culture.
— Our purpose and culture is a critical part of the strategy 
—  Ongoing development of our leadership team on the importance of safeguarding our culture
—  Roll-out of our employee forum and people board across our ASOS sites to feed back on 
how our workforce feel about culture and change  
—  Giving all employees the opportunity to have fulfilling careers through employment policies, 
competitive remuneration and benefits packages, and career development opportunities
—  Key behaviours have been developed to show the qualities we’re looking for in someone 
who works for ASOS

STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 32
The outturn for 2017 shows another strong performance for ASOS. The significant sales growth coupled with tight control of operating 
expenditure has delivered year on year growth in profit. There has been considerable investment in capital projects in order to deliver the 
capability for future sales growth. The business is supported by a robust cash position.
Revenue
The Group generated retail sales growth of 34% during the year, with UK growth of 16% and strong international growth of 47% (36% 
constant currency). This result was driven by investments in price and proposition. International retail sales accounted for 63% (2016: 
57%) of total retail sales. 
UK retail sales grew by 16%, a solid performance in a more promotional market. The A-List loyalty scheme which annualised during the 
year, continued to aid increases in conversion and average order frequency. ASOS retained its first place position for unique visitors to 
apparel retailers in the 15-34 age range (Comscore, August 2017).
US retail sales grew by 46% (31% in constant currency) driven by price investments and the annualisation of improved delivery 
propositions coupled with key promotional events, which increased conversion and average basket value metrics.
EU retail sales grew by 45% (34% in constant currency) aided by the introduction of free returns across the whole of the EU, alongside 
prior year price investments annualising. 
RoW retail sales grew significantly at 52% (42% constant currency), augmented by further price and proposition investments. Russia 
and Israel were the stand out performers, achieving triple digit sales growth over 200% and 150% respectively.
Delivery receipts increased by 18% which lagged retail sales growth as customers increasingly took advantage of more extensive free 
shipping options. The number of premier customers increased by 55%.

Gross profitability
Group retail gross margin increased by 10bps to 48.6% compared to last year (2016: 48.5%) due to an improved markdown position 
through both increased full price mix and shallower depths on clearance activity. This benefit, coupled with the net FX tailwind, offset price 
investments and a continued shift into branded sales. Gross margin (including delivery receipts and third-party revenues) decreased by 
20bps to 49.8% (2016: 50.0%) as faster free delivery options became more appealing to customers.

CFO’S FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Payroll and staff costs decreased by 70bps to 8.5% of sales as a result of cost leveraging. Headcount has increased 34% (2017: 3,579; 
2016
3
: 2,664). Non-cash share-based payment charges amounted to £7.6m (2016: £4.5m) relating to a third grant to senior 
management under the Long-Term Incentive Scheme during the year and Save As You Earn scheme to all employees.
Warehousing costs increased by 90bps to 8.8% of revenue due to ramp up and increased fulfilment mix from Eurohub 2 which is currently 
a more manual operation, partly offset by efficiencies achieved at Barnsley from automation investments. 
Marketing costs decreased by 80bps to 4.5% of sales as a result of digital marketing efficiencies and a higher return on advertising 
spend, alongside a redistribution of spend towards customer propositions such as A-List and student discounts. 
Other operating costs remained flat at 4.0% of revenue. 
Depreciation and amortisation remained flat at 2.2% of revenue as a consequence of the strong sales growth versus prior year together 
with a significant element of capital expenditure being in relation to projects which go live in the next financial year.
Exceptional items
No exceptional items have been identified for the year to 31 August 2017.
In the comparative period to 31 August 2016, the Group settled trademark infringement disputes with high-performance cycle wear 
manufacturer Assos of Switzerland GmbH, and German menswear retailer Anson’s Herrenhaus KG. This resulted in a one-off exceptional 
legal settlement cost of £20.9m (including associated legal fees) representing full, final and global settlement of all outstanding litigation.
Discontinued operations 
No discontinued operations have occurred for the year to 31 August 2017.
In the comparative period to 31 August 2016, the Group discontinued its in-country China operation, which incurred an operating loss 
before tax of £3.6m up to the point of closure and one-off exceptional closure costs before tax of £6.5m, of which £4.4m was non-cash 
relating principally to the impairment of fixed assets.
Income statement
The Group generated continuing profit before tax and exceptional items of £80.0m, up 26% compared to last year, lower than sales 
growth due to gross margin investment of 20bps and a 10bps investment in operating costs.

Taxation
The effective tax rate from continuing operations before exceptional 
items increased by 60bps to 19.9% (2016: 19.3%). This arose 
mainly from the deferred tax prior year adjustment in respect of 
losses in China and to an increase in expenses not deductible for 
tax purposes. The effective tax rate from continuing operations after 
exceptional items increased by 100bps to 19.9% (2016: 18.9%). 
Going forward, ASOS expects the effective tax rate to be 
approximately 100bps higher than the prevailing rate of UK 
corporation tax due to permanently disallowable items.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
before exceptional items increased by 25% and 24% to 77.2p and 
76.6p respectively (2016: 61.9p and 61.8p). This was driven by 
the increase in continuing profit before tax during the year. 
Statement of financial position
The Group continues to enjoy a healthy financial position including 
a closing cash balance of £160.3m (2016: £173.3m). 
The reduction in cash includes the payment of last year’s £20.2m 
legal settlement (excluding legal fees) in relation to trademark 
infringement disputes with Assos of Switzerland GmbH and 
Anson’s Herrenhaus KG. 
Net assets increased by £86.7m to £287.1m during the year 
(2016: £200.4m) due to the increase in capital expenditure and 
inventory. The closing stock position was up 25% versus last year to 
ensure good stock availability to meet customer demand for the new 
season. In addition, there was a reduction of £12.8m in the fair 
value of the net liability position of outstanding forward contracts 
since 31 August 2016. This was due to hedges which were entered 
into pre-Brexit at adverse rates, settling during the period. The

Statement of cash flows
The Group’s cash balance decreased by £13.0m to £160.3m 
during the year (2016: £173.3m) as capital expenditure of 
£161.5m was partly offset by a cash inflow from operating 
activities of £145.9m. The working capital inflow is predominately 
made up of higher stock which reflects the higher level of sales 
expected for the new season compared to the prior year, offset by 
a movement in trade payables comprising higher trade payables 
caused by the timing of payments. The prior year balance includes 
the accrual for the trademark infringement legal settlement of 
£20.2m, which was settled after the year-end. The summary

A YEAR IN REVIEW WITH LOUISE MCCABE, DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  
This year, there’s been a step change in 
how we integrate the four pillars of Fashion 
with Integrity into our core business. Our 
corporate responsibility priorities have been 
repositioned as strategic non-negotiables, 
and we’ve taken steps to engage every 
person in the business in understanding and 
achieving them, and in removing barriers to 
faster progress.
We’ve also introduced an extensive and 
robust governance structure for Fashion 
with Integrity. This will help us identify 
and overcome barriers to progress, and 
also support our UN Global Compact 
commitments on human rights, environment, 
labour conditions and business integrity. 
Over 85 senior leaders and subject experts 
from ASOS are participating in seven 
steering groups which report into a central 
executive board chaired by our CEO. 
Some key themes emerging for us are 
transparency, the circular economy and 
diversity. These principles are woven 
through our approach to human rights, 
sustainability and social investment and are 
part of the fabric of how we do Fashion 
with Integrity at ASOS.
 
Transparency
In January, our Board approved a new 
Ethical Trade Strategy setting out our 
long-term vision for safeguarding workers’ 
rights in our supply chains. We continue 
to build on our commitments to protect the 
rights of workers, particularly those most 
vulnerable to modern slavery. To support 
this strategy, we’re now publishing details 
of our manufacturing sites, and adopting 
a transparent approach to identifying and 
publishing our supply chain risks in our 
Modern Slavery Statement.
We’ve also increased the transparency and 
extent of our carbon emissions reporting 
by extending its scope and improving 
our assessment methodology. While this 
increases our reported carbon intensity, it 
gives a more realistic picture of where we 
are and helps us identify exactly how and 
where we can begin to decouple growth 
from emissions. We’ve also undertaken 
a number of detailed studies to help us 
understand how we can lessen the future 
carbon emissions impact of our logistics 
operations, packaging and customer 
deliveries. 
Circular economy
In May this year, we signed a commitment 
to a Circular Fashion Future at the 
Copenhagen Fashion Summit. This signals 
our intention to shift from the current 
fashion model of ‘take, make, use, dispose’ 
to a circular model where materials are 
reclaimed and reused or regenerated 
instead of using virgin resources. We’re 
looking forward to collaborating with our 
partners to reach our goals and support 
wider change across the fashion industry. 
As we begin our journey to a circular 
economy, we continue to speed up the pace 
of change for the fabrics we use, and are 
already exceeding this year’s targets for our 
2020 goal of 95% more sustainable cotton 
in our collections.
 
Diversity
We continue to celebrate diversity at ASOS 
and this year I’ve been especially impressed 
with the content produced by the ASOS 
Magazine, website and social teams. 
This continues to celebrate and reflect the 
diversity of our 20-something audience 
within a changing landscape of gender, self-
expression and body confidence. We have a 
particular focus on disability and, following 
the Paralympic Games in Rio, we’re 
delighted to be continuing our successful 
partnership with the British Paralympic 
Association. We’ll be providing formal and 
ceremony wear for PyeongChang 2018 
Winter Paralympic Games and the Tokyo 
2020 Summer Paralympics.
The ASOS Foundation has gone from 
strength to strength in 2017. I’m 
particularly proud of our partnership with 
Centrepoint, the UK youth homelessness 
charity. Funding from the ASOS Foundation 
has enabled Centrepoint to provide mental 
health support and to launch the UK’s first 
national homelessness prevention helpline 
for young adults.

STRATEGIC REPORT
“ I’m committed to ASOS transforming how fashion 
impacts on people and our planet. We can do this 
if we’re determined enough, work together, make 
brave decisions and continue to be open and 
honest about what needs to be done.” 
Nick Beighton, CEO ASOS PLC 38
human rights impacts resulting from how 
we buy our products. We’re undertaking 
an independent review of our purchasing 
practices within the framework of the 
Action, Collaboration, Transformation 
(ACT) initiative on living wage. This will 
help to highlight gaps in our practices so 
we can agree actions for improving our 
purchasing mechanisms. 
—  Freedom of association: workers’ 
rights to organise and bargain 
collectively is an essential step towards 
their enjoyment of other labour rights. 
We recognise the barriers to freedom 
of association that exist in our sourcing 
regions, and are working to overcome 
them by building relationships with trade 
unions both at the global and local level. 
—  Living wage: all workers in our 
supply chain are entitled to a wage that 
meets their basic needs. Through our 
participation in the ACT initiative on 
living wage, we’re working to improve 
wages in key garment sourcing countries 
through sectoral collective bargaining. 
—  Gender equality: women represent 
the highest proportion of the workforce 
in the garment supply chain, but are 
still vulnerable to exploitation. We’re 
piloting an in-factory gender programme 
to better understand and address some 
of the obstacles for women in gaining 
equal opportunity employment. We’re 
also working with NGOs and academics 
to deliver and evaluate the impact of this 
programme before rolling it out to our 
wider supply chain. 
—  Health and safety: worker safety is 
a priority for ASOS at all times. We’re 
raising awareness of the steps needed to 
protect workers from harmful chemicals 
and other workplace hazards by setting 
clear standards and guiding suppliers on 
their effective application.
—  Modern slaver y: we’re working with 
our suppliers, industry colleagues and 
other key stakeholders on programmes 
to address and reduce modern slavery 
risks in our supply chains. See our 
Modern Slavery Statement for details 
about our efforts in this area. 
—  Child labour: we’re working to 
better identify and stop child labour 
in our supply chains by conducting 
unannounced factory audits and 
preventing unauthorised subcontracting. 
We’re also developing relationships 
with local NGOs to deliver effective 
remediation programmes where needed.
OUR PRODUCTS
Respecting people and the planet with great  
products that our customers can trust
Alongside commercial criteria, our sourcing 
strategy also focuses on ethical trading, 
sustainable sourcing and animal welfare.
Ethical trading
For ASOS, ethical trade means it’s our 
responsibility to make sure every worker 
in our supply chain is respected and 
protected. Everyone in our supply chain 
should be safe at work, financially secure 
and respected by their employers and 
fellow workers. To achieve this, we set high 
ethical standards and assess and support 
our suppliers to help them meet these 
standards. We also work with others to 
bring about long-lasting improvements in 
supply chain working conditions.
Our standards and sourcing 
practices
Our ethical trade standards are set out in 
these policies:
—  ASOS Supplier Ethical Code: based 
on the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base 
Code and ILO Fundamental Conventions 
and defines the minimum standards we 
require from all our suppliers.
—  ASOS Child Labour, Remediation 
and Young Worker Policy: sets 
out the steps suppliers need to take to 
protect young workers and to make 
sure no children are involved in the 
manufacture of any of our products. 
—  ASOS Migrant and Contract 
Worker Policy: sets out supplier 
requirements for the recruitment and 
employment of migrant and contract 
workers, two groups vulnerable to 
exploitation.
Our Board approved a new Ethical Trade 
Strategy in January 2017, setting out our 
long-term vision for increasing respect for 
workers’ rights across our supply chain. 
Our strategy is two-pronged – it focuses on 
improving our business practices to protect 
human rights in our supply chain from the 
top down, while empowering workers to 
realise their fundamental rights from the 
bottom up. Our key priorities centre on:
—  Supply chain transparency: we 
recognise the importance of supply chain 
mapping and due diligence to uphold 
human rights and prevent undeclared 
subcontracting. We’re developing ways 
to ensure the transparency of our supply 
chain and traceability of our products 
(see the case study on the next page). 
—  Purchasing practices: we’re 
committed to improving our buying 
practices so that we limit any negative 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT continued ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 39
—  Third-par ty brands: ASOS stocks 
over 850 third-party brands, and we 
have a new programme to work with 
these brands on ethical trade and 
promote best practice. There are three 
main aims to this programme: 
  1  To learn from and collaborate with 
established brand partners with 
strong human rights programmes
  2  To influence those who aren’t showing 
a high level of commitment
 3  To support smaller, new brands in 
building their capacity for ethical 
trade and sustainability as they grow.
To make sure we achieve these goals, we’ve 
expanded our Ethical Trade team both at 
head office and in our key sourcing regions. 
In the last year, our head office team has 
tripled in size and we now have 12 people 
in our Sourcing department. We’re also 
expanding team capacity in our key product 
sourcing regions to make sure the people 
responsible for driving ethical standards 
understand country-specific risks and engage 
regularly with local stakeholders. 
Monitoring and supporting suppliers
We only work with suppliers who are 
committed to meeting our standards and 
improving conditions for the 107,312 people 
working in our supply chain. We currently 
have 178 suppliers, who use 594 factories 
across 28 countries. Our regional ethical 
trade teams are based in our main sourcing 
regions – China, Eastern Europe, India, 
Turkey and the UK – where over 80% of the 
factories making our products are located. 
Here are some examples of the way we 
engage with our suppliers on ethical trade:
—  Supply chain mapping: we work 
with the Sustainable Sourcing team to 
map our supply chain beyond tier one 
suppliers (see the case study below).
—  Factory assessments: we carried out 
487 audits between September 2016 
and July 2017 to check how factories 
are performing against our standards 
and to give support where needed. The 
majority of our audits are unannounced, 
giving us a more realistic picture of 
actual working conditions. 
—  Supplier support: we continue to 
help our suppliers to make necessary 
improvements at the factory level by giving 
guidance on difficult issues. We held four 
regional supplier and factory conferences 
in the past financial year to raise 
awareness of key issues and offer advice 
to suppliers on how to address them. 
Transparency and product 
traceability
We believe supply chain transparency is 
essential to make sure we’re not contributing 
to negative environmental and social 
impacts when sourcing our raw materials 
and manufacturing our products. We want 
to lead the industry in disclosing our human 
rights impacts. So, this year we published 
our factory list which gives gender-
disaggregated workforce data for all our 
mapped tier one to tier three sites and is 
updated every two months.
We’ve developed and disseminated a new 
subcontracting policy. This strengthens our 
long-held requirement for suppliers to declare 
all factories involved in the manufacture of 
ASOS products and work with us to make 
sure only approved units are used.
We’ve traced 44% of our cotton to its 
country of origin, 60% of our viscose to the 
fibre producer and 90% of our leather back 
to tannery level. 
We’ll continue to expand both the 
breadth and depth of our disclosure and 
have committed to mapping our product 
supply chain down to tier five for key raw 
materials by 2020 (see our Modern Slavery 
Statement).
“ We’re working towards full 
visibility of our entire supply chain, 
all the way back to raw material.”

Animal welfare
We strongly believe that no animals should 
suffer in the name of fashion or cosmetics. 
So we regularly review our animal welfare 
policy and guidelines for buyers and 
suppliers to make sure we continue to 
advance animal welfare standards in our 
supply chain. We promote alternatives to 
animal-derived materials by featuring faux 
fur, non-leather and synthetic down products 
in our collections. And we continuously 
update training and guidance, including 
how to ensure faux fur is truly fake with our 
Quality Control team in Barnsley and our 
retail teams, suppliers and brands.
Working with others to improve 
supply chain practices
We’re engaging in a number of initiatives 
to collaboratively address challenges in 
implementing labour standards, including:
—  ACT, an initiative which brings together 
17 clothing brands and trade unions to 
address the issue of living wage in the 
textile and garment supply chain 
—  Fast-forward, an auditing initiative 
involving other major UK retailers, 
aimed at addressing UK-specific supply 
chain issues and promoting best practice 
standards across the industry
—  Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), an 
alliance of companies, NGOs and trade 
unions which promotes labour standards 
in global supply chains.
Sustainable sourcing
There are four elements that continue to 
define our focus on sustainable sourcing.
1  Traceability of raw materials: 
mapping our commodities to better 
understand and influence how they’re

OUR CUSTOMERS
Helping young people to look, feel and be their best
At ASOS, we focus relentlessly on reflecting 
the needs of our customers all over the 
world. We do this in two ways: by ensuring 
that our products and communications 
are inclusive, responsible and celebrate 
diversity, and by providing the best possible 
customer care 24/7.
Inclusive products and 
communications
We celebrate and promote our customers’ 
diversity through our clothing ranges, our 
social media presence, our editorial content 
and our website.
Positive self-image
We always want to use our influence among 
young fashion lovers in a responsible way 
by promoting a healthy, positive body image 
to our customers. We do this by:
—  Making sure our own Model Welfare 
policy and guidelines on digital 
manipulation are fully followed to protect 
our models and our customers
—  Bringing in experts to train our 
employees on body image and health
—  Publishing articles on diverse and 
inspirational young men and women 
in ASOS Magazine, focusing on their 
achievements not their looks
—  Communicating with customers  
about issues such as body image  
and mental health
—  Working with the anti-bullying charity, 
the Diana Award, to produce and run 
sessions to help open up discussions 
with young people about body image 
issues – between September 2016 and 
August 2017 over 650 students between 
13 and 18 years old took part
—  Partnering with the UK’s eating  
disorders charity, Beat, to provide an 
online support service which helped 
more than 10,000 people with eating 
disorders between September 2016 and 
August 2017
—  Working with youth homelessness charity 
Centrepoint to provide essential mental 
health services for young adults at risk
Focusing on disability
Our Celebrating Diversity disability 
programme aims to raise awareness of 
disability internally, improve access to our 
products and services for customers with 
disabilities, and create opportunities for 
young people with disabilities. Some of our 
activities in the past 12 months include:
ASOS and British Paralympic 
Association 
—  Designing and producing the ceremony 
and formal wear for 600 Paralympics 
GB athletes and staff at the Rio 2016 
Summer Paralympic Games
—  Extending our current partnership with 
the British Paralympic Association to 
include the PyeongChang 2018 Winter 
Paralympic Games and the Tokyo 2020 
Summer Paralympics
—  Hosting Come and Try sessions where 
students from Haverstock School in 
Camden played wheelchair basketball 
with British Paralympic Association 
coaches.
Promoting positive self-image through ASOS Magazine
Our quarterly magazine goes out to customers in the UK, France, 
Germany and the USA. Customers praise our magazine for pushing 
boundaries and being inclusive across its content, whether this is 
by featuring people from diverse ethnic backgrounds or with body 
shapes you don’t typically see in mainstream media. We see words 
like ‘empowering’, ‘inspiring’ and ‘refreshing’ again and again in 
customers’ feedback. The magazine team have a shared belief that 
we’re not just here to sell clothes, but to help our audience negotiate a 
time in their life that isn’t always easy. Our 2017 issues have featured 
Hunter Schafer, a teenage transgender rights activist; Mama Cax, an 
amputee and body positivity advocate; and Anne-Marie Imafidon, 
the founder of a social enterprise encouraging girls to get involved in 
science, technology, engineering and maths careers. 
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 42
Accessible website 
—  As part of the ASOS web redesign 
project we’ve given real attention to 
making the user experience accessible 
to everyone, whether people have 
vision, dexterity or any other barriers 
to accessibility. The User Experience 
team have been working to established 
technical implementation guidelines 
(The Web Accessibility Guidelines or 
WCAGs), and we’re aiming to be one 
of the first fashion e-commerce sites to 
achieve AA standard.
—  We’ve done research with the RNIB 
using 20 participants with different 
disabilities to truly understand how they 
access websites and apps and what they 
expect from a fashion e-commerce site. 
This is helping us to identify the work 
we still have to do and understand how 
other sites and apps are addressing the 
same questions.
We donated £88,229 in products to 
disability charity Scope to raise money 
for employment accessibility programmes 
for young adults. And we’re a member 
of the Business Disability Forum who are 
helping us to make ASOS a disability-smart 
organisation.
Customer care 
To make sure that our customers have full 
confidence in our experience, we provide 
a 24/7/365 customer care service. This 
year we handled 16.1m contacts including 
phone calls, social media, emails and live 
chat. We also have up-to-date information 
on our website help pages in nine different 
languages.
One of the most important things we do for 
our customers is provide fraud protection 
and data privacy services. Our Fraud 
Prevention team work 24/7 to make sure 
threats are mitigated as efficiently and 
effectively as possible. This year, our team 
prevented £10.9m of fraud attacks across 
80,108 orders. We also have technical 
and physical security controls to prevent 
unauthorised access to customer data, 
including access restrictions, encryption of 
certain customer data and alert systems, 
and give our customers the control over 
their data that they are entitled to expect.
OUR BUSINESS
Achieving growth while adding social value and 
minimising environmental impact
We believe in growing our business in a 
sustainable way while ensuring our long-
term commercial viability. We do this by 
focusing on two things: our people and the 
environment.
Our people
At ASOS, we work hard to create a unique 
culture where people can feel valued, 
respected, enjoy their work, know they 
make a real difference each day and have 
some fun along the way. We want ASOS to 
be a diverse, inclusive and inspiring place 
to work that attracts the very best talent 
from around the world. 
All our employees (ASOSers, as we like to 
call them) and third-party colleagues are 
central to our success. As at 31 August 
2017, we employed 3,579 people 
including 3,463 full-time and 116 part-time 
ASOSers. Most people are based at our 
headquarters in Camden, North London, 
and our Customer Care site in Leavesden, 
with smaller teams in Paris, Birmingham, 
Berlin, New York and Sydney. To support our 
operations, we also employ people through 
our outsourced partners at our Barnsley 
fulfilment centre, and at our international 
Customer Care centres in Glasgow, Lisbon, 
Vladimir and Columbus, Ohio. 
We communicate regularly with everyone 
about our performance and objectives, and 
we encourage ASOSers to suggest where 
we can make improvements and fast track 
our business. This year we’ve continued to 
build employee engagement. We launched 
our values – authentic, brave and creative 
– at our first Leadership Summit at the 
start of the year; and each area then held 
activation sessions to bring it to life across 
the business. Our values are now part of 
ASOSers’ everyday thinking. As we grow 
and age, maintaining our culture and high 
levels of engagement is even more critical; 
and we’ve developed important initiatives 
with this in mind.
We introduced ASOS Anniversaries in April 
to celebrate more and more ASOSers who 
are staying with us for longer. We now 
celebrate each person’s ‘ASOS birthday’ 
every year with birthday coffee and cake. 
And for the bigger anniversaries (3, 5, 10 
and 15 years) we’re giving ASOSers extra 
holiday time and cash – and even naming 
products (10 years) and rooms (15 years) 
after people. 
It’s important that we don’t lose touch with 
our ASOSers, and we want to capture their 
creative, brave ideas in the decisions we 
make. With this in mind, we’ve launched an 
ASOS in Touch forum with representatives 
from all areas and locations of the business. 
A member of our executive team meets with 
these representatives regularly, giving them 
a direct line to our decision-makers. This 
group will help keep us true to our values 
and be a direct line to the wider ASOS 
population. 
Another key initiative has focused on 
wellbeing, especially mental health. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT continued ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 43
For the first time, we held events across 
our UK and global locations for Mental 
Health Awareness Week. We want to start 
breaking down the stigma around mental 
health – to give people the chance to talk 
openly about it and come up with ideas 
for supporting mental health, whether they 
have a condition or not. 
Alongside this, we’ve focused on inclusion 
on a wider scale with ASOS All In – our 
commitment to treating everyone as equals 
and encouraging diversity. We’re proud 
that ASOSers represent all sections of 
society and the diverse customer base we 
enjoy – and that we work in an environment 
where everyone feels respected and valued 
for who they are. This year we’ve kicked off 
ASOS All In with Women In Tech – events 
and initiatives to support more women in 
our technology space, such as Women in 
Silicon Milkroundabout. We’ll be building 
on this next year, focusing on LGBTQIA and 
disability with events, external speakers and 
education for all ASOSers. 
As well as these initiatives, we’ve been 
looking at nailing the basics and setting 
ourselves up for the future. As we expand 
globally, we need to hire great people who 
will support our growth. We’ve reviewed 
and put in place solid foundations for our 
people policies and contracts globally. We 
regularly include our third-party colleagues 
in Company-wide communications and 
show our appreciation of the contributions 
they make by including them in our 
employee discount programme.
Having strong ethical standards is important 
to us. We expect all our ASOSers and third-
party colleagues to act with integrity and 
behave ethically in everything they do. 
Attracting talent and investing in 
our people 
Attracting, developing and retaining the 
best people who will thrive in our fast-
paced environment remains our number 
one priority. This has been recognised by 
LinkedIn, who voted us as the second most 
attractive UK employer, up from sixth place 
last year. Over the past 12 months, we’ve 
strengthened our executive team in critical 
areas, with the promotions of Andy Berks 
to digital product director, Nick Loveday to 
retail director of womenswear and Stefan 
Pesticcio to retail director of menswear. 
We also made some key strategic 
appointments in our Global Trading, 
Technology, People Experience, Finance, 
Supply Chain, Content and Engagement, 
Brand Experience, Corporate Responsibility, 
and Legal teams. Across the business, 
apprenticeships and internships help us to 
attract more junior and emerging talent, 
and we continue to build partnerships with 
a variety of universities and colleges.
Once we have the best talent on board, we 
develop our people by offering opportunities 
that match both their professional and 
personal aspirations. We have a robust 
learning offer to support them through 
their journey here at ASOS, focusing on 
employability and personal development. 
We greet people on their first day with an 
immersive induction, including a history of 
the business, time with our executive team 
and a tour of our HQ to see everything 
from our Technology department to the 
Catwalk. Once people have settled in, we 
offer a varied learning offer for people at 
all levels of the business. Leadership and 
management development takes place in-
house and during away days, and we have 
programmes available on a mobile platform 
so people can enjoy training on demand. 
We support everyone with their professional 
qualifications; and we offer diverse role- 
and department-specific training, including 
coaching, classroom, psychometric, informal 
and social learning, all in line with the 
ASOS culture. 
We also encourage ASOSers to put time 
into the community and give them various 
chances to do this (see Our Community 
section on pages 45 and 46). As well as 
being a good thing to do in its own right, 
this kind of voluntary work helps people 
feel involved and gives them a stronger 
connection with our brand. Our overall aim 
is to ignite the passion which so clearly 
exists throughout ASOS by creating an 
environment where it’s easy for each person 
to fulfil their true potential.
Increasing the number of 
customer orders that can be 
transported in a single journey 
ASOS packages customer orders 
differently for shipping, to optimise the 
space in lorry trailers. Traditionally, 
parcels are placed on a pallet and then 
loaded into a lorry trailer. But since July 
2016, carriers have been encouraged 
to load parcels loose in the trailer. 
This means there’s no need for pallet 
wrap for the roughly 40 pallets per 
day (saving 14 metres of plastic wrap 
per pallet). And following this loose 
load method, each lorry can also carry 
another 8,000 parcels on average, 
meaning up to 20 fewer lorries on the 
road each week. We’re continuing to 
support this and hope that all carriers 
will soon be using the loose load system.
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 44
We are aware of the importance of 
making it easy for ASOSers to raise any 
concerns that they have about their job, 
and what they see and hear. We have a 
‘Whistleblowing’ helpline as is required 
of a business the size of ASOS, with a 
confidential helpline that is available 24/7 
in different local languages. We proactively 
promote this each year to ensure that we 
are never complacent.
Equal opportunities
ASOS is committed to encouraging diversity 
and inclusion, and discrimination of any 
form has no place in our business. We want 
each person to feel respected and able 
to do their best. This means recognising 
their individuality, their personal styles and 
ways of working. We treat all ASOSers 
equally regardless of age, disability, sex, 
sexual orientation, gender reassignment, 
marital or civil partner status, family status, 
race, nationality, ethnic or national origin, 
religion or belief. And if anyone develops 
a long-term illness or disability, we do our 
best to support them to return to work. 
We’re particularly keen to ensure that 
women have equal chances to develop 
fulfilling careers and rise to the top of 
our business. On 31 August 2017 there 
were three women and four men on our 
Board. Across ASOS, 63% of our full-time 
employees are women and 37% men (2016: 
65% women and 35% men), while 92% of 
our part-time employees are women and 8% 
men (2016: 93% women and 7% men).
Safety
Our employees and everyone working  
on behalf of ASOS are entitled to work  
in a safe environment. We carry out health 
and safety risk assessments regularly  
and frequently review our safety policy,  
‘Be Smart’. During the 2017 financial 
year, we had no reportable work-related 
incidents under the Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR) (2016: none). 
Environment
As an online business, we deliver products 
directly to customers without the need 
for bricks and mortar stores. We ship 
to customers in over 230 countries and 
territories from our fulfilment centres in 
Germany, the UK and the US. So the 
biggest environmental impacts from our 
business are waste from our packaging and 
carbon emissions from customer deliveries 
and the running of our buildings. This is 
where we’re largely focusing our efforts to 
improve operational and resource efficiency.
Carbon footprint
Our carbon footprint continues to increase 
in line with our business growth. We’ve also 
seen an increase in our carbon impact as 
we increase the transparency of our carbon 
reporting.
We can only publish emissions data from 
the previous year in this report due to 
differing reporting timeframes. For the 
year ended 31 August 2016, our total 
carbon footprint rose to 207,650 tonnes 
of CO
2
 (2015: 48,336 tonnes). Overall, 
emissions have increased by 329% 
compared to the previous year, primarily 
due to improvements in data quality and an 
expansion of our reporting scope.
Our carbon intensity has increased to 
5.27kg CO
2
 per customer order. This is 
largely due to widening the scope of our 
carbon emissions reporting to include 
emissions from inbound and inter-site 
transporting of goods, as well as from 
transporting customer returns.
Transporting goods
Inbound stock movements from suppliers, 
inter-site stock movements and outbound 
deliveries/returns to and from customers 
make up the largest proportion of our 
footprint, accounting for 92.3% of 
emissions. So reducing delivery emissions 
is an ongoing priority for ASOS. In the last 
year, we’ve reviewed our methodology for 
calculating our transportation emissions. 
And in doing so, we’ve been able to identify 
some important ways we can reduce the 
size of our footprint. For example, we’re 
more aware of which delivery/return 
routes and options (i.e. standard versus 
fast delivery option) are the most carbon 
intensive. This means we can start to work 
more closely with the carriers that cover 
these routes to minimise carbon emissions. 
We can also make better decisions about 
where to locate future regional hubs.
We’re continuing to increase the amount 
of stock we hold in our German fulfilment 
centre (Eurohub 2), where 85% of 
European orders, excluding the UK, are 
now fulfilled. This is helping us to reduce 
stock and vehicle movements across Europe 
and lower emissions as a result.
Waste
As well as continually reviewing our 
packaging options with suppliers to reduce 
the volume of packaging, we’re focusing on 
reusing and recycling used packaging. We 
recycle packaging from customer returns, 
apart from returns forms which currently 
aren’t recyclable. Between September 
2016 and August 2017, our returns 
processing site in the UK recycled 352 
tonnes of cardboard and sent 458 tonnes 
of plastic to be turned into manufacturing 
pellets. If we receive returns where the 
original garment packaging has clearly not 
been opened, we leave them in the original 
packaging rather than replacing it. 
We’ve become a member of RECycling of 
Used Plastics Limited (RECOUP), a not-for-
profit charity that works with stakeholders 
such as plastics manufacturers, brands 
and plastics recyclers to increase plastics 
recycling in the UK. By supporting RECOUP, 
we’re helping with plastics packaging 
research, engaging stakeholders from 
plastics recycling sectors, consulting with 
government bodies, advising on closed 
loop projects and sharing best practice.
We’ve also been working to produce a 
packaging impact assessment tool – this 
will allow us to more accurately calculate

OUR COMMUNITY
Making a positive difference to young people’s lives 
in the communities where we operate
Our community programmes aim to create 
opportunities for young adults to reach 
their full potential. Our community work is 
supported by ASOS, our employees and 
the ASOS Foundation – an independent 
charity (charity number 1153946). We do 
most of our work in the UK, particularly 
in the four areas where we employ the 
most people: London, Hemel Hempstead/
Leavesden, Barnsley and Birmingham. 
We also contribute money, resources and 
expertise to community projects in Kenya 
(where the ASOS Made in Kenya range 
is made) and India (where some of our 
product and IT suppliers are based). The 
ASOS Foundation works with long-term 
charity partners including The Prince’s 
Trust and Centrepoint in the UK, SOKO 
Community Trust and Wildlife Works 
Carbon Trust in rural Kenya, and Udayan 
Care in New Delhi, India.
UK community work
ASOS community:
—  We gave continued support to Call to 
Create at the Roundhouse in Camden, 
who offer circus, dance, poetry and 
music programmes for young adults,  
and also ran a coding club for  
11 to 14 year-olds.
—  Our funding for entrepreneurship 
programmes in partnership with  
Barnsley College enabled the 
college to run their popular Global 
Entrepreneurship Week, involving  
800 students and 25 employers.
ASOS Foundation:
—  We continued to fund a clinical lead at 
Centrepoint HQ in London and committed 
new funding for two health specialists 
in Barnsley to support homeless young 
people with complex needs in the town.
—  Funding from the ASOS Foundation 
enabled Centrepoint to launch the UK’s 
first specialist helpline for 16 to 25 
year-olds who are homeless or at risk 
of homelessness – this aims to intervene 
early and work with the estimated 
130,000 young people at risk of 
homelessness each year.
—  We trained 70 young people through 
a range of courses run with our partner 
The Prince’s Trust – in 2017, these 
included Get Started with Web Design, 
Get Started with Fashion, Get Started 
with Customer Care, Get Into Fashion 
and Get Into Technology.
—  The Prince’s Trust awarded 104 
young people development grants for 
equipment to enable them to access 
work or training.
the emissions associated with our mailing 
and garment packaging. It will also help us 
to make more informed decisions around 
product materials and our supply chain,  
as we’ll be able to compare their impact  
on emissions.
To help us meet our goal of zero waste from 
all our offices, we’re having our unwanted 
office furniture, electrical equipment and 
used ink cartridges collected to be reused 
or recycled instead of being sent to landfill. 
Energy efficiency in buildings
Emissions from our buildings make up the 
second largest proportion of our carbon 
footprint, 3.2%. Although our total carbon 
footprint increased significantly compared 
to the previous year, our building emissions 
actually decreased by 8%, showing the 
effect of reducing energy consumption at 
our premises. 
We’ve taken several measures to improve 
building energy efficiency over the past year:
—  An environmental appraisal for the 
refurbishment of our London head office 
including detail on energy use, water 
stewardship, waste reduction and use  
of sustainable materials.
—  Strengthening the roof at Eurohub 2  
so we can install solar panels.
—  Replacing all the external lighting  
at our Barnsley fulfilment centre with  
low-emission LED alternatives.
We are also carrying out a renewables 
appraisal for a new US fulfilment centre hub 
so that renewable energy generation can 
be factored into the building design.
Employee travel
Our business travel emissions increased 
by 56% compared with 2015. This is 
partly down to our growth, and partly 
due to a change in the methodology we 
use to calculate flight emissions. We now 
follow Defra best practice and account for 
radiative forcing in flight emissions – the 
higher impact of greenhouse gases when 
they’re released at altitude. 
In the UK, we started an employee car-
sharing scheme at our Barnsley, Hemel 
Hempstead and Leavesden premises. 
This has led to a saving of 40,612 
miles, equating to 7.98 tonnes of CO
2
 
(September 2015 to 30 July 2017).
STRATEGIC REPORT ASOS PLC 46
—  We established our first Get Into Fashion 
course which led to nine young people 
being offered temporary roles in the 
ASOS Buying and Merchandising teams 
– five students were also offered 12-month 
Fixed Term Contract roles after finishing 
our Get Into Technology programme.
—  We supported Arrival Education’s 
Success for Life programme for 
young people with potential who are 
disengaged from school and learning 
due to challenging circumstances in 
their personal lives. As part of this, we 
also set up ASOS employee mentoring, 
a GCSE focus day to support those at 
risk of not getting 5 A* to Cs, and a 
workshop for students interested in law. 
Kenya – Project Pipeline
—  We continued to maintain the original 6km 
pipeline installed to provide fresh drinking 
water to 3,800 people in the Kasigau 
region, including two schools.
—  We delivered emergency water supplies 
by truck to 4,000 primary and 
secondary school pupils. 
—  We provided three large water storage 
tanks and one small tank along with 
piping at Buguta Secondary School as 
well as an extra-large water storage tank 
at Mackinnon Road Secondary School.
—  We connected the Cafgem school to 
mains water and provided one extra-
large water storage tank.
—  We continued to run Stitching Academy 
Hub programmes, offering graduates 
low-cost space and equipment to rent so 
they can start their own businesses.
—  We continued to deliver the Pipeline 
Roadshow, a programme of community 
workshops in rural villages including 
women’s health, free eye-care clinics 
and training in financial management for 
women and families.
India – Udayan Care
—  Through the ASOS Foundation, we 
continued to support 72 children at 
Udayan Care homes throughout Delhi 
and Greater Noida.
—  Our second Udayan Care home in 
Kurukshetra, which will include space for 
a community mentoring programme and 
IT centre, will open at the end of 2017.
—  We’re currently looking for land to buy 
for our third Udayan Care home.
—  Ten ASOS employees were able to 
volunteer in India at Udayan Care this 
year, refurbishing living spaces and 
running workshops for the children as part 
of our fourth annual Give a Week Away.
Employee involvement
We encourage all ASOS employees to 
be more involved with our communities 
and offer them various ways to donate, 
fundraise and volunteer. During the year, 
ASOS employees have been engaged in:
—  Payroll Giving: more than 15% of 
employees make regular donations to 
charity from their pay – we received our 
Gold Quality Mark for Payroll Giving in 
April.
—  Payday Pennies: launched in 2014, 
13% of employees now donate the 
pennies from their salary directly to the 
ASOS Foundation.
—  Give a Day Away: our employees 
volunteered 3,253 hours to give 
time and expertise to our community 
programme partners or to their chosen 
charity or community group.
—  ASOS Active and ASOS Engage: 
employees doing sponsored challenges 
and organising fundraising events 
contributed more than £117,000 to the 
ASOS Foundation.
—  Employee sample sales: sample sales 
raised more than £108,000 for the 
ASOS Foundation.
ASOS employees raise over £45,000 
in second Walk for Water Challenge
Our big annual fundraiser took place 
for the second year running, with ASOS 
Barnsley, Birmingham, Hemel Hempstead 
and London employees all taking part in 
one of the four 24-mile routes.
All money raised went to support our 
partner SOKO Community Trust with water 
projects throughout Kenya. Our priority is 
more pipes, tanks, catchments, repairs and 
boreholes. This will make sure that 4,000 
children have clean water to drink and 
wash with and will keep them safe from 
disease so that they can stay in school.

CHAIRMAN’S GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
Our context
ASOS is a fast-paced, dynamic, 
entrepreneurial business. Having grown at 
around 30% for many years, our trajectory 
is impressive and we’re incredibly proud to 
be part of this story. But we are not blind 
to its challenges and are continually aware 
of the need to maintain an appropriate 
governance infrastructure that supports the 
increasing size and profile of the business, 
and monitor the ever-evolving regulatory 
and legal landscape, while preserving the 
culture that enables ASOS to move and 
grow at speed. 
Our take on corporate governance
As a Board, we recognise and appreciate 
the uniquely special culture that is ASOS. 
Corporate governance, without care, can 
easily become an ineffective box-ticking 
exercise. Internally, we embrace ‘doing the 
right thing’ as core to how we do business; 
it’s even the name of our Code of Integrity. 
‘Doing the right thing’ speaks to a mindset 
and an attitude that we as a Board strive 
to embed throughout the business. For us, 
this is primarily about establishing the right 
culture and values in our people to produce 
the right way of thinking and behaviour 
in all of our actions and interactions. We 
believe this underpins effective corporate 
governance that can build long-term value 
for shareholders, a sustainable business 
and a trusted brand. Of course, this must 
be supported by policies, processes and 
training. But beyond that, we empower our 
people to use and trust their instincts. We 
aim to nurture people who engage with the 
spirit of why we do things in a certain way, 
not just the letter. This is a more meaningful 
approach to governance for our business 
and our demographic.
Governance highlights over the year
We previously identified a need for a 
dedicated Business Assurance function 
to increase the effectiveness of our risk 
management and compliance. This has 
been in place since January 2017 and is 
successfully embedded in the business, with 
increased focus on enhancing resilience 
across key areas. 
Read more in our Risk Report on  
pages 26 to 31.
I’d like to personally commend our Ethical 
Trading and CR teams for the great work 
done on our first Modern Slavery statement. 
We’re proud of the commendations this 
has received which only reinforces our 
commitment and desire to embody Fashion 
with Integrity as a way of doing business. 
As an AIM-listed company, we fulfilled 
the requirements of the AIM ‘Rules for 
Companies – July 2016’ during the year. 
However, in recognition of best practice, 
we go beyond these rules to meet the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in a number of areas. In this spirit, 
we also conducted our first externally 
facilitated Board evaluation this year. 
I invite you to read more about our 
governance framework in the following 
Corporate Governance Report.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Board composition
As at 16 October 2017, the Board 
comprised the chairman, two executive 
directors and four other non-executive 
directors. A short biography of each of the 
directors in office at the year end is set out 
on pages 49 to 51. There were no changes 
to the composition of the Board during the 
financial year to 31 August 2017.
The composition of the Board is monitored 
by the Nomination Committee. The Board 
is satisfied that, between the directors, it 
has an effective and appropriate balance 
of skills and experience, including (without 
limitation) in the areas of retailing, fashion, 
finance, innovation, international trading 
operations, ecommerce and marketing. The 
Board is also satisfied that it has a suitable 
balance between independence (of both 
character and judgement) on the one hand, 
and knowledge of the Company on the 
other, to enable it to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively. All directors 
are encouraged to use their independent 
judgement and to constructively challenge 
all matters, whether strategic or operational.
We also have effective procedures in 
place to monitor and deal with conflicts of 
interest. The Board is aware of the other 
commitments and interests of its directors, 
and changes to these commitments and 
interests are reported to and, where 
appropriate, agreed with the rest of the 
Board. The Nomination Committee has 
formally reviewed these during the year. 
We are committed to encouraging diversity 
among our workforce and 43% of the ASOS 
Plc Board are women (three of seven). 
For further information on diversity within 
ASOS, read about our people in the 
Corporate Responsibility Report on page 42. 
It is the Board’s job to ensure that ASOS, its subsidiaries and all its 
businesses (together ‘the Group’) are managed for the long-term 
benefit of all shareholders, while having regard for employees, 
customers, suppliers, and our operational impact on the community 
and environment. The application of standards of corporate 
governance that are appropriate for the Group’s nature, culture, 
status, profile, size and circumstances is an important part of this 
job. We explain more about how the Board has delivered on that 
commitment in the last financial year across the following pages.
The board
The Board’s primary tasks are to enhance shareholders’ long-term interests by: 
—  reviewing and approving the Group’s overall strategy and direction
—  determining, maintaining and overseeing controls, audit processes and risk management 
policies to ensure ASOS operates effectively and sustainably in the long term
—  reviewing and approving the risk appetite, and the checks and controls applied to 
operate the business in line with that appetite
—  approving the financial statements, as well as revenue and capital budgets and plans
—  approving material agreements and non-recurring projects
—  reviewing and approving remuneration policies
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to three Board committees, as shown in the 
table below. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board is supported by the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, each of 
which has access to the resources, information and advice that it deems necessary, at the 
cost of the Company, to enable the committee to discharge its duties. Those duties are set 
out in the Terms of Reference of each committee, which are available at www.asosplc.com. 
Executive directors are not members of the Board committees, although they may be invited 
to attend meetings. The general counsel & company secretary acts as secretary to each 
committee. The minutes of committee meetings are circulated to all committee members and 
are given by each relevant committee chairman to the Board.
The specific responsibilities of each committee are set out within this section.
Audit 
Committee
The composition, responsibilities and activities of the Audit Committee 
are set out in the separate Audit Committee Report on pages 57 to 59.
Remuneration 
Committee
The composition, responsibilities and activities of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 60 
to 71, along with our Remuneration Policy and details of how that policy 
was implemented during the year to 31 August 2017.
Nomination 
Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises all of the independent non-
executive directors, and our chairman acts as the committee chair. 
Our CEO is also invited to attend meetings, unless he has a conflict of 
interest. Other directors, and the general counsel & company secretary, 
are invited only as appropriate (and only if there is no conflict of 
interest). The committee is also assisted by executive search consultants 
as and when required.
The committee’s principal responsibility is to evaluate the Board’s 
requirements and ensure that appropriate procedures are in place for 
the nomination, selection and succession of directors to meet those 
requirements. During the year to 31 August 2017 there was one scheduled 
meeting when the committee met to consider succession planning and to 
review conflicts of interest. Whilst there is no immediate plan to recruit to 
the Board, the Committee monitors Board composition to ensure that the 
skills and experience continue to be of the right mix to lead ASOS.

BOARD DIVERSITY ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 53
GOVERNANCE REPORT
Appointment, removal and  
re-election of directors
The Board makes decisions regarding the 
appointment and removal of directors and 
there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for appointments. Our Articles 
of Association state that one-third of the 
directors must stand for re-election by 
shareholders annually in rotation; that all 
directors must stand for re-election at least 
once every three years; and that any new 
directors appointed during the year must 
stand for election at the AGM immediately 
following their appointment. However, 
to underline their accountability to 
shareholders and the Board’s commitment 
to appropriate corporate governance, 
each director offers themselves for re-
election at the upcoming AGM. The Board 
unanimously believes that the contributions 
of each director continue to be effective. 
We therefore encourage shareholders to 
support their re-election.
Roles of the chairman and chief 
executive officer
There is a clear division of responsibility at 
the head of the Company. Our chairman 
is responsible for running the business of 
the Board and for ensuring appropriate 
strategic focus and direction. Our CEO 
is responsible for proposing the strategic 
focus to the Board, implementing it once 
it has been approved and overseeing 
the management of ASOS through the 
Executive Board. 
Board and committee meetings
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision, through which it 
manages ASOS, with a minimum of eight 
Board meetings scheduled each year to 
consider those matters. Before the start of 
each financial year, a schedule of dates for 
that year’s eight Board meetings (as well 
as the committee meetings) is compiled 
to align as far as reasonably practicable 
with the Company’s financial calendar on 
the one hand, and the trading calendar 
on the other, while also ensuring an 
appropriate spread of meetings across the 
financial year. This may be supplemented 
by additional meetings when required. 
The table below sets out Board attendance 
during the year to 31 August 2017.
The Board and its committees receive 
appropriate and timely information prior 
to each meeting; a formal agenda is 
produced for each meeting, and Board 
and committee papers are distributed 
several days before meetings take place. 
Any director can challenge proposals, and 
decisions are taken democratically after 
discussion. Any director who feels that any 
concern remains unresolved after discussion 
may ask for that concern to be noted in 
the minutes of the meeting, which are then 
circulated to all directors. Specific actions 
arising from such meetings are agreed by 
the Board or relevant committee and then 
followed up by management.
The directors also have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretarial 
team, including the general counsel & 
company secretary, who is responsible for 
ensuring that all Board procedures have 
been complied with. Individual directors 
are also able to take independent legal and 
financial advice at the Company’s expense 
when necessary to support the performance 
of their duties as directors. Throughout 
their period in office, the directors are 
also updated on the Group’s businesses 
and the regulatory and industry-specific 
environments in which they operate by 
way of written briefings and meetings with 
senior executives and, where appropriate, 
external parties. Appropriate training is 
also available to all directors to develop 
their knowledge and ensure they stay up 
to date on matters for which they have 
responsibility as a Board member. 
Key Board actions during the year
At the beginning of the last financial 
year, the Board agreed to pay a total of 
£20.2m in cash to secure a comprehensive 
co-existence and a full, final and global 
settlement of all trade mark infringement 
disputes with high-performance cycle wear 
manufacturer Assos of Switzerland GmbH 
(Assos), and German menswear retailer, 
Anson’s Herrenhaus KG (Anson’s). The 
disputes had resulted in several cases being 
heard in court, as well as multiple trade 
mark registry actions around the world.
Following a lot of work by the Executive 
Board and their senior management 
team, the Board reviewed and approved 
a detailed, ambitious but realistic long-
term plan for the business, seeking to both 
take advantage of – and be prepared for 
– upcoming potentially disruptive trends 
and developments across the business 
departments and our key markets.
The next phases of the ongoing 
development of our infrastructure were 
also approved by the Board. We agreed 
to invest in further automation and facilities 
improvements in our Barnsley warehouse, 
the opening and then Phase 2 extension 
of our new Eurohub 2 fulfilment centre, 
the start of a new project to open a US 
fulfilment centre near Atlanta, Georgia 
during the next financial year, and the 
further development of our head office in 
Camden, London.
The Board also authorised further capital 
expenditure into several transformational 
technology projects. These will further 
enhance our ability to grow and scale with 
PLC Board meetings Committee meetings

In the previous financial year, we identified 
the need for a dedicated Business

management and compliance function. This 
has been in place since January 2017, 
and has added value to strengthen links

Board performance
Looking back
An effective Board is vital to the success 
of ASOS. Annually the Board evaluates 
its performance, usually led by the 
chairman. Key outputs from last year’s 
internal evaluation included more focus 
on succession planning, and increased 
interaction between the Board and the 
senior management team. In response, over 
the last year, the Nomination Committee 
met to discuss succession planning. A series 
of departmental ‘deep dives’, led by senior 
management on operationally significant 
areas, were also instigated with the Board.
Looking forward
Having carried out internal reviews for the 
last few years, a different approach to Board 
evaluation was taken last year through an 
externally facilitated exercise. This provided 
a useful external expert perspective on the 
performance of the Board. The exercise 
was led by the senior independent director 
(SID), rather than the chairman. The external 
review was facilitated by Prism Cosec, a 
provider with no prior connection to ASOS. 
Following a review of Board and committee 
agendas, papers and associated minutes 
from the previous financial year, focus areas 
were then compiled in collaboration with 
Prism, the SID and the company secretary. 
Prism then conducted private one-to-one 
interviews with each director and the 
company secretary, before producing their 
final report for discussion with the SID. 
Individual matters were discussed directly 
between the SID and the relevant director, 
while key collective outputs were shared 
collectively with the Board in the September 
Board meeting. 
The proposed resulting actions include: 
—  Holding more off-site Board meetings.
—  Build on the Board’s exposure to senior 
management.
—  Further work on succession planning.
Executive board 
The Executive Board consists of the 
executive directors and key functional 
directors and meets weekly. Under the 
chairmanship of our CEO, the Executive 
Board is collectively responsible for 
developing the proposed strategic focus 
for submission to the Board, the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s business and 
its overall trading, operational and financial 
performance in fulfilment of that strategy, 
as well as plans and budgets approved 
by the Board of Directors. It also manages 
and oversees key risks, management 
development and corporate responsibility 
programmes. The CEO reports to the Board 
on issues, progress and recommendations 
for change that come out of the Executive 
Board’s meetings. As at 16 October 2017, 
20% of the Executive Board are women 
(two of ten).

Financial controls
ASOS has an established framework of 
internal financial controls, the effectiveness 
of which is regularly reviewed by the 
Executive Board, the Audit Committee and 
the Board as an ongoing assessment of 
significant risks facing the Company.
—  As outlined in this Corporate 
Governance Report, the Board is 
responsible for reviewing and approving 
overall Company strategy, approving 
revenue and capital budgets and 
plans, and for determining the financial 
structure of ASOS including treasury, tax 
and dividend policy. Monthly results and 
variances from plans and forecasts are 
reported to the Board.
—  The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its duties regarding the 
financial statements and accounting 
policies, as well as with the maintenance 
of proper internal business and 
operational and financial controls, 
including the results of work performed 
by the internal audit function. The 
committee provides a direct link between 
the Board and the external and internal 
auditors through regular meetings.
—  The Board has established an 
organisational authority structure, with 
clearly defined lines of responsibility 
and approval thresholds, to specify the 
transactions requiring its approval. The 
chief financial officer is responsible 
for the functional leadership and 
development of ASOS’s finance 
activities, including compliance with this 
organisational authority structure.
—  There are comprehensive procedures for 
budgeting and planning, for monitoring 
and reporting to the Board business 
performance against those budgets and 
plans, and for forecasting expected 
performance over the remainder of the 
financial period. These cover profits, 
cash flows, capital expenditure and 
balance sheets. Monthly results are 
reported against budget and compared 
with the prior year, and forecasts for 
the current financial year are regularly 
revised in light of actual performance.
—  ASOS has a consistent system of prior 
appraisal for investments, overseen by 
the chief financial officer, with defined 
financial controls and procedures with 
which each business area is required to 
comply to be granted investment funds 
for development. Regular post-investment 
reviews are also carried out to check the 
extent to which investment cases were 
delivered in line with plans.
Non-financial controls
ASOS has a number of non-financial 
controls covering areas such as legal and 
regulatory compliance, business integrity, 
health and safety, risk management, 
business continuity and corporate 
responsibility (including ethical trading, 
supplier standards, environmental concerns 
and employment diversity). The key 
elements of those non-financial controls are 
set out opposite. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 55
GOVERNANCE REPORT
—  Appropriate standards and policies: 
the Board is committed to maintaining 
appropriate standards for all of our 
business activities and ensuring that 
these standards are set out in written 
policies. Key examples of such standards 
and policies include Do The Right Thing, 
our Code of Integrity (designed to ensure 
that everybody who works for and 
on behalf of ASOS acts with integrity, 
behaves ethically and works within 
best practice); Fashion with Integrity, 
our corporate responsibility framework 
standards, which include objectives 
relating to the impact that the Group’s 
activities have on the environment, 
workplace, marketplace and community 
(further details of which are set out on 
pages 36 to 46) of this report; the ASOS 
Supplier Standards (which set out the 
core trading requirements expected of 
all ASOS suppliers). 
—  Appropriate approvals: all material 
contracts are reviewed by the 
Procurement and Legal departments, and 
signed by a senior executive of ASOS.
—  Appropriate oversight: as businesses 
change, so do their challenges and risks. 
Given ASOS’s continued growth, the 
Board regularly reviews all standards and 
policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
to ASOS as its size and shape evolves. 
The most significant of these is our risk 
management process, which is based 
around our Risk Register. Business 
Assurance has primary responsibility 
for the Risk Register. It has deep links 
with the executive directors and senior 
management team in its oversight of risk 
and its management. Through its review, 
and the implementation of business 
continuity plans to address key risks with 
an immediate impact, risks facing the 
business are re-assessed and potential 
actions are considered and implemented 
to mitigate against those risks and prepare 
the business to handle them should they 
arise. The Risk Register is reviewed on a 
regular basis and presented to the Audit 
Committee twice a year.
—  Appropriate assistance: each year, 
Deloitte, our internal auditors, carry out 
reviews of our internal processes in a 
number of different areas to assist with 
our risk management processes, provide 
an objective independent view of the 
effectiveness of various procedures 
and policies, and identify where 
improvements could be made. Deloitte 
report to the Audit Committee; and the 
day-to-day relationship is managed 
by our general counsel & company 
secretary and the chief financial officer 
with links into Business Assurance. 
The internal audit plan for each year 
is compiled after consultation with the 
Executive Board members approved by 
the Audit Committee; and the reports 
and recommendations from each audit 
are reviewed by the relevant business 
department, the Executive Board, Audit 
Committee and Business Assurance. 
—  Appropriate engagement: recognising 
that, where standards and policies 
apply across ASOS, they are only 
effective if their intended audiences fully 
engage with them, and that ASOS has 
a non-traditional but effective culture, 
we dedicate a lot of time and effort to 
ensure that all ASOS-wide standards 
and policies in all areas (including 
business integrity, anti-bribery, gifts 
and hospitality, intellectual property 
and design rights) are written and 
communicated to the organisation in a 
way that resonates with and engages 
ASOSers.
—  Appropriate internal disclosure: with a 
business as large as ASOS, we know 
we rely on our people to be our eyes 
and ears on what’s happening across 
the organisation. So, under the banner 
of ‘Say It’, we have a number of ways 
in which ASOSers can provide us with 
feedback on any matter, including 
anything that just doesn’t feel right. 
One of those – called We’re Listening 
– is through an external independent 
provider which anyone connected to 
ASOS can contact to share concerns 
about the business. This service, 
which is anonymous, multilingual 
and independent, can be contacted 
through a website portal or by calling a 
local-rate telephone number. The Audit 
Committee is advised of any significant 
concerns raised through this service and 
subsequent investigations. We ensure 
that all ASOSers, new and long-serving, 
know of these feedback channels and 
encourage their use across ASOS. 
Relations with shareholders
ASOS is committed to communicating 
openly with its shareholders to ensure 
that its strategy and performance are 
clearly understood. We communicate with 
shareholders through the Annual Report 
and Accounts, full-year and half-year 
announcements, trading updates and the 
annual general meeting (AGM); and we 
encourage shareholders’ participation 
in face-to-face meetings. A range of 
corporate information (including all ASOS 
announcements and presentations) is also 
available to shareholders, investors and the 
public on our corporate website,  
www.asosplc.com. 
Private shareholders
The AGM is the principal forum for 
dialogue with private shareholders, and we 
encourage all shareholders to attend and 
participate. The Notice of Meeting is sent 
to shareholders at least 21 days before the 
meeting. The chairs of the Board and all 
committees, together with all other directors, 
attend the AGM and are available to 
answer questions raised by shareholders. 
Shareholders vote on each resolution, by 
way of a poll. For each resolution, the 
number of votes received for, against and 
withheld is announced. The results of the 
AGM are subsequently published on  
www.asosplc.com.
Institutional shareholders
The directors actively seek to build a mutual 
understanding of objectives with institutional 
shareholders. Shareholder relations are 
managed primarily by the chief financial 
officer and director of investor relations, 
supported by our CEO as appropriate. Our 
chief executive officer and chief financial 
officer make presentations to institutional 
shareholders and analysts immediately 
following the release of the full-year and 
half-year results. ASOS communicates 
with institutional investors frequently 
through a combination of formal meetings, 
participation at investor conferences, 
roadshows and informal briefings with 
management. In addition, we review 
analysts’ notes and brokers’ briefings to 
achieve a wide understanding of investors’ 
views. 
The Board as a whole is kept informed 
of the views and concerns of major 
shareholders by briefings from the chief 
financial officer, supported by the director 
of investor relations when required. Any 
significant investment reports from analysts 
are also circulated to the Board. The non-
executive directors, including the senior 
independent non-executive director, are 
available to meet with major shareholders 
whenever required to discuss issues of 
importance to them. ASOS PLC 56

GOVERNANCE REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
All members of the Audit Committee appreciate the crucial role 
the committee plays in helping the Board to discharge its overall 
responsibility to protect as far as possible the long-term success 
of ASOS by appropriately managing the risks to the business. We 
do this by monitoring, reviewing and challenging the effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of control and processes in areas such as 
financial reporting, risk management, business continuity, and 
business assurance on critical topics like cyber security, fraud, 
bribery and corruption. The committee also monitors and reviews 
the appointment of ASOS’s external and internal auditors, the 
nature and scope of their work, and their independence and 
effectiveness. It is vital that we as a committee assess what 
processes and systems make ASOS more effective, robust and 
sustainable in the long term, while preserving and fostering the 
business’ agility, adaptability and growth. 
Audit Committee composition 
The Audit Committee currently comprises 
three independent non-executive directors: 
Ian Dyson (committee chair), Rita Clifton 
and Hilary Riva. The table below sets 
out each member’s attendance record at 
committee meetings during the financial 
year.
Committee  
member Role
Attendance 
record
Ian Dyson Committee chair 4/4
Rita Clifton Non-executive director 4/4
Hilary Riva Non-executive director 4/4
The Board is satisfied that the committee 
chair, Ian Dyson, has recent and relevant 
financial experience. He’s a chartered 
accountant, has held executive roles in 
financial positions in other companies and 
has chaired audit committees for a number 
of other listed companies. The committee’s 
other members have all played an active 
role in committee meetings held throughout 
the year.
Although not members of the Audit 
Committee, our Company chairman, 
our chief executive officer, our chief 
financial officer, our general counsel & 
company secretary, our finance director 
(Accounting & Control) and our business 
assurance manager are also invited 
to attend meetings, unless they have a 
conflict of interest. Other senior members 
of the Finance team are invited to attend 
meetings as appropriate, unless there’s a 
potential conflict of interest. 
The committee has engaged the following 
external advisers to help it meet its 
responsibilities, both of whom are 
invited to attend committee meetings 
unless they have a conflict of interest: 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) act as 
external auditors to ASOS and Deloitte 
act as our internal auditors. The Audit 
Committee chair and members also 
regularly meet with both the external and 
internal auditors, without the executive 
directors or members of the Finance team 
present. ASOS also receives advice as 
needed from KPMG, EY and Slaughter and 
May on tax and legal issues relating to 
corporate matters.
The Audit Committee: 
responsibilities
The committee’s principal responsibilities 
are: 
—  Monitoring the integrity of ASOS’s 
financial statements in relation to the 
Company’s financial performance
—  Reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes
—  Reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s financial and internal controls, 
including the process for the evaluation, 
assessment and management of risk
The full Terms of Reference for the 
committee are available on our corporate 
website, www.asosplc.com. They were last 
updated on 19 January 2017.
The Audit Committee met four times for 
scheduled meetings during the year. Its 
activities included: 
—  Reviewing and approving the  
Annual Report and Accounts to 
31 August 2016 and half-year results  
to 28 February 2017
—  Considering reports from the external 
auditors and identifying any accounting 
or judgemental issues requiring 
attention
—  Overseeing the appointment of and 
relationship with the external auditors, 
including an assessment of their 
independence and a review of the 
policy for use of external auditors to 
provide non-audit services
—  Reviewing and considering reports on 
the work of the internal audit function
—  Reviewing and approving the Group’s 
tax and treasury strategies 
—  Reviewing the capitalisation process for 
fixed assets
—  Reviewing the robustness of the cyber 
security processes and systems, and the 
work of the Cyber Security team
—  Reviewing the Company’s Business Risk 
Register and the risk mitigation actions 
undertaken during the year
—  Considering reports on the Company’s 
Gifts and Corporate Hospitality Policy
—  Reviewing the committee’s Terms of 
Reference ASOS PLC 58
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued
Financial reporting 
The Board has discussed areas of risk with 
the auditors and agree on the following 
areas of heightened risk to be reviewed 
and assessed in the audit of ASOS’s 
performance in the financial year to 
31 August 2017.
—  Capitalisation of costs may not 
be appropriate: given the increased 
capital expenditure during the year, 
there is a risk that additions may be 
incorrectly capitalised. 
—  Revenue may not be correctly 
recorded: as revenue is recognised 
on dispatch and the returns provision 
is based on estimates there is a risk 
that revenue may not be accurately 
recorded.
—  Inventory not recorded correctly: 
as a result of the increased inventory 
holding in the overseas warehouses 
and the fast-moving nature of the 
fashion market, there is an increased 
risk that the closing inventory is 
not accurately recorded or that the 
inventory provisioning is not complete 
in the financial statements. 
The committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of management’s 
accounting in relation to each of these 
significant risks and PwC reported to 
the committee on the work performed in 
assessing each during their audit. Details 
of this work are provided in PwC’s Audit 
Report on pages 76 to 79.
External audit 
The external auditors, PwC, were first 
appointed in the financial year to 31 
March 2008. The fees paid to PwC for 
the financial year to 31 August 2017 
were £246,000. In line with its Terms of 
Reference, the Audit Committee undertakes 
a thorough assessment of the quality, 
effectiveness, value and independence 
of the audit provided by PwC each year, 
seeking the views of the Board, together 
with those of relevant members of the 
Executive Board. 
The Board is satisfied that the Company 
has adequate policies and safeguards 
in place to ensure PwC maintain their 
objectivity and independence. The external 
auditors report to the Audit Committee 
annually on their independence. Periodic 
rotation of key audit partners is also 
required and, in line with that policy, 
having overseen our external auditing for 
five years, the previous audit partner from 
PwC stood down and was replaced by 
Andy Latham with effect from the financial 
year ended 31 August 2017. 
The Board has a formal policy on the 
Company’s relationship with PwC in 
respect of non-audit work. Proposals for 
all non-audit services above £50,000 
must be approved by the Audit Committee 
before being carried out, and PwC 
may only provide such services if their 
advice doesn’t conflict with their statutory 
responsibilities and ethical guidance. 
Following the most recent review, the 
Audit Committee recommended the 
reappointment of PwC as auditors 
of ASOS, and PwC expressed their 
willingness to continue. A resolution 
to reappoint PwC and a resolution to 
enable the directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 
2017 AGM. 
Risk management and internal 
controls 
The Board oversees risk management and 
has a policy of continuous identification 
and review of principal business risks. This 
includes the use of key internal controls 
and processes to identify key risks, and 
to consider how those risks may affect the 
achievement of business objectives and 
determine appropriate mitigation actions, 
taking into account the Company’s risk 
appetite. 
The Executive Board implements the 
internal controls and processes to put 
the Board’s policies on risk and control 
into effect, and provides assurance on 
compliance with these policies and 
processes. On a day-to-day basis, the 
business assurance manager facilitates the 
day-to-day operation of the Group Risk 
Management process. This is overseen by 
the general counsel & company secretary 
who has executive responsibility for Risk 
Management. The business assurance 
manager joined the business in January 
2017 to ensure there is a more integrated, 
deeper focus on applying and evolving 
risk management and internal controls 
throughout the business. 
As part of our risk management 
framework, our Business Risk Register, 
is reviewed regularly using a consistent 
approach to identify the impact and 
likelihood of any material risk to the 
business, as well as any mitigating factors 
or controls. The output of the risk review 
is reported on a regular basis to the 
Executive Board, the Audit Committee and 
the ASOS leadership team.
In the financial year to 31 August 2017, 
we undertook an unannounced cyber 
security breach simulation exercise to 
assess the Executive Board’s readiness to 
respond and deal with an actual incident. 
Security of customer data is a key risk to 
the business, with significant reputational 
impact for ASOS that could materially 
impact the business’s viability should 
such a breach occur. It helped to both 
ensure that risk and crisis management 
is embedded within our key processes 
and to identify other key mitigation and 
planning that we could put in place to 
be better prepared for the crystallisation 
of a key risk. Alongside the risk register 
review, we also repeated the Black Swan 
risk review process which was initiated 
in the previous financial year to identify 
unlikely – but potentially significant – risks  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 59
GOVERNANCE REPORT
that could affect the business. This has 
helped to strengthen our holistic view of 
risk and encourage a culture that’s never 
complacent about identifying new and 
evolving risks. 
We continue to make particular effort 
to ensure that all ASOS-wide processes 
and controls are written, positioned and 
refreshed in such a way that everyone 
connected with ASOS can understand 
and engage with them. Such an approach 
continues to be essential for these 
processes and controls to be effective 
across our fast-moving high-growth 
business. 
The Board is satisfied that the risk 
management and internal controls systems 
for all parts of the business operated 
effectively for the financial year to 
31 August 2017 and up to and including 
the date of this report.
Internal audit 
Our internal audit function is outsourced 
to Deloitte, who update the committee at 
each meeting on their ongoing reviews. 
The fees paid to Deloitte for the financial 
year to 31 August 2017 were £210,000. 
The committee reviewed the schedule of 
planned internal audits undertaken during 
the year and monitored progress in fixing 
the management actions highlighted by 
these audits. Key internal audits conducted 
included reviews of zonal pricing, fraud, 
anti-bribery and corruption procedures, 
carrier contractor compliance, and 
the core controls in place for the new 
finance and retail IT systems ahead of 
implementation. 
A schedule of internal audit review 
projects for the financial year to  
31 August 2018 was approved by  
the Audit Committee in March.
Committee evaluation
During this financial period, an externally 
facilitated Board evaluation to assess the 
effectiveness of the Board and the Board 
committees was undertaken by Prism 
Cosec, as explained on page 54 of this 
report. This review concluded that the 
Audit Committee is working effectively.
Our priorities for the year ahead
During 2018, the committee will continue 
to focus on the integrity of the financial 
controls, risk management systems and 
robustness of the Company’s cyber security 
arrangements, to make sure they reflect the 
changing risks of our high-growth business. 
The security of our customer data will be 
a key focus in the financial year ahead, 
and this will be regularly monitored by 
the committee. The committee will also 
oversee the governance of the various 
transformation projects that are ongoing 
across the business to ensure that those 
projects are being appropriately managed 
and sequenced, both from an individual 
perspective and holistically.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I present the Remuneration Committee’s report 
for the year to 31 August 2017, my second report as Committee Chair. 
Business strategy and remuneration 
philosophy
The Committee is pleased to report that 
the Management team has continued to 
deliver against the key facets of ASOS’s 
business strategy, including those reflected 
within the remuneration arrangements 
both for executive directors and ASOSers. 
ASOS remains committed to driving growth 
in customers and revenue within a fast 
moving, dynamic environment while also 
delivering a sustainable level of profit 
growth for our shareholders. 
To be successful in its mission to become the 
World’s Number One Fashion Destination 
for 20-somethings, ASOS needs to be able 
to attract, motivate and retain the top talent 
in the market. To enable that, the Committee 
must ensure that their remuneration policy 
is appropriate for this diverse, high calibre 
team and complex, fast-paced, agile 
business. At the same time, the Committee 
recognises the need for remuneration 
governance and pay decisions that are 
appropriate for the size, nature and profile 
of the Company.
The year under review
The year to 31 August 2017 has been a 
strong one for the business, as you will 
have already read in this Annual Report. 
Turning specifically to our incentive 
programmes, the Company-related 
performance condition for our annual 
bonus for the last financial year was based 
on both growth in revenue, which was 
up 33%, and in Profit Before Tax, which 
increased by 26%. The long-term incentive 
award that vested at the end of the financial 
year was subject to three year performance 
conditions for the period from 1 September 
2014 to 31 August 2017, relating to the 
compound annual growth rate in Earnings 
Per Share, which came in at 19.8%, and  
ASOS’ Total Shareholder Return compared 
to a basket of companies from the FTSE 
All-Share General Retailers Index, where 
ASOS ranked in the upper quartile.
In view of these achievements, the 
Committee has determined that the CEO and 
the CFO will receive annual bonus payouts 
of 64.9% and 64.2% respectively, of their 
maximum opportunities, with the FY14 ALTIS 
awards vesting at 99.1% of the maximum. 
These are the first vested awards under the 
ASOS Long Term Incentive Scheme (ALTIS), 
coming four years since the last long-term 
incentive award vested within ASOS and 
the Committee and I are pleased to see the 
long-term focus and dedication of those 
award holders be rewarded. Taken together 
the Committee believes this is a fair and 
appropriate level of reward to reflect the 
results that have been delivered and the 
value that has been created for shareholders 
over the last three financial years. 
The year ahead 
The Committee regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of our remuneration policy 
to ensure it remains appropriate as the 
business continues to grow. During the 
year, the Committee has sought to gain 
a strong understanding of the changing 
UK corporate governance landscape and 
emerging market trends to help guide our 
thinking. But we are also conscious that 
several significant enhancements have been 
made to our remuneration mechanics over 
recent years. In view of this, the Committee 
determined that it would be beneficial 
to maintain the current remuneration 
arrangements for the year ahead. 
While we have not made any fundamental 
changes to the way in which our executive 
directors are remunerated this year, the 
Committee has made a number of changes 
to certain dimensions of the executive pay 
framework to ensure continuous improvement 
in ASOS’s remuneration effectiveness: 
—  We have further enhanced the annual 
bonus plan mechanics to help simplify 
the scheme while maintaining strong 
strategic alignment
—  We have adopted a more rigorous 
approach to performance measurement 
and the way in which we set targets for 
the purpose of our incentives
—  We have invested significant time 
in enhancing the way in which 
management performance objectives 
are set to ensure they are consistently 
stretching and achievable
The Committee is also pleased to be able 
to highlight ASOS’s progress with the 
provision of a voice for employees through 
the establishment of an employee forum, 
‘ASOS In Touch’ at each of our UK sites. 
The purpose of this initiative is to create 
representative groups with the remit to 
directly discuss with the Executive Leadership 
team and the Board things we can do better 
and differently, in order to continue making 
this a formidable company to be a part of. 
We are aware that gender reporting  
will be implemented with effect from  
our next financial year, and we have 
already undertaken a thorough analysis  
of the diversity of our team so we will be 
well placed to report on this and inform  
our shareholders on ASOS’s position in  
this regard.
Concluding remarks
The Committee is aware of the prevailing 
pressures on executive remuneration 
for main market listed companies and 
continues to monitor developments as 
they arise. We will continue to consider 
the implications for ASOS’s executive 
remuneration policy on a needs basis.
While we are an AIM-listed company, we 
seek voluntary shareholder approval for our 
Remuneration Report to provide invaluable 
public accountability for the Board over 
the appropriateness of our remuneration 
policy and its implementation. At the AGM 
last year, only 66% of shareholders voted 
in favour of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, which was disappointing. We have 
listened to the feedback raised last year 
and will reflect this in our approach to the 
ongoing governance of remuneration at 
ASOS. The Committee values open and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders and 
our broader stakeholders, and welcomes 
any feedback on the ongoing executive 
remuneration arrangements.We hope that 
you find this year’s Remuneration Report 
informative and look forward to your 
continuing support in the coming year.

Chair of the Remuneration Committee
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 61
GOVERNANCE REPORT
REMUNERATION POLICY
 
The Remuneration Committee determines 
ASOS’s policy on the remuneration of 
the executive directors and other senior 
executives. The principles that underpin 
this policy aim to encourage strong 
performance and engagement, both 
in the short and long term. They also 
exist to enable the Group to achieve its 
strategic objectives and create sustainable 
shareholder value – and to make sure high 
performance is required to access high 
rewards, and that the total reward cost to 
ASOS is affordable and sustainable. Our 
Remuneration Policy must also help attract, 
retain and motivate high-calibre, high-
performing engaged employees. It must 
reward people for their contributions to the 
success of ASOS in a fair and responsible 
manner, over both the short and long term. 
And, it must be communicated in a way 
that’s straightforward, effective and easy 
to understand.
In determining the practical application of 
the policy, the Remuneration Committee 
considers a range of internal and external 
factors. These include pay and conditions 
for employees generally, shareholder 
feedback and appropriate market 
comparisons with remuneration practices 
in FTSE-listed, AIM-listed and other retail 
and internet/technology-based companies. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that this policy successfully aligns the 
interests of executive directors, senior 
managers and other employees with the 
long-term interests of shareholders. We 
do this by ensuring that an appropriate 
proportion of total remuneration is directly 
linked to the Group’s performance over 
both the short and long term, with an 
emphasis for executive directors and senior 
managers on share-based remuneration 
and long-term shareholding.
Remuneration Policy components
Each component forms part of an overall 
competitive remuneration package 
designed to attract and retain appropriate 
talent with the necessary skills to 
implement the Company’s strategy in order 
to create long-term value for shareholders.

Remuneration policy for other 
employees
The remuneration policy for executive 
directors has been developed with 
consideration of the reward philosophy, 
strategy, and policy for ASOSers across 
the whole organisation. Where possible, 
we aim to create alignment between the 
way executive remuneration is structured 
and the way ASOSers more generally 
are rewarded. Inevitably, there are some 
differences between our management and 
the rest of the business. This is typically a 
result of developing reward arrangements 
that are competitive for the different talent 
markets from which we recruit or to which 
we risk losing staff. The policy for executive 
directors and the senior levels within 
ASOS’s leadership group also places a 
larger emphasis on pay-at-risk through 
incentives and long-term remuneration 
through the ALTIS programme.
All employees are entitled to base pay, 
benefits and pension contributions and 
are eligible for participation in the ASOS 
annual bonus plan, and during the financial 
year 196 employees joined the ALTIS.
ASOS operates a Save As You Earn Scheme 
for all employees. More information about 
the scheme is given on page 62. We 
encourage a strong culture of ownership 
across the organisation and encourage all 
ASOSers to behave and think like owners. 
We are very proud of the enthusiasm and 
support for these schemes shown by our 
fellow ASOSers, with 34% of employees 
participating in the SAYE 2017 scheme. 
Remuneration Policy developments
Revisions to the Remuneration Policy and 
its implementation require the approval 
of the Remuneration Committee, to whom 
the Board delegates responsibility for the 
policy. There have been no changes to the 
Remuneration Policy this year. 
Performance measure selection and 
approach to target setting
For the ASOS annual bonus and ALTIS, our 
policy is to choose performance measures 
that help drive and reward the achievement 
of our strategy and also provide alignment 
between executives and shareholders. The 
committee reviews metrics each year to 
ensure they remain appropriate and reflect 
the strategic direction of ASOS. 
The measures used in the 2018 annual 
bonus reflect ASOS’s KPIs for the year. 
Long-term performance targets for 2018 are 
based on a combination of absolute and 
relative performance: 
—  TSR provides strong alignment with 
shareholders and is measured against 
the FTSE All-Share General Retailers 
as this provides a robust and relevant 
benchmark. 
—  EPS is considered an objective and 
well accepted measure of Company 
performance which reinforces the 
objective of achieving profitable growth.
—  Revenue captures top-line growth and is 
a key element of our progress towards 
our mission.
—  Net Promoter Score captures customer 
engagement, which is a key element of 
our strategy.
Targets for each performance measure are 
set by the committee with consideration 
to an extensive set of reference points 
including internal plans and budgets, 
forecasts for the sector, relevant sector 
benchmarks and external expectations. 
Performance is generally measured on 
a sliding scale, so that incentive payouts 
increase pro rata for levels of performance 
between the threshold and maximum 
performance targets. 
When considering any annual salary 
increases for executives, the Committee 
does so in the context of the proposals for 
salary increases to the broader workforce 
more generally, as it does for any other 
changes to other elements of remuneration 
being considered.

Total potential remuneration for executive directors in the 2018 financial year
The chart on page 63 shows the potential remuneration at different levels of performance of each executive director in the 2018 financial 
year from the remuneration opportunity granted to them by ASOS’s remuneration policy.
Basis of calculation:
—  Minimum – fixed pay only (salary + benefits + pension*). Salary and pension are those effective from 1 September 2017 and benefits 
are based on actual figures for 2016/17 
—  Target – fixed pay, plus target bonus opportunity of 90% of salary for the CEO and 60% of salary for the CFO, plus 25% of the face 
value of the ALTIS award on grant (i.e. 50% of salary)
—  Maximum – fixed pay, plus maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO, plus the full 
face value of the ALTIS award on grant (i.e. 200% of salary)
* Pension is net of employers tax and NIC
Recruiting new executive directors or senior executives
When recruiting any executive director or senior executive, we seek to apply consistent policies on fixed and variable remuneration 
components in line with the remuneration policy set out above. This helps to ensure that any new executive director or senior executive is on 
the same remuneration footing as existing executive directors or senior executives respectively, while still taking into account the skills and 
experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual. 
The granting of payments or share awards on joining in order to secure the appointment of an executive director or senior executive 
is normally limited to the fair value of any deferred remuneration that would be forfeited at the previous employer, taking into account 
relevant factors including the form of the awards, remaining vesting period and the likelihood of any performance conditions being met. 
Any such proposal for executive directors requires the prior approval of the Remuneration Committee. The committee may also agree that 
ASOS will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Executive directors’ service contracts and payments for loss of office
It is our policy that all executive directors should have rolling service contracts with an indefinite term, but a fixed period of notice of 
termination. The services of all executive directors may be terminated on a maximum of 12 months’ notice by the Company or the 
individual. Our approach to remuneration in each of the circumstances in which an executive director may leave is set out in the table 
below, with an individual’s status being determined by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the rules of any applicable scheme.
Remuneration component ‘Bad’ leaver situation ‘Good’ leaver situation
Salary in lieu of notice Provided up to the effective leaving date Up to a maximum of one year’s salary; normal 
practice is to make a phased payment
Pension and other benefits Provided up to the effective leaving date – no 
benefits would be provided after that date, 
unless this is in the interests of ASOS
Up to one year’s worth of pension and benefits
Bonus None Paid in accordance with bonus scheme terms – 
normal practice is for payment to be time and 
performance pro-rated to the effective leaving 
date
Long-term incentives Awards lapse May vest in accordance with scheme rules – 
normal practice is for the vested award to be 
time and performance pro-rated to the effective 
leaving date
Other payments None Disbursements such as contributions to legal 
costs and outplacement fees
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts with ASOS. Instead, they have letters of appointment which provide for a maximum 
of three months’ notice of termination by the Company or the individual at any time, with no pre-determined amounts of compensation. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 65

GOVERNANCE REPORT
Annual bonus for the year ended 31 August 2017
For both Nick Beighton and Helen Ashton, the annual bonus plan for the year ended 31 August 2017 was based 70% on a Company 
objective and 30% on non-financial objectives (15% on personal objectives and 15% on net promoter score NPS). Nick’s maximum bonus 
opportunity as CEO was 150% of salary, and Helen’s maximum bonus opportunity as CFO was 100% of salary for the year.
The Company objective was based on a matrix of stretching PBT and sales growth targets. This helps ensure investment made to drive sales 
is executed while delivering a sustainable profit margin for shareholders. During the year, actual sales growth achieved was 33% against a 
target of 27%, and actual PBT achieved (including operating losses from discontinued operations but before exceptional items) was £80m.

For the CEO, the personal objectives were based around several core strategic priorities that focused on the areas of continued 
development of the Executive team; enhancement of the organisation’s approach to reputation management; and implementation of the 
Group’s Fashion with Integrity programme. 
For the CFO, the personal objectives were based around the development of an enhanced business performance management 
programme; successful development of ASOS’s risk management framework; and delivery of the first phase of ASOS’s Finance 
Transformation programme. 
The CEO’s and CFO’s respective achievement against those objectives following careful consideration by the committee, were as follows:

As a result, taking into account the PBT and sales outcomes under the Company objective, and the achievement of NPS and personal 
objectives under the non-financial objectives:
— Nick Beighton’s annual bonus was 97.3% of his annual salary as CEO, out of the maximum 150% of base salary
— Helen Ashton’s annual bonus was 64.2% of her annual salary as CFO, out of the maximum 100% of base salary
Overall, the committee is satisfied that the bonus payments reflect ASOS’s performance during the year. ASOS PLC 68

2014 to 31 August 2017 comprise two independent conditions based on:  
(a)   compound annual fully diluted EPS growth over the three financial years of the Company (the EPS Condition) ending on or around 31 August 2017  
(the 2017 financial year)
 (b)  a relative TSR-based condition measuring the Company’s TSR performance against that of a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the 
FTSE All-Share General Retailers Index (the Comparator Group) over a period of three years starting on 1 September 2014 (the TSR Condition). 
The EPS Condition applies to 70% of the total number of shares held under that award. The part of an award subject to the EPS Condition shall only vest if compound 
annual fully diluted EPS growth over the three years to the 2017 financial year is at least equal to 10%; thereafter, the part of such awards subject to the EPS 
Condition shall vest in accordance with the table below for awards made from 2017 onwards.

The TSR Condition applies to 30% of the total number of shares held under such awards. For the purposes of the TSR Condition, the committee will compare the TSR of 
the Company over the performance period against the TSR performance of each member of the Comparator Group over the same period, calculated by reference to a 
three-month averaging period prior to the start and to the end of the performance period. If, at the end of the performance period, the Company is notionally ranked at least 
median against the members of the Comparator Group, the part of such awards subject to the TSR Condition shall vest in accordance with the table below.

Employee benefit trust 
ASOS uses an employee benefit trust 
to facilitate the acquisition of ordinary 
shares in the Company for the purpose 
of satisfying awards and options granted 
under ASOS share schemes. During 
the financial year, ASOS used both the 
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and the 
Capita Trust (CT) to satisfy awards granted 
under its SAYE and SIP share schemes:
—  The EBT is a discretionary trust, the 
sole beneficiaries being employees 
(including executive directors) and 
former employees of the Group who 
have received awards under the SAYE 
Scheme (or their close relations in 
the event of their death). The trustee 
of the EBT is Capita Trustees Limited, 
an independent professional trustee 
company based in Jersey. Under the 
terms of the Trust Deed, ASOS funds 
the EBT to purchase on the EBT’s 
own account ordinary shares in the 
Company on the open market in return 
for the EBT agreeing to use the ordinary 
shares in the Company that it holds to 
satisfy certain outstanding awards and 
options made under the Company’s 
share schemes.
—  The CT holds shares awarded under 
the SIP solely for the benefit of current 
employees (including executive 
directors) who participate in it. The 
trustee of the SIP is Capita IRG Trustees 
Limited, an independent professional 
trustee company based in the United 
Kingdom. Under the terms of the Trust 
Deed, ASOS funds the CT to buy the 
shares on the open market and retain 
those shares on behalf of the underlying 
beneficiaries. 
As at 31 August 2017, the EBT and 
CT (combined) held 337,648 shares in 
ASOS Plc (2016: 395,185 shares) to 
the value of £0.6m (2016: £2.7m). The 
EBT and CT are both recognised within 
the EBT reserve for accounting purposes. 
The Group’s accounting policies are 
detailed within Note 24 to the financial 
statements and movements are detailed in 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity on page 81. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 73
GOVERNANCE REPORT
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, financial 
position and cash flows, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future 
performance and position, are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 46. In 
addition, details of the Group’s objectives 
and policies on financial risk management 
are set out in Note 18 to the financial 
statements on pages 96 to 98. 
The Group continues to have a strong 
financial position including cash and cash 
equivalents of £160.3m at 31 August 
2017 and an undrawn £20m revolving 
credit facility, available until October 
2018. The directors have reviewed current 
performance and cash flow forecasts, and 
are satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of potential 
changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group will be able to operate 
within the level of its current facilities for 
the foreseeable future and at a minimum 
for 12 months from the date of signing the 
Group financial statements. The directors 
have therefore continued to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements.
Viability statement
The directors have also assessed the 
Group’s prospects and viability over a 
three-year period to 31 August 2020. This 
three-year assessment period was selected 
as it corresponds with the Board’s strategic 
planning horizon as well as the time 
period over which senior management are 
remunerated via long-term incentive plans.
In making this assessment, the directors 
took account of the Group’s current 
financial position, annual budget, three-
year plan forecasts and sensitivity testing. 
The Board also considered a number of 
other factors, including the Group business 
model (pages 6 and 7), its strategy (pages 
1 to 9), risks and uncertainties (pages 26 
to 31) and internal control effectiveness 
(pages 58 and 59). While the principal 
risks and uncertainties could impact future 
performance, none of them is considered 
likely, individually or collectively, to affect 
the viability of the business during the 
three-year assessment period. The Group 
is operationally strong with a robust 
balance sheet and cash position, and has 
a track record of delivering profitable and 
sustainable growth, which is expected to 
continue.
Based on this assessment, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue in operation and meet 
all its liabilities as they fall during the 
period up to 31 August 2020.
Statement on disclosure of 
information to auditors
The directors confirm that, so far as 
each is aware, there’s no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors 
are unaware. Each of the directors has 
taken all the steps he or she should have 
taken as a director to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that 
information.
Political donations 
No political donations have been made 
during this financial year. 
Annual general meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will be held at 12.00 noon on

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group and 
parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU). Under company 
law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
—  Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently.
—  Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent.
—  State whether applicable IFRS as 
adopted by the EU have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements.
—  Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it’s 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that show 
and explain the Group and the Company’s 
transactions. These must disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and the Company and for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website, www.asosplc.com. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names, 
functions and short biographies are set out 
on pages 49 to 51, confirms that, to the 
best of his or her knowledge:
—  The Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group.
—  The Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the Company.
—  The Strategic Report on pages 1 
to 46 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group 
and the Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, ASOS Plc’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
—  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 August 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and the Group’s and the parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
—  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and parent company 
statements of financial position as at 31 August 2017; the consolidated statement of total comprehensive income, the consolidated and 
parent company statements of cash flows, and the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview  
—  Overall Group materiality: £4,000,000 (2016: £3,000,000) – having regard to the revenues and 
profitability of the business
—  Overall parent company materiality: £235,000 (2016: £170,000) – based on 1% of total assets 
—   Full scope audit of:
 —   ASOS Plc – the parent entity holding investments throughout the Group 
   —  asos.com Limited – the trading entity that generates the vast majority of the trading results for the 
Group through the asos.com website
— Capitalisation of internal staff costs
— Recording of revenue
— Inventory provisioning
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.  
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and  
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
We determined that there were no key matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Capitalisation of internal staff costs
The Group continued to invest heavily in its operational 
infrastructure spending £73.9m on property, plant and 
equipment as set out in note 12, and £93.6m on intangible 
assets as set out in note 11. The most significant elements 
of this expenditure, as described in the CFO’s review, was 
related to the newly opened Eurohub 2 distribution centre in 
Berlin, additional expenditure to further automate the Barnsley 
distribution centre and new retail and financial systems due to 
go live in the coming year. 
We focussed on this area due to the size of the costs 
capitalised and, as set out on page 84, the fact that there 
was judgement involved in assessing whether the criteria set 
out in accounting standards for the capitalisation of such costs 
had been met. In particular we focussed on the capitalisation 
of internal staff costs to confirm that costs capitalised were a 
fair reflection of actual costs incurred and the associated time 
was spent on projects which met the criteria to be capitalised.
We gained an understanding through walkthroughs performed and discussion 
with management of the process in place for evaluating and approving capital 
expenditure. We had a particular focus on staff time capitalised in relation to 
capital projects which included an assessment that individual projects met the 
criteria set out in accounting standards for capitalisation.
We tested management’s control in relation to capital funding request forms 
which evidenced that the requisite capitalisation criteria had been considered 
and that the projects were appropriately approved. We were able to place 
reliance on this control for the purpose of our audit.
In addition we performed detailed testing on a selection of projects. Our 
work covered capitalisation of employee time for internal staff and external 
contractors. We obtained an understanding of various selected capitalised 
projects, tested time charged to them back to timesheet data and third party 
payroll data and independently assessed whether sufficient economic benefits 
were likely to flow from the projects to support the values capitalised. 
Our testing did not identify any costs that had been inappropriately capitalised.
Recording of revenue
The Group has one main source of revenue which relates 
to sales made through ASOS.com and its website. Sales of 
goods sold via the website are recognised on dispatch from 
the warehouse, as described on page 103, with customers 
having the right to return the goods, should they so choose, 
within a predefined window. Should customers return any 
goods, the Group will refund the associated revenue relating 
to the returned goods.
The nature of the Group’s revenue and revenue recognition 
policies generated two specific heightened areas of focus for 
our audit: 
—  Firstly, we assessed whether the policy of recognising 
revenue on dispatch rather than delivery could 
significantly enhance revenues and profits inappropriately. 
—  Secondly, we focussed on the level of provision recorded 
for returns and the associated reduction in revenue and 
profit arising as a result of recording this provision.
We discussed the revenue recognition policy with management and performed 
a walkthrough to understand the revenue recognition process.
To test revenue transactions during the year, we utilised transactional data 
software to identify those revenue transactions which did not follow the 
expected business process. For unusual amounts we performed substantive 
testing to gain evidence over the commercial rationale for these items to leave 
an amount untested below materiality. 
We examined management’s assessment of the estimated financial impact 
of recognising sales on dispatch rather than on receipt by customer, as well 
as performing an independent calculation of the potential difference from 
recognising revenue on dispatch rather than delivery. We determined that the 
sales and profit impact of this on the results for the year was not material. 
We understood the methodology used to calculate the returns provision and 
determined it was consistent with the prior year. We tested the inputs to 
the calculation to source data and assessed the key assumption driving the 
calculation which was assessed returns rates having regards to historic returns 
rates. We also compared the provision to actual returns of sales made pre year 
end processed in the period post year end. 
No issues arose from our work to suggest that the provision was materially 
misstated. 
Inventory provisioning
The Group held £323.3m of inventory as at 31 August 
2017. The nature of the Group’s business model is to service 
demand in a dynamic and fast moving fashion market which 
inherently means there is a risk of inventory falling out of 
fashion and proving difficult to sell above cost. 
There are key assumptions that drive the inventory provision, 
which is netted against the Group’s inventory balance, 
including the ability to sell through older inventory and the 
realisable value that will be achieved on sale. The provision 
broadly comprises two elements: a provision for items looking 
to be sold off at below cost and a provision for aged items 
which there is a concern may ultimately be sold at below cost.
As the Group’s business further expands internationally and 
the gross value of inventory increases, the risk around the 
completeness of inventory provisioning remains a focus area 
for the audit.
We understood the methodology used to calculate the inventory provision and 
determined it was consistent with that applied in the prior year. 
We reconciled the inventory values used in the provision to the general ledger.
For items looking to be sold at below cost we checked the calculation 
performed by management as to the required provision to write these items 
down to net realisable value. We also independently validated the quantum 
and associated cost of these items and assessed the appropriateness of the level 
of income expected to be received from selling these items. 
For aged inventory we obtained an ageing summary of inventory which we 
reconciled back to the general ledger. We then tested a sample of items to 
validate the accuracy of the ageing applied in this summary. 
We then recomputed the level of provision having regard to the Group’s 
provisioning methodology and performed some sensitivity analysis to assess 
whether there was a risk of material misstatement of the provision. 
Nothing arose from our work to suggest that the provisions recorded were 
materially inaccurate. ASOS PLC 78
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT continued
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
We determined there to be two entities in scope for our Group audit. ASOS Plc is the parent entity holding investments throughout the 
Group, and asos.com Limited represents the vast majority of the trading results for the Group through the asos.com website.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Overall materiality £4,000,000 (2016: £3,000,000). £235,000 (2016: £170,000).
How we determined it With reference to both revenue (reflecting the size of the 
business) and profit before tax.
1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
Within the Group there is a focus on driving sales given 
the Group’s strategy on reinvesting profits into significant 
capital expansion to underpin future growth. At the same 
time, the business remains focussed on delivering an 
acceptable short term return as it expands sales. Having 
regard to both the size of the business and its profitability, 
£4m was viewed as an appropriate level to set materiality.
The parent company does not trade. As a result 
we believe that total assets is the most appropriate 
benchmark to use for the company. 
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £3,900,000 and £235,000. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £100,000) and £9,000 (parent company audit) (2016: £8,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
— the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
—  the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt  
about the Group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’ Report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 79
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
STRATEGIC REPORT AND DIRECTORS’ REPORT
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 August 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibility set out on page 74, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
—  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
—  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year to 31 August 2017
1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the course of preparing the financial statements, management necessarily makes estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies 
and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually reviewed and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances. Actual results may differ from the initial estimate 
or judgement and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on the financial statements at the time such updated information 
becomes available. The Audit Committee considers estimates and judgements made by management, as detailed in the Audit Committee Report  
on pages 57 to 59.
The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities are:
Accounting estimates
Inventory valuation
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a weighted average cost basis, which requires an estimation of products’ 
future selling prices. A provision is also made to write down any slow-moving or obsolete inventory to net realisable value. The provision is £5.5m 
at 31 August 2017 (2016: £4.7m).
Refund accruals
Accruals for sales returns are estimated on the basis of historical returns and are recorded so as to allocate them to the same period in which the 
original revenue is recorded. These accruals are reviewed regularly and updated to reflect management’s latest best estimates, although actual 
returns could vary from these estimates. The accrual for net refunds totalled £42.6m (2016: £23.2m). For further details, see Note 3 on page 85.
Loyalty scheme deferral
An accrual is made to defer the fair value of consideration received on loyalty scheme sales. This revenue is subsequently recognised over 
the period that the awards are redeemed. The fair value of loyalty awards is determined with reference to the fair value to the customer and 
considers factors such as future redemption rates. Assumptions included in this fair value calculation are reviewed regularly and updated to reflect 
management’s latest best estimates, although actual redemption rates could vary from these estimates. At 31 August 2017, £4.4m (2016: £2.7m) 
has been provided against future expected redemption of outstanding points and vouchers. 
Calculation of share-based payment charges
The charge related to equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date 
they are granted, using an appropriate valuation model selected according to the terms and conditions of the grant. Judgement is applied in 
determining the most appropriate valuation model and in determining the inputs to the model. Third-party experts are engaged to advise in this 
area where necessary. Judgements are also applied in relation to estimations of the number of options which are expected to vest, by reference to 
historic leaver rates and expected outcomes under relevant performance conditions. See Note 19 on pages 99 to 101.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of other intangible assets
Depreciation and amortisation are provided to write down assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The determination 
of these residual values and estimated lives, and any change to the residual values or estimated lives, requires the exercise of management 
judgement. See Notes 11 and 12 on pages 92 and 93.
Capitalisation criteria
Where assets are acquired or developed in house, management exercises judgement in determining that the asset meets the criteria to be 
capitalised as either an intangible or tangible fixed asset.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where an impairment is required, the recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use 
calculations prepared using management’s assumptions and estimates. See Notes 11 and 12 on pages 92 and 93.
Accounting judgements
Legal contingencies
Where legal proceedings are brought against the Group and material future economic outflow is considered possible but not probable, or cannot 
be reliably measured, the Group discloses the nature of the contingent liability in the notes to the financial statements but does not recognise a 
liability in respect of the contingency. A liability is recognised only when a future economic outflow is probable and the amount of that outflow can 
be reliably measured. Judgement is required in the determination of probability and as to whether the Group’s exposure can be reliably estimated. 
See Note 22 on page 101. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 85
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Group financial statements for the year to 31 August 2016. 
Various new accounting standards and amendments were issued during the year, none of which have an impact on the current year. 
The following accounting standards are in issue but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group:
—  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement’. The standard is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has completed an assessment of IFRS 9 and it is expected that adoption will not 
have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.
—  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. The Group has completed an assessment of IFRS 15 and it is expected that adoption will not have a material impact on 
the results or financial position of the Group.
—   IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 has also been adopted. 
The standard will require lease liabilities and the right of use assets for leases to be recognised on the Statement of Financial Position. The 
Group has completed an assessment of IFRS 16. This assessment indicates that there will be a significant impact on the value of non-current 
assets and lease liabilities as the leases for warehouing and office space are currently accounted for as operating leases. For the current level 
of operating lease commitments, see Note 21. There will be an immaterial impact on the reported profit for the year.
Accounting policy references are included in the relevant notes throughout the financial statements and also in Note 24.
3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been determined to be the Executive Board who receive information on the basis of the 
Group’s operations in key geographical territories, based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
The Executive Board assesses the performance of each segment based on revenue and gross profit after distribution expenses, which excludes 
administrative expenses.
See Note 24 for the Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition.

Due to the nature of its activities, the Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.
No analysis of the assets and liabilities of each operating segment is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker in the monthly management 
accounts. Therefore no measure of segmental assets or liabilities is disclosed in this note.

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the parent company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and Capita Trust are eliminated from the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, 
adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive share options.

Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value-in-use calculations.
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units (CGUs), which include the geographical business segments 
as described in Note 3. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the discount rates. Value-in-use 
was calculated from cash flow projections for three years using data from the Group’s latest results and financial forecasts approved by the Board. 
The budgeted cash flow assumes a growth rate which is higher than the long-term growth rate of the UK economy, based on the Group’s recent 
performance and current performance expectations. No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations could 
result in a material impairment of goodwill.
The goodwill balance relates to the historic acquisition of asos.com Limited, a 100% subsidiary of the Group. ASOS PLC 92

13 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that amounts will not be recovered. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. Any provision made against an impaired receivable is recognised within administrative expenses in the Statement of Total 
Comprehensive Income.

All other receivables are non-interest bearing. The other receivables balance includes £5.9m UK VAT receivables (2016: £nil). The fair value of 
trade and other receivables is not materially different from their carrying value.
Trade and other receivables fall into the ‘loans and receivables’ category of the Group’s financial assets.
At 31 August 2017, trade receivables with a gross value of £0.1m (2016: £nil) were individually determined to be impaired and the provision 
for impairment of these trade receivables was £0.1m (2016: £nil). The other amounts within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired 
assets, as they are deemed fully recoverable.

hold any collateral as security.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as they are due to reverse in the same jurisdiction.
The Company has losses of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) which are available for offset against future taxable profits. The Group has no other losses which 
are available to be carried forward against future taxable profits (2016: £14.5m). A deferred tax asset of approximately £0.1m (2016: £3.5m) 
relating to a portion of these losses has not been reflected in the financial statements since it is not anticipated that they will reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Of this unrecognised deferred tax asset, £0.1m (2016: £0.3m) relates to the UK and £nil (2016: £3.2m) relates to China. The Group had 
losses of £14.2m which are no longer available to offset against future profits because the companies have ceased to trade.
The deferred tax asset on share-based payments is created by the temporary difference between the carrying value of outstanding share-based 
payment options on the Statement of Financial Position and the tax base of these options, being the estimated future tax deduction expected to 
crystallise on exercise of the option. The tax base is calculated by reference to the Company’s share price at the reporting date and the number of 
share options outstanding, which has increased during the year to 31 August 2017.
It is estimated that deferred tax assets of £12.4m (2016: £13.3m) will be recovered within one year. It is estimated that deferred tax liabilities of 
£nil (2016: £nil) will be payable within one year. Deferred tax assets of £2.4m (2016: £nil) and deferred tax liability of £5.6m (2016: £nil) will 
be recovered in more than one year.
During the year to 31 August 2016, the substantively enacted corporation tax rates changed to 19% with effect from 1 April 2018 and to 18% 
with effect from 1 April 2020. During the year ended 31 August 2017, the substantively enacted corporation tax rate with effect from 1 April 
2020 was reduced by a further 1% to 17%. The changes in the rates reduced the deferred tax asset by £0.8m. ASOS PLC 96

as part of his remuneration package.
Employee Benefit Trust
The provision of shares to satisfy some of the Group’s share incentive plans is facilitated by purchases of own shares by the Group’s Employee 
Benefit Trust and Capita Trust (the Trusts). Shares held by the Trusts are valued at the weighted average historical cost of the shares acquired and the 
carrying value is shown as a reduction within shareholders’ equity. The costs of operating the Trusts are borne by the Group but are not material.
During the year to 31 August 2017, 57,537 shares (2016: 26,374 shares) were transferred from the Trusts to employees in settlement of share 
options and awards in exchange for cash consideration of £1.8m (2016: £0.7m). Nil shares (2016: nil) were purchased by the Trusts to satisfy 
future options and awards, at a cost of £nil (2016: £nil). The Trusts have waived the right to receive dividends on these shares.
At 31 August 2017, the carrying value of the 337,648 shares held by the Trusts (2016: 395,185 shares) was £0.6m (2016: £2.7m).

Risk management
The Group’s Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to capital risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, to 
ensure liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group does not engage in speculative 
trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements. The Group’s treasury policies and procedures 
are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding, while maintaining a strong credit 
rating and sufficient headroom. The Group makes adjustments to its capital structure in light of changes to economic conditions and the Group’s 
strategic objectives. At 31 August 2017, the Group had capital of £447.4m (2016: £373.7m).
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 97
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by continuously monitoring short- and long-term forecasts and actual cash flows and ensuring it has 
the necessary banking and reserve borrowing facilities available to meet the requirements of the business. At 31 August 2017, the Group had an 
undrawn revolving loan credit facility of £20.0m that is available until October 2018. Borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility bear interest 
at a rate linked to LIBOR. Commitment interest is payable on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. The facility, which is unsecured, includes 
covenants related to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation cover of net financing costs, and net balance sheet debt.
Any surplus cash is placed on deposit to maximise returns on cash balances, within the terms of the investment policy and agreed by the  
Audit Committee.
The Group’s financial liabilities at amortised cost as at 31 August 2017 and 31 August 2016 all mature in less than one year.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on its obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial 
activities. The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, bank balances, and cash in hand. The Group’s credit risk is 
primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts included in the Statement of Financial Position are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group has a low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of high 
volume, low value and short maturity. The Group’s trade receivables are primarily with large advertising companies with which the Group 
has a long-standing relationship, and the risk of default and write-offs due to bad debts is considered to be low. The Group has no significant 
concentration of credit risk, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Board-approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be placed with each 
approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its revolving credit facilities to the extent that these are utilised.
During the year, the Group had no drawings under its revolving loan credit facility. The Group may draw down periodically on the revolving 
loan credit facility in the future if required, but no drawdown will be long term in nature and therefore the Group has not entered into interest rate 
derivatives to mitigate the interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed to foreign currency transaction risk, primarily on sales denominated in US dollars, 
euros and Australian dollars and on costs denominated in US dollars and euros. The Group’s presentational currency is pounds sterling, therefore 
the Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risks due to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of non-sterling assets 
and liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to match foreign currency transactions in the same currency, taking into account where sales and costs both arise in the 
same currency. Where appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge future highly 
probable forecast foreign currency cash flows. The Group’s policy is to layer hedges over a 24-month period, with 100% (2016: 80%) coverage 
of the net unmatched exposure for the first 12 months, 60% for 13 to 18 months and finally 40% from 19 to 24 months, with hedges currently 
in 12 currencies. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as Level 2 derivative financial instruments under IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’. They have been fair valued at 31 August 2017 with reference to forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market,  
with the resulting value discounted back to present value.

The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 24 
months. Therefore, the fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged 
item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The 
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.

these currencies relative to pounds sterling at the reporting date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged. The sensitivity rate of 10% is 
deemed to represent a reasonably possible change based on historic exchange rate volatility.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
— all sensitivities affecting the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income also impact equity
—  exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in 
equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives, with no impact on the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income
—  all hedge relationships are fully effective
—  translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Group’s presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit before tax or in equity.

Euro (0.2) (0.6) 3.8 3.6
Australian dollar 0.1 0.4 1.2 2.0
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including 
fluctuating trade payable and cash balances and changes in the currency mix. As the sensitivities are limited to financial instrument balances as at the 
reporting date due to ASOS’s hedging policy, they do not take account of the Group’s revenues and costs of sale, which are sensitive to changes in 
exchange rates. In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation while, in reality, foreign currencies do not move independently.
Interest rate sensitivity
The Group has determined that at 31 August 2017 and 31 August 2016 there was no significant sensitivity to changes in market interest rates.

19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
See Note 24 for the Group’s accounting policy on share-based payments.
The Group recognised a charge of £7.6m (2016: £4.5m) related to share-based payments during the year to 31 August 2017, all of which 
relates to equity-settled schemes. In addition, £nil (2016: £0.5m) was charged directly to equity, representing the recycling of upfront cash paid by 
Executive Directors on joining the ALTIP scheme after it failed to meet its performance conditions.

Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) Scheme
Under the terms of the current SAYE Scheme, the Board grants options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to employees who enter into 
an HMRC-approved SAYE Scheme for a term of three years. Options are granted at up to a 20% discount to the market price of the shares on the 
day preceding the date of offer and are normally exercisable for a period of six months after completion of the SAYE contract. These option grants 
are settled on exercise through a transfer of shares from the Employee Benefit Trust.

22 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
From time to time, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business which, due to the  
fast-growing nature of the Group and its e-commerce base, may concern the Group’s brand and trading name or its product designs. All such 
cases brought against the Group are robustly defended and a liability is recorded only when it is probable that the case will result in a future 
economic outflow which can be reliably measured.
At 31 August 2017, the Group had contingent liabilities of £19.1m (2016: £7.3m) in relation to supplier standby letters of credit, rent deposit 
deeds and other bank guarantees. The likelihood of cash outflow in relation to these contingent liabilities is considered to be low.
In the year to 31 August 2016, ASOS reached a full and final global settlement of £20.2m for the trademark infringement disputes brought 
against it by Assos of Switzerland (a high-performance cycle-wear brand), and Anson’s Herrenhaus (a German menswear retailer), which was 
presented, along with associated legal fees of £0.7m, as an exceptional item in the financial statements.  ASOS PLC 102

24 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General information
ASOS Plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) is a global fashion retailer. The Group sells products across the world and has 
websites targeting the UK, US, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia. The Company is a public limited company which is listed on 
the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Greater London House, 
Hampstead Road, London NW1 7FB.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The going concern basis of accounting has therefore been adopted in 
preparing the financial statements. Further details are contained in the Directors’ Report on pages 72 and 73.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. As at the reporting date these are the standards, subsequent amendments and related 
interpretations issued and adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been endorsed by the EU.
On 5 May 2016, the Group discontinued its local operations in China which were undertaken by ASOS (Shanghai) Commerce Co. Limited 
(ASOS.cn). As a result, the China operation met the recognition criteria of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations’ and is therefore presented as such throughout this report.
a) Accounting convention
The financial statements are drawn up on the historical cost basis of accounting, excluding derivative financial instruments held at fair value. The 
financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds except where otherwise indicated.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group financial statements include the financial statements of ASOS Plc, all its subsidiaries, and the Employee Benefit Trust and 
Capita Trust up to the reporting date. All intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date on 
which control ceases. Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting. A list of all 
the subsidiaries of the Group is included in Note 8 of the parent company financial statements. All apply accounting policies which are consistent 
with those of the rest of the Group.
Any non-controlling interest acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised at the proportionate share of the acquired net assets. Subsequent 
to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest equals the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling 
share of changes in equity since acquisition. Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions. Total comprehensive income is attributed to a non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a 
deficit balance.
(ii) Employee Benefit Trust and Capita Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust and Capita Trust (the Trusts) are considered to be controlled by the Group. The activities of the Trusts are conducted on 
behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order to obtain benefits from its operation and, on this basis, the assets held by the 
Trusts are consolidated into the Group’s financial statements.

Additional accounting policy information
a) Revenue recognition
Revenue consists primarily of internet and advertising sales as well as postage and packaging receipts (delivery receipts).
Retail sales and delivery receipts are recorded net of an appropriate deduction for actual and expected returns, relevant vouchers, sales taxes, and 
deferral of the fair value of loyalty incentives which are yet to be redeemed. Retail sales and delivery receipts are recognised upon despatch from 
the warehouse at which point title and risk passes to third parties and revenue can be reliably measured.
Third-party revenue relates to advertising income earned from the website and the ASOS magazine and is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of value added tax, and is recognised when the magazine is delivered to customers, at which date the service is completed.
The amount of revenue arising from the sale of goods and provision of services has been disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
b) Foreign currency translation
The trading results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period. The Statement 
of Financial Position of each overseas subsidiary is translated at year-end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in the 
translation reserve within equity and are reported in Other Comprehensive Income.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. Exchange 
differences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income.
c) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequent changes in the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in equity in the hedging reserve and in 
Other Comprehensive Income, and are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 are recognised immediately 
in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income.
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in 
fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
d) Exceptional items
Items of income and expenditure which are material and non-recurring are presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Total 
Comprehensive Income. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps to provide an indication of the underlying performance of the Group. 
e) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses. Cost of purchase comprises the purchase price including import 
duties and other taxes, transport and handling costs and any other directly attributable costs, less trade discounts.
A provision is made to write down any slow-moving or obsolete inventory to net realisable value.
f) Taxation
The tax expense included in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income and Statement of Changes in Equity comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable based on the taxable profit for the period, and the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates and in accordance with 
laws that are expected to apply in the period/jurisdiction when/where the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different 
taxable entities and where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. ASOS PLC 104
24 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
g) Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over shares of the parent company.
Equity-settled awards are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is calculated using an appropriate option pricing model and is 
expensed to the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period after allowing for an estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest. The level of vesting is reviewed annually and the charge adjusted to reflect actual and estimated levels of vesting.
Where an equity-settled share-based payment scheme is modified during the vesting period, an additional charge is recognised over the remainder 
of that vesting period to the extent that the fair value of the revised scheme at the modification date exceeds the fair value of the original scheme 
at the modification date. Where the fair value of the revised scheme does not exceed the fair value of the original scheme, the Group continues to 
recognise the charge required under the conditions of the original scheme.
In accordance with IFRS 2, asos.com Limited is required to recognise share-based payment arrangements involving equity instruments where  
asos.com Limited has remunerated those providing services to the entity in this way. ASOS Plc makes contributions to asos.com Limited equal to the 
charge for the share-based payment arrangement which is reflected as an increase in ASOS Plc’s investment in asos.com Limited.
h) Leases
Rent payable under operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, is charged to the Statement 
of Total Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
i) Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, equity instruments issued and 
liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of 
Total Comprehensive Income. Acquisition expenses are recognised in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
(including intangible assets) of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and assessed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income. For the purposes of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to those CGUs that have benefited from the acquisition. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit on a pro rata basis. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on 
disposal.
j) Other intangible assets
The cost of acquiring and developing software that is not integral to the related hardware is capitalised separately as an intangible asset. This 
does not include internal website development and maintenance costs, which are expensed as incurred unless representing a technological 
advance leading to future economic benefit. Capitalised software costs include external direct costs of material and services and the payroll and 
payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the project.
Capitalised software development costs are stated at historic cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over the assets’ expected economic lives, normally between three to seven years. In prior years the range was between three to five years, 
this has been increased to reflect the planned usage of projects. Amortisation is included within administrative expenses in the Statement of Total 
Comprehensive Income. Software under development is held at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Acquired domain names and trademarks are recognised initially at cost. Those deemed to have a definite useful life are amortised on a straight- 
line basis according to the estimated life of the asset. Those deemed to have an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually or as 
triggering events occur. Any impairment in value is charged to the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income in the period in which it occurs.
k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Residual values and 
useful lives are assessed at each reporting date.
Depreciation is recognised to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment to their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis 
as follows:
— Fixtures, fittings, plant and machinery depreciated over five years or over the remaining lease term where applicable 
— Computer equipment depreciated over three to five years according to the estimated life of the asset
 
Depreciation is included in administrative expenses in the Statement of Total Comprehensive Income. Assets under construction are not depreciated.
At each reporting date, property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present 
value of expected future pre-tax cash flows of the relevant CGU or fair value less costs to sell if higher. Any impairment in value is charged to the 
Statement of Total Comprehensive Income in the period in which it occurs.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year to 31 August 2017
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. As at the year end, these are the standards, subsequent amendments and related interpretations 
issued and adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been endorsed by the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current 
and prior years. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained on page 72 and 73 of the Directors’ Report. 
No new accounting standards or amendments issued during the year have had, or are expected to have, any significant impact on the Company.
The following accounting standards are in issue but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Company:
—  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement’. The standard is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Company has completed an assessment of IFRS 9 and it is expected that adoption will not 
have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Company.
—  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. The Company has completed an assessment of IFRS 15 and it is expected that adoption will not have a material impact 
on the results or financial position of the Company.
—  IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 has also been adopted. 
The Company has completed an assessment of IFRS 16 and it is expected that adoption will not have a material impact on the results or 
financial position of the Company.
The financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds except where otherwise 
indicated.
The Company’s principal accounting policies are the same as those set out in Note 24 of the Group financial statements, with the addition of those 
included within the relevant notes below. Unless otherwise stated, these policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
2 LOSS FOR THE YEAR
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Total Comprehensive Income as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.  
The loss for the year and total comprehensive loss attributable to shareholders was £0.8m (2016: loss of £0.5m).
3 OTHER RECEIVABLES
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables due from subsidiary undertakings is 
established when there is objective evidence that amounts will not be recovered.

Receivables from subsidiary undertakings 1.2 2.1
The fair value of other receivables is not materially different to their carrying value.
As at 31 August 2017, receivables from subsidiary undertakings of £1.2m (2016: £2.1m) were unimpaired and considered by management to 
be fully recoverable. Receivables from subsidiary undertakings that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired. As
at 31 August 2017, receivables of £1.2m (2016: £2.4m) were more than three months past due but not impaired. These relate to subsidiary 
undertakings for which there is no history of default. The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows:
