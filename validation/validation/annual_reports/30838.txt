Strategic Report 
The Strategic Report explains in detail how we have performed this year and sets out a fair review of the business, 
a balanced and comprehensive analysis of our performance, the use of key performance indicators to explain the 
progress we have made, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company, and an indication of 
potential future developments. The Strategic Report is prepared in line with the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Company has had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council. It is intended 
to provide shareholders with a better understanding of the Company, of its position in the markets within which it 
operates, and of its prospects. In setting out the Company’s main risks and uncertainties, an indication of potential 
future developments, and in other content, this report and accounts contains statements that are based on knowledge 
and information available at the date of preparation of the Strategic Report, and what are believed to be reasonable 
judgements, and therefore cannot be considered as indications of likelihood or certainty. A wide range of factors may 
cause the actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contained within, or implied by, these various 
forward-looking statements. None of these statements should be construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Corporate website
We maintain a corporate website  
at www.itvplc.com containing our  
ﬁnancial results and a wide range  
of information of interest to  
institutional and private investors.

Notes
Alternative Performance Measures: We use both statutory and adjusted measures in our Strategic Report, the latter of which, 
in management’s view, reflects the underlying performance of the business and provides a more meaningful comparison of how the 
business is managed and measured day-to-day. A full reconciliation between our reported and adjusted results is provided in our 
Alternative Performance Measures deﬁnitions on pages 34 and 35. Our KPIs are set out on pages 36 to 39.
1. The Strategic Report also refers to total revenue, which includes all ITV revenue, both internal and external.
2. Non-Net Advertising Revenue (Non-NAR) includes all ITV revenue, both internal and external, except Net Advertising Revenue (NAR).
3.  EBITA before exceptional items has been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of production tax credits (‘adjusted EBITA’). Statutory EBITA 
is £810 million (2016: £857 million) and statutory proﬁt before tax is £500 million (2016: £553 million). 2 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 ITV at a glance
ITV Studios UK
 
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK.   
We produce programming across a diverse range of genres 
such as drama, entertainment and factual entertainment for 
ITV’s own channels, as well as for other UK broadcasters such 
as the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky.
ITV America
 
ITV America is the largest independent producer of unscripted 
content in the US. We are also growing our presence in scripted 
content, using our strong cash flows to produce high-proﬁle 
dramas with the potential to travel and build international appeal.
ITV Studios Rest of World
 
ITV Studios also operates in the Netherlands (through 
Talpa Media), Germany, France, Italy, Australia and the Nordics. 
Talpa produces and distributes entertainment formats while 
the other businesses produce scripted and unscripted content for 
local broadcasters in these regions. This content is either created 
locally or are formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, 
primarily the UK and Talpa. 
Global Entertainment
 
Global Entertainment, ITV’s distribution business, owns the 
rights to ITV programmes and formats and acquires third-party 
content, distributing this to other broadcasters and platforms 
internationally. Within this business, we also ﬁnance productions 
for ITV and third parties to acquire global distribution rights.
The family of channels attracted a 
total share of viewing (SOV) of 21.7% 
in 2017, the largest audience of any 
UK commercial broadcaster. Our main 
channel is the largest commercial channel 
in the UK, delivering 99% of all commercial 
audiences over ﬁve million.
Our free-to-air digital channels provide 
more targeted demographics for 
advertisers, such as 16–34s, ABC1s, 
Men and Housewives with Children, and 
consist of ITV2 and ITV3, the two largest 
digital channels in the UK, ITV4, CITV 
and ITVBe. We also have high deﬁnition 
versions of our digital channels available 
on pay platforms.
 
In addition to linear broadcast, ITV delivers 
its content across multiple platforms. 
This is either through our over-the-top 
(OTT) service the ITV Hub, available on 29 
platforms including ITV’s website (itv.com), 
pay providers such as Virgin and Sky and 
through direct content deals with services 
such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix.
ITV has the ITV Hub+ which is a 
Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) 
service where subscribers have access 
to advertising free content and the 
ability to download catch up content. 
We have partnered with the BBC to 
launch a new SVOD service, ‘BritBox’, 
in the US and Canada. The streaming 
service allows subscribers to access 
the best of British television. 
We also own a best of British SVOD 
service, Cirkus, in the Nordics and 
Germany, and an online service, ITV 
Choice, an entertainment channel 
for emerging markets available in 
100 countries.

Strategic Report
Chairman’s 
Statement
We’re reporting on a challenging year, 
but one in which ITV has made 
signiﬁcant progress.
ITV delivered a strong operating 
performance with great on-screen and 
online viewing. Against this, net advertising 
revenue (NAR) reacted to political and 
economic uncertainty, contracting by just 
under 5% (though, as we report, this trend 
improved towards the end of the period). 
 Our rebalanced company saw continued 
growth in non-NAR revenues – from 
sponsorship, from digital and from 
production, both at home and abroad. 
We thank our former Chief Executive, 
Adam Crozier, along with the executive 
team for these important advances. 
And I’m very grateful to Ian Grifﬁths, 
who added the role of Chief Operating 
Ofﬁcer to Group Finance Director.
ITV’s mass commercial audience is at 
the heart of our offer to viewers and 
advertisers. We own the only such mass 
audience in the UK. We’ve now grown our 
share of television viewing for two years 
in a row. And our broadcast schedule 
offers the most trusted medium of brand 
advertising: where an ‘impact’ is watching 
an entire, full screen, advertisement with 
the sound up; where no impacts are fake; 
where a brand is guaranteed adjacency 
to trusted content; and where there’s 
no ad-blocking. Meanwhile, ITV Studios 
now produces for over 200 channels in 
11 countries around the world.
This underlines the enduring strengths on 
which we’ll build our new revenue streams 
in the future. So with our strong balance 
sheet we’re able to deliver good returns 
to shareholders while also investing in 
that future. In line with our dividend policy 
and reflecting the Board’s conﬁdence 
in the business and the outlook for 2018, 
the Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend  
of 5.28p, which equates to a full year 
dividend of 7.8p, up 8%.

Our award-winning daytime shows, thriving 
soaps and major dramas are a vital part of 
Britain’s national conversation, exploring 
topical social issues that deﬁne our culture. 
And as a major employer of creative talent 
in Manchester, Leeds and London, our role 
in the nation’s growing creative economy 
is very important to us. 
I’d like to thank my Board colleagues for 
their valuable support and input during 2017. 
We welcome Margaret Ewing as our vastly 
experienced new Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. And we shortly bid farewell 
to Andy Haste and John Ormerod, each of 
them having committed ten fruitful years 
to the Company. We have a clear plan to 
continue to improve the diversity of the 
Board. At the time of writing, our gender 
balance is now 40% female and 60% male. 
And we intend in the medium term also 
to widen our ethnic diversity beyond our 
current one BAME member. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I want to 
thank all ITV colleagues for their excellent 
contribution in 2017. With that quality of 
commitment, we’ll prosper in the future.
 
Sir Peter Bazalgette
Chairman
As we work hard on ITV’s next chapter of 
growth, we are thinking about our digital 
competitors. And we see just as many 
opportunities to seize as threats to ward off. 
Netflix and Amazon may compete with us for 
viewers, but they also buy our programmes 
and co-produce major new series. 
Talking of that future, we were delighted 
to welcome Carolyn McCall as our new 
Chief Executive at the beginning of 2018. 
Investors will be familiar with her background 
in media, her experience of direct to 
consumer relationships and use of consumer 
data, her ability to design and implement 
astute strategy and her understanding of 
what it is to run an international company. 
In short, she’s someone with a track 
record of delivering value to shareholders. 
As she explains, she’s already started her 
strategy refresh. 
Today, there’s quite rightly a growing 
emphasis on company culture and social 
purpose. These are qualities ITV, as a Public 
Service Broadcaster, has always kept front 
of mind  – hand in hand with entertainment. 
But now they’re in even sharper focus. As a 
producer of trusted, sourced national news, 
regional news and current affairs in an age 
of fake news, we take our contribution to 
a functioning democracy very seriously.

Strategic Report
A strong  
platform 
for delivery
As an integrated producer broadcaster, ITV is in a unique position 
to create and own world-class content, broadcast it on one of the 
biggest marketing platforms in the UK and distribute it globally 
through its international network. 
ITV is an increasingly global and diversiﬁed organisation, with 
signiﬁcant non-advertising revenue streams reducing its 
dependency on UK advertising.
ITV has delivered a strong operational and ﬁnancial performance 
over many years and is in a good position to continue to do this, 
underpinned by its strategic assets and competitive advantage.  
ITV is currently undertaking a strategic refresh to ensure it has a clear 
strategy and priorities which reflect what ITV needs to be in three, 
ﬁve and ten years’ time. 
Strong market 
position
The Broadcast & Online business is robust. Our on-screen and online 
viewing performance is strong and we continue to deliver unrivalled 
audience scale and reach for advertisers as well as more targeted 
demographics on our digital channels and on the ITV Hub.
Online, Pay & Interactive is a material, fast-growing and proﬁtable 
part of the business and we are building our digital business 
through our direct to consumer SVOD services BritBox, Cirkus 
and the ITV Hub+.
ITV Studios, our international content business, is now a global player 
of scale, creating, owning and managing rights and we will continue 
to grow in key creative markets, driving value from the strong 
demand for quality content.

Market 
Review
The market environment in which we operate 
is rapidly changing and becoming increasingly 
competitive. Consolidation of media and 
telecoms companies, the increasing influence 
of technology and the evolution in the way 
viewers consume media, what they watch, 
when they watch it and how they watch it, 
bring both challenges and opportunities.
Key market 
trends
Over recent years, there has been a signiﬁcant change in the availability and delivery 
of content with a substantial increase in the number of ways to watch television, with 
viewers able to choose a variety of platforms, both free and pay to watch live, catch up 
and box set content. This has led to the rapid growth of online viewing. However, linear 
television viewing remains resilient and is still the most popular way to consume content 
for all demographics. 
The proliferation of channels, platforms and new entrants has caused a signiﬁcant 
increase in the global demand for content, with spend growing on high-quality programming. 
We estimate that the global content market is growing at around 5% per annum, with 
some genres such as drama rising faster than others.
This growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including: a larger international 
pay television market; the consolidation of pay providers with content companies and 
distributors coupled with the convergence in the television market, where telecoms and 
new media companies are competing with traditional media companies for content and 
viewers; online players such as Netflix and Amazon investing heavily in new original content; 
and online advertising driven platforms such as Google and Facebook creating a new 
market for short form and digital content.
Global content
The US is by far the largest content market in the world, dominating the global production 
sector, with the UK the second largest market. This represents a signiﬁcant opportunity 
for ITV Studios, which has a strong presence in both regions.
Demand for drama, particularly US drama, has increased signiﬁcantly in the last few years. 
Original scripted content is brand deﬁning for broadcasters and OTT players in an increasingly 
competitive global environment. US studios continue to dominate the market for drama 
in the US and internationally. However, the rise of Netflix and Amazon, which are investing 
heavily in creating high-quality original scripted content, has signiﬁcantly increased 
competition in the market.
 Suburra is the ﬁrst original Italian Netflix crime 
drama produced by Cattleya, which was acquired 
by ITV Studios in 2017. 11
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information
 Market Review
This increased competition, coupled with the fact that viewers are now expecting higher 
quality content, has driven up the cost of production. Deﬁcit ﬁnancing and co-productions 
or partnerships have therefore become increasingly important in ﬁnancing productions, 
where distributors are often funding the difference between what the content buyer is 
paying for the original broadcast and the cost of production. This deﬁcit is covered through 
global sales, our windowing strategy of making content available in different territories, 
on different broadcast platforms and at different times, either exclusively or non-exclusively 
along with sales to OTT platforms. As a distributor as well as a producer, ITV is in a strong 
position to deﬁcit ﬁnance its own productions and therefore produce high-quality content 
and retain the rights to it as well as acquiring rights for third-party productions.
Leveraging our network relationships and international distribution network, we have 
expanded our global scripted business and developed a strong portfolio of international and 
returning drama. We are taking advantage of the increased demand from OTT platforms 
and other viewing windows around the world, with our UK and US studios having a number 
of original commissions conﬁrmed or in the pipeline for international distribution in 2018 
and beyond. Conﬁrmed commissions for international rights outside of the UK include 
Harlots (S2) for Hulu, Vanity Fair and War of the Worlds for Amazon and Robozuna for 
Netflix. In the UK, these programmes will be broadcast on either ITV or the BBC. The OTT 
deals for international distribution will make Netflix the biggest customer for our Global 
Entertainment business in 2018.
ITV America has developed several scripted programmes over the last few years and has 
a healthy pipeline of content in development. Our 2017 scripted deliveries included Good 
Witch, Sun Records, Somewhere Between and a pilot of Snowpiercer. 2018 deliveries and 
beyond are expected to include a fourth series of Good Witch and a ten-part series of 
Snowpiercer.
In the UK, there is stronger demand and higher viewing ﬁgures for UK content over 
imported series. We are a major producer of scripted content and have further reinforced 
this position through our acquisition of World Productions in 2017. Our 2017 scripted 
deliveries in the UK included Victoria, Cold Feet, Poldark, Unforgotten, The Loch and Fearless. 
Scripted deliveries in 2018 include Vanity Fair, Next of Kin, Trauma, The City And The City, 
Poldark (S4), Unforgotten (S3) and The Bodyguard, all of which have international appeal.
In Europe, we have seen a resurgence in demand for local scripted content because acquired 
US content is not performing as well as it has historically on broadcast channels. There is 
now also global demand for high-quality, foreign language scripted content. As such, we 
have strengthened our position in this area through our acquisitions of Tetra Media Studio 
in France and Cattleya in Italy along with our investment in Apple Tree Productions, a Danish 
scripted production company. These acquisitions produce long-running, critically acclaimed 
foreign-language dramas for free-to-air, pay and OTT platforms locally and internationally. 
Titles include Proﬁlage for TF1, Gomorrah for Sky Italia and Suburra for Netflix and Rai.
While not growing as quickly as scripted content, demand for unscripted content remains 
strong as networks continue to require lower cost, high volume popular series. The UK 
remains the dominant producer of unique unscripted formats. 
Along with the established entertainment and factual entertainment genres, unscripted 
reality programming, where we have focused our US acquisitions, has grown quickly with 
formats such as Real Housewives, Four Weddings, The First 48 and Alone. OTT platforms 
have also started to supplement their catalogue with unscripted titles, which provides 
a lower cost alternative to expensive scripted titles. In 2018, we will have multiple 
original unscripted commissions in production or development including; Queer Eye 
for the Straight Guy, and Girl Incarcerated with Netflix and several shows in development 
with Facebook.
ITV is now a genuine global player in unscripted content, being a leading unscripted 
independent producer in the US and Europe as well as the largest commercial production 
company in the UK. The large independent production companies, such as Endemol 
Shine Group and Fremantle Media, continue to be ITV Studios’ main competitors in 
non-scripted content. 
 Good Witch is a scripted format produced by 
ITV America for the Hallmark channel in the US. 
It will go into its fourth season in 2018.

Changes in viewing habits
The multiple ways in which viewers are now able to watch content has impacted viewing 
habits globally and we have seen a signiﬁcant increase in OTT viewing as a result. This varies 
by demographic with younger viewers spending proportionately more time consuming 
video content on non-TV devices (such as smartphones, games consoles and tablets) 
compared with older demographics who spend more time on linear television. 
Digital viewing, while currently only a small proportion of total viewing, is growing fast, 
particularly via OTT services such as Netflix and Amazon, which have seen exponential 
growth over the last few years. We continue to invest in ITV’s online offering, the ITV Hub, 
along with rolling out our SVOD services, BritBox in the US and Canada, and Cirkus in the 
Nordics and Germany, to enable us to compete in this market.
Linear television viewing
In the UK, linear television viewing still remains the most popular form of media 
entertainment. UK average linear television viewing in 2017 was 203 minutes per day, 
down from 212 minutes in 2016. The decline is partly driven by the absence of a major 
sporting event in 2017 and is similar to 2013 (a no sporting year), which also saw a nine 
minute decline in average viewing year-on-year. The average for 16–34s was 123 minutes 
per day which declined by 11% (2016: 138 minutes). The corresponding decline for 16–34s 
across the ITV family of channels was 5% and as such ITV saw share growth for this 
demographic year-on-year (Source: BARB). Younger viewers are more skewed to watching 
content outside of the seven-day BARB measurement window and often on non-TV devices 
and as such this viewing is not currently captured by BARB (further detail below). While it is 
clear that younger viewers do watch less linear television than other demographics, if the 
right content is delivered, they will watch it either via linear television or online. Love Island 
on ITV2 was an example of this in 2017, with an average of 1.4 million 16–34s viewers across 
the series and 0.9 million 16–34s catch up requests online per day. 
ITV competes for linear viewers with the BBC and commercial broadcasters including 
Channel 4, Sky and Channel 5. ITV and BBC1 continue to be the only channels consistently 
able to deliver mass audiences as well as targeted demographics, and in 2017, ITV again 
delivered 99% of all commercial audiences over ﬁve million viewers and 96% over 
three million.
In 2017, the ITV family of channels increased their SOV to 21.7% (2016: 21.3%) and is second 
only to the BBC’s Family of channels at 31.4% which lost share during the year (2016: 31.9%) 
due to the move of key entertainment shows from BBC1 to commercial broadcasters. 
Digital viewing
Digital viewing includes catch up viewing of broadcaster content via the television set or 
other devices, such as tablets and mobiles and video on demand (VOD) delivery of other 
long-form content such as box sets and movies via services such as Sky, Netflix and Amazon. 
While digital viewing has grown fast, it still accounts for a small proportion of total viewing 
time. In the UK, we estimate 75% of all viewing of legal long-form content is live (excluding 
online simulcast viewing) (2016: 79%), with a further 13% timeshifted via a Personal Video 
Recorder (PVR) and watched within 28 days of the original broadcast date (2016: 12%). 
Of the estimated 12% of content viewed on demand (2016: 9%), 4% is catch up viewing of 
broadcaster content via the television set or to other devices such as tablets and mobiles 
(2016: 4%). The remaining 8% of content is other VOD viewing, where viewing of box sets 
via services such as Sky, Netflix and Amazon are replacing viewing of DVDs (2016: 5%). 
This is growing quickly, driven by accessibility of these services on smartphones, tablets 
and connected televisions, which allows viewers to watch content whenever and wherever 
they want.

 Market Review
Pay television
The platform 
mix in the UK 
is roughly 50% 
free-to-air 
and 50% linear 
pay TV
There is currently no industry measure for online viewing in the UK. BARB is developing a 
joint-industry, audited measure of online viewing across all devices used to watch content, 
which will include viewing across PCs, tablets and smartphones. Initial ﬁndings from this 
project are expected to be published during 2018.
Pay television
Free-to-air television in the UK is delivered through services including Freeview, YouView 
and Freesat, while linear pay television is delivered through operators such as Sky, BT, Virgin 
and TalkTalk. The platform mix between free-to-air and linear pay television has remained 
constant for a number of years at around 50:50. The market dynamics of the pay market 
are changing as established pay television providers such as Sky and Virgin face increasing 
competition from BT and OTT providers Netflix and Amazon.
Increasingly homes are supplementing their free and pay television with other forms of 
paid content including SVOD services such as Netflix, or by purchasing additional channels 
through ‘no-contract’ providers such as Now TV or TalkTalk TV Store. Around 30% of homes 
in the UK have an SVOD service and this is weighted towards those homes that have linear 
pay TV (Source: BARB). Including SVOD pay services, the platform mix in the UK is roughly 
40% free-to-air and 60% paid viewing, which is unchanged from 2016.
ITV earns revenue from various third parties, including Sky and Virgin, through the licensing 
of channels and content, including our HD digital channels (ITV2 HD, ITV3 HD and ITV4 HD) 
and catch up VOD. 
ITV has also launched BritBox, a SVOD service in the US and Canada, which is a joint venture 
with the BBC. The service offers a signiﬁcant amount of content from both broadcasters 
and gives ITV access to the fast-growing SVOD market in the US.
Advertising revenue
As an integrated producer broadcaster, ITV generates revenues from advertising through 
linear television, sponsorship and online, and competes with commercial broadcasters and 
other advertising media for its advertising revenues. Cash from these revenue streams is 
then used to fund the creation of content in the UK and internationally.
In the UK, television advertising (including VOD, sponsorship and other television revenues) 
continues to hold a signiﬁcant share of the overall advertising market with a 25.5% share 
in 2017 (2016: 27.5%). The decrease year-on-year can be attributed to the ongoing political 
and economic uncertainty in the UK with advertisers reducing spend on television as they 
try to manage margins. Historically, we have seen that television advertising loses share 
in an economic downturn, however it recovers quickly when the cycle reverses. Internet 
advertising (search, classiﬁed and display) has grown its share to 51.2% in 2017 (2016: 46.6%), 
making the UK one of the most developed markets for online advertising. Internet advertising 
has beneﬁted in the current climate from the way it is sold when compared with television. 
Online advertising is normally sold as annual volume deals rather than share deals for 
television, which enables advertisers to reduce their television spend quickly. Print 
advertising continues to decline at 13.1% in 2017 (2016: 15.6%).
While online advertising has grown rapidly, there are concerns about what some online 
advertising delivers, especially when compared with television, that online has no trusted 
measurement system, the adverts may not be seen by a human in full or at all and the 
content around the advertising may not be appropriate for that brand. The ITV Hub 
delivers the key demographics and a high-quality, trusted and measured environment 
for online advertisers. 
The UK television advertising market is extremely difﬁcult to measure as all broadcasters 
have different deﬁnitions. We estimate ITV’s SOB (which is based on pure linear television 
advertising excluding VOD, sponsorship and self-promotion) to be 47.6% in 2017, up from 
47.4% in 2016. This increase is because of ITV’s unique ability to deliver mass audiences 
across multiple regions and in key demographics.

Chief Executive’s Report
Carolyn McCall
Chief Executive
I was very pleased to join ITV in January 
as Chief Executive. It is still early days, 
but I have already visited many parts of 
the business and met many very talented 
ITV people. I have visited our ofﬁces in 
London, Manchester and Leeds, a number 
of our newsrooms, production companies 
as well as two cornerstones of our schedule, 
Coronation Street and Emmerdale. I have 
been struck by the pride and passion ITV 
people have for what they do and the 
critical role ITV plays in society and the 
media ecology. 
ITV’s operational performance was strong 
in 2017 in what clearly was a challenging 
year with continued economic and political 
uncertainty impacting the demand for 
television advertising. Share of viewing 
was up for the second year running –  
a ﬁrst ever for ITV; there was a signiﬁcant 
increase in online viewing, up over 30% 
and with good revenue growth; and the 
Studios business also delivered good 
revenue growth both in total, and 
excluding acquisitions.  15
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information
 Chief Executive’s Report
ITV has a strong consumer proposition 
and fantastic content which drives mass 
audiences and key demographics which are 
so valuable to advertisers. It also has the 
potential to do more targeted advertising. 
Live television remains the preferred way 
of watching content, even for younger 
audiences. And it gives immediate scale, 
reach and fame for advertisers that just 
cannot be achieved anywhere else. It also 
provides a safe, trusted and transparent 
environment in which to advertise and 
generates the highest return on investment 
of any media. Recent research by Ebiquity, 
found that for every pound spent, TV 
generates over £4 of proﬁt compared to 
just over £2 for online video and less than 
£1 for online display. 
While online advertising continues to grow, 
advertisers are challenging its effectiveness 
and what it actually delivers – we are now 
starting to see many more questions being 
asked about unacceptable content, 
measurability and trust in online media. 
The Board is proposing a full year dividend 
of 7.8p, up 8% which reflects conﬁdence in 
the business and the outlook for 2018. This 
is in line with ITV’s ordinary dividend policy. 
The business remains highly cash generative 
but given that there is now a more normal 
ordinary dividend, ﬁve consecutive special 
dividends, leverage around 1x and a strategic 
refresh underway, the Board has decided 
not to pay a special dividend for 2017.
ITV is in good shape but we recognise that 
the media landscape continues to change 
rapidly, with more content to watch and 
more ways to watch it. The economics 
are also changing. We are operating in 
an increasingly competitive market – 
traditional broadcasters are no longer our 
only competitors for viewers, for advertising 
and for quality content. These relatively 
‘new’ competitors are also customers. 
We have kicked off a strategy refresh to 
address all of these areas and we have 
identiﬁed three major areas in this refresh – 
content, advertising and direct to consumer. 
We will have a clear strategy, together with 
well-deﬁned priorities, to establish what ITV 
needs to be in three and ﬁve years’ time and 
what we need to do to face the challenges 
and exploit the opportunities ahead. 
 Trauma was a three-part drama broadcast on 
ITV main channel in February 2018 and produced

Chief Executive’s Report continued
Netflix and Amazon are important buyers 
of our content – this year, Netflix will 
become the biggest customer of Global 
Entertainment, our distribution business. 
And the focus isn’t just on drama, they also 
want unscripted content in the US. 
And ITV Studios is an international 
production business of scale, with total 
revenues of over £1.5bn – 54% of which 
was generated outside the UK – and is 
active in 11 countries with a library of over 
45,000 hours. We have strong relationships 
through our global production and 
distribution network and sell content 
to over 200 channels globally. 
The ITV Hub delivers a high quality, trusted 
and measured environment for advertisers. 
It also allows us to build direct to consumer 
relationships around our great content and 
programme brands – something we are 
just at the start of – but already we have 
75% of all 16 to 34 year olds registered. 
And through voting and competitions within 
our programmes, we had over 100 million 
interactions last year. 
Creating and owning quality content is 
a real advantage. The integrated producer 
broadcaster model is also a beneﬁt – we have 
a great opportunity to make content famous 
on our channels in the UK before selling it 
round the world. Not only does our success 
on-screen and online depend on having 
fantastic content, but the global demand 
for high quality programming remains strong 
as broadcasters and platform owners look 
for brand deﬁning content. 
 Emmerdale performed strongly in 2017, with 
an average of 6.5 million viewers and a 33% share, 
this was its highest share in four years. 17

 An Hour to Catch a Killer Trevor McDonald 
presented this one-off documentary as part of 
ITV’s Crime and Punishment season broadcast 
on the main channel in 2017.
While the economic outlook remains 
uncertain, we expect ITV Family NAR to 
be positive in the ﬁrst half with Q1 up 1% – 
a continuation of the improvement we saw 
towards the end of 2017. In 2018 we expect 
online to show double digit revenue growth. 
We have kicked off our strategic refresh 
and when we report to you at the interims 
we will be able to give you an update and 
some of the key headlines. In the meantime, 
we remain very focused on the business. 
There is a lot to do and the energy and 
commitment of ITV people both creatively 
and commercially will help us deliver all 
of this. 
We have a solid foundation to build on and 
a strong balance sheet and healthy cash 
flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the 
right strategic decisions for the long term 
future of ITV in an increasingly competitive 
environment whilst still delivering 
sustainable returns to shareholders.

volumes are actually up too by 3% with 
online viewing up 22%. And we have a great 
schedule to come for the rest of the year 
including the FIFA World Cup in June, 
Vanity Fair, Clean Break, White Dragon, 
Britain’s Got Talent and Little Big Shots. 
ITV Studios’ has a great pipeline of new

Poldark, Bodyguard and Shetland for BBC, 
Living the Dream for Sky and internationally 
Love Island, The Voice, The Chase, Big Star’s 
Little Star, Snowpiercer and Good Witch. 
We have already secured over 60% of our 
expected revenue for 2018, about £100 
million more than this time last year and 
expect to deliver good organic revenue 
growth in ITV Studios over the full year.

We earn pay revenues from platforms in the UK primarily by licensing 
our HD channels and our online VOD services. In March 2017, we 
launched a joint venture with the BBC, BritBox US, a SVOD service 
offering the best of British television. The service launched in Canada 
in February 2018. We also monetise our consumer interaction with 
our biggest shows through competitions and voting. Going forward 
we need to ensure we are paid the appropriate value for our content 
on all platforms.
Original production
We produce original content commissions for broadcasters and platform 
owners internationally from our production bases in the UK, the US, 
the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Australia and the Nordics.

Responsibility
Building a responsible business that 
beneﬁts all stakeholders.
We want to continue to build a successful, creative, commercial and global 
organisation. We believe that conducting our business in a responsible way 
has a fundamental role in achieving this goal. 
As the largest commercial broadcaster in the UK and a growing international business, 
we reach millions of people on a daily basis through our programmes and channels. 
We are woven into the fabric of society, both mirroring and shaping popular culture. 
As well as complying with our legislative and regulatory requirements, we believe in

and our communities. To help shape our corporate responsibility (CR) strategy, we engage 
with our stakeholders to identify the issues most important to them and our business. 
Our approach
Our strategy focuses on three priorities: people, planet and partnerships. Each of our 
priorities highlights the risks and opportunities that are most relevant to us, and we 
have made four commitments under each, that incorporate our main assets and business 
operations. These three pillars are underpinned by core responsible business practices 
such as good governance, business ethics, data protection, responsibility of content and

ITV’s Employee Network Groups
Active networks like ITV Ambassadors, 
ITV Pride and The Women’s Network help 
connect colleagues and help identify 
ways to make ITV an even more inclusive

new networks; ITV Balance for working 
parents, grandparents and carers, and ITV 
Embrace, the Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic network. 
Low emission vehicles
Improving the environmental impact of 
our operations is an important focus at 
ITV. In 2017, our ITV Daytime team, who 
look after Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, 
This Morning and Loose Women, bought 
a range of Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles 
to replace older diesel models. These 
vehicles each drive about 40,000 miles 
a year to broadcast footage from outside 
the studio. Not only do the new vehicles 
save fuel and money, they are technically 
more advanced, and so transmit better 
quality footage.
1 million minutes
In the UK more than one million older 
people are chronically lonely, and 
Christmas is one of the loneliest times. 
That’s why, in December 2017, Good 
Morning Britain repeated it’s award-
winning campaign, 1 Million Minutes, 
asking viewers to pledge just 30 minutes 
of their time to support an older person. 
Partnering with a number of charities, 
the campaign was promoted on-air in 
the UK and abroad, including Austria, 
Australia, Canada and South Africa. 
The response from viewers was amazing, 
with over 22.7 million minutes pledged 
during the month of the campaign, which 
makes a real difference to so many lives.

 Operating and Performance Review
ITV has delivered a strong operational 
performance in a challenging year 
with ongoing economic and political 
uncertainty in the UK. ITV took action 
early to reduce overhead costs but the 
uncertainty has undoubtedly had an 
impact on the demand for television 
advertising and therefore as expected 
ITV’s ﬁnancial performance.
We set ourselves challenging objectives to 
grow our on-screen and online viewing and 
deliver good growth in non-NAR. And ITV 
has delivered on these as we have continued 
to rebalance and strengthen the business 
creatively and commercially. On-screen, our 
share of viewing was up for the second year, 
up 2%, the ITV Hub continues to deliver 
strong viewing, up 39%, Online, Pay & 
Interactive revenue grew 7% and total 
ITV Studios revenue grew 13% including 
currency beneﬁt. We have a strong creative 
pipeline of high-quality programmes, 
particularly drama and entertainment, 
and we continue to perform well across 
the key genres that return and travel. 
We measure performance through a 
range of metrics, particularly through our 
alternative performance measures and KPIs 
as well as our statutory results, all of which 
are set out later in the report.
External revenue was up 2% to £3,132 million 
(2016: £3,064 million), with 11% growth in 
non-NAR more than offsetting the decline 
in NAR, a clear indication that our strategy 
of rebalancing the business is working. 56% 
of total revenues came from sources other 
than spot television advertising (non-NAR).
Adjusted EBITA declined 5% to £842 million 
(2016: £885 million) and adjusted EPS 
declined 6% to 16.0p (2016: 17.0p) impacted 
by a 5% decline in NAR and the ongoing 
investment across the business and the 
fact that the prior year includes the full 
£37 million revenue and proﬁt beneﬁt of the

Statutory proﬁt before tax declined by

and statutory EPS declined by 9% to 
10.2p primarily due to the decline in earnings 
and higher amortisation and impairment 
of acquired assets, which is explained in 
more detail in the Finance Review. 
We have a strong balance sheet and 
the business continues to be highly cash 
generative. Our proﬁt to cash conversion 
remains high at 91% and we ended the 
year with net debt of £912 million (2016: 
£637 million) after the effect of acquisitions 
and investments of £95 million, dividend 
payments of £494 million and pension 
contributions of £80 million. 
The Board has proposed an ordinary 
dividend of 7.8p, an increase of 8%, 
reflecting our conﬁdence in the underlying 
strength of the business and the outlook 
for 2018. This is in line with the Board’s 
commitment to a long-term sustainable 
dividend policy and for ordinary dividends to 
grow broadly in line with earnings, targeting 
dividend cover of around 2x adjusted 
earnings per share over the medium term. 
We remain focused on being a creator, 
owner, distributor and broadcaster of 
content and in 2017 we continued to deliver 
on our strategy to diversify the business and 
grow new revenue streams, further reducing 
our reliance on UK spot advertising and 
making ITV a stronger and more resilient 
business. We continue to build our free-to-
air, online and pay businesses through 
Broadcast & Online and are further growing 
our international content and distribution 
business, ITV Studios. We are currently 
undertaking a strategic refresh to ensure 
we have a clear strategy and well-deﬁned 
priorities which reflect what ITV needs to 
be in three and ﬁve years’ time.

Viewing
On-screen we performed strongly with 
viewing up for the second consecutive year. 
We increased our spend on entertainment 
but sports costs were lower as a result of 
there being no major sports tournament 
in 2017. 
ITV Family SOV grew 2% with a strong 
performance across the schedule. This level 
of growth is the second biggest in ITV’s 
recent history and never before has ITV 
delivered two years of consecutive growth. 
Daytime shows including Good Morning 
Britain, This Morning and The Chase grew 
their audiences and Coronation Street 
and Emmerdale continue to perform well 
and are now the UK’s two largest soaps. 
We launched the sixth weekly episode 
of Coronation Street in September, which 
has further strengthened its performance. 
We successfully aired a range of new dramas 
street was weak while supermarkets 
increased their spend and some of the 
FMCGs returned to spend in the second half 
of 2017. Entertainment & Leisure was down, 
impacted by tough comparatives from the 
European Football Championship in 2016. 
Cars and Telecommunications increased 
their spend around product launches and 
digital brands continue to spend heavily 
on television to build brand awareness.
Total costs were down as the cost savings 
and lower schedule costs offset the increased 
investment on the ITV Hub, ITV Hub+ and ITV 
Box Ofﬁce (our pay-per-view channel used 
to show boxing matches). 
Overall Broadcast & Online adjusted EBITA 
declined 7% to £599 million (2016: £642 
million) which has led to a one percentage 
point reduction in the adjusted EBITA margin 
to 29% (2016: 30%).
Broadcast & Online
The media environment in which we 
operate is constantly changing. Our Broadcast 
& Online business is robust and evolving 
to take advantage of the signiﬁcant 
opportunities for growth. 
ITV through its free-to-air channels offers 
unique audience scale and reach as well 
as the key demographics demanded by 
advertisers. The ITV Hub, the digital home 
for all our channels and content, is growing 
rapidly, driven by viewers’ appetite for catch 
up and VOD and the quality of our content. 
We continue to explore and trial new ways, 
both free and pay, to distribute content to 
broadcasters and platform owners as well 
as directly to consumers. 
Financial performance
Broadcast & Online total revenue was 
down 3% in the year at £2,075 million (2016: 
£2,132 million). We delivered 7% growth in 
Online, Pay & Interactive, driven by double-
digit growth in online advertising, but this 
was offset by the 5% decline in NAR. Including 
sponsorship, VOD and self-promotion, 
ITV total advertising was down 3%. 
Advertising categories such as Retail, Finance 
and Food continued to see declines due 
to the uncertain economic outlook, along 
with the weaker pound causing inflationary 
pressures, leading advertisers to reduce 
spend in order to maintain margins. Within 
Retail, spending has been mixed: the high 
 Good Karma Hospital was the third most 
watched drama on ITV in 2017, averaging 
6.9 million viewers and a 26% share. It has been 
recommissioned for a second series in 2018. 25

 Operating and Performance Review
including Liar, Good Karma Hospital, 
Fearless, Bancroft and Little Boy Blue and 
new entertainment shows, The Voice, The 
Voice Kids, The Keith and Paddy Picture 
Show and Five Gold Rings, as well as new 
sitcom Bad Move. We continued to drive 
signiﬁcant audiences with our returning 
brands such as Broadchurch – which was 
the most watched drama in the year – Vera, 
Unforgotten, Victoria, Cold Feet, Ant & Dec’s 
Saturday Night Takeaway, I’m A Celebrity…
Get Me Out Of Here! and Britain’s Got Talent. 
Our news programming continues to 
perform well with highlights including our 
General Election coverage, as does our 
sporting schedule with the Six Nations 
Rugby Championships and the launch of 
horse racing on ITV. Some of our schedule 
did not perform as well as we had hoped, 
for example The Nightly Show, Fearless and 
Bigheads, so will not return in 2018.
We continue to target the hard to reach 
demographics demanded by advertisers – 
particularly young and male audiences – 
through our digital channels and online, 
and have seen a signiﬁcant increase in 
our target demographics on ITV2 and ITV4. 
Our 16–34s share of commercial impacts 
(SOCI) on ITV2 was up 17% helped by the 
phenomenal success of Love Island as well 
as Celebrity Juice, Family Guy and American 
Dad. Male SOCI on ITV4 was up 12% helped 
by ITV’s horse racing coverage, The French 
Open and the Isle of Man TT Races. ITV3’s 
viewing performance improved in the year 
due to the strong performance of dramas 
such as Midsomer Murders, Lewis and 
Endeavour. ABC1 adults SOCI on ITV3 was 
up 1% making it the most popular digital 
channel for this demographic.
ITV Hub
The ITV Hub, which is now available on 
29 platforms, continues to grow rapidly, 
driven by viewing on mobile and connected 
televisions. The ITV Hub is now pre-installed 
on around 90% of all connected televisions 
sold in the UK and launched on Apple TV, 
Apple’s new TV app and Microsoft XBox 
in 2018.
Long-form video requests were up 34% 
and online viewing consumption, which 
measures how long viewers are spending 
online, was up 39%. The ITV Hub has now 
been the fastest-growing public service 
broadcaster online service for the last three 
years driven by the good user experience 
and great content and now has 21 million 
registered users.
The ITV Hub helps ITV reach valuable younger 
audiences – 75% of the UK’s 16–24 year olds 
are registered together with 65% of the UK’s 
16–34 year olds. Younger viewers increasingly 
use the ITV Hub for simulcast viewing, as 
well as catch up, with programmes such as 
Love Island delivering record viewing with 
1.3 million simulcast requests for the ﬁnal.
We are using the insight we gain from our 
registered users to develop more targeted 
advertising solutions and to increasingly drive 
viewing through personalisation. In the year, 
we launched personalised ITV Hub home 
pages for our audiences and have introduced 
data-driven recommendations and mobile 
notiﬁcations to registered users. 
 Diana, Our Mother: Her Life & Legacy was 
ITV’s highest rated factual in over 14 years. It had 
9.4 million viewers and a 36% share.
 Unforgotten returned to ITV for its second 
series. It is produced by Mainstreet Pictures, part 
of ITV Studios UK. It averaged 6.1 million viewers 
and has been recommissioned for a third series 
in 2018.  26 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

ITV commercial audiences As a result, ITV’s ‘Other commercial income’ 
increased by 2%, with new sponsorship 
around ITV horse racing and The Voice, 
offset by a reduction in third-party airtime 
sales commission and revenue primarily 
from UTV following ITV’s acquisition in 
February 2016 and successful integration 
of the business.
Digital advertising is growing rapidly and 
we have seen double-digit growth in our 
VOD advertising revenues on the ITV Hub, 
which delivers more targeted demographics 
and a high-quality, trusted and measured 
environment for online advertisers.
In 2017, ITV announced a trial for addressable 
advertising with Sorenson on connected 
Smart televisions. We have also launched 
a trial of a self-service portal so that any 
business, however small, can easily access 
advertising on ITV.
Remain responsive to a changing  
media environment
Linear television viewing remains resilient 
despite signiﬁcant changes in the availability 
and delivery of content. On average viewers 
watched 203 minutes of television a day in 
2017. This is lower than 212 minutes in 2016 
and partly is due to there being no major 
sports tournament in 2017. The majority 
of viewing remains live at over 75% as 
television continues to have the power 
to bring audiences together. VOD viewing 
continues to grow rapidly while PVR (recorded) 
viewing has remained relatively constant 
over the last few years at around 13%. 
Younger viewers are watching less linear 
television than they used to, but through 
delivering great content such as The Voice, 
Britain’s Got Talent, Saturday Night Takeaway 
and Love Island, television reaches around 
90% of young people each week and 
remains their dominant choice of media. 
Developing ITV’s digital  
broadcast assets
We are further developing our social media 
assets across our international portfolio of 
programmes as live television continues to 
demonstrate a growing relevance as viewers 
increasingly connect and engage through 
social media. We now have over 160 YouTube 
branded channels and had around 20 owned 
and operated programme apps across the 
year which, together with our quality content, 
is driving signiﬁcant growth in viewer 
engagement. Our programmes generated 
over 100 million interactions in 2017. 
Strong advertising proposition
While political and economic uncertainty 
has led advertisers to reduce their current 
spend, television remains one of the 
most efﬁcient and effective mediums for 
advertisers to achieve mass simultaneous 
reach. As viewing and advertising becomes 
more fragmented, the scale of advertising 
that television, and particularly ITV, delivers 
becomes increasingly valuable. 
ITV’s unique ability to deliver mass 
audiences, as well as more targeted 
demographics across the family of channels, 
has enabled us to again increase our share 
of the television advertising market (SOB) to 
47.6% from 47.4%. ITV delivered 99% of all 
commercial audiences over ﬁve million and 
96% of all commercial audiences over three 
million. SOV provides an overall measure 
of viewing performance, but because 
advertisers are buying scale and breadth 
of audience, SOV is not necessarily a direct 
indicator of advertising performance. 
ITV aims to maximise further the value of 
its airtime and drive new revenue streams 
through sponsorship, interactivity and 
branded extensions. ITV utilises the core 
assets of its strong brand and reputation, 
unique commercial relationships and quality 
production capability to deliver a wide 
variety of marketing solutions. 
 Horse Racing moved to ITV from Channel 4 
in 2017 with races broadcast across ITV main 
channel and ITV4 during the year.

We are continuing to develop the ITV Hub+, 
our ad-free subscription version of the ITV 
Hub, which while relatively small, tripled 
its subscribers in the year. We have extended 
the service across all platforms so subscribers 
can now watch on mobile, PC and connected 
televisions and launched it on Amazon.
Over the last few years we have also 
established a number of smaller pay 
propositions. We own a majority stake 
in Cirkus, a best of British SVOD service 
in the Nordics and Germany. We also have 
a general entertainment channel, ITV 
Choice, for emerging markets available 
in over 100 countries. 
We are trialling ITV Box Ofﬁce, a direct 
to consumer pay per view offering which 
currently focuses on boxing and we have 
a number of live events based around our 
key brands, which build relationships directly 
with our viewers. For example, we have 
the Emmerdale Studios Experience, which 
showcases the process of creating an 
episode of the soap, and This Morning Live, 
a shopping and lifestyle festival. 
ITV also continues to license its channels 
and content across multiple platforms, 
including our HD digital channels and 
catch-up VOD on Sky and Virgin Media set 
top boxes and all our live channels and catch 
up VOD across their connected platforms. 
We announced that ITV Encore will close 
as an exclusive Sky channel in 2018 which 
allows ITV to distribute box sets more widely 
across multiple platforms. The closure 
of Encore will impact ITV’s pay revenues 
in 2018.
SDN
SDN generates revenue by licensing capacity 
to broadcast channels, radio stations and 
data providers on digital terrestrial 
television or Freeview. It holds a licence 
with capacity for 16 broadcast channels, 
including ITV services and third-party 
channels. SDN external revenue grew 
4% driven by the full year impact of the 
16th stream, which was launched in 2016. 
Building our pay offering in the UK 
and internationally
As a creator, owner and distributor of sought 
after content, ITV is well positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities that arise 
from the changes we are seeing in digital 
media and consumer behaviour. We must 
ensure that however our content is viewed 
and on whatever platform it is viewed on, 
we are paid the appropriate value for it.
As we look to build our pay offerings, we are 
developing SVOD services to target direct 
to consumer pay revenues. In March 2017, 
we launched our US joint venture with the 
BBC, BritBox, (with AMC Networks taking 
a minority share), an ad-free SVOD service 
offering the most comprehensive collection 
of British content in the US. A version of the 
service also launched in Canada in February 
2018 and we now have over 250,000 
subscribers in total. In 2018, we will explore 
opportunities for BritBox on other platforms, 
include original commissions, and look to 
roll it out further internationally. 
 Saturday Night Takeaway returned for 
its 14th series in 2017 and averaged 7.9 million 
viewers and a 37% share across the series returns 
for a 15th series in 2018.
Our pay  
offerings 28 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Total organic revenue, which excludes 
our current year acquisitions and foreign 
exchange, was up 7% and acquisitions 
continue to deliver with a 13% return 
on investment in 2017.
Reflecting our growth in key production 
markets in Europe and the US, 54% of ITV 
total revenue was generated outside the 
UK (2016: 50%). ITV is the number one 
commercial producer in the UK and a leading 
producer in Europe and the US. As our 
Studios business grows internationally, 
foreign currency movements have an 
increasing impact on our results. 
In 2017, the foreign currency beneﬁt was 
£43 million on revenue and £7 million on 
adjusted EBITA. 
Adjusted EBITA was flat year-on year at 
£243 million. There was good underlying 
proﬁt growth but adjusted EBITA was 
impacted by our ongoing investment in 
US drama and the fact that the prior year 
includes the full £37 million beneﬁt of the 
four year licence deal for The Voice of China. 
Adjusted EBITA margin declined by two 
percentage points to 15%, impacted by 
revenue mix on new and returning shows. 
ITV Studios
Growing an international content business 
has been central to ITV’s strategy as 
an integrated producer broadcaster. 
As ITV creates and owns more content, 
our channels in the UK provide a platform 
to showcase our programmes before 
distributing them across multiple platforms 
in the UK and internationally. 
Growing demand for content
The strong global demand for content from 
broadcasters and platform owners provides 
signiﬁcant opportunity for ITV Studios.
We estimate that the global content 
market is growing at around 5% per annum, 
with some genres, such as drama, growing 
more rapidly. To capitalise on this growth, 
we continue to develop, own and manage 
rights in genres that return and travel 
internationally, namely drama, entertainment 
and factual entertainment, and we have 
built a healthy pipeline of new and 
returning programmes. 
Financial performance
ITV Studios is now a global producer 
of scale and total revenues grew 13% 
to £1,582 million (2016: £1,395 million) 
including currency beneﬁt, with growth 
across the business as we continue to 
build our capability in key creative markets.

Key new and returning  
scripted programmes
Building scale in key creative markets
ITV Studios has three production divisions 
– Studios UK, ITV America and Studios Rest 
of World (RoW). Across these divisions, ITV 
produced over 8,400 hours of programming, 
compared to 7,800 in 2016 and secured 240 
recommissions and 239 new commissions 
in the year. 
The US and the UK are the dominant 
creative markets, with the US the largest 
exporter of scripted content and the UK the 
world leader in exported formats. Over the 
last few years we have built scale in these 
key markets, both organically and through 
acquisitions, and we now have a signiﬁcant 
portfolio of successful series and formats 
that travel.
The UK performed well with total revenue 
up 11% at £692 million (2016: £626 million). 
We continue to grow our sales to ITV, which 
were up 13% with deliveries including The 
Voice, The Voice Kids, Love Island, Next of 
Kin, Bancroft, Fearless, Unforgotten, Little 
Boy Blue and an extra episode of Coronation 
Street. We have again grown ITV Studios 
UK share of original content on ITV main 
channel from 63% to 66%. Our off-ITV 
revenues grew 10% with deliveries including 
The City And The City, Shetland, Moorside 
and Motherland for BBC, Back for Channel 4, 
Blind Date for Channel 5 and Living the 
Dream for Sky. We strengthened our UK 
drama business with the acquisition in April 
of a majority stake in World Productions, 
the producer of Line of Duty, and our 
entertainment business with an investment 
in start-up Koska in October. 
ITV America total revenue grew 33% to 
£313 million (2016: £235 million) including 
foreign exchange. We delivered ﬁve drama 
commissions – the third series of the 
Good Witch for Hallmark which has been 
commissioned for a fourth series, Sun Records 
for CMT, Somewhere Between for ABC and 
two pilots for TNT, Highland and Snowpiecer, 
which has been commissioned for a ten-part 
series. We have also delivered a high volume 
of programmes from our entertainment 
portfolio including two series of Hell’s 
Kitchen, Pawn Stars, Alone, Forged in Fire 
and First 48 and new commissions including 
Sideserf, World Hip Hop Star and Big Star’s 
Little Star.
Studios RoW has production bases in 
Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, 
the Nordics and Italy where we produce 
original content as well as local versions of 
ITV Studios UK and Talpa formats. Revenue 
grew 10% to £390 million (2016: £355 million) 
including foreign exchange, driven particularly 
by good growth in Australia, France and 
the Nordics. Across the territories, our 
entertainment and format deliveries 
included The Voice in Australia and 
Germany, The Chase in Australia and 
Germany, and Love Island in Germany. 30 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Operating and Performance Review continued
We have further strengthened our 
international business with a number 
of other small investments. In April, 
we acquired a 45% stake in Blumhouse 
Television, established by Jason Blum, 
the renowned ﬁlm and television producer, 
which ﬁnances and produces original 
scripted and unscripted ‘dark’ genre 
programming for global audiences including 
The Jinx and Cold Case Files. In May we 
entered into a joint venture with the US 
talent agent and production company, 
Circle of Confusion, and in June we acquired 
Elk Production, a Swedish entertainment 
production company. 
Investing in content with 
international appeal
We have continued to expand our portfolio 
of successful formats and series that return 
and can be distributed internationally. 
With the acquisition of Talpa Media in 2015, 
we have signiﬁcantly strengthened our 
global capability in entertainment formats. 
Across the business, we have grown a solid 
portfolio of high volume and high margin 
formats that travel internationally and that 
we produce locally. For example, during 2017 
we produced The Voice in ﬁve countries 
and The Voice Kids and Four Weddings in 
four countries. 
Demand for drama is growing strongly as 
standout original content becomes brand 
deﬁning for both broadcasters and OTT 
players. To capitalise on this, we are investing 
in our global scripted business, particularly 
in the US, to build on the success of our 
UK drama business. We are strengthening 
our development and creative capabilities 
internally and have invested in a number 
of development relationships. In 2017, 
we increased our investment in drama 
across the business, investing £243 million 
(2016: £160 million). 
We ﬁnance our large-scale scripted projects 
through our strong underlying cash flows 
or through co-productions and partnerships 
with broadcasters and OTT platforms. 
The production costs are partly funded by 
the initial sale of the series to a broadcaster, 
while the deﬁcit (the difference between 
the cost and what the broadcaster pays), 
is recovered through distribution revenue 
from selling the ﬁnished product globally 
to other broadcasters and platforms. 
Talpa continues to develop its formats 
including The Voice Senior, A Year To 
Remember, I Love My Country, A Whole 
New Beginning and Around The World With 
80 Year Olds. Our international scale now 
enables ITV to make The Voice and these 
other formats in all our international 
production territories and therefore earn the 
production revenue as well as the format fee.
Some of our content will not be 
recommissioned in 2018 as they have 
not performed as expected, for example 
The Loch and Sun Records. 
We are making real progress in building 
a European scripted business. In February 
2017, ITV acquired a majority stake in Tetra 
Media Studio, a French scripted production 
company, and in October ITV acquired 
a majority stake in Cattleya, the Italian 
scripted production company behind 
Gomorrah and Suburra. We also took a stake 
in a Danish scripted producer Apple Tree 
Productions in December. These, along with 
our existing European drama businesses, 
will enable us to beneﬁt from the increasing 
demand for locally produced content with 
global appeal.
 Marriage Boot Camp is a US reality 
entertainment format produced by ThinkFactory 
Media which is part of ITV America, and is now in 
its 11th season.
 Poldark is produced by Mammoth Screen 
(part of ITV Studios UK) for the BBC. It has been 
recommissioned for a fourth season in 2018 and 
has been sold to over 150 countries. 31

We balance our ﬁnancial exposure through 
building a portfolio of programmes across 
genres and across their content life cycle, 
with successful international dramas 
offsetting the risk that we will not recover

Queer Eye for the Straight Guy for Netflix, 
Harlots for Hulu and we are in development 
with a number of shows for Facebook. 
Expanding our global  
distribution business
Global Entertainment, the distribution 
arm within ITV Studios, delivered revenue 
growth of 4% to £187 million (2016: £179 
million) as we continue to drive value from 
our investment in creating and owning the 
rights to quality content with international 
appeal. As well as funding and creating new 
content from ITV Studios, we also invest in 
third-party producers and their content 
from all over the world. Global 
Entertainment’s pipeline of new projects is 
strengthening with projects such as Vanity 
Fair, The City And The City and World On Fire 
expected for 2018.
Our content continues to sell well 
internationally to broadcasters and OTT 
platforms and in particular, our scripted 
programmes with titles including Victoria, 
Poldark, Vera, Good Witch, The Murdoch 
Mysteries, Schitts Creek, The Loch, Fearless 
and Harlots. Over 15 of our scripted 
programmes have been sold to more than 
100 countries Our entertainment and 
factual entertainment formats are highly 
demanded and include programmes such 
as The Voice, Love Island, The Chase, Big 
Star’s Little Star, This Time Next Year, Five 
Gold Rings, Come Dine With Me and Four 
Weddings. In 2017, we sold 62 different 
formats internationally, 17 of which are 
being produced by ourselves or other 
producers in three or more countries 
including Love Island, Keeping the Nation 
Alive and Hell’s Kitchen. We currently have 
over 250 programme supply agreements 
in place with online platforms including 
Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. 
 Love Island is a UK reality entertainment 
format, the third series of which was broadcast 
on ITV2 in 2017. The format has been sold to six 
countries including Australia and Germany.
 5 Gold Rings is a new entertainment format 
co-produced by Talpa Media and Possessed (part 
of ITV Studios UK). It was broadcast in the UK in 
2017 and will return for a second series in 2018. 
The format was sold to four countries in 2017. 32 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Operating and Performance Review continued
 Pictured: Behind the scenes 
on Coronation Street
We consistently seek to drive 
productivity across the Group by 
investing in our people, new broadcast 
and production technology as well as 
up to date ofﬁce facilities. 
By investing in these areas, we aim to 
transmit our content and advertisements 
more efﬁciently, increase our production 
output and the rights we own and 
improve our viewer experience. 
People
During the year, we continued to invest in our people, rolling out a new conversation 
based performance management process and continuing to provide general and  
more speciﬁc training for staff across the business.
We use employee engagement scores as a key measure. We will undertake our next 
engagement survey in 2018. Our 2016 survey showed that ITV continues to have high 
levels of engagement (90%), (see the KPIs section on pages 36 to 39 for details on how 
this is measured). We always seek to recruit and promote internally where possible with 
34% of vacancies in 2017 ﬁlled from within ITV.
Broadcast and content technology 
One of the key initiatives in our Broadcast business is to improve our processes around 
our content supply chain, which includes how we store our content and how our content 
is managed and ultimately played out via our transmission centres. We have sought to 
reduce the time taken from live transmission to content being available for catch up on 
the ITV Hub. We are in the process of upgrading our advertising sales system and during 
the year we began investigating how robotic process automation may beneﬁt ITV in 
the future.
Production facilities 
September 2017 saw the launch of a sixth weekly episode of Coronation Street, which 
required a signiﬁcant step up in productivity and investment in expanding the production 
site with new streets, as well as new equipment, sound stages and a state of the art 
production control room. We refresh our regional news production facilities on a 
continuous rotation basis and this year we built new facilities for our UTV licence in 
Northern Ireland. During 2018, we are relocating our Daytime studios to a new state 
of the art facility as part of our London property move.
We also seek to use established and emerging technology to drive productivity, where it 
makes commercial sense to do so. In our Studios business, we have recently implemented 
a new process and technology for script editing and management. We commenced 
roll-out of a bespoke artist payment system, which has reduced duplication across the 
business and uses less paper. Our regional news teams are taking advantage of new 
production technologies and increasingly use mobile kits that enable reporters to shoot 
more efﬁciently and transmit high-quality live reports.

 Operating and Performance Review
 Pictured: Broadchurch 34 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
The Annual Report includes both statutory and adjusted measures, the latter of which, in management’s view, reflect the 
underlying performance of the business and provide a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and measured 
on a day-to-day basis. 
Our APMs and KPIs are aligned to our strategy and business segments and together are used to measure the performance 
of our business and form the basis of the performance measures for remuneration.
Adjusted results exclude certain items because, if included, these items could distort the understanding of our performance 
for the year and the comparability between periods.
Key adjustments for adjusted EBITA, profit before tax and EPS
Adjusted EBITA is calculated by adding back exceptional items and high end production tax credits to EBITA. Further adjustments, which 
include amortisation and impairment of assets and net ﬁnancing costs, are made to remove their effect from adjusted proﬁt before 
tax and EPS. The tax effects of all these adjustments are reflected in the adjusted tax charge. These adjustments are detailed below. 
Production 
tax credits 
The ability to access tax credits, which are rebates based on production spend, is fundamental to our Studios business 
when assessing the viability of investment in green-lighting decisions, especially with regards to high-end drama. 
ITV reports tax credits generated in the US and other countries (e.g. Ireland, Hungary, Canada and South Africa) within 
cost of sales, whereas in the UK and Italy tax credits for high-end drama must be classiﬁed as a corporation tax item. 
However, in our view all tax credits relate directly to the production of programmes. Therefore, to align treatment, 
regardless of production location, and to reflect the way the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis, 
these are recognised in adjusted EBITA. Our cash measures including proﬁt to cash conversion and free cash flow are 
also adjusted for the impact of production tax credits. Further detail on this is included below.
Exceptional 
items 
These include acquisition-related costs, reorganisation and restructuring costs, property costs and non-routine legal 
costs. These items are excluded to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how the business 
is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis. They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not 
considered part of the core operations of the business or are considered to be one-off in nature, though they may 
cross several accounting periods. We also adjust for the tax effect of these items. Note 2.2 includes further detail 
on exceptional items.
Acquisition-related costs
We structure our acquisitions with earnouts or put and call options, to allow part of the consideration to be based on 
the future performance of the business as well as to lock in and incentivise creative talent. Where consideration paid or 
contingent consideration payable in the future is employment-linked, it is treated as an expense (under accounting rules) 
and therefore part of our statutory results. However, we exclude all consideration of this type from adjusted EBITA, 
adjusted proﬁt after tax and adjusted EPS as, in our view, these items are part of the capital transaction and do not form 
part of the Group’s core operations. The Finance Review explains this further. Acquisition-related costs, including legal 
and advisory fees on completed deals or signiﬁcant deals that do not complete, are also treated as an expense (under 
accounting rules) and therefore on a statutory basis form part of our reported results. In our view, these items also form 
part of the capital transaction and are excluded from our adjusted measures.
Restructuring and reorganisation costs
These arise from Group-wide initiatives to reduce the ongoing cost base and improve efﬁciency in the business. 
We consider each project individually to determine whether its size and nature warrant separate disclosure. Where there 
has been a material change in the organisational structure of a business area or a material Group-wide initiative, these 
costs are highlighted and are excluded from our adjusted measures.
Property costs
In 2018, ITV will relocate to various properties on a temporary basis while its headquarters are redeveloped. The ﬁt-out 
costs will be capitalised but the incremental one-off property project costs, including move costs, rental payments for 
these properties and accelerated depreciation for assets made redundant due to the move, will be ring-fenced as they 
relate to a one-off property project and are therefore excluded from our adjusted measures. As a ring-fenced cost, 
rental payments will continue to be excluded from our adjusted measures until we move back, which is expected in 2023.
Amortisation  
and  
impairment  
Amortisation and impairment of assets acquired through business combinations and investments are not included 
within adjusted earnings. As these costs are acquisition-related, and in line with our treatment of other acquisition-
related costs, we consider them to be capital in nature and they do not reflect the underlying trading performance of 
the Group. Amortisation of software licences and development is included within our adjusted results as management 
consider these assets to be core to supporting the operations of the business. 
Net financing 
costs 
Net ﬁnancing costs are adjusted to reflect the underlying cash cost of interest for the business, providing a more 
meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and funded on a day-to-day basis. The adjustments made remove 
the impact of mark-to-market on swaps and foreign exchange, imputed pension interest and other ﬁnancial gains and 
losses, which do not reflect the relevant interest cash cost to the business and are not yet realised balances. 
A full reconciliation between our adjusted and statutory results is provided on the following page.

other pension assets, mainly gilts, over which the pension scheme 
holds a charge, which are held by the Group as security for future 
unfunded pension payments of four former Granada executives. 
A full reconciliation is included within note 3.7. 
Proﬁt to cash conversion 
This is our measure of our effectiveness of cash generation used for 
working capital management. It is calculated as our adjusted cash 
flow as a proportion of adjusted EBITA. Adjusted cash flow, which 
reflects the cash generation of our underlying business, is calculated 
on our statutory cash generated from operations before exceptional 
items, net of capex on property, plant and equipment (excluding 
capex relating to the redevelopment of our London headquarters) 
and intangible assets, and including the cash impact of high end 
production tax credits. 
Free cash flow
This is our measure of free cash flow after we have met our ﬁnancial 
obligations. It takes our adjusted cash flow (see above) and removes 
the impact of net interest, adjusted cash tax (which is total tax 
paid adjusted to exclude the receipt of production tax credits) and 
pension funding. A full reconciliation is included on pages 45 and 46. 36 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Adjusted EBITA 
Definition
This is the key proﬁtability measure used across the whole business. Adjusted earnings 
before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) is calculated by adding back exceptional items 
and high end production tax credits. It reflects the underlying performance of the business  
and provides a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and measured 
on a day-to-day basis.
Further detail on this measure is included within the Alternative Performance Measures 
section, page 34.
Performance
In 2017, adjusted EBITA decreased by £43 million or 5%, predominantly due to a £81 million 
or 5% decline in NAR. This was partially offset by growth from high margin Online, Pay & 
Interactive, £25 million lower programming budget due to the absence of a major sports 
tournament, delivery of £29 million of overhead savings, and foreign exchange beneﬁt. 
Group adjusted EBITA margin decreased by two percentage points to 27% driven by the 
decline in NAR and revenue mix within ITV Studios.

ITV Family 
share of

Definition
Keeping our free-to-air proposition strong and our audiences healthy is vital for the Broadcast  
& Online business, and ITV Family SOV helps measure this. ITV Family SOV is the total viewing 
audience over the year achieved by ITV’s family of channels as a proportion of total television 
viewing, including the BBC Family. 
Performance
ITV Family SOV grew 2% in 2017 to 21.7%. Within this, the ITV main channel was up 1% with 
strong performances from daytime, the soaps, drama and entertainment. The digital channels 
were up 3% in the year mainly across ITV2 and ITV4. ITV2 viewing amongst 16–34s continues 
to grow, with 16–34s SOV up 18% in the year. It remains the most popular digital channel in 
the UK based on SOV and is the largest digital channel for 16–34s.
ITV also continues to deliver mass audiences and in 2017 delivered 99% of all commercial 
audiences over ﬁve million and 96% over three million, which is unchanged from 2016.

ITV Family share of 
commercial impacts
Definition
To maintain our position as a leading commercial broadcaster, we need to have strong ITV 
Family SOCI. SOCI is the trading currency in the television advertising market, and since it only 
covers commercial television it does not include the BBC. This is the share of total UK television 
commercial impacts which is delivered by ITV’s family of channels. An impact is one viewer 
watching one 30-second commercial. SOCI provides an overall measure of viewing performance. 
However, because advertisers are buying scale and breadth of audience, SOCI is not necessarily 
a direct indicator of advertising performance. 
Performance
ITV Family SOCI was broadly flat year-on-year, with ITV main channel flat and the digital 
channels up 1%. ITV2 is now more targeted towards younger viewers with SOCI amongst 
16–34s up 17% in the year. ITV4 is more targeted towards male viewers with Men SOCI 
up 12% in the year. ITV3 is targeted to ABC1 adults with SOCI up 1% in the year for this 
demographic. The move of The Great British Bake Off from BBC1 to C4 affected ITV 
main channel’s SOCI performance in the year.

ITV Family share  
of broadcast
Definition
ITV’s share of UK television spot advertising revenue is known as its share of broadcast (SOB). 
Our SOB has always been based on our estimate of the pure spot advertising market, excluding 
sponsorship, VOD and all broadcasters’ self-promotion revenues on their own channels, which 
this year has seen a signiﬁcant increase and therefore further distorts the external spot market.
It is increasingly difﬁcult to measure the total television advertising market as all broadcasters 
have different deﬁnitions and include other sources of revenue, such as sponsorship and VOD, 
in their estimates of television advertising. 
Performance
We again gained share in 2017 as a result of our unique ability to deliver mass audiences across 
the key demographics to our advertisers and more targeted demographics on our digital 
channels. This was helped by ITV’s coverage of the horse racing, which targets the male 
demographic and is highly demanded by advertisers. Our SOB increased to 47.6% in the year.

Total long-form 
video requests
Definition
We remain focused on growing our audience share from our free-to-air broadcast 
and increasingly from our VOD business as well. 
Long-form video requests is a measure of the total number of our videos requested across 
all platforms on which the ITV Hub is available and therefore provides a key measure of how 
much of our content is being viewed online. A long-form video is a programme that has been 
broadcast on television and is available to watch online and on demand in its entirety. 
Performance
Long-form video requests were up 34% in 2017 to 1,426 million views supported by 
our continued investment and focus on the ITV Hub, mobile apps and simulcast offering. 
Online consumption, which is the measure of how long viewers are spending online, 
is an important indicator of online performance and this increased by 39% in 2017.

Definition
As we grow our international content business, tracking the performance of the creative 
renewal pipeline and the number of new commissions won is a key indicator. This ﬁgure 
includes programmes shown both on ITV and on other broadcasters, and both in the UK 
and internationally.
Performance
There was strong growth in the number of new commissions for ITV Studios in 2017 , up 5%  
to 239. Eighty three of these new commissions came from the UK business, with the remaining 
156 coming from our international businesses. In addition, there were 240 recommissions in 
the year (2016: 188) with 106 from ITV Studios UK and 134 from the international businesses. 
We continue to invest in our creative pipeline, building on our existing portfolio of programmes 
and formats. We are particularly focused on the genres that can return and travel, namely drama, 
entertainment and factual entertainment.

As an integrated producer broadcaster, part of our strategy is to use our broadcast channels

The percentage of ITV output from ITV Studios increased to 66% in 2017 driven by new 
entertainment programmes in the year such as The Voice, The Voice Kids and Cannonball 
as well as an extra episode of Coronation Street during 2017. Many of the ITV Studios

ITV Family 
share of 
viewing
Definition
Keeping our free-to-air proposition strong and our audiences healthy is vital for the Broadcast  
& Online business, and ITV Family SOV helps measure this. ITV Family SOV is the total viewing 
audience over the year achieved by ITV’s family of channels as a proportion of total television 
viewing, including the BBC Family. 
Performance
ITV Family SOV grew 2% in 2017 to 21.7%. Within this, the ITV main channel was up 1% with 
strong performances from daytime, the soaps, drama and entertainment. The digital channels 
were up 3% in the year mainly across ITV2 and ITV4. ITV2 viewing amongst 16–34s continues 
to grow, with 16–34s SOV up 18% in the year. It remains the most popular digital channel in 
the UK based on SOV and is the largest digital channel for 16–34s.
ITV also continues to deliver mass audiences and in 2017 delivered 99% of all commercial 
audiences over ﬁve million and 96% over three million, which is unchanged from 2016.

ITV Family share of 
commercial impacts
Definition
To maintain our position as a leading commercial broadcaster, we need to have strong ITV 
Family SOCI. SOCI is the trading currency in the television advertising market, and since it only 
covers commercial television it does not include the BBC. This is the share of total UK television 
commercial impacts which is delivered by ITV’s family of channels. An impact is one viewer 
watching one 30-second commercial. SOCI provides an overall measure of viewing performance. 
However, because advertisers are buying scale and breadth of audience, SOCI is not necessarily 
a direct indicator of advertising performance. 
Performance
ITV Family SOCI was broadly flat year-on-year, with ITV main channel flat and the digital 
channels up 1%. ITV2 is now more targeted towards younger viewers with SOCI amongst 
16–34s up 17% in the year. ITV4 is more targeted towards male viewers with Men SOCI 
up 12% in the year. ITV3 is targeted to ABC1 adults with SOCI up 1% in the year for this 
demographic. The move of The Great British Bake Off from BBC1 to C4 affected ITV 
main channel’s SOCI performance in the year.

ITV Family share  
of broadcast
Definition
ITV’s share of UK television spot advertising revenue is known as its share of broadcast (SOB). 
Our SOB has always been based on our estimate of the pure spot advertising market, excluding 
sponsorship, VOD and all broadcasters’ self-promotion revenues on their own channels, which 
this year has seen a signiﬁcant increase and therefore further distorts the external spot market.
It is increasingly difﬁcult to measure the total television advertising market as all broadcasters 
have different deﬁnitions and include other sources of revenue, such as sponsorship and VOD, 
in their estimates of television advertising. 
Performance
We again gained share in 2017 as a result of our unique ability to deliver mass audiences across 
the key demographics to our advertisers and more targeted demographics on our digital 
channels. This was helped by ITV’s coverage of the horse racing, which targets the male 
demographic and is highly demanded by advertisers. Our SOB increased to 47.6% in the year.

 Finance Review
ITV delivered a strong operational performance in a challenging 
year with ongoing economic and political uncertainty in the UK. 
ITV took action early to reduce overhead costs but the continued 
uncertainty has undoubtedly had an impact on the demand 
for television advertising and therefore as expected, on ITV’s 
ﬁnancial performance.
We set ourselves challenging objectives to grow our on-screen 
and online viewing and deliver good growth in non-NAR, and we 
have delivered on these. On-screen, our share of viewing grew 
for the second consecutive year, up 2%, online viewing was up 39%, 
Online, Pay & Interactive revenues grew 7% and ITV Studios total 
revenues grew 13%, including currency. In total, ITV delivered 2% 
external revenue growth to £3,132 million, with the 11% increase 
in non-NAR to £2,066 million more than offsetting the 5% decline 
in spot advertising revenue.

£25 million lower programme budget due to no major sports 
tournament, growth from high margin Online, Pay & Interactive 
and foreign exchange beneﬁt. ITV Studios showed good underlying 
proﬁt growth but the comparator included £37 million beneﬁt 
of the four year licence deal for The Voice of China which was 
recognised in full in accordance with accounting standards. 
ITV Studios adjusted EBITA was flat at £243 million. Group adjusted 
EBITA was also impacted by £15 million of investment including 
in the ITV Hub, ITV Box Ofﬁce and ITV Studios creative capability, 
particularly in America.

Adjusted ﬁnancing costs were higher year-on-year due to the bond 
issue. We made a number of investments in associates, including 
Blumhouse Television and Circle of Confusion and our joint venture 
BritBox US, and our adjusted tax rate was the same year-on-year. 
The net of these movements and the decline in NAR resulted in 
a 6% decline in adjusted EPS to 16.0p. Statutory EPS was down 9% 
to 10.2p due to the decline in EBITA and higher amortisation and 
impairment, which is explained over the following pages. 
Our key strengths include our high margins and healthy cash flows, 
which, together with our ongoing focus on costs, places us in a good 
position to continue to invest in growing an even stronger and more 
resilient business going forward, while delivering sustainable returns 
to our shareholders.

Total exceptional items (154) (164)
T otal exceptional items in the year were £154 million (2016: 
£164 million). Operating exceptional items principally relate to 
acquisition-related expenses, which are mainly performance based 
employment-linked consideration. Restructuring and property-
related costs of £30 million include £24 million of incremental 
one-off property project costs associated with our planned London 
property move in 2018, primarily related to temporary rent and 
accelerated depreciation on ﬁxtures and ﬁttings. We will continue 
to incur exceptional rental costs over the next four or ﬁve years 
until we return to our headquarters at The London Television 
Centre. Further details can be found later in the section. 
Restructuring and property-related costs also include £6 million 
of redundancy costs in relation to the closure of the London 
Studios business. 
The insured trade receivable provision of £27 million relates to 
the unpaid portion of revenue from the four year licence deal for 
The Voice of China with Talent Television and Film Co. Ltd (Talent), 
the revenue for which was fully recognised in 2016 in accordance 
with accounting standards as ITV had no further obligations under 
the terms of the agreement. Following a breach of the agreement 
by Talent as they had not fulﬁlled their payment obligations, we 
have taken back the licence for The Voice of China. ITV is pursuing 
Talent vigorously for the £30 million still due under the agreement. 
Further, ITV has credit insurance in place and a claim has been 
submitted. ITV will continue to pursue the amounts due and 
believes there will ultimately be no material impact. Whilst ITV is 
conﬁdent that it will recover the amount due, accounting standards 
set very speciﬁc requirements for the recognition of contingent 
assets, which is how the recovery of the amount due will be 
accounted for. As discussions with the insurers and the claim 
against Talent are in progress, at this early stage of pursuing 
recovery ITV is not able to demonstrate sufﬁcient certainty for 
accounting purposes, to be able to recognise a cash receivable at 
the year end. Accordingly, ITV has made a provision amounting to 
£27 million (£30 million net of £3 million insurance excess) against 
the Talent receivable recorded in our accounts in the year ended 
31 December 2017. The cash received in future will also be treated 
as an exceptional item. 
The cash cost of exceptionals in 2017 was £126 million.
The pension curtailment in 2016 related to the closure of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension sections of the ITV pension scheme to 
future beneﬁt accrual.

Net ﬁnancing costs (50) (51)
Adjusted ﬁnancing costs increased to £33 million (2016: £26 million) 
primarily due to the full year impact of the new €500 million 
Eurobond issued in December 2016.
Net ﬁnancing costs were £50 million in 2017 which was broadly flat 
year-on-year (2016: £51 million). The increase in adjusted ﬁnancing 
costs was offset by lower unrealised foreign exchange and other 
net ﬁnancial losses. These costs largely relate to the movement in 
the value of put and call options for unowned equity on acquisitions 
we have made when it is not dependent on the seller remaining 
within the business. The put and call options normally run for three 
to ﬁve years. The value in the put and call option will fluctuate with 
currency and the expected performance of the business. 
JVs and associates 
The share of losses from JVs and associates has increased to 
£4 million (2016: nil) and is in relation to losses arising on our 
investments in BritBox US (a US based SVOD service launched as a 
joint venture with the BBC in the US in 2017) along with Blumhouse 
Television and Circle of Confusion, both of which are scripted talent 
investments within ITV Studios.
Profit before tax 
Adjusted proﬁt before tax, after amortisation and impairment 
of assets and ﬁnancing costs, was down 6% at £800 million (2016: 
£847 million). Statutory proﬁt before tax decreased by 10% to 
£500 million (2016: £553 million), due to the decline in EBITA 
as explained earlier, along with higher costs associated with 
amortisation and impairment of acquired assets in the year.

Adjusted tax charge
The total adjusted tax charge for 2017 was £154 million (2016: 
£160 million), corresponding to an effective tax rate on adjusted 
proﬁt before tax (PBT) of 19% (2016: 19%), which is broadly in line 
with the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%). 
We expect this effective tax rate to be sustainable over the medium 
term. The adjustments made to reconcile the tax charge with the 
adjusted tax charge are the tax effects of the adjustments made 
to reconcile PBT and adjusted PBT, as discussed earlier.

Implications of US tax reforms
As a result of the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
in the US, ITV has recognised a non-cash tax charge of £9 million, 
resulting from the revaluation of our US deferred tax assets to 
reflect the reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate to 21% 
from 1 January 2018.
We are working through the new legislative provisions in order 
to assess the full impact on our tax proﬁle going forward, however 
we do not expect them to have a material impact on the Group’s 
effective tax rate.
Cash tax
Cash tax paid in the year was £95 million (2016: £90 million), the 
majority of which was paid in the UK. The 2017 cash tax ﬁgure is 
net of £23 million of production tax credits received in the year 
(2016: £36 million). The cash tax paid is higher than the full year tax 
charge for 2017 of £87 million largely due to the timing of receipt of 
production tax credits in the UK and Italy and the tax treatment of 
allowable pension contributions. A reconciliation between the tax 
charge for the year and the cash tax paid in the year is shown below.

Tax strategy
ITV is a responsible business, and we take a responsible attitude to tax, 
recognising that it affects all of our stakeholders. In order to allow 
those stakeholders to understand our approach to tax, we have 
published our Global Tax Strategy, which is available on our 
corporate website.
 
www.itvplc.com/investors/governance/policies
We have four key strategic tax objectives :
1. Engage with tax authorities in an open and transparent 
way in order to minimise uncertainty
2. Proactively partner with the business to provide clear, timely, 
relevant and business focused advice across all aspects of tax
3. Take an appropriate and balanced approach when considering 
how to structure tax sensitive transactions
4. Manage ITV’s tax risk by operating effective tax governance 
and understanding our tax control framework with a view 
to continuously adjusting our approach to be compliant with 
our tax obligations 
Our tax strategy is aligned with that of the business and its 
commercial activities, and establishes a clear Group-wide approach 
based on openness and transparency in all aspects of tax reporting 
and compliance, wherever the Company and its subsidiaries operate. 
Within our overall governance structure, the governance of tax 
and tax risk is given a high priority by the Board and Audit and Risk 
Committee, including through the operation of the Tax & Treasury 
Committee. Further details of the Committee can be found on page 
66. The ITV Global Tax Strategy as published on the ITV plc website 
is compliant with the UK tax strategy publication requirement set 
out in Part 2 Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016. 44 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

EPS – adjusted and statutory
Overall, adjusted proﬁt after tax was down 6% at £646 million 
(2016: £687 million). After non-controlling interests of £4 million 
(2016: £4 million), adjusted basic earnings per share was 16.0p 
(2016: 17.0p), down 6%, which is marginally higher than the decrease 
in adjusted EBITA of 5% due to an increase in adjusted ﬁnancing 
costs to £33 million (2016: £26 million) and our investment in 
associates in the year. The weighted average number of shares 
declined marginally to 4,006 million (2016: 4,010 million) because 
ITV bought shares during the year on behalf of the Employee 
Beneﬁt Trust and, in line with accounting standards, shares held by 
the Trust are not included in the total share count. Diluted adjusted 
EPS in 2017 was 16.0p (2016: 17.0p) reflecting a weighted average 
diluted number of shares of 4,017 million (2016: 4,029 million). 
The weighted average diluted number of shares was down year- 
on-year because of a decrease in the number of shares expected 
to vest in ITV’s long term incentive plans in the future.
Statutory EPS declined by 9% to 10.2p (2016: 11.2p) due to the 
decline in statutory EBITA as explained earlier, along with higher 
costs associated with amortisation and impairment of acquired 
assets in the year. 
A full reconciliation between statutory and adjusted EPS is 
included within the Alternative Performance Measures section.
Dividend per share
The Board has declared a ﬁnal dividend of 5.28p, an increase of 10% 
(2016: 4.8p). This equates to a full year dividend of 7.8p (an increase 
of 8% year-on-year), which gives a cover of 2.1x and reflects our 
conﬁdence in the underlying strength of the business and the 
outlook for 2018.
This is in line with the Board’s commitment to a long-term 
sustainable dividend policy and for ordinary dividends to grow 
broadly in line with earnings, targeting dividend cover of around 
2x adjusted earnings per share over the medium term. ITV plc had 
£1.6 billion of distributable reserves at 31 December 2017 available 
immediately to support the dividend policy. 
Given that there is now a more normal ordinary dividend, ﬁve 
consecutive special dividends, leverage of 1x net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA and the strategic refresh under way, the Board has decided 
not to pay a special dividend in respect of 2017.

Acquisitions
Since 2012, we have acquired a number of content businesses in 
the UK, US and creative locations across Europe, developing a strong 
portfolio of programmes that return and travel. As we have grown 
in size and expanded our network relationships and distribution 
capability, this has helped to renew and strengthen our creative 
talent and build our reputation as a leading European producer 
and distributor and a leading unscripted independent production 
company in the US. 
During the year, we have strengthened our UK business with the 
acquisition in April of a majority stake in World Productions, the 
drama production company behind the critically acclaimed and 
multi-award-winning Line of Duty. In October, we acquired a 25% 
stake in Koska Limited, a UK factual-entertainment production 
start-up, founded by Nick Emmerson, co-creator of Supernanny.
We are also making real progress in building a European scripted 
business. In February, we acquired a majority stake in Tetra Media 
Studios, the French television production group behind leading 
dramas including crime series Proﬁlage, now in its seventh series, 
and Les Hommes de l’Ombre, the critically acclaimed political 
thriller. In October, we acquired a majority stake in Cattleya, the 
leading Italian independent producer behind international hit 
TV dramas Gomorrah, Suburra and Romanzo Criminale, and in 
December we acquired a 25% stake in Apple Tree Productions, 
a Danish scripted production company headed up by the award-
winning producers of The Killing and The Bridge.
We have further strengthened our international business with 
a number of other small investments and acquisitions. In April, 
we acquired a 45% stake in Blumhouse Television, established by 
Jason Blum, the renowned ﬁlm and television producer, which 
ﬁnances and produces original scripted and unscripted ‘dark’ genre 
programming for global audiences, including The Jinx and Cold Case 
Files. In May, we acquired a 49% stake in Circle of Confusion, a 
premier talent management and production company in the US, 
to launch Circle of Confusion Television Studios. The new television 
studio label will source, develop and produce premium scripted 
programming. Additionally, in June we acquired a majority stake 
in Elk Production, one of the leading independent production 
companies in Sweden. The company produces original formats 
such as the award-winning reality TV series Parneviks, along with 
acquired formats including Ninja Warrior and Dessertmästarna. 
We have strict criteria for evaluating potential acquisitions. 
Financially, we assess ownership of intellectual property, earnings 
growth and valuation based on return on capital employed and 
discounted cash flow. We have a corporate cost of capital (WACC), 
which we flex when assessing investment opportunities reflecting 
the size, risk proﬁle, geography and type of investment. We also use 
our WACC to assess the performance of our investments and in the 
year we had a 13% return on capital employed from our acquisitions, 
well in excess of our WACC. Strategically, we ensure an acquisition 
target has a strong creative track record and pipeline in content 
genres that return and travel, namely drama, entertainment and 
factual entertainment, as well as succession planning for key 
individuals in the business. 45

** Undiscounted and adjusted for foreign exchange, including the initial cash consideration and excluding working capital adjustments.
We generally structure our deals with earnouts or with put and 
call options in place for the remainder of the equity, capping the 
maximum consideration payable. By basing a signiﬁcant part of the 
consideration on future performance in this way, not only can we 
lock in creative talent and ensure our incentives are aligned, but 
we also reduce our risk by only paying for the actual, not expected, 
performance delivered over time. We believe this is the right way 
to structure our deals as we should not pay upfront for future 
performance and should incentivise and reward delivery by the 
business over time.
The majority of earnouts or put and call options are dependent on 
the seller remaining within the business, the most signiﬁcant of 
which is for Talpa Media whereby the total maximum consideration, 
including the payment made to date, is up to €1.1 billion, which is 
contingent on Talpa Media continuing to deliver signiﬁcant proﬁt 
growth to 2022 as well as John de Mol’s continued commitment 
to the business during this time. To date, we have paid €600 million 
to John de Mol including €100 million for the ﬁrst tranche of the 
earnout which was paid out in full in May 2017. Under the deal 
structure, because all future payments are directly related to John 
de Mol remaining with the business, these payments are treated as 
employment costs and therefore are part of our statutory results. 
However, we exclude them from adjusted proﬁts and adjusted EPS 
as an exceptional item, as in our view, for the reasons set out above, 
these items are part of capital consideration reflecting how we 
structure our transactions and do not form part of the core 
operations. This is consistent with our treatment of all costs 
of this type.
The table above sets out the initial consideration payable on our 
acquisitions, our expected future payments based on our current 
view of performance and the total maximum consideration payable, 
which is only payable if exceptional compound earnings growth  
is delivered. 
We closely monitor the forecast performance of each acquisition 
and, where there has been a change in expectations, we adjust our 
view of potential future commitments. 
Expected future payments of £292 million have decreased by 
£36 million since 31 December 2016, which is the net of the 
additional future payments relating to our 2017 acquisitions, the 
€100 million payment made to John de Mol for the ﬁrst tranche of 
his earnout and foreign exchange on future payments denominated 
in foreign currency. At 31 December 2017, £161 million of expected 
future payments had been recorded on the balance sheet.
In 2018, around £78 million will be payable on our acquisitions, 
primarily to those based in the US.

One of ITV’s key strengths is its healthy cash flows reflecting our 
ongoing tight management of working capital balances and our 
disciplined approach to cash and costs. This is particularly important 
when there is wider political and economic uncertainty. Remaining 
focused on cash and costs means we are in a good position to 
continue to invest across the business and deliver sustainable 
returns to our shareholders.
In the year, we generated £763 million (2016: £862 million) of 
operational cash from £842 million (2016: £885 million) of adjusted 
EBITA, which equates to a strong proﬁt to cash ratio of 91% after 
capex (2016: 97%). In the year, we saw an increase in working capital. 
This was due to the payment schedule for sports rights for future 
years, and the timing difference between the production and the 
ﬁnal delivery and payment of scripted and entertainment titles 
such as Snowpiercer, Good Witch, Vanity Fair, Poldark, Dancing on Ice 
and Survival of the Fittest.
To facilitate our working capital management, we have a £100 million 
non-recourse receivables purchase agreement (free of ﬁnancial 
covenants), which gives us the flexibility to access additional liquidity 
when required. At the 31 December, £90 million of receivables were 
sold under the purchase agreement (2016: £35 million).

*Adjusted cash tax of £118 million is total cash tax paid of £95 million excluding receipt of 
production tax credits, which are included within adjusted cash flow from operations, as 
these production tax credits relate directly to the production of programmes.
While our free cash flow after payments for interest, cash tax and 
pension funding remained healthy in the period, it was down 17% 
to £527 million (2016: £636 million). This was primarily due to the 
year-on-year decline in adjusted EBITA along with the increase in 
working capital, as explained earlier.
Overall, after dividends (ordinary and special), acquisitions and 
acquisition-related costs, pension and tax payments, we ended 
the year with net debt of £912 million, compared with net debt 
of £1,074 million at 30 June 2017 and net debt of £637 million at 
31 December 2016. Our net cash generation was weighted towards 
the second half of 2017 due to the payment in the ﬁrst half of 
the special dividend, the Talpa earnout and content acquisitions.

Debt structure and liquidity
Our balance sheet strength, together with our healthy free cash 
flow, enables us to continue to invest in opportunities to grow 
the business and to make sustainable returns to our shareholders. 
We have a number of facilities in place to preserve our ﬁnancial 
flexibility. We have a £630 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) 
in place until 2022 (with the option to extend to 2023). We also have 
a bilateral ﬁnancing facility of £300 million, which is free of ﬁnancial 
covenants and matures in 2021. This provides us with sufﬁcient 
liquidity to meet the requirements of the business in the short to 
medium term. The RCF has the usual ﬁnancial covenants for this 
type of ﬁnancing. Of the total £930 million of facilities in place, 
£60 million was drawn down at 31 December 2017. Our policy is 
to maintain at least £250 million of available liquidity at any point.
 In January 2017, we repaid the £161 million Eurobond as it matured.

Foreign exchange 
As ITV continues to grow internationally, we are increasingly 
exposed to foreign exchange on our overseas operations. We do not 
hedge our exposure to revenues and proﬁts generated overseas, as 
this is seen as an inherent risk. We may elect to hedge our overseas 
net assets, where material. To date, we have hedged a signiﬁcant 
portion of the euro net assets arising from the Talpa Media acquisition.
ITV is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on transactions we 
undertake in a foreign currency. Our policy is to hedge a portion 
of any known or forecast transaction where there is an underlying 
cash exposure for the full tenor of that exposure, to a maximum of 
ﬁve years forward, where the portion hedged depends on the level 
of certainty we have on the ﬁnal size of the transaction.
Finally, ITV is exposed to foreign exchange risk on the retranslation 
of foreign currency loans and deposits. Our policy is to hedge such 
exposures where there is an expectation that any changes in the 
value of these items will result in a realised cash movement over 
the short to medium term.
The foreign exchange and interest rate hedging strategy is 
discussed and approved by the ITV plc Board and implemented 
by our internal Tax and Treasury Committee which oversees 
governance and approval of tax and treasury related policies 
and procedures within the business. During 2017, we reviewed 
our foreign exchange risk management policies and made 
some amendments. There were no signiﬁcant changes to 
the previous policy.
Foreign exchange sensitivity
The following table highlights ITV’s sensitivity, on a full year basis, 
to translation resulting from a 10% appreciation/depreciation in 
sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables 
are held constant. An appreciation in sterling has a negative effect 
on revenue and adjusted EBITA; a depreciation has a positive effect.

** Net of £20 million cross-currency swaps.
At 31 December 2017, £570 million of the £630 million RCF 
was undrawn.
Capital allocation and leverage
Our objective is to run an efﬁcient balance sheet. We have always 
believed that maintaining leverage below 1.5x net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA (2017 Adjusted EBITDA was £872 million) will optimise 
our cost of capital and maintain our investment grade credit. 
At 31 December 2017, reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 
1.0x (2016: 0.7x). Our priority has been to invest to drive organic 
growth and we have made acquisitions where we have found the 
right opportunities. We balanced this investment with attractive 
returns to shareholders. Our investment decisions are based upon 
value creation and returns analysis. Our returns analysis looks at 
the 360 degree value creation and the long-term future value 
of our investments in Broadcast and Studios. 
We also look at an adjusted measure of net debt, taking into 
consideration all of our other debt-like commitments including 
the expected, undiscounted contingent payments on acquisitions, 
the net pension deﬁcit, net of gilts held as security against a 
proportion of those liabilities, and the undiscounted operating 
lease commitments, which mainly relate to property. This adjusted 
leverage measure better reflects how the credit rating agencies 
look at our balance sheet. This is important to monitor as our 
investment grade rating is a key criteria when considering our 
overall capital allocation. At 31 December 2017, adjusted net debt 
was £1,430 million (31 December 2016: £1,637 million) and adjusted 
net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6x (31 December 2016: 1.8x). 
A reconciliation of net debt to adjusted net debt is provided in 
the Alternative Performance Measures section on page 35.
Credit ratings
We are rated investment grade by two ratings agencies: BBB- 
(stable outlook) by Standard and Poor’s and Baa3 (stable outlook) 
by Moody’s Investor Services. The factors that are taken into 
account in assessing our credit rating include our degree of 
operational gearing, exposure to the economic cycle, as well as 
business and geographical diversity. Continuing to execute our 
strategy will strengthen our position against all these metrics.  48 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Pensions 
The net pension deﬁcit for the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes at 
31 December 2017 was £83 million (31 December 2016: £328 
million). The year-on-year reduction in the deﬁcit reflects gains 
from asset values in the year, more accurate data on scheme 
members based on the preliminary results of 1 January 2017 
actuarial valuation and our deﬁcit funding contributions of £80 
million. The net pension deﬁcit includes £38 million of gilts, which 
are held by the Group as security for future unfunded pension 
payments of four former Granada executives, the liabilities of 
which are included in our pension obligations. A full reconciliation 
is included within note 3.7.
Actuarial valuation
The last actuarial valuation was undertaken in 2014. On the basis 
agreed with the Trustee, the combined deﬁcits as at 1 January 2014 
amounted to £540 million and are estimated to be at a broadly 
similar level today. 
The Trustee is in the process of undertaking a full actuarial valuation 
of all sections of the Scheme as at 1 January 2017, which we expect 
to agree during H1 2018.

Deﬁcit funding contributions
The Group continues to make deﬁcit funding contributions in line 
with the most recent actuarial valuation in order to eliminate the 
deﬁcits in each section. The acccounting deﬁcit does not drive 
the deﬁcit funding contribution.
The total deﬁcit funding contribution for 2017 was £80 million, 
which is consistent with the contributions payable in 2016. We do 
not expect a material change in the deﬁcit funding contribution 
for 2018. Further details are included within note 3.7.
New accounting standards
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is effective from 1 January 2018. From 
our assessment, there is no material impact on the Group’s results. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is effective from 
1 January 2018. An assessment of the impact on all of the Group’s 
material revenue streams has been completed. The new standard 
requires the Group to reclassify various costs attributable to 
revenue in the income statement. For the year ending 2017, there 
will be no material impact on the Group’s revenue and no impact on 
the Group’s proﬁt or the Group’s adjusted EBITA as detailed below:

Adjusted EBITA –
IFRS 16 Leases, is effective from 1 January 2019. The detailed 
assessment of the impact on the Group’s performance is ongoing. 
During the early impact assessment, the Group has reviewed 
the current accounting for the existing key service agreements, 
including satellite, transponder and playout agreements and 
concluded that those do not meet deﬁnition of a lease and 
therefore should be classiﬁed as service agreements under the 
regulations of IFRS 16 and current accounting standards. Outside 
of the transmission infrastructure agreements, the adoption is likely 
to have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities, mainly due to property leases.

Ian Grifﬁths
Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and Group Finance Director
London property
In 2017, the Board made the decision to redevelop our headquarters 
at The London Television Centre for which we own the freehold. 
This requires relocating staff and studios for four to ﬁve years to 
alternative accommodation before moving back into a new freehold 
building. Therefore, ITV has taken rented ofﬁce and studios space 
in the interim while the new headquarters are constructed.
During the course of the project, ITV will ring-fence all incremental 
costs in relation to the redevelopment. Move costs, dual rates and 
rent will be treated as exceptional costs in the P&L as they relate 
to the one-off property project that runs over several years 
but we will no longer incur them once we return to The London 
Television Centre. Capital items will be capitalised as investment 
capex. Investment capex is excluded from capex for our adjusted 
cash measurements. 
In 2017, ITV incurred £24 million of costs in relation to accelerated 
depreciation for assets made redundant as a result of the move, 
move costs, dual rates and rent. These were exceptionalised as 
explained above. ITV also incurred £16 million of costs for the ﬁt 
out of the interim ofﬁces and studios and in relation to planning 
for the redevelopment of The London Television Centre which 
were capitalised. 
In 2018, ITV will incur move costs, dual running costs, dual rates and 
rent which will be exceptionalised as explained above. ITV will incur 
around £40 million of cash costs for further ﬁt-out of the interim 
ofﬁces and studios space and further costs associated with the 
redevelopment of The London Television Centre, which will be 
capitalised. Depreciation associated with the ﬁt-out of the interim 
ofﬁces and studios space will not be exceptionalised.
In February 2018, Lambeth Council planning committee passed a 
resolution to grant planning permission for the new headquarters. 
The application now goes forward to the Greater London Authority 
for endorsement. Once all approvals have been granted, we expect 
to commence demolition of the current building in 2018. All build 
costs will be capitalised until we move back, which is expected in 
2023, with the most signiﬁcant investment capex to be incurred in 
2021 and 2022. 
Following the step up in London property operating costs in 2018, 
we do not expect future costs to be materially different from 2018 
when we move back in 2023. 50 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risks and 
Uncertainties
As a producer and broadcaster, ITV’s business 
carries a number of risks, which we manage 
through our risk management framework. 
Our continuing success is dependent on how 
well we understand and manage our risks.
Risk management framework
The risk management framework sets out our processes for 
identifying, reviewing and managing our risks and is regularly 
assessed and adapted as the Company, industry and macro 
environment evolves. 
Risks are primarily controlled through the risk management 
process. The Board has carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company and details of these  
are set on out on the following pages. 
Our ongoing process for risk identiﬁcation, review and 
management is set out below and is consistent with last year. 
Management and Divisional Boards
Have responsibility for:
• The development and operation of the risk management 
framework and for the operation of our systems of internal 
control. This includes:
– Risk identiﬁcation and assessment and establishing 
controls and procedures to monitor and mitigate risks
–  Assessment and review of ﬁnancial controls, policies and 
procedures to ensure risks are identiﬁed and the processes 
and procedures are in accordance with and aligned to 
the strategy
–  Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of internal 
controls and putting in place remedial plans where 
controls are weak or there are opportunities for 
improvement. Serious control weakness (if any) is 
reported to the Board and action taken as appropriate
• Routinely reviewing and challenging risks and mitigations.
Operation and Assurance – three lines of defence
• We are continuing to develop our three lines of defence 
model to better manage our risks. We are moving our 
approach to risk away from a rules and process driven 
system to a cultural people driven solution, which we 
believe encourages a focus on prevention rather than 
reaction to failure. The Leading Risk training programme 
in place for ITV Studios production management continues 
to be developed

• Sets strategic objectives
• Identiﬁes and evaluates principal risks and uncertainties
• Sets our strategy on risk and establishes tolerance levels and risk appetite
• Ensures a robust and appropriate risk management framework is in place
• Continually monitors the risk management and internal control systems
The Board is responsible for setting the level of risk the Company is willing to take in line with our strategy. There are clear approval 
frameworks in place and we continue to develop our approach to ensure that the business understands the Board’s risk appetite and 
the tolerance levels and track the key risk indicators to help manage each risk. 
Throughout the year, we have continued to focus on and strengthen our risk culture. We have an open communication culture where 
information is shared and issues are escalated as appropriate.
1 Business divisions
• The business divisions own the 
management of their risks 
and are responsible for:
– Identifying and reporting local risks
– Maintaining risk registers and business 
continuity plans where appropriate
– Reviewing and implementing 
mitigating actions and controls
2 Group functions
• Including Group Finance, Legal, 
Human Resources, Group Secretariat, 
Technology, Procurement, Health &  
Safety, Tax & Treasury and Insurance
• Support the business divisions 
in managing risks.
3 Internal audit
• Internal Audit provides objective assurance 
as to the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk 
management, reporting to the 
Management Board, Divisional boards 
and the Audit and Risk Committee.
• The internal audit plan is driven from ITV’s 
risk management framework. Internal 
Audit reviews the auditable elements of 
the principal and operational risks and this 
review informs the areas and topics that 
Internal Audit focuses on.  52 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

• The current economic 
environment is uncertain, 
which may impact demand for 
advertising
• ITV has made signiﬁcant progress in 
rebalancing the business and 56% of our 
total revenue comes from sources other 
than television spot advertising
• Growing non-NAR in areas such as ITV 
Studios and Online, Pay & Interactive, 
remains a key priority of the business
• The Company has adequate ﬁnancial 
liquidity and balance sheet flexibility 
to continue to invest as ITV maintains 
its focus on cash and costs
A faster than expected  
shift to VOD or other 
new technologies, 
such as internet enabled 
televisions or online 
only services, causes a 
sustained loss of viewing 
and advertising revenue.
• Television is now available on 
many different devices and 
platforms, which is changing 
the way people are consuming 
television and viewers are now 
spending more time watching 
content online
• This structural shift is 
impacting the advertising 
market in the UK as digital 
advertising continues to 
grow strongly
• While growing rapidly, online 
viewing remains a small 
percentage of total viewing 
at around 12% (2016: 9%, 
source: BARB/Thinkbox data) 
and television advertising 
represents 25.5% of total 
advertising in the UK, which 
is slightly down on 2016  
(2016: 27.5%)
• The business continues to develop the 
ITV Hub VOD services, maximise the 
distribution of the ITV Hub and grow 
its VOD advertising business
• ITV monitors the market for new technology 
and where appropriate explores how ITV 
can participate
• ITV continues to invest around £1 billion 
in its programme budget annually
• ITV is focused on ensuring that television 
provides a trusted and safe environment for 
advertisers and delivers the highest return 
on investment of any advertising media. 
• ITV has launched its SVOD proposition, 
Britbox, in the US and Canada
• Cirkus, our SVOD proposition, has been 
rolled out further and is now in the Nordics 
and Germany
This risk has increased since last year 
as online viewing is growing particularly 
amongst younger viewers. 
Principal risks
 
For each principal risk, mitigating actions have been identiﬁed and the risk has been mapped to its relevant business segment and, 
where possible, assigned key risk indicators. Risk direction has also been given to each risk which is after mitigation. Where appropriate, 
the key risk indicators are aligned to our key performance indicators (KPIs) on pages 36 to 39. All principal risks are owned by at least one 
member of the Management Board. 
The Management and Divisional Boards have reviewed ITV’s principal risks and uncertainties and these potential risks are 
predominantly unchanged. 53

Talent and People
A signiﬁcant event 
removes a number of 
the key management 
team from the business 
on a long-term or 
permanent basis.
• In the ordinary course of 
business activities, there will be 
times when the Management 
Board is in one location or 
travel together as a group
• There is a business resilience plan in place, 
which includes succession plans or nominated 
replacements for all key positions within 
the Company
ITV fails to evolve its 
organisational structure 
and culture and therefore 
fails to attract, develop 
and retain key creative, 
commercial and 
management talent.
• Employing the best creative, 
commercial and management 
talent is key to our success
• Failing to create the right 
culture to attract and retain 
this talent increases this risk
• Employee engagement is critical and we 
continue to monitor it through our employee 
surveys, which take place every two years 
(90% engagement in 2016 employee survey)
• ITV constantly reassesses the business 
to create a ﬁt-for-purpose organisation
• ITV is focused on working across the business 
to embed and strengthen the culture of 
‘One ITV’ way of working
• ITV invests in training and development 
programmes
• Succession plans are in place for all key 
positions within the Company
Operational
There is signiﬁcant loss 
of programme rights or 
ITV fails to identify and 
obtain the optimal rights 
packages.
• There is increased competition 
for high-quality programme 
rights as broadcasters and 
platform owners demand 
brand deﬁning content
• The signiﬁcant budgets of the 
new platforms, such as Netflix 
and Amazon, have changed the 
market for on-screen and 
off-screen talent, which has 
impacted the cost of content
• ITV is focused on both protecting and 
exploiting existing rights and ensuring 
that future rights generated accrue to ITV
• As an integrated producer broadcaster, 
ITV produces a signiﬁcant proportion of the 
broadcast schedule. In 2017, this increased 
to 66% of the main channel’s original 
commissions
• ITV invests in creating and owning quality 
content through ITV Studios
• ITV maintains good relationships with 
independent producers to ensure it has 
opportunities to acquire quality content
• ITV has a detailed model to evaluate the value 
of third-party rights to ensure it only buys 
rights that make economic sense
This risk and opportunity has increased since 
last year as OTT platforms are increasing 
their programme spend. This presents an 
opportunity for ITV Studios to supply 
content to them. 
ITV fails to create, own 
and protect the rights to 
a sufﬁcient number of hit 
programmes/formats 
across its international 
portfolio of content 
companies.
• Our ability to create and 
own hit programmes depends 
on the quality of our content 
business
• ITV is the largest UK commercial 
producer and a leading 
independent non-scripted 
producer in the US and Europe
• ITV maximises opportunities for ITV Studios 
to create successful shows by investing 
in the creative pipeline and focusing on 
programmes and genres that can return 
and travel internationally, i.e. drama, 
entertainment and factual entertainment, 
as evidenced by our increased investment 
in producing scripted content
• ITV is focused on hiring and retaining 
the right key creative talent

ITV does not react quickly 
enough to changes in the 
broader market and fails 
to properly resource, 
ﬁnancially, creatively 
and operationally, the 
new growth businesses, 
in particular online 
and international content.
• In a fast-changing media 
environment, there is an 
increased risk that sub-optimal 
investment decisions are made
• Investment opportunities and decisions are 
made by the relevant board based on their 
strategic ﬁt and return on investment proﬁle
• Talent management plans have been 
developed and reviewed to ensure adequate 
succession planning across ITV
• ITV continues to embed and strengthen 
the culture of ‘One ITV’ way of working
• Lessons from recent investments are 
captured through post-acquisition reviews
Technology
A major incident results 
in ITV being unable to 
continue with scheduled 
broadcasting for a 
sustained period of time. 
• ITV’s broadcast technology 
chain is complex because it 
operates in multiple regions 
and links to many platforms
• Risk can therefore materialise 
within ITV or with third parties 
responsible for servicing the 
broadcast supply chain
• With the move out of 
Southbank, ITV will be using 
third-party managed studio 
facilities for some of its 
daytime shows
• A risk register of broadcast operations, 
including key outsourced functions, 
is in place and reviewed on a regular basis
• There are business continuity and disaster 
recovery plans in place in high risk areas 
to help deliver a rapid and flexible response
• Major incident scenario testing takes place 
bi-annually
• ITV has ongoing modernisation projects 
to ensure transmission and distribution 
technologies are ﬁt-for-purpose
• ITV continues to proactively manage its 
broadcast chain partners and suppliers to 
ensure the risk of incidents and regulatory 
breaches is minimised
ITV remains heavily 
reliant on legacy systems, 
which could potentially 
restrict the ability to 
grow the business. These 
systems and processes 
may not be appropriate 
for new non-advertising 
revenue or rapid 
international growth.
• Our system requirements 
change as we continue to 
rebalance the business, grow 
new revenue streams and 
become increasingly 
international
• System requirements are kept under 
review with business growth and system 
modernisation projects implemented 
as appropriate
• A modernisation plan is in place for the

• Cyber risk mitigations in relation to all of 
our systems are set out on page 55. 55

Technology
Impact of cyber attack 
on ITV
There is a sustained cyber 
attack causing prolonged 
system denial or major 
reputational damage, 
for example: 
•  The ability to broadcast 
our channels
•  The availability of 
ITV Hub
•  ITV loses a signiﬁcant 
volume of personal 
or sensitive data
•  Corporate systems are 
compromised
• Cyber security is an increasing 
risk as our business develops 
new revenue streams and 
direct to consumer 
propositions
• With increasingly sophisticated 
technology and proliferation of 
cyber hacking tools, along with 
increased amounts of company 
data, the risk of a cyber attack 
has increased across the world 
• There are a growing volume 
of software and hardware 
vulnerabilities being identiﬁed 
by technology providers in 
their own products
• Further, we are higher risk 
as a result of being a media 
company and operating in 
a public environment
• By establishing further internal cyber 
controls across our devices, apps, networks 
and servers, we have improved our ability to 
monitor, detect and respond to cyber threats
• We continue to educate our colleagues in 
order to improve our ability to spot, avoid 
and report cyber attacks
• We have worked with specialist security 
organisations to implement 24x7 monitoring 
of our network trafﬁc and during the year 
they conducted cyber simulation and 
phishing exercises
• We have enhanced our process for the risk 
assessment of third-party security as our 
cyber risk extends to our supply chain 
• There are disaster recovery and incident 
management plans in place for high-risk 
areas of the business
This risk has increased since last year as our 
technology becomes more sophisticated.
Reputation
An event with public 
interest causes signiﬁcant 
reputational and brand 
damage. 
• WIth our Broadcasting 
and Studios businesses, the 
Company operates in a public 
environment and is exposed 
to the risk of a high-proﬁle 
incident, for example through 
our association with the 
actions of our talent
• ITV has a crisis management policy and 
process in place and is increasing emphasis 
on its development and application
• ITV proactively manages its broadcast chain 
partners and suppliers to ensure the risk 
of incidents and regulatory breaches 
is minimised
There is a major health and 
safety incident that 
results in a signiﬁcant 
loss of human life on 
a production.
• As ITV Studios expands, there 
is a continued increase in the 
number of production hours, 
and an increased potential 
to produce certain types of 
programming that have higher 
inherent risks
• ITV has a central health and safety team 
and health and safety policies and procedures 
in place, with appropriate training for 
employees where required
• We have developed our safety management 
approach to align with our studios label 
model to ensure ownership of risk in the 
appropriate business areas. To reflect this, 
we are developing our training programme 
initially through Leading Risk (see case study 
on page 79)
• We are continually reviewing our processes 
and overall approach to production safety 
(see case study on page 78) and have built 
a comprehensive online resource to provide 
easily accessible production focused health 
and safety advice and support
• We are developing our reporting tools to 
provide increased oversight of risks across 
the Studios division
This risk has increased since last year as 
ITV undertakes more complex productions.

Regulation
There is a signiﬁcant  
or unexpected change 
in UK regulation or 
legislation.
• ITV could be affected if 
there is a change in UK media 
regulation or legislation; for 
example, if there is a change 
in advertising restrictions 
in key categories
• ITV regularly communicates with 
appropriate groups and its legal panel 
and Ofcom to monitor potential policy, 
legal and regulatory developments
Impact of exiting 
the European Union
The political and 
economic uncertainty 
arising from the UK’s 
referendum vote to 
leave the EU could 
result in continued macro 
uncertainty. This may 
impact the overall health 
of the UK television 
advertising market, with 
corporate and consumer 
conﬁdence both 
weakening since the 
outcome.
Further, there is 
considerable uncertainty 
regarding the likely terms 
of the post Brexit trading 
arrangement between 
the UK and the EU, which 
is expected to continue 
for the foreseeable 
future. 
While the potential changes and 
the impact of any such changes 
will remain unknown for a while, 
ITV could, for example, be 
affected by:
• Changes to EU broadcasting 
legislation and/or rules around 
EU market access, for example 
if the UK does not retain 
classiﬁcation of UK content 
as European. This could 
potentially reduce the scale 
of the market opportunity 
for UK content in the EU
• Restrictions to the free 
movement of our staff 
impacting our operating model 
and ability to attract and retain 
the best talent
• New non-EU worldwide trade 
deals that could, for example, 
see pressure to weaken 
requirements for UK 
broadcasters to purchase 
original content made in the 
UK/EU or for the UK to broaden 
exceptions from intellectual 
property protection. This could 
potentially reduce the scale of 
the market opportunity for our 
content in the UK.
• Changes in taxation, free 
movement of capital and 
transfer pricing regulation
The likelihood or extent of any impact is 
currently unknown, however, we continue 
to work closely with industry bodies and 
discuss key issues with key UK Government 
departments
We will closely monitor negotiations with 
the EU, as well as emerging non-EU worldwide 
trade deals, and will evaluate any potential 
areas of risk 57

• ITV has worked with the pension trustees 
to limit the potential deﬁcit by a series of 
asset-backed arrangements. Further, it has 
taken some mortality risk out of the scheme 
with a longevity swap and hedged a portion 
of inflation and interest rate variability

Strategic Report
What is the process ITV follows?
At an annual strategy meeting the Board assesses ITV’s prospects and risks. Amongst 
other topics, the Board reviews the ﬁve year ﬁnancial plan, which is based on our strategic 
priorities. Pages 18 to 19 of the Annual Report provide detail of ITV’s prospects in the 
Strategy and Business Model section.
What is the assessment period for viability?
In its assessment of viability, the Board reviewed the planning horizon and is of the 
view that a three year period to 31 December 2020 continues to be most appropriate. 
The factors the Board considered in adopting this timeframe were as follows:
• Visibility over ITV’s broadcast advertising business is relatively short term, as advertising 
remains cyclical and closely linked to the UK economic growth impacted by Brexit and 
the uncertain UK macroeconomic climate
• The commissioning process and life cycle of programming gives the Studios division 
more medium term outlook. However, while non-returning brands are replaced with 
new commissions, over time there is less visibility as programmes can experience 
changes in viewer demand or come to a natural expiration
• Technology in the media industry continues to change the demand for content and 
also how it is consumed
• Pension funding, which is one of ITV’s key funding obligations, is also agreed triennially 
with the Trustees of the pension scheme
• ITV’s business model does not necessitate investment in large capital projects that 
would require a longer-term horizon assessment or returns
Assessment of viability
When considering the longer term viability of ITV, the Board reviewed each of ITV’s 
principal risks and, taking into account current operational and ﬁnancial performance, 
has in particular analysed the impact of:
Scenario modelled Link to principal risks (pages 52 to 57)
Scenario 1:
The Broadcast division experiencing a signiﬁcant 
and sharp downturn, similar to the 2008/09 
ﬁnancial crisis, with advertising revenues 
declining for two years followed by a year of 
flat revenue. This scenario could be regarded as 
cautious as recessions in the advertising market 
have historically not exceeded a two-year period 
and showed growth following that period. 
There is a major decline in advertising revenues 
and ITV does not build sufﬁcient non-NAR 
revenue streams to mitigate the ﬁnancial 
impact of this decline.
Scenario 2:
A number of key programme brands within the 
Studios division are not recommissioned. While 
the scheduling decisions of commissioners are 
made in advance, a number of key shows could 
come to an end at the same time.
ITV fails to create and own a sufﬁcient 
number of hit programmes/formats across its 
international portfolio of content companies.
Viability Statement 59
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information
 Risks and Uncertainties
In line with prior years, the Board has considered a scenario involving changes in pension 
funding obligations. However, while the ﬁnal actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2017 
has not been agreed, the Board does not anticipate any material changes in funding 
obligations in the three year period under assessment. The Board will continue to 
monitor the risk, as the next valuation as at 1 January 2020 could have an impact on 
the periods assessed in future viability statements. 
Further, the impact of the London Property project on the Group’s viability was 
considered. Due to the medium-term nature of the project, it is not currently 
anticipated to have a signiﬁcant impact on liquidity in the period reviewed in this 
statement. The Board will continue to monitor the impact of the project as it progresses.
The viability review involved flexing the underlying strategic forecast for the above 
impacts, both individually and concurrently, and no speciﬁc mitigations were assumed. 
The underlying strategic forecast assumed: business as usual capital spending; the 
ongoing availability of the ﬁnancing facilities (as ITV remains within the covenants, 
current bank facilities are secured for more than three years and there are no major 
bond repayments due in this period); and the Group maintains the stated dividend policy.
The scenarios used are hypothetical but are considered appropriate to model risks 
that could impact the viability of the Group. In addition, there are options at the disposal 
of the Board to maintain liquidity and continue operations in the event of any of the 
scenarios arising, such as reducing M&A activity and non-essential capital expenditure 
as well as reviewing the Group’s dividend policy.
Viability statement
Based on the results of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation that ITV 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period ending 31 December 2020. The assessment has been made with reference 
to ITV’s strategy and the current position and prospects.

Governance
Chairman’s Governance Statement
I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Report for 2017. We believe that 
corporate governance is essential to our success and as such the Board is committed to 
upholding the highest standards of governance and works closely with the executive team 
in order to do so. We are engaged in considering the proposals for the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) and will seek to ensure compliance with that Code in due 
course. This year has seen an increase in Board membership, which builds on our already 
diverse Board and brings additional experience, ensuring there is an appropriate balance 
of skills and knowledge. This current Board consists of a strong team with a wide range 
of experience across various industries and territories.
Information on what we focused on in the year can be found on page 67. 
Board composition
Following the departure of Adam Crozier, we announced in July of last year the 
appointment of Dame Carolyn McCall as Chief Executive. I am very pleased to welcome 
Carolyn, who with her track record in media, experience of international operations, clear 
strategic acumen and strong record of delivering value to shareholders will help to continue 
to build on the success of ITV. The decision to appoint Carolyn was taken after a rigorous 
selection process. More detail can be found on page 68. 
The Board is mindful of the need to refresh its membership at appropriate intervals and 
after more than nine years on the board Andy Haste and John Ormerod will step down 
following the AGM in May. The Board agreed last year that Margaret Ewing would be the 
best candidate to succeed John as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. Salman Amin 
was also appointed during the year and has been a great addition to the Board. More details 
on our approach to Board diversity can be found on page 69. 
Directors’ other commitments are kept under review to ensure that they have sufﬁcient 
time to dedicate to our business. Details of appointment dates and length of tenure for 
each director can be found on page 68. All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles 
of Association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM following their appointment 
by the Board. Subsequently, all Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders 
as recommended by the Code.
In the Governance section
This section of the Annual Report contains 
a statement from our Chairman and 
information about the Directors and 
Management Board. It explains our 
governance structure and corporate 
governance compliance and includes 
reports from the Audit and Risk and 
Remuneration Committees and the 
Directors’ Report.
 The Board 
is mindful of the 
need to refresh 
its membership 
at appropriate 
intervals.”

Board induction and evaluation 
We believe that a comprehensive induction programme is important for all of our new 
Board members as well as a programme of continuing evaluation for the Board to assess 
its effectiveness. Full details of our evaluation and induction processes in the year are 
set out on page 69. 
Stakeholder engagement 
Our stakeholders are very important to us and we remain committed to maintaining 
regular open dialogue and effective communication with them. We believe that continued 
engagement is highly beneﬁcial to all parties as it helps to build a greater understanding 
of their views, opinions and concerns. Further information on how we engage with our 
stakeholders can be found on page 71. 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
ITV is required to report on how it has complied with the principles of governance set out 
in the Code. The Board considers that during 2017 the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code but notes the following: 
• Provision B.7.1 – Independence 
John Ormerod has served on the Board for more than nine years. The Board believes he 
remains independent and as explained last year, the Board agreed that he should remain 
as a Director until a successor as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee could be found. 
Margaret Ewing was appointed in October 2017 to ﬁll this position. 
• Provision A.2.1 – Separation of Chairman and CEO 
Following Adam Crozier’s departure, the Board agreed that I would step up as 
Executive Chairman from July 2017 until a new Chief Executive joined the business. 
Dame Carolyn McCall was appointed to the Board in January 2018 to ﬁll this position. 
The Board notes that this was not compliant with the Code.
Further information on corporate governance and a schedule setting out how we comply 
with the Code can be found on our website. 
 www.itvplc.com/investors/governance
A copy of the Code is available on the FRC website.
 www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance
Looking ahead 
It has been a year of change for ITV and we enter 2018 with a new Chief Executive who 
the Board strongly believes will put ITV in the best position to face the challenges of 
a competitive and rapidly changing industry.

Culture
Q What is ITV’s culture? 
A ITV believes in an open and 
collaborative culture across all areas 
of the business. At its core, ITV puts 
trust and an open and honest working 
environment for all as its most 
important values.
Q How does the Board engage with 
the corporate culture? 
A The Board places a high importance 
on the value of corporate culture 
within ITV and the role it provides in 
the development and retention of 
employees as well as ITV’s external 
reputation. As mentioned, openness 
and communication are key at ITV and 
as such it is imperative that the Board 
is visible throughout the organisation. 
The Board participates in site visits to 
our different locations and is in regular 
communication with senior executives 
and other employees.
Q How is the corporate culture 
embedded across the organisation? 
A We seek to instill the ‘One ITV’ 
way of working our global network of 
Ambassadors to enhance communication 
and information sharing across all levels 
of the business. The Board considers 
and acts upon feedback from employee 
engagement surveys. We also aim for 
our senior executives and our Board 
members to be as visible as possible and 
use open plan ofﬁce space to encourage 
openness and collaboration. Our London 
property strategy is a big step to achieve 
a more coherent and joined-up business. 
Q What is next for ITV? 
A We believe that an effective and well 
embedded corporate culture helps 
create a successful business. We will 
continue to focus on building a strong 
corporate culture and will keep this 
under consideration as part of our 
strategy refresh.  62 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Succession planning and diversity
Succession planning
The Board recognises that effective succession planning is key to the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives and is also 
integral to maintaining an effective Board. The Board has in place a framework which it reviews regularly to ensure that:
• The Board is refreshed appropriately in order to encourage new ideas 
• There is a diverse Board with a wide range of skills and experience 
• Board tenure is appropriate and Board members remain independent
During the year the Board has undergone some changes as set out below:
Chief Executive: In May 2017 we announced that Adam Crozier would leave ITV in June 2017. Following this, we commenced 
the recruitment process for a successor. As part of its succession planning process, the Board had already discussed the key skills, 
experience and other requirements of the role. They established a small committee comprised of Peter Bazalgette, Andy Haste, 
Roger Faxon and Mary Harris to manage the process. The Board engaged Spencer Stuart to assist and provided them with a clear brief. 
Throughout the process, the Committee met regularly and gave careful consideration to the candidates proposed. Face to face interviews 
were held and after much debate a strong shortlist was agreed who were asked to meet with all members of the Board. The Board 
unanimously agreed that Carolyn McCall should be asked to join ITV as Chief Executive, which we announced in July 2017. Carolyn joined 
the business on 8 January 2018 and in the interim period the Board agreed that Sir Peter Bazalgette should take the role of Executive 
Chairman and Ian Grifﬁths was promoted to COO & CFO. 
Non-executive Directors: During the year, we welcomed two new Non-executive Directors: Salman Amin with effect from 9 January 2017 
and Margaret Ewing with effect from 31 October 2017. Details of the recruitment process for Salman Amin are set out in the Annual Report 
and Accounts for 2016. When considering the recruitment of Margaret Ewing, the Board was mindful of the need to ensure succession 
planning for the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee as John Ormerod, the current Chairman of that Committee, is stepping down 
from the Board in May 2018, and wanted to ensure an appropriate handover period. The Board engaged Zygos to assist with the 
recruitment of Margaret Ewing following a similar process as that set out above for the Chief Executive.
Both John Ormerod and Andy Haste will step down from the Board following the AGM in May 2018 and the Board is considering the current 
diversity of the Board with a view to considering further appointments if appropriate. 
Committees: The Board also reviewed Committee membership and during 2017 Mary Harris succeeded Andy Haste as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. In addition, Anna Manz and Roger Faxon joined the Remuneration Committee. 69

 Corporate Governance
Diversity 
It is our policy to retain a talented and diverse but relatively small board bringing a balance of 
in-depth commercial and creative experience. The Board does not have a separate diversity 
policy but instead relies on the ITV Equal Opportunities policy. ITV encourages diversity 
throughout the business and recognises a range of characteristics. More information on this 
can be found on pages 20 and 99. We believe that the ITV Board is a diverse group in terms of 
experience, age, gender and educational and professional background. We consider diversity 
as part of our succession planning process but recognise it is important to ensure that the 
most appropriate person is chosen for the relevant position. 
Induction, training and development
All Directors who join ITV receive a comprehensive induction. It is intended to provide 
the Director with an overview of the industry and important key themes for the Company.  
It is also used to familiarise each Director with the different areas of the business and 
employees within the Company. During the year, Margaret Ewing and Salman Amin were 
appointed as Non-executive Directors and Carolyn McCall as Chief Executive. Margaret 
joined as a successor to the Audit and Risk Committee Chair and as such her induction 
was tailored accordingly. More details can be found below.
During a Directors’ period of appointment, they are continually updated on the Group’s 
different business areas and the competitive and regulatory environment in which they 
operate. This is done through:
• Updates and papers which cover changes affecting the Group and the market in which 
it operates and meetings with senior executives across the Group and key advisers; 
• Regular updates on changes to the legal and governance requirements of the Group 
and in relation to their own position as Directors 
• Presentations given at Board and Committee meetings on business matters and technical 
update sessions from external advisors where appropriate
Executive Directors may accept external appointments as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies and retain any fees paid to them. Further details of external positions held by 
Directors can be found on page 96.

Board evaluation
External 
The Board undertakes an external evaluation every three years to review its effectiveness. 
The last external Board evaluation took place in 2016.
Internal 
The work of the Board and its committees is reviewed annually. The evaluation takes the 
form of a detailed questionnaire and interviews with the Board and Committee members 
eliciting feedback on a wide range of topics. In addition, input is sought from the Executive 
Directors, other relevant senior executives and external advisers. Results are then passed 
to the relevant Committee Chairman and a report of actions is submitted to the Board and 
Committees and actioned as appropriate. The table below indicates the important themes 
that were identiﬁed for the Board from the exercise for 2017. Committee actions are set out 
on pages 73 and 85.
Actions for 2018
Composition • Ensure there is a broad range of experience and perspective on the Board,  
in particular recent media, technology and digital experience
• Consider the successor for the Senior Independent Director when Andy Haste steps 
down from the Board.
Effectiveness • Review meeting structure to enhance productivity and efﬁciency and allow for greater 
in depth discussions
Stakeholder engagement • Engage more regularly on wider stakeholder engagement
• Spend more time understanding and visiting UK and international acquisitions

Non-executive Directors and job 
descriptions for the Chairman, Chief

Stakeholder engagement 
The Board has a responsibility to create value for all its stakeholders and we believe it is vital 
to engage and listen to their views. As one of the biggest national broadcasters in the UK, 
ITV has a wide range of stakeholders and more on how we engage with some of these 
different groups is detailed below: 
Investors: The Board attaches a high priority to effective communication with investors 
and has regular open dialogue with them. During the year meetings were routinely held with 
institutional investors to keep them updated on the Company’s performance against our 
strategy. The Board is kept informed of any feedback from these meetings. Further details can 
be found in our ‘investor calendar’ below. Our AGM provides a forum for private shareholders 
to raise questions with the Board directly should they wish. They have ample opportunity to 
ask questions during the meeting and before and after the event. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director are always available to all shareholders. 
Employees: Engagement with employees is facilitated in a number of ways. We have 
engagement surveys and Carolyn McCall has introduced weekly podcasts to keep employees 
up to date with what she has been doing and to communicate important issues for ITV in an 
effective and engaging way. In addition, a separate email has been set up for employees to 
ask Carolyn any questions they may have. Further details of what else we do around employee 
engagement can be found on page 100, including information on our annual roadshows. 
Viewers: ITV reaches a vast audience across the UK and the Board recognises the important 
role it plays for viewers. Viewers are able to tell us their thoughts directly via email or 
telephone with contact details provided on our website. They are also able to use our regulator 
Ofcom, to raise any concerns they may have. The Board has delegated the review of such issues 
to the Broadcast Board where a compliance report is received monthly detailing viewer or 
regulator concerns. Our dedicated viewer services team was awarded the Best Customer 
Services in Telecoms & Media for the seventh year running in 2017 and is on hand to resolve 
any technical issues or other questions our viewers may have. We now also provide bespoke 
support for all of our live Daytime shows, ITV Box Ofﬁce events, and the ITV Hub to enhance 
our viewer experience.

Dear Shareholder,
On the following pages we set out the Audit and Risk Committee’s report for 2017, 
which provides an overview of the areas considered by the Committee during the year.
As expected, 2017 was more challenging than recent years for ITV. Economic uncertainty in 
particular associated with Brexit has resulted in lower UK advertising revenues and proﬁts. 
However, the Committee has continued to ensure that judgements remain balanced.
During the year, ITV’s 2016 Annual Report and Accounts were included as part of a sample 
within the FRC thematic review of reporting on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs), 
with the object of improving the quality of disclosures and identifying good practices. 
As a result of the review, our deﬁnitions of APMs on page 34 have been clariﬁed to aid 
shareholders’ understanding. 
Our risk management process continues to develop. We have included some case studies 
on page 78 and 79 to highlight some initiatives that we have developed to consider the 
approach of our leadership teams in relation to risk on production and development of 
our three lines of defence model for the approach to health and safety in production. 
During the year, we were delighted to welcome Margaret Ewing as a Non-executive Director 
and successor to me as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. I will be stepping down as 
a Director of the Company following the AGM in May 2018. Margaret brings very broad 
experience to the Committee, having been a senior partner at Deloitte, Group Finance 
Director of listed companies and is an experienced Non-executive Director. 
Further information on corporate governance and a schedule setting out how we comply 
with the Code can be found on our website www.itvplc.com. 
As mentioned in previous years, we seek to respond to shareholders’ expectations in our 
reporting. We reiterate that we welcome feedback from shareholders.

In this report
The purpose of this report is to highlight 
areas that the Committee has reviewed 
during the year. We report to shareholders 
on the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting issues 
and judgements made in connection with 
the preparation of the Company’s ﬁnancial 
statements. Also highlighted is how the 
Committee has assisted the Board in 
reviewing the Company’s internal control 
and risk environment. We explain what  
the Committee has done to review the 
effectiveness of our internal and  
external auditors.

Governance
Our focus in 2017
In planning its own agenda, and reviewing the audit plans of the internal and external auditors, the Committee takes account of signiﬁcant 
issues and risks, both operational and ﬁnancial, likely to have an impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial statements and/or the Company’s 
execution and delivery of its strategy. The Committee also addresses speciﬁc queries referred to it by the Board or Remuneration Committee.
During 2017, there were no topics where there was signiﬁcant disagreement between management, the external auditor and the 
Committee, or unresolved issues that needed to be referred to the Board. Set out in the tables below is information on the key matters 
considered during the year.
Regular reviews and recurring transactions
The following table summarises the regular reviews and activities undertaken by the Committee. Some of these areas may require 
the application of judgement by management or have underlying complexity.

 Audit and Risk Committee Report
Most of the topics mentioned above are relevant to all businesses. However, matters speciﬁc to ITV include:
• Deal debt: this is where management estimates the over and under delivery of advertising value to agencies. The Committee 
reviews management’s approach and method of determining the provisions required for net under delivery.
• Deﬁcit ﬁnancing: as part of our strategy to expand our content portfolio, signiﬁcant investment in high-end drama is made.  
The Committee reviews the accounting implications, including revenue recognition and recoverability of the amounts invested.
Complex discrete transactions
The Group completed certain transactions during the period that were in line with strategy but could have been considered outside 
the normal course of business, as set out below. The Committee carefully reviewed these transactions to ensure that the judgements 
applied by management were reasonable and any complex accounting guidance followed correctly. During 2018, the Committee will 
also undertake post-acquisition reviews of signiﬁcant investments in subsidiaries and associates over the past ﬁve years.
Area of focus Financial reporting and judgement Action taken by management
Action taken by the Committee 
and outcome
Revenue 
recognition 
Talpa signed a four year deal 
to license The Voice of China 
in January 2016 and credit 
insurance was arranged. 
The format revenue for all 
four years was recognised in 
full in 2016 in line with our policy 
and accounting standards. 
In 2017, Talpa took back the 
licence for The Voice of China 
due to a breach of agreement 
by the customer resulting from 
non-payment of outstanding 
invoices. ITV is pursuing talent 
for the amounts due and has 
submitted a claim under its credit 
insurance policy for the amounts 
due from the customer.
While management is conﬁdent 
in the Group’s position that the 
credit insurance policy remains 
effective, IFRS only permits 
an asset relating to the credit 
insurance to be recognised 
when the receipt of monies 
is virtually certain.
The judgement focused on:
• Whether the £30 million of 
unpaid receivables held on the 
balance sheet are recoverable
• Whether an asset should be 
recognised for the credit 
insurance
Also see note 2.1 on page 124.
The following points were noted:
• A review of key documentation 
between the insurers, ITV or the 
customer had been performed 
by management
• Management had sought legal 
counsel and opinion
As a result of the above actions, 
management considered it 
appropriate that:
• The outstanding receivables 
are fully impaired
• While management consider 
the credit insurance policy 
remains effective, under IFRS 
no asset should be recognised 
at present
• Due to the timing difference 
between the impairment of  
the receivables in 2017 and  
the potential recognition of  
the credit insurance policy 
recovery in a later period, this 
should be highlighted within 
the ﬁnancial statements  
as an exceptional item.
The Committee assessed 
management’s proposed 
accounting treatment for the 
outstanding receivables and 
credit insurance, considered 
management’s report on the 
accounting treatment, had direct 
conversations with the legal 
advisers and agreed with the 
assessment that:
• The receivables should be 
fully provided against
• No asset should be recognised 
in relation to the credit 
insurance in 2017
• The disclosure, as proposed,  
is appropriate
KPMG also presented their view 
on the matter to the Committee, 
noting consistent conclusions 
on the appropriate accounting 
treatment and disclosure. 76 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Action taken by the Committee 
and outcome
London 
properties
The Group has announced  
its intention to redevelop 
its South Bank site and build a  
new London ofﬁce. 
The teams currently located 
in the South Bank site will be 
relocated to various sites on 
a temporary basis while the 
South Bank site is redeveloped. 
Over the course of the project 
incremental costs, both capital 
and income statement related, 
will be incurred.
The judgement focused on 
the presentation of these 
incremental costs, as exceptional, 
which arise solely as a result of 
the project, within the Annual 
Report and Accounts. 
Management proposed that 
incremental costs incurred across 
the project over the medium 
term, both capital and income 
statement related, should be  
ring-fenced and removed from 
the underlying results i.e. any 
one-off, dual running or dual 
temporary rent costs and capital 
expenditure on planning/new 
build of HQ.
The Committee assessed 
management’s proposed 
treatment for the incremental 
costs, discussed the proposed 
presentation with management, 
and agreed that:
• The new London ofﬁce project 
is a signiﬁcant one-off and  
not in the normal course  
of business
• It will require separate 
disclosure of the accounting 
implications within the 
ﬁnancial statements and  
in the Finance Review
The Committee also agreed 
with management that all other 
costs that were expected to 
be incurred regardless of the 
property decision, such as 
depreciation on studios or ofﬁce 
ﬁt costs or service charges, will 
continue to be recognised as an 
operating expense within the 
underlying results.
Accounting for 
Gurney litigation
In 2016, due to evidence of 
alleged breaches of contract 
and other fraudulent issues, the 
Group, having taken legal advice, 
initiated legal proceedings 
against the minority owners, 
who continue to hold a 38.5% 
membership interest in Gurney 
Productions LLC (Gurney). 
These minority owners dispute 
the allegations and have counter-  
claimed for damages of at 
least $150 million. The action 
is ongoing. 
Financial reporting and 
judgement involved:
• The accounting for the 
ongoing operations of Gurney
• The measurement of liabilities 
held for settlement of a 
counter-claim, if any, and 
for the cost of ongoing 
legal proceedings
Based on the current status of 
the business, and taking into 
account the legal proceedings, 
management proposed that 
for accounting purposes:
• Gurney should be treated as 
if it had been wound down with 
no further results recognised 
in the accounts, a provision 
recognised against the 
goodwill and against assets 
within Gurney 
• An acquisition-related 
liability should continue to 
be maintained for potential 
ongoing contractual 
obligations
• No provision should be held 
for the counter-claim against 
ITV as the Directors believe 
this counter-claim is completely 
without merit, and
• A provision for legal costs, 
accounted as an exceptional 
cost, should be held for ongoing 
legal proceedings
The Committee’s actions included:
• A review of the nature of 
the dispute and developments 
to date
• Discussions with ITV’s general 
counsel and US legal advisers, 
and
• A review of management’s 
proposed accounting treatment, 
including provisions held
The Committee agreed with 
management’s proposed 
accounting and presentation.

Other matters
In addition to ﬁnancial reporting matters, the following topics were reviewed:
Area of focus Issue Action taken by Committee Outcome
Cyber security 
and simulation 
exercise
Cyber security is an increasing 
risk as our business develops 
new revenue streams and direct 
to consumer propositions.
The Committee undertook a 
detailed review of the cyber 
security risks and strategy, 
including ongoing actions taken 
by management around:
• Embedding IT controls
• Educating our colleagues
• Detection and response
• Ownership across organisation 
and third parties
The Committee also reviewed 
ﬁndings from a cyber incident 
and phishing exercise conducted 
during the year.
Completed and planned 
mitigations were reviewed  
and assessed. 
The Committee noted the 
progress that had been made 
and will continue to monitor 
and review mitigations.
Technology 
modernisation
Legacy business systems continue 
to be modernised to reduce a 
number of key business risks.
The Committee reviewed the 
programme of work to modernise 
legacy business systems, including:
• Implementation of a cloud-
based ﬁnancial and payroll 
system in the US
• Development of a bespoke 
artiste payment system in  
the UK
• Progress in the replacement  
of our airtime sales system
Completed and planned 
mitigations were reviewed  
and assessed and the Committee 
will continue to keep this 
under review.
Tax
The Criminal Finances Act 2017 
introduced new Corporate 
Offences of Failure to Prevent  
the Facilitation of Tax Evasion.
The Committee monitored the 
actions taken by management to 
implement reasonable prevention 
procedures in line with published 
HMRC guidance.
Prevention procedures were 
reviewed and assessed and the 
Committee considered these to 
be adequate. The Committee will 
continue to receive updates.
Employment 
status – 
ITV Studios 
production
The issue of employment and 
worker status in the modern 
economy has come under 
increasing scrutiny, particularly 
in the UK where employment 
and tax law and practice are 
developing as a result. 
Employment status can be 
especially complex in television 
production, where freelancers 
are often used both behind and 
in front of camera.
The Committee received regular 
updates from management in 
order to assess whether ITV is 
following best practice in how 
it engages people, and adapting 
to change where appropriate.
The Committee noted the 
progress and will continue 
to monitor and review this area.  78 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Alternative 
Performance 
Measures
During 2017, ITV’s 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts were 
selected within a sample of 
companies for the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) 
thematic review of reporting 
relating to Alternative 
Performance Measures.
The FRC has asked that we point 
out that its review only covered 
the speciﬁc disclosures relating to 
the thematic review and provided 
no assurance that the report and 
accounts were correct in all 
material respects. 
Matters discussed with the FRC 
focused on:
• Why restructuring and 
reorganisation costs were 
determined to be non-recurring
• How the company determined 
that acquisition-related 
expenses should be treated as 
operational exceptional costs
The Committee discussed the FRC 
review points with management 
and agreed with management’s 
recommendation to provide:
• Further explanations of 
exceptional restructuring and 
reorganisation costs in future 
Annual Reports and Accounts, 
and to cease referring to these 
costs as non-recurring
• Disclosure noting that the 
acquisition-related costs are 
not considered to be part of  
the core operations of the 
business and hence require 
highlighting in the accounts, 
rather than referring to them 
as being non-recurring or  
one-off in nature
The FRC welcomed the planned 
changes and these have been 
reflected in the Annual Report 
and Accounts; refer to page 34.
Treasury policy
In 2016, after reviewing the 
annual Treasury report, the 
Committee had requested further 
analysis not just on what foreign 
exchange (FX) exposures were 
being hedged, but also on what 
was being left unhedged.
This analysis was prepared and 
discussed at the Tax and Treasury 
Committee. A recommendation 
for some amendments to the 
treasury policy on FX risk 
managed was reviewed by the 
Committee as part of the 2017 
annual treasury report.
The Committee agreed with the 
proposal to amend the treasury 
policy on FX risk management 
and recommended that the Board 
approve the revised policy.
Anti-bribery and 
corruption
Following an internal audit review 
on the implementation of our 
anti-bribery and corruption 
policies, actions to strengthen 
implementation of the Group’s 
programme were recommended 
by Internal Audit.
The Committee reviewed the 
result of the internal audit, the 
recommendations and 
management’s response.
The Committee agreed to keep 
the agreed actions under review.
Management has put in place 
a cross-business steering group 
to help ensure that the agreed 
actions, such as risk assessments 
and enhanced local language 
guidance and training, are 
implemented consistently 
across the business.

Case study: new approach to health and safety – Emmerdale project
We have been working on a project with Emmerdale trialling a refreshed approach to considering the effectiveness of health and 
safety on production. The project was in three stages – Discovery, Collaborative Analysis and Improvement – and required all aspects 
of the production team to focus on the day-to-day constraints and opportunities that they face identifying risks and potential 
mitigations. A team, nominated from the production, is in place, supported by the health and safety team, to deliver improvements.
We have engaged with the HSE, our insurers and unions on this new approach, which supports risk management in a more efﬁcient 
and effective way while ensuring local ownership of risks and accountability for the implementation of solutions. 79

 Audit and Risk Committee Report
Leading Risk 
During the year, we introduced a Leading Risk programme to support our leadership 
team in ITV Studios to consider risk effectively within its business area. The programme 
was developed with a focus on behaviour rather than process controls and to help build 
a consistent language around risk. We partnered with the London School of Economics 
(LSE) on a research project based on this programme, which will provide us with 
a better understanding of risk decision- making to help us enhance a positive risk 
management culture.
The programme uses case studies to provide effective group conversations about how 
risk management works in reality, the impact of risks that are realised, the impact of 
leadership behaviours on risk management and the importance of culture and voice to 
actively manage risk. Building on this, the programme seeks to provide an understanding 
of risk drivers and risks that are accepted in the pursuit of goals. Output includes a risk 
appetite model that reflects the views of the leadership team, which can be articulated 
throughout the business.
To date, nearly 200 of our leaders in the UK and US have gone through the programme  
with further roll-out during 2018 internationally.
Dr Soane, LSE, explains:
“ Risk is clearly a signiﬁcant consideration for ITV. We are examining how risk managers  
think and feel about risk. We are also assessing risk managers’ views on how their teams 
make decisions about risk, and on the organisational climate. For example, do people  
feel empowered and enabled to speak up if they see something they’re worried about?  
Do teams that have a strong shared understanding about decision processes.”
Risk management and internal controls
Risk management
The Committee continued to consider the process for managing risk within the business and assisted the Board in relation to compliance 
with the Code. Further information on our risk management processes and details of our principal risks is included in the Strategic Report 
on pages 50 to 57.
Following on from earlier reviews by the Committee on health and safety processes in the business, we have developed some innovative 
programmes to develop our approach to risk, moving away from a rules and process driven system to a cultural people driven solution, 
which we believe encourages a focus on prevention rather than reaction to failure. Further information is set out in the case studies 
below and on page 78.
In 2017, the Committee reviewed the management of pension risks in ITV’s deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, focusing on how management 
and pension trustees were managing risks relating to longevity, interest rates, inflation rates and investment strategy. 
The Committee also reviewed the General Data Protection Regulation readiness plan for the business. This included detail of the 
governance model and the results of a detailed personal data audit. The Committee reviewed the workstream activities and plans  
and will keep this under review in 2018.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and for regularly reviewing the effectiveness of those 
systems. The Committee assists the Board in reviewing the systems of internal control. The primary responsibility for the operation 
of these systems is delegated to management. Such systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Key control procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk.
As part of our internal control process, the Group’s strategy is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group performs an annual 
strategy review and a rolling ﬁve year ﬁnancial planning exercise, which are reviewed and approved by the Board. The ﬁve year plan feeds 
into the annual budget cycle. The Executive Directors review formal forecasts, detailed budgets, strategies and action plans and the Board 
approves the overall Group budget as part of its normal responsibilities. The results of operating units are reported monthly to the Board, 
along with an update of the Group’s performance against strategic KPIs and cash. Actual results are compared with budget and forecasts, 
and key trends and variances are explained and analysed.
200
of our leaders in the UK and 
US have gone through the

Governance
Assurance
The Committee satisﬁes itself that internal controls are operating throughout the year principally based on a programme of internal 
audit reviews, reviews of the effectiveness of internal controls including fraud and anti-bribery, reviews of balance sheet checklists certiﬁed 
by local management, ‘deep dive’ sessions with relevant management on the management of certain key risks and controls and through 
a suite of automated analytics that monitor ﬁnancial transactions in our systems. In addition to the internal audit programme, there are 
a number of exception reports that cover transaction processing. For those subsidiaries not covered by exception reporting software, 
a monthly self-assessment takes place, which is subject to independent internal review.
Our auditors
Internal auditor 
The Group’s internal audit activity is outsourced to Deloitte which reports directly to the Committee. The Committee continues to believe 
that outsourcing offers access to the wide range of skills and resources in the various geographies required and endorses its continuing use. 
The Committee keeps under review the internal audit relationship with Deloitte and the procedures to ensure appropriate independence 
of the internal audit function is maintained. The effectiveness of internal audit is assessed over the year using a number of measures that 
include (but are not limited to):
• An evaluation of each audit assignment completed using feedback from the part of the business that has been audited, and
• A high level annual review that is completed by obtaining feedback from senior management in each division
Prior to the start of the year, the Committee considered and approved the internal audit plan, which included audits across the Group  
as well as assurance over live projects. During the year, the Committee reviewed ﬁndings from these internal audit reports, the actions 
taken to implement the recommendations made in the reports and the status of progress against previously agreed actions. All internal 
audit reports are available to the Committee.
External auditor
The Group’s external auditor is KPMG. The table below summarises the process followed to manage the relationship and audit process.
Engagement Audit tendering and rotation Independence, objectivity  
and fees
Reappointment
The Committee considers 
carefully the scope of planned 
work and the assessment of 
risk and materiality on which it 
is based. In particular, through 
the Committee Chairman, 
the Committee participates 
in the negotiation of the audit 
fee to ensure that there is an 
appropriate balance between 
the scope of work and the cost of 
assurance. The Committee’s aim is 
to support a robust and effective 
audit and strong reporting lines 
to the Committee.
The Committee agrees the 
terms of engagement, audit 
and non-audit fees and reviews 
progress and results throughout 
the year.
KPMG were appointed as auditor 
of ITV plc in December 2003 prior 
to the Company becoming the 
parent company of the ITV Group 
on 2 February 2004. In 2012 we 
undertook a competitive tender 
and, applying the BIS guidance 
on the EU Audit rules. The next 
mandatory tender would be for 
the 2023 ﬁnancial year and the 
next mandatory rotation would 
be for the 2024 ﬁnancial year. 
The Committee continues to 
monitor audit quality to ensure 
a robust and effective audit.
We comply with the provisions 
of the Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use 
of Competitive Tender and Audit 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.
The Committee seeks to ensure 
the objectivity and independence 
of our auditor through:
• Focus on the assignment and 
rotation of key personnel
• The adequacy of audit resource
• Policies in relation to non 
audit work
As a result of these strict 
guidelines the Committee 
believes that non-audit services 
do not have a direct or material 
effect on the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. A copy of our Auditor 
Independence policy is available 
on our website at www.itvplc.com.
Fees paid to KPMG for 2017 are 
set out in note 2.1 on page 128. 
We monitor relationships with 
other audit ﬁrms to ensure we 
have sufﬁcient choice for any 
future appointment.
During the year, the Committee 
considered the performance 
and audit fees of our auditor, 
and the level of non-audit work 
undertaken, and recommended 
to the Board that a resolution for 
the reappointment of KPMG for 
a further year as the Company’s 
auditor be proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM in May 
2017. The resolution was passed 
and KPMG was reappointed.
The Committee has 
recommended the reappointment 
of KPMG at the AGM on  
10 May 2018.

and other signiﬁcant risks
• Reappointment
• Audit plan and strategy
• Engagement
• Fees and independence
• Audit Quality Review focus areas

Audit quality is reviewed throughout the year and the Committee continues to use the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) Audit Quality 
Practice Aid to structure its review of audit quality. When making its assessment of audit quality, the factors the Committee focused  
on included:
External audit 
quality reports
The audit strategy for the year addressed thematic concerns that the FRC had highlighted.
Auditor 
interaction with 
management
Reviewing the auditor’s understanding of business progress against the strategy and emerging industry 
themes, as well as the auditor’s discussion with management on key corporate transactions.
Auditor’s own 
view of 
effectiveness
Enquired with regards to:
• Audit methodology and its effective application to ITV
• Robustness of challenges and ﬁndings on areas that require management judgement
• Whether there had been an internal peer review of the ITV audit and what the ﬁndings were, and

In its assessment of audit quality, the Committee also took into account:
• The detailed audit strategy for the year, including the coverage of emerging risks
• Group materiality and component materiality
• How the auditor communicated any key accounting judgements and conclusions, and
• Feedback from management of the performance of the auditor
There were no signiﬁcant ﬁndings from the evaluation this year and the Committee considers the external audit to have been robust  
and effective. 82 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
Dear Shareholder,
I am writing to update you on the work of the Committee during the year. Included within 
the Remuneration Report is our Annual Report on Remuneration, which will be subject 
to an advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 10 May 2018.
From the Committee’s perspective, 2017 was an extremely busy year. As you are aware, 
after seven years, Adam Crozier stepped down from the Board. In this context, it was 
a priority for the Board and our shareholders that ITV continued to perform strongly 
over the period of transition and that Carolyn McCall, our new Chief Executive, inherited 
a business with positive momentum. 
As described earlier in the Annual Report, the business has continued to make signiﬁcant 
progress despite external challenges. This has been achieved under the leadership of 
Ian Grifﬁths, in his expanded role as COO & CFO, and Peter Bazalgette, who stepped into 
the role of Executive Chairman.
The Committee made a number of key decisions during the year, which were made in 
close consultation with both the Nomination Committee and the wider Board as a whole. 
By the end of the year, we are pleased to report that ITV had not only robustly navigated 
a challenging trading environment, but we now also have in place a highly talented and 
experienced executive team for the future. 
The changes described above inevitably required the Committee to consider a number 
of ‘one-off’ matters outside of the normal course of business. During the year, we have 
consulted extensively with our major shareholders and kept all our shareholders informed 
regarding key decisions, all of which were fully disclosed to the market at the time.
Further information on the work of the Committee can also be found on page 85. 
This included consideration of the remuneration framework for the wider employee group 
when considering remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives 
and gender pay gap reporting. In addition, the Committee has reviewed the malus and 
clawback provisions in the rules of the bonus and share award plans to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
In this report
The purpose of this report is to set out for 
shareholders the principles and policy we 
apply to remuneration for our Executive 
Directors and to update you on how we 
have applied these for the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 December 2017. The report also 
aims to demonstrate how our Remuneration 
Policy aligns to our strategy, supports the 
retention of the Executive Directors and 
rewards them for strong performance.

 Remuneration Report
2017 performance
At the start of 2017, we expected a challenging year ahead for advertising with continued 
economic and political uncertainty impacting business conﬁdence. Our internal forecast 
of a c.5% contraction in the advertising market over the year, which set the context for the 
2017 target setting, has subsequently proved to be accurate. Despite these challenges, 
ITV has continued to perform strongly. Real progress has been made against operational 
KPIs and tight control maintained over costs and cash.
The 2017 adjusted EBITA target was set at £785 million versus the 2016 adjusted EBITA 
outcome of £885 million. This lower, but still stretching, 2017 target reflected the decline 
in the external advertising environment mentioned above. In addition, it should be noted 
that the 2016 proﬁt out-turn beneﬁted from a format sale in a new geography, which 
would not repeat in 2017. Given these downward pressures, the 2017 actual target being 
£100 million below the 2016 out-turn was considered by the Board and the Committee 
to be stretching at the time the target was set. 
However, strong performance against a number of metrics ensured that adjusted EBITA 
for 2017 was £842 million which represented a signiﬁcant outperformance of expectations 
at the start of the year. Linear viewing is up for the second year and continues to deliver 
the mass audiences and key demographics advertisers demand. Video on Demand (VOD) 
viewing is up nearly 40% with The ITV Hub now having over 21 million registered users, 
with good growth in online advertising. ITV Studios delivered good organic revenue growth 
and we have a strong pipeline of programmes for 2018.
Overall, and as discussed in the Strategic Report, ITV continues to make signiﬁcant progress 
growing, strengthening and rebalancing the business. 
Performance-related pay
Performance measures for our Annual Bonus Awards (Bonus) and Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) are closely aligned to our KPIs. These are drawn from our strategy and cover all parts 
of the business.
Stretching bonus targets were set for 2017, taking into account the challenging external 
backdrop and the non-recurring item in 2016 described above. The Committee has 
considered 2017 performance, and the subsequent remuneration outcomes, in this context. 
The Committee noted that the adjusted EBITA, cost savings and cash conversion targets 
set at the start of the year were all exceeded. Management has delivered exceptional 
performance in a very difﬁcult trading environment. In addition, the operational 
performance of the business and performance against personal targets have been strong.
Over the past few years, we have included a cost-saving target in our Bonus awards to 
ensure that management continues to focus on streamlining the business. Once again, 
this target has been exceeded with a further £29 million of savings being delivered. 
The Bonus payout level for 2017 is around 97% of maximum. The 2017 all-employee bonus 
will be paid out in full, reflecting the outstanding contribution of ITV employees in a critical 
year of transition. Further information and details of the Bonus targets for 2017 are set out 
on page 88.
The performance period for awards made under the LTIP in 2015 ended on 31 December 
2017. Based on performance over the last three years, a vesting outcome of 63% was 
achieved. Full vesting was not achieved mainly due to outcomes relative to the stretching 
EPS and share of viewing (SOV) targets originally set. In line with our phased approach to 
the introduction of holding periods, 50% of the vested amount will become exercisable 
in March 2020. Details are set out on page 89.
 The business 
has continued to
make signiﬁcant
progress despite
external challenges.
This has been
achieved under 
the leadership of 
Ian Grifﬁths and 
Peter Bazalgette.” 84 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
As Adam Crozier was only in post as Chief Executive for six months of the year (see below), 
his total remuneration for 2017 is signiﬁcantly lower than last year. Ian Grifﬁths’ reported 
total remuneration for 2017 is £2.720 million, as detailed on page 87. However, this 2017 
total remuneration includes the interim arrangements pertaining to his expanded role for 
part of the year (see below), all of which were fully disclosed at the time of announcement 
in May 2017. When considered on a more like-for-like basis, Ian’s total remuneration for 2017 
is similar to last year’s. 
The Committee considers the total pay for the Executive Directors to be a fair reflection 
of both ITV’s performance and their respective contribution over the period. 
Board changes
On 30 June 2017, Adam Crozier stepped down as Chief Executive and on departure his 
remuneration arrangements were determined in accordance with his contractual terms 
and the limits set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 
AGM. All variable incentives continue to be performance based and prorated for time 
served. In light of Adam’s departure, Ian Grifﬁths took on an expanded role in addition 
to his previous responsibilities, until a new Chief Executive was appointed and had joined. 
The Board agreed an interim package to reflect this expanded role. 
Full details of the payments made in respect of these changes were disclosed at the time 
of announcement in May 2017, and are also set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Carolyn McCall joined ITV as Chief Executive on 8 January 2018. Her remuneration 
arrangements and buy-out arrangements are consistent with the terms of the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2017. Carolyn’s total 
remuneration opportunity is broadly in line with that of the previous Chief Executive 
and includes a cash allowance for income on retirement of 15% (25% for previous Chief 
Executive). Details of Carolyn’s package were published at the time of announcement 
in July 2017, and are replicated on page 92. 
Remuneration Policy implementation in 2018
The policy approved by shareholders in 2017 will continue to apply in 2018. Details of 
how the Committee proposes to implement the policy in 2018 are set out on page 91.
Following Carolyn’s appointment, the Company has commenced a strategic refresh which 
will set the priorities for the business over the medium to long term. Following consultation 
with major shareholders, the Committee has decided to defer the setting of performance 
metrics and targets for the 2018 LTIP awards until this refresh has been completed to 
ensure that the metrics and targets are fully aligned with the strategic plan. 
Once the metrics and targets have been agreed, the Committee expects to publish details 
on the Company’s website and in the 2018 Remuneration Report. While the metrics and 
targets are yet to be determined, the Committee would expect to engage with major 
shareholders regarding any material changes to the current approach. 
Shareholder views
Over the course of the past year, we consulted with major shareholders on a number of 
matters and we will seek to maintain this dialogue in future years. We would like to take the 
opportunity to thank the investors and proxy voting agencies who took part in this process. 
In this Remuneration Report, we have sought to adopt a transparent approach and we 
would welcome feedback from our shareholders regarding the key decisions made.

Remuneration Policy
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 10 May 2017 for a three year period. This Policy 
will continue to apply for 2018.
The Policy aims to balance the need to attract and retain high-quality talent essential to the Company’s success with the need to be 
cost effective and to reward exceptional performance. The Policy balances these factors, while taking into account prevailing best practice 
and fair outcomes for investors.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the package is tied to the achievement of stretching performance conditions that align remuneration with 
our strategy to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. 
A summary of the Policy is below. The full Policy can be found on our website:

Salary
Executive Directors did not receive a salary increase from 1 January 2017 as part of the normal salary review process. 
Adam Crozier’s annual salary for the year was £941,000. During the year, Ian Grifﬁths was appointed to an expanded role as COO & CFO. 
In order to reflect the increased operational responsibilities associated with the new role, his salary was increased by £50,000 to 
£625,025 per annum with effect from 3 May 2017.
Following Adam Crozier’s decision to step down from the Board, Ian Grifﬁths was asked to lead the executive team on an interim 
basis and take on additional responsibilities until a new Chief Executive joined the business. To reflect these additional responsibilities, 
he received a temporary salary supplement of £200,000 per annum. In order to facilitate a suitable transition, this supplement will 
remain payable until 7 April 2018. Full disclosure of the above changes to salary were set out on the Company’s website on 3 May 2017.
Peter Bazalgette took the role of Executive Chairman from 30 June 2017 to 8 January 2018. He received no additional remuneration

Taxable beneﬁts
The beneﬁts provided to the Executive Directors include the cost of private medical insurance and car-related beneﬁts. 
Bonus (cash and shares)
Annual incentives are provided to Executive Directors through the bonus, with one-third of any award usually deferred into shares under 
the Deferred Share Award Plan (DSA). The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are linked 
to the Company’s corporate, ﬁnancial and strategic priorities. This enables the Committee to reward both annual ﬁnancial performance 
delivered for shareholders and performance against speciﬁc ﬁnancial, operational or strategic objectives set for each Executive Director. 
Payments and deferrals in respect of the ﬁnancial year are set out below.
The maximum bonus opportunity of 180% of salary for Adam Crozier was prorated for the period he was employed up to 30 June 2017.

The majority of the bonus (75%) was based upon the achievement of corporate and ﬁnancial targets, with payout determined in 
accordance with pre-set target ranges subject only to the usual adjustments to exclude the impact of material in-year acquisitions and

At the start of 2017, we expected a challenging year ahead for advertising with continued economic and political uncertainty impacting 
business conﬁdence. Our internal forecast of a c.5% contraction in the advertising market over the year, which set the context for the 2017 
target setting, has subsequently proved to be accurate. Despite these challenges, ITV has continued to perform strongly. Real progress 
has been made against operational KPIs and tight control maintained over costs and cash.
The 2017 adjusted EBITA target was set at £785 million versus the 2016 adjusted EBITA outcome of £885 million. This lower, but still 
stretching, 2017 target reflected the decline in the external advertising environment mentioned above. In addition, it should be noted that 
the 2016 proﬁt out-turn beneﬁted from a format sale in a new geography, which would not repeat in 2017. Given these downward pressures, 
the 2017 actual target being £100 million below the 2016 out-turn was considered by the Board and the Committee to be stretching at the 
time the target was set. 
However, strong performance against a number of metrics ensured that actual adjusted EBITA for 2017 was £842 million which represented 
a signiﬁcant outperformance of expectations at the start of the year. Linear viewing is up for the second year and continues to deliver the 
mass audiences and key demographics advertisers demand. Video on Demand (VOD) viewing is up nearly 40% with The ITV Hub now having 
over 21 million registered users, with good growth in online advertising. ITV Studios delivered good organic revenue growth and we have 
a strong pipeline of programmes for 2018.
The remainder of the bonus (25%) was based upon the Committee’s assessment of the contribution each Executive Director made to the 
overall strategy through the delivery of speciﬁc targets. The Committee applies suitable judgement when assessing performance in this 
regard. Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives aligned to our strategic priorities and delivered well against these 
objectives. The factors taken into account are summarised overleaf.

1.  For Adam Crozier, the number of shares that vest has been prorated for time served from the date of award to the vesting date in line with the rules of the LTIP. 50% of the shares 
that vest will become exercisable on 27 March 2018 and 50% will become exercisable after a two year holding period on 27 March 2020.
2.   For Ian Grifﬁths, 50% of the shares that vest will become exercisable following a one year holding period on 27 March 2019, and the remaining 50% will become exercisable after 
a two year holding period on 27 March 2020.
 3. For the purpose of the single ﬁgure table, the share price used to value the shares at 31 December 2017 was the average share price for the ﬁnal quarter of 2017 (163.8 pence). 
4. The share price used to calculate the number of shares under award was 256.7 pence (the average of the share price on each of 24, 25 and 26 March 2015).
When considering performance outcomes, the Committee looks beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align with overall 
business performance. For these awards, the formulae were applied without adjustment. Dividends accrue on vested shares during the 
holding period. 
Details of the performance achieved for the 2015 LTIP awards are below. A gateway condition of minimum cumulative adjusted EPS 
(45.7 pence) was met before any portion of the award could vest.

The Committee sets targets for the LTIP taking into account external forecasts, internal budgets, business priorities, risks and uncertainties. 
Targets are set to be appropriately stretching in this context, with maximum performance set at a level that is considered to be the delivery 
of exceptional performance. The award made in 2017 is subject to performance measures and targets as set out below. The award will be 
subject to an initial cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to that required for threshold performance (56.3 pence) before 
any portion of the award can vest.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information
Remuneration Policy in 2018
The following section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2018.
Salary
Salaries are paid in line with the Remuneration Policy. On 1 January 2018, Ian Grifﬁths received an increase of 2.75% in line with the wider 
employee group.
2018 Salary
Carolyn McCall £900,000
Ian Grifﬁths £642,213
Taxable beneﬁts and pension
These are provided in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Both Carolyn McCall and Ian Grifﬁths receive private medical cover, car-related beneﬁts, and a cash allowance in lieu of participation  
in any ITV pension scheme. 
Bonus (cash and shares)
The targets for the annual bonus are generally set at the start of the ﬁnancial year. The targets are based on assumed market conditions 
and take into account both the budget for the year as well as longer-term strategic priorities. 
Awards made to Executive Directors through the bonus will be paid two-thirds in cash and one-third deferred into shares under the DSA. 
The performance metrics and weightings for 2018 bonuses will be similar to previous years. The Board considers the actual targets for 
2018 to be commercially sensitive at this time and we envisage including equivalent disclosures to those included for the 2017 bonus in 
next year’s report. The Committee may adjust bonus targets or outcomes to reflect signiﬁcant one-off events (e.g. major transactions), 
foreign exchange movements or material changes to assumed plan conditions to ensure that the plan continues to reward performance 
fairly. The Committee may amend the bonus pay-out should any formulaic assessment of performance not reflect the overall business 
performance of the year. 
Share awards
The performance measures for LTIP awards are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain aligned with the Company’s strategic 
priorities over the course of the three year performance period.
For 2018, Carolyn McCall will be granted an award over 265% of salary and Ian Grifﬁths an award over 225% of salary.
Following Carolyn’s appointment as Chief Executive in January 2018, the Company is currently in the process of completing a strategic 
refresh. The Committee has decided to defer the setting of performance measures for the 2018 awards until the strategic refresh has been 
completed. This is to ensure that the targets are fully aligned with the future strategic plan. Major shareholders were consulted regarding 
this approach and the feedback was supportive.
Once the targets for the 2018 awards have been set, the Committee expects to disclose these to shareholders on the Company’s website and 
in the Remuneration Report for 2018. The Committee will engage appropriately with major shareholders regarding any material changes. 
Malus and Clawback 
Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share elements 
of the bonus and awards made under the LTIP. Under malus, unvested share awards (including any LTIP shares subject to a post-vesting 
holding period) can be reduced (down to zero if considered appropriate) or be made subject to additional conditions. Clawback allows 
for repayment of bonuses previously paid and/or shares previously received following vesting. Malus/clawback can be operated up to 
four years following the start of the relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards. 
The circumstances in which the operation of these provisions would be applied may be considered from time to time but currently include 
material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud. The Committee has carried out a review of these arrangements and is happy 
that there is no need to instigate either malus or clawback for any vested or outstanding awards at this time.

Details of Committee memberships can be found on pages 62 and 63.
Carolyn McCall – buyout arrangements
In line with the Remuneration Policy, it was agreed that ITV would buy out certain bonus and share awards that Carolyn forfeited by 
leaving her previous employer, easyJet plc, and joining ITV. Details of forfeited arrangements are set out in the easyJet plc Annual Report 
and Accounts for 2016/17.
In determining the buyout, the Committee has taken into account relevant factors including performance conditions attaching to 
the forfeited awards, the likelihood of the awards vesting and the form and timing of the awards. The awards will be bought out on 
a comparable basis where possible, particularly where the performance period has completed. Part of the buyout will be dependent  
on the extent to which legacy incentives at her previous employer vest in due course. 
All elements of the buyout package are subject to continued employment. If Carolyn gives notice to leave the Company within 12 months 
of commencing employment, all awards paid or that vested during this period will be repayable by her.
The buyout arrangements comprise the following:
• Annual bonus – easyJet bonus award forfeited in respect of 2016/17 will be replaced with an award of equivalent value.  
This will include a cash payment of £607,287 and a deferred share award equivalent to £303,643, which will vest after three years. 
• Legacy deferred bonus shares – shares relating to easyJet bonuses paid in prior years, and not subject to additional performance 
conditions, will be replaced with equivalent awards over ITV shares that will vest over the same time horizon as awards forfeited.
• Long-term incentives – various long-term incentive awards that were forfeited on joining ITV will be replaced with equivalent ITV share 
awards. The value of the buyout in respect of the 2014 and 2015 awards will be based on the ﬁnal vesting outcome for the corresponding 
easyJet awards. To the extent that the 2015 award lapses, no buyout will be made. In respect of the 2016 award, a replacement award 
will be granted in due course, subject to ITV performance criteria. Consistent with the approach taken in respect of the 2018 ITV LTIP award, 
the exact performance criteria will be determined following the completion of the strategic refresh. In all cases, the awards will vest and 
be released over the same time horizons as awards forfeited, which includes the continued application of relevant holding periods.
The share elements of the buyout will be formally granted during the course of 2018. Full details regarding the buyouts denominated 
in shares will be set out in the relevant stock exchange announcement at the time of grant, and shareholders will also be provided with 
additional detail in next year’s Remuneration Report. 
Other Disclosures
Payments to past Directors or for loss of ofﬁce
Adam Crozier stepped down as Chief Executive on 30 June 2017. His 12 month notice period commenced on 3 May 2017, the date his 
decision was advised to the Board. As announced on the Company’s website on 3 May 2017, on cessation of employment and in line with 
his contractual arrangements he received a payment in lieu of his remaining notice period and in respect of accrued but untaken holiday 
totalling £1,052,866. He continues to receive private healthcare, a fuel card and life cover until 2 May 2018 when his notice period ends. 
In addition Adam Crozier received an allowance for legal advice and outplacement services with a cap of £50,000. 
Remuneration Report
continued 93
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information
The Committee agreed to treat share awards as follows:
•  DSA – for bonus already earned, all outstanding awards were released in full on 30 June 2017. 
• LTIP – any unvested nil-cost options vest on their normal vesting dates, are subject to the same performance conditions as other 
participants and were prorated to 30 June 2017. In respect of the 2014 award (which had already vested) the ﬁrst tranche was exercised 
on 30 May 2017 and the second tranche on 30 June 2017. In respect of the 2015 award, the award vests in March 2018 with the ﬁrst tranche 
exercisable in March 2018 and the second tranche in March 2020. In respect of the 2016 award, this will vest in March 2019 and become 
exercisable in March 2021.
In line with contractual arrangements, a bonus payment will be made in March 2018 for the six months served as a director in 2017. 
One-third of this will be payable in shares in the normal way but the Committee has agreed that these will not be subject to a deferral 
period. The value of these shares is included in the single ﬁgure table on page 87 with further details on page 88.

1. As Adam Crozier stepped down as Chief Executive during the year, the values received by him up to 30 June 2017 have been annualised to enable a comparison.
2. Beneﬁts include the cost of medical insurance and car-related beneﬁts.
3. As the majority of employees are based in the UK, overseas employees have not been included.
4. The percentage change in beneﬁts is the average change for all employees (excluding the Chief Executive) with any of the same beneﬁts as the Chief Executive.
The Committee is mindful of pay practices across the Group and during the course of the year regular updates are provided regarding 
remuneration trends for the wider employee population. The Committee considers pay in the wider group from a number of perspectives. 
Overall, the Committee is keen to ensure pay practices across the Senior Executive Group are fair, reflect the nature of the role and 
align with performance.

Directors’ share interests
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Directors being shareholders so as to align their interests with other shareholders.
Shareholding guidelines are in place, which encourage Executive Directors to build up a holding of ITV plc shares based on a percentage of base 
salary. 50% of the requirement must normally be obtained within three years of appointment and the remainder normally within ﬁve years.

1.  The value of shares held by Adam Crozier is based on his holding at 30 June 2017 when he stepped down from the Board. The share price used to value the shares on 30 June 2017  
was 181.4 pence.
2.  The value of shares held by Ian Grifﬁths is based on his holding at 29 December 2017 using a share price of 163.8 pence. 
Where the value of shares required to be held increases as a result of a salary increase (or an increase in the relevant percentage), 
the Executive Directors will have three years from such increase to achieve compliance. The Committee may change the guidelines 
so long as they are not, overall, in the view of the Committee, less onerous.
Non-executive Directors are required to build and then maintain a holding of 100% of their base fee over the six years from the date 
of appointment to the Board (unless for some reason they are unable to retain their fees). The current position against the guidelines 
for each Non-executive Director is set out in the table below.

fair consideration to the employment of people with a disability or long-term health condition in accordance with the Equality Act 2010. 
Our employment and recruitment policies are based on equal opportunities and non-discrimination. ITV works with a variety of diversity

Diversity: ITV’s goal is to reflect modern society through our programmes, channels, workforce and services, ensuring we are relevant and 
accessible to all. It’s integral to our business aims to reflect, represent and appeal to the breadth of communities that characterise modern 
society. Working in partnership with the production community, we aim for our programmes to portray accurately the diverse makeup of 
modern society by the people on-screen and the editorial content. The Company has a number of policies to support an inclusive workforce 
and culture, for example the Code of Conduct, Equal Opportunities Policy, Flexible Working Policy and Transitioning at Work Policy. We also

Governance
Engagement: It is critical for our ongoing success that we attract, develop, recognise and retain the very best talent across the whole of 
ITV. To achieve this we continuously engage with our colleagues to ensure they understand our business priorities, how they help to deliver 
business success and the opportunities available for them to thrive and develop. We regularly survey our employees to hear their feedback. 
The last survey was completed in 2016, and the overall completion rate was 80%. The overall engagement index is 90%. Throughout 2017 
we have been taking action on the results and plan to conduct our next engagement survey in 2018.
This year we launched our ﬁrst on-air employee roadshow, which was broadcast globally to all our ITV sites. All employees from around 
the world were able to watch live interviews with our Chairman and members of the Management Board. Employees from the UK were 
also invited to attend in person and were able to ask questions directly. Other employees were able to email their questions separately. 
The roadshow received great feedback and we would look to do this again in future years.
To further promote employee engagement, the Company has a network of Ambassadors who are nominated and elected by employees 
to represent each part of the business. These Ambassadors share the views of the employees they represent enabling us to understand 
ways to make ITV a better place to work. The Ambassadors also keep employees up to date with what is going on across the business.
Remuneration: When the Company reviews pay it takes a number of factors into consideration, including the need to stay competitive. 
Our focus on cash and costs remains incredibly important for the future health of our business. We need to balance our business and 
ﬁnancial commitments with our continuing investment in our programming and people.
The Company continues to be committed to ensuring employees earn at least the Living Wage or greater. Where appropriate we 
have agreed additional increases. On 1 January 2018, all eligible employees received a pay increase of 2.75% (2017: 1.5% paid to eligible 
employees earning less than £100,000).
In addition, a bonus arrangement extends to all our employees, providing a comprehensive incentive framework THAT rewards everybody 
when the Company is successful. For 2017 the maximum bonus amount was increased from £1,500 to £1,750. The all-employee bonus 
award for 2017 was paid in full at £1,750 (2016: £1,300).
The Company also operates a successful and popular all-employee Save As You Earn scheme that encourages voluntary investment  
in ITV shares and a package of voluntary beneﬁts, which provides valuable cost savings for both employees and the Company.
Information about remuneration for the Directors is included in the Remuneration Report on page 82.
Succession planning, training and development: When planning succession within the Company, consideration is given to emergency 
cover together with medium and long-term succession and this is reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee. There is particular 
emphasis on growing the internal leadership pipeline through the launch of the following key programmes:
Executive 
Development 
Programme
Next generation potential Management Board successors, giving them an opportunity to develop their 
management potential and gain a greater understanding of the business.
Developing Future 
Leaders Programme
Delegates selected from across the business identiﬁed as a result of the performance review process. 
Content includes understanding what it means to be a leader at ITV, how to manage performance effectively, 
coaching skills and change management.
There is also a comprehensive portfolio of development courses and workshops in place for all employees that address common 
development needs. International training for last year was limited. The Company ran workshops in Germany and Hong Kong and this 
year workshops, on line webinars will be put in place for our international employees. An online training portal called My Academy will 
also be launched to the international markets.
Spend and investment on training in 2017 can be categorised as follows: Leaders and Managers development spend was £150,000, 
all employees development spend was £230,000 and the high potential development programme spend was £90,000.
The annual turnover for employees for 2017 was 10.46% (UK only). 4.59 % was planned and 5.86% regrettable.

Pensions
The Company pensions arrangements are overseen by the Pensions Steering Committee comprised of the COO & CFO (Chairman), 
Director of Group Finance, Group HR Director, Director of Treasury and Director of Reward and Pensions. The Committee meets monthly 
and is supported by a range of specialist advisers.
The Company operates a number of pension arrangements which provide retirement and death beneﬁts for employees.
ITV Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”): The Scheme comprises three sections: A, B and C. Section A includes a deﬁned contribution (DC) 
section. The deﬁned beneﬁt (DB) sections have been closed since 2002 to new members and, following a comprehensive consultation 
exercise, were closed to future accrual with effect from 28 February 2017. Contributions to the DC section also ended with effect from 
that date.
ITV Pension Scheme Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc) is the corporate trustee and manages the DB and DC assets, which are 
held under trust separately from the Company. Members of the trustee board are formally appointed as directors of ITV Pension Scheme 
Limited. There are nine directors including the chairman — ﬁve appointed by the Company and four nominated by the members. The 
current chairman’s tenure came to an end at the end of December and a replacement is currently being recruited. There is also a vacancy 
for another Company appointed director. The trustee board has four committees: Investment, Audit and Operations, DC, and Corporate 
Affairs. The Corporate Affairs Committee is convened as and when appropriate for dealing with any corporate activities that may arise. 
The trustee board and each committee hold regular meetings throughout the year at which key issues and more routine business matters 
are dealt with. A budget is agreed each year. The trustee board has a risk register, a conflicts of interest policy and a register of interests 
policy, which are reviewed regularly.
It is the responsibility of the trustee to have in place appropriate training for its directors and effective committee structures. The trustee 
directors receive regular training throughout the year and also have the support of various professional advisers. The Group pensions 
department helps identify training opportunities. Training is delivered both by attendance at external courses and with targeted training 
to support speciﬁc agenda items at the start of each trustee board meeting. Where appropriate, longer training sessions are organised. 
Comprehensive records are kept of all training completed by each trustee director. The trustee board completes regular assessments of 
its advisers.
The chairman conﬁrms in an annual statement that the trustee meets its legal duties in relation to the DC section as required under 
the Pensions Regulator’s Code of Practice 13.
Full valuations are carried out every three years. The latest completed actuarial valuation of all three sections of the main DB scheme 
was carried out as at 1 January 2014. The trustee of the Scheme is undertaking actuarial valuations as at 1 January 2017 and the outcome 
is expected before the end of March 2018.
ITV Deﬁned Contribution Plan (the “Plan’): The new trust based Plan was established to accept contributions from 1 March 2017 for 
ex-DB members and DC members who transferred from the ITV Pension Scheme. In addition, pure DC assets previously built up in the 
ITV Pension Scheme were transferred to the Plan during March 2017.
ITV DC Trustee Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc) is a corporate trustee and manages the DC assets, which are held under trust 
separately from the Company. Members of the trustee board are formally appointed as directors of ITV DC Trustee Limited. There are ﬁve 
directors including the chairman – three appointed by the Company and two nominated by the members. There is currently a selection 
exercise taking place for the two member-nominated vacancies. It is the responsibility of the trustee to have in place appropriate training 
for its directors.
The governance framework for managing the Plan and developing the board is in line with that in place for the ITV Pension Scheme.
Work is in progress to enable the chair to be in a position to conﬁrm in an annual statement that the trustee meets its legal duties 
in relation to the DC section as required under the Pensions Regulator’s Code of Practice 13.
 Directors’ Report 102 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
Ulster Television Pension and Assurance Scheme (the “Scheme”): The Scheme provides DB beneﬁts. It closed to new members in 2002 
but is still open to future accrual.
Following the UTV acquisition in 2016, responsibility for managing the Scheme has moved to the Group pensions department and it was 
decided to strengthen the governance of the Scheme by replacing the existing individual trustee structure with a corporate trustee – UTV 
Pension Scheme Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ITV plc). The trustee manages the DB assets, which are held under trust separately 
from the Company. Members of the trustee board are formally appointed as directors of UTV Pension Scheme Limited. There are ﬁve 
directors including the chairman — three appointed by the Company (including a professional trustee as chairman) and two nominated 
by the members. It is the responsibility of the trustee to have in place appropriate training for its directors.
The governance framework for managing the Scheme and developing the board is being enhanced to be in line with that in place for the 
ITV Pension Scheme. Full valuations are carried out every three years. The latest completed actuarial valuation was carried out as at 1 July 
2014. The trustee of the Scheme is undertaking an actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2017 and the preliminary results were agreed in principle 
at the end of 2017 and the valuation is expected to be ﬁnalised before the end of March 2018. The trustee board has adopted the Pensions 
Regulator’s integrated risk management framework – taking a holistic approach and looking at how risks around the employer covenant, 
funding and investment strategy are all linked and interdependent.
ITV Auto-enrolment Pension Plan (the “Plan”): Since 2013, employers within the Group have been required to enrol all eligible individuals 
into a pension scheme automatically. This applies to all eligible individuals who are contracted to work for us, regardless of their contract 
type or tax status (i.e. it applies to workers and not simply employees). Eligible individuals are enrolled into the ITV Auto-enrolment Pension 
Plan. The plan is currently provided using a master trust arrangement run by NOW:Pensions with an independent board of trustee directors. 
This plan is currently under review.
Pension Scheme indemnities: Qualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions, as deﬁned in Section 235 of the Companies Act 2006, 
were in force for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017 and remain in force for the beneﬁt of each of the directors of ITV Pension 
Scheme Limited, ITV DC Trustee Limited and UTV Pension Scheme Limited. These indemnity provisions cover, to the extent permitted 
by law, certain losses or liabilities incurred as a director or ofﬁcer of ITV Pension Scheme Limited, ITV DC Trustee Limited and UTV Pension 
Scheme Limited.

which it is responsible. All data for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017 is disclosed below for direct (gas, vehicle fuel, fuel oils and

Source: Mitie Energy analysis of ITV data. The emissions data covers our global operations for which we have operational control. We use the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard and the latest conversion factors from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy to calculate emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. 
33% of our data set is based on estimated data. Estimates are calculated from previous consumption trends and published benchmarks.
In 2017, the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 17% compared to the previous year. As 90% of our greenhouse gas emissions 
are generated within our UK operations, this is where we focus our efforts. We continued to replace ageing infrastructure with more 
efﬁcient plant, optimise our building management software systems and replace lighting systems with more efﬁcient LED technology. 
The amount of diesel purchased for fleet vehicles also decreased, which was due in part to the purchase of some Plug-in Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles for our fleet.

Health and safety 
The health and safety of our employees, contractors and those participating in our productions is always a high priority. The signiﬁcant 
loss of human life as the result of a major incident on production has been identiﬁed as a principal risk to the organisation. The Company’s 
professional Health and Safety team continues to develop and reﬁne our management system to ensure it meets the speciﬁc risk proﬁle 
of the business and embeds the ownership of risk with business owners. 
The key elements of our safety management system are: Process, Compass (our online presence), Education, Expertise, Monitoring 
and Assurance.
In 2017, we continued to build our education programme rolling out Leading Risk sessions with the leadership teams in ITV Studios UK 
and America, supported by a research project being undertaken in collaboration with the London School of Economics to give us a greater 
understanding of risk-taking beliefs and behaviours within our production business. This is the ﬁrst step in aligning our training programme 
to the Studios Label model to ensure ownership of risk in appropriate areas. See page 79 for more information. 
We have developed and launched an online resource, Compass, to provide easily accessible production focused health and safety advice 
on the most common health and safety risks managed by our productions.
To enable us to review the effectiveness of our processes and overall approach to production safety, we are using new methodology 
to engage with the business, building our understanding of the effectiveness of safety management, enabling us to continually improve 
and reﬁne our approach. 
We will build on this in 2018 across our business and will continue to underpin our health and safety management system with 
three key principles
• People are the solution
• Safety is about positive outcomes
• Safety is a moral responsibility

Directors’ Report
continued
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group 
and parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
(Reduced Disclosure Framework).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless 
they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required:
• To select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• To make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• For the Group ﬁnancial statements, to state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
• For the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent company ﬁnancial statements
• To prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Under applicable law 
and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report, Annual Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. Each of the 
Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 62 and 63, conﬁrm that, 
to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group accounts, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial 
position and proﬁt of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Directors conﬁrm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and each 
Director has taken all steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in order 
to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
The Board has conducted a review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal controls for the year ended 
31 December 2017. In the opinion of the 
Board, the Company has complied with 
the internal control requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code throughout 
the year, maintaining an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and minimising risk.   
Financial Statements 
107 
In this  
section 
 
 
The financial statements have been presented in a style that attempts to make them less complex  
and more relevant to shareholders. We have grouped the note disclosures into five sections: ‘Basis of 
Preparation’, ‘Results for the Year’, ‘Operating Assets and Liabilities’, ‘Capital Structure and Financing Costs’ 
and ‘Other Notes’. Each section sets out the accounting policies applied in producing the relevant notes,  
along with details of any key judgements and estimates used. The purpose of this format is to provide  
readers with a clearer understanding of what drives financial performance of the Group. The aim of the  
text in boxes is to provide commentary on each section, or note, in plain English. 
 
Keeping   
it simple 
 
Notes to the financial statements provide information required by statute, accounting standards or  
Listing Rules to explain a particular feature of the financial statements. The notes that follow are a part  
of the financial statements and will also provide explan ations and additional disclosure to assist readers’ 
understanding and interpretation of the Annual Report and the financial statements.

108 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of ITV plc (‘the Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017, which comprise the con solidated 
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement  
of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows, company balance sheet, company statement of changes in equity, and the related 
notes, which include the accounting policies. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2017  
and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;  
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union;  
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
'Reduced Disclosure Framework'; and  
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with th e requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the G roup 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our respon sibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion  
is consistent with our report to the audit committee.  
We were appointed as auditor by the Directors in December 2003 prior to the Company becoming the parent company of the now ITV Group 
on 2 February 2004. The period of total uninterrupted engagement for the listed ITV Group is 14 financial years ended 31 December 2017. We 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest en tities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided. 
2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judg ement, were of most significance in the audit of the financia l statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.  
We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, to gether with our 
key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters 
were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provi de a separate 
opinion on these matters.

The risk Our response 
Net Advertising Revenue (‘NAR’) £1,591 million (2016: £1,672 million) Risk vs 2016: ◄ ► 
Refer to page 75 (Audit and Risk Committee report), page 124 (accounting policy) and pages 125 and 126 (financial disclosures) 
Subjective estimate  
The majority of ITV’s advertising revenue (‘NAR’) is subject to regulation 
under Ofcom’s Contract Rights Renewal system (‘CRR’). CRR works by 
ensuring that the annual share of TV advertising that will be placed 
with ITV by each advertising agency can change in relation to the 
viewing figures for commercial television that it delivers. The CRR 
system, the pricing of the annual contractual arrangements with 
advertising agencies and the details of each advertising campaign, 
together with the related processes and controls, are complex and 
involve estimation.  
In particular, the complexity of the pricing mechanism means it is 
possible for a difference to arise between the price received by ITV  
for an advertising campaign and the value it delivered, mainly as a 
result of the actual viewing figures differing from the expected level 
for the campaign. Where the Group has over-delivered viewers, this is 
referred to as a ‘deal credit’, or a ‘deal debt’ where delivery has fallen 
short. Rather than the price paid for that campaign being adjusted at 
the end of the campaign, these differences are noted for each agency 
and then taken into account when agreeing either future campaigns  
or the annual contract. A net deal debt position with an agency is 
recorded in ITV’s accounts, as a liability. Net deal credit positions are 
not recognised.  
NAR is therefore considered a significant risk due to: 
• The number and complexity of contractual agreements with 
advertising agencies;  
• The complexity of the systems and processes of control used to 
record revenue; and,  
• The level of estimation involved in determining any deal debt liability 
at the period end. 
Our procedures included:  
• Control operation: testing of controls, assisted by our own IT 
specialists, including those over: segregation of duties, input of 
annual deal terms with agencies, input of individual campaigns’ 
terms and pricing, comparison of those terms and pricing data 
against the related contracts with advertising agencies; link to 
transmission/viewer data; and the system generated calculation  
of deal debt for each campaign. 
• Assessing estimate: challenging the year end deal debt positions 
based on comparison with customers’ correspondence and agreed 
terms of business. 
• Test of detail: confirming that the transmissions occurred prior  
to invoices being raised and revenue recognised by agreeing the 
transmissions to the corresponding spots. 
• Assessing disclosures: we also assessed the adequacy of the 
Group's disclosures in respect of the accounting policies on  
revenue recognition. 
Our results: 
• From the evidence we obtained, we found the resulting amount  
of recorded NAR and the estimated level of deal debt position 
liabilities to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).

The risk Our response 
Other revenue streams (‘Non-NAR revenue’) £2,066 million (2016: £1,855 million) Risk vs 2016: ◄ ► 
Refer to page 75 (Audit and Risk Committee report), page 124 (accounting policy) and pages 125 and 126 (financial disclosures)  
Complex contract accounting  
Non-NAR revenue includes revenue from: programme production  
and the sale of programme rights within the Studios segment; 
transmission supply arrangements and the Online, Pay & Interactive 
division within the Broadcast segment.  
Recognition of revenue is driven by the specific terms of the related 
contracts and is considered to be a significant risk as the terms of  
the contracts are varied and can be complex, with the result that 
accounting for the revenue generated in any given period can require 
individual consideration and judgement. Due to the contractual 
nature of these revenue streams, the focus of our work is on the  
risks associated with significant one-off contracts.  
Our procedures included:  
• Assessing principles: we considered the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies against the relevant accounting standards.  
• Test of detail: on a sample basis we assessed revenue contracts 
entered into during the year, and considered whether revenue had 
been recognised in accordance with the contractual terms in the 
correct accounting period, given the requirements of the relevant 
accounting standard.  
• Assessing disclosures: we also assessed the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of the accounting policy on  
revenue recognition.  
Our findings:  
• From the evidence we obtained we found the resulting amount  
of recorded Non-NAR to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).  
Gross defined benefit pension scheme obligations £3,987 million (2016: £4,200 million) Risk vs 2016: ◄ ► 
Refer to page 74 (Audit and Risk Committee report), page 153 (a ccounting policy) and pages 153 to 161 (financial disclosures)  
Subjective valuation  
Significant estimates are made in determining the key assumptions 
used in valuing the Group’s post-retirement defined benefit obligations. 
When making these assumptions, the Directors take independent 
actuarial advice relating to their appropriateness.  
In addition, the Group has a longevity swap, the valuation of which is 
complex being dependent mortality and longevity experience.  
The valuation of the gross defined benefit obligations and longevity 
swap are considered a significant risk given the quantum of the gross 
pension obligation, the impact of the longevity swap on the net 
obligation position, and that a small change in assumptions can  
have a material financial impact on the Group.  
Our procedures included:  
• Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the key financial 
assumptions applied in determining the Group’s gross pension 
obligations, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/life 
expectancy, with the support of our own actuarial specialists. This 
included a comparison of these key assumptions against externally 
derived data.  
• Assessing application: assessing methodology applied to the 
longevity swap valuation and challenging underlying mortality 
assumptions against externally derived data, with the support of  
our own actuarial specialists.  
• Assessing disclosures: considering the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the gross defined benefit 
obligations to these assumptions.  
Our findings:  
• The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the 
valuation of the gross pension obligations and the longevity swap  
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).  
Recoverability of parent company’s investment in subsidiaries £2,191 million (2016: £1,861 million) Risk vs 2016: ◄ ► 
Refer to page 181 (accounting policy) and pages 183 (financial disclosures) 
Low risk, high value  
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments in 
subsidiaries represents 34% (2016: 29%) of the parent company’s  
total assets. Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due  
to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial 
statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest 
effect on our overall parent company audit. 
Our procedures included:  
• Test of detail: comparing the carrying amount of 100% of the 
investments balance (2016: 100%) with the relevant subsidiaries’ 
draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being  
an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were  
in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those 
subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.  
Our results:  
• We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £28 million (2016: £35 million), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of normalised Group profit before tax of £568 million (2016: £6 23 million) which excludes the pre-paid employment-linked remuneration 
charge, the exceptional bad debt provision in relation to the co ntract receivables and the non-recurring element of the property project costs 
disclosed in note 2.2, of which materiality represents 5% (2016: 5.5%).  
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set as £27 million (2016: £34 million) determined with r eference to the 
benchmark of the Company’s total assets, of which it represents 0.4% (2016: 0.5%).  
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £1.4 million (2016: £1.7 million), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Scoping and coverage 
     
The Group’s principal operations are in the United Kingdom. The Group audit team performed the audit of the core UK operations  
(comprising Broadcast and Online, the UK Studios, Global Entertai nment and the central functions) as if they were a single aggr egated set  
of financial information using materiality of £20 million (2016: £25 million). Talpa Media B.V. – a significant component of th e Group in the 
Netherlands – was subject to an audit for Group reporting purposes. The Group audit team instructed the component auditor as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks de scribed above and the determination of the information to be re ported back. 
Specified audit procedures were performed by other component auditors, as instructed by the Group audit team, on two entities i n the US 
included in our scope based on the relative size of their oper ations. The Group audit team set the materiality of £5 million (2 016: £5 million)  
for both the audit of the component and the specified audit procedures. The Group audit team performed procedures on the items excluded  
from normalised Group profit before tax.  
The Group audit team held several telephone conference meetings with the component audit teams to assess the audit risk and strategy. The 
Group audit team also visited the component in the Netherlands. At this visit and in these meetings, the findings reported to t he Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component a uditor.  
Together, the above audit and these specified audit procedures covered 88% (2016: 90%) of Group revenue, 95% (2016: 89%) of Gro up profit 
before taxation; and 92% (2016: 90%) of total Group assets. 
4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if: 
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in note 1 on page 120 to the fina ncial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt o ver the 
Group and Company's use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial stateme nts; or  
• the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 106 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion  
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, excep t as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work,  
we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
• we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;  
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and  
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the C ompanies Act 2006.  
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:  
• the Directors’ confirmation within the Viability Statement on pa ges 58 and 59 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the  
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;  
• the risks and uncertainties on pages 52 to 57 disclosures descri bing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; 
and  
• the Directors’ explanation in the Viability Statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period th ey have  
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expecta tion  
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet it s liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including  
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the Viability Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.  
Corporate governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if:  
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledg e we acquired during our financial statements audit and the Dir ectors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understanda ble and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess th e Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or  
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by  
us to the Audit Committee. 
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance St atement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven p rovisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent comp any, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Dire ctors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement w ith the 
accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.

7. Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities  
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 106, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the finan cial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent co mpany’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicab le, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative  
but to do so.  
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material miss tatement, 
whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material m isstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate,  
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic de cisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
Irregularities – ability to detect  
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statem ents from  
our sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards).  
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting (inc luding related 
company legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our 
procedures on the related financial statements items.  
In addition, we considered the impact of laws and regulations in the specific areas of broadcasting regulations recognising the nature of the 
Group’s activities. With the exception of any known or possible non-compliance, and as required by auditing standards, our work in respect of 
these was limited to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence. We co nsidered 
the effect of any known or possible non-compliance in these areas as part of our procedures on the related financial statements items.  
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance thr oughout 
the audit.  
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detectio n of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

Notes to the Financial Statements  
Section 1: Basis of Preparation 
120 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
In this  
section 
 
 
This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial 
statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy  
is described in the note to which it relates. This section also shows new EU endorsed 
accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and whether they are 
effective in 2017 or later years. We explain how these changes are expected to  
impact the financial position and performance of the Group. 
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as  
the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interests in associates and jointly controlled entities. The Company is domiciled in the 
United Kingdom. 
As required by European Union law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the Group’s financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRS’), and approved  
by the Directors. 
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost. Where other bases are applied, these 
are identified in the relevant accounting policy. 
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’). 
Going concern 
At 31 December 2017, the Group was in a financial net debt position with a positive gross cash balance. Even though  
the Group is in a net current liability position, its strong balance sheet and continued generation of significant free  
cash flows enables the Group to meet its obligations and has enabled further investment.  
As a part of the going concern test, the Group reviews forecasts of the television advertising market to determine the 
impact on ITV’s liquidity position. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current available funding. 
The Group also continues to focus on development of the non-advertising business, and evaluates the impact of 
further investment against the cash headroom of the business. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for at least 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. 
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and available-for-sale investments  
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has  
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of th e entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.  
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where  
the Group and one or more other parties undertake an econom ic activity that is subject to joint control. The Group 
accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in  
the entity is stated as one line item at cost plus the investor’s share of retained post-acquisition profits and other 
changes in net assets. 
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the financial and operating 
decisions of an entity. These investments are also accounted for using the equity method. 
Investments where the Group concludes it does not have significant influence are deemed ‘available-for-sale’.  
These investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at  
cost and assessed for impairment.

120 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
 
121 
Current/non-current distinction 
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to  
be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Group’s operating cycle. All other assets are classified  
as non-current assets. 
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course  
of the Group’s operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities  
are classified as non-current liabilities. 
Classification of financial instruments 
The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified into the following financial statement captions in the 
statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’: 
• Loans and receivables – separately disclosed as cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables; 
• Available-for-sale financial assets – measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; 
• Financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or lo ss – separately disclosed as derivative financial instruments  
in assets/liabilities and included in other payables (contingent consideration); and 
• Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost – separate ly disclosed as borrowings and trade and other payables. 
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate classification of the Group’s financial instruments.  
Details on the accounting policies for measurement of the above instruments are set out in the relevant note.  
Where unconditional rights to set off financial instruments exist, the Group presents the relevant instruments  
net in the statement of financial position. 
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract. Financial instruments  
are no longer recognised in the statement of financial po sition when the contractual cash flows expire or when  
the Group no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and rewards under the instrument. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to three months 
from the date of acquisition and cash held to meet certai n finance lease commitments. The carrying value of cash  
and cash equivalents is considered to approximate fair value.  
Foreign currencies 
The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK and therefore the consolidated financial 
statements are presented in pounds sterling (‘£’). 
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated into pounds 
sterling at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate. Wher e there is a movement in the exchange rate between the  
date of the transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is implemented on certain foreign currency firm commitments, for which the effective portion of 
any foreign exchange gains or losses is recognised in other comprehensive income (note 4.3). 
Where a forward currency contract is used to manage fore ign exchange risk and hedge accounting is not applied,  
any impact of movements in currency for both the forward currency contracts and the assets and liabilities is taken  
to the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange  
rate on the date of the transaction. 
The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the year end 
exchange rate. The revenue and expenses of these companies are translated into pounds sterling at the average 
monthly exchange rate during the year. Where differences arise between these rates, they are recognised in the 
translation reserve within other comprehensive income.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
Section 1: Basis of Preparation continued 
122 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Group’s interests in joint ventures an d associates are recognised  
in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income. 
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, an interest in a joint venture or an associate, the related translation reserve  
is released to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of  
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period  
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of estimation, judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in  
the related notes: 
• Revenue recognition (note 2.1) 
• Business combinations (note 3.3 and note 3.4) 
In addition to the above, the areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant 
to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• Defined benefit pension (note 3.7) 
• Taxation (note 2.3) 
New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards 
The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed ac counting standards relevant to the Group’s results that 
are effective in 2017:  
Accounting Standard Requirement 
Amendments to IAS 7 
‘Statement of Cash Flows’  
on Disclosure Initiative 
The amendments introduce an additional disclosure that will enable users of the 
financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. 
Amendments to IAS 12 
‘Income Taxes’ on recognition 
of deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses 
The amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt 
instruments measured at fair value. 
Annual Improvements to 
IFRS 2014 – 2016 cycle 
Amendments to a number of IFRSs, one of which is effective in 2017; this amendment 
clarified the scope of IFRS 12, specifically the disclosure requirements for interests in 
subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified as held-for-sale. 
Based on the Directors’ analysis, the amendments outlined above do not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial position or performance for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
EU endorsed accounting standards effective in future periods 
The Directors considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations  
or amendments that are currently endorsed but not yet effe ctive. IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 are both effective for the  
period beginning 1 January 2018 and, while the Directors do not expect these standards to have a significant 
impact on the Group’s results, they highlight the conclusions from the impact assessment below.  
IFRS 16 is effective for the period beginning 1 January 2019. The Directors have detailed the status of the  
impact assessment below. 
  
Financial Statements
122 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
 
123 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is effective 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 requires the Group to identify 
distinct promises in contracts with customers that qualify as ‘performance obligations’. The consideration receivable 
from customers must then be allocated between the performance obligations identified. 
An assessment of the impact on all of the Group’s material revenue streams has been completed. The impact on the 
Group’s revenues and results is not material for either the Gr oup or for the individual divisions, Broadcasting & Online  
and ITV Studios.  
The changes to the current accounting policies on adoption of IFRS 15 require the Group to reclassify various costs 
which are now deemed to be attributable to revenue within the income statement. The impact on the results for  
the year ending 2017, which is not considered material to the Group, either individually or collectively, will be: 
Income statement account Impact 
NAR revenue Reduction of £11 million 
Other commercial income Reduction of £1 million 
Online, pay & interactive revenue Increase of £10 million 
Operating costs Reduction of £2 million 
There is no impact on either profit or adjusted EBITA for the year for the Group or for an individual division. 
The Directors adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 on a fully retrospective basis and will present, within the 2018  
financial statements, a restatement of the comparative periods. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is also effective 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 introduces new models for classification  
of financial assets and accounting for credit losses. Hedging rules have been amended to allow hedge accounting  
to be applied to more risks. 
The analysis of the impact focused on the following items: 
• Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities;  
• Trade receivables impairment; and 
• Recognition of hedging instruments and on the type of hedging relationships.  
No material impacts were identified compared with the existing accounting treatment.  
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 will change lease accounting for lessees under operating leases. 
Such agreements will require recognition of an asset, repr esenting the right to use the leased item, and a liability, 
representing future lease payments. Lease costs (such as property rent) will be recognised in the form of depreciation 
and interest, rather than as an operating cost.  
The detailed assessment of impact on the Group’s performance is ongoing, with the current focus on the completeness 
of the lease data. During the early impact assessment, the Group has reviewed the current accounting for existing key 
agreements, including satellite, transponder and playout agreements, and concluded that those do not meet lease 
definition under the regulations of IFRS 16, and therefore should continue to be classified as service agreements as 
presented within these financial statements.  
The adoption is likely to have a material impact on the presentation of the Group’s assets and liabilities, mainly  
due to property leases. Due to the quantity of leases under review, the Group has not substantially completed the 
assessment of lease contracts under the new accounting standard. Therefore, a quantification of the impact on  
the Group’s results cannot currently be estimated.

In this

This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. On the following 
pages, you will find disclosures explaining the Group’s results for the year, segmental 
information, exceptional items, taxation and earnings per share. 
2.1 Profit 
before tax  
Keeping 
it simple 
 
This section analyses the Group’s profit before tax by reference to the activities 
performed by the Group and an analysis of key operating costs. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) is the Group’s  
key profit indicator. This reflects the way the business is managed and how  
the Directors assess the performance of the Group. This section therefore  
also shows each division’s contribution to total revenue and adjusted EBITA. 
Accounting policies 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and equivalent sales taxes, and comprises the sale of products and services  
to third parties. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate timing and amount of revenue that can  
be recognised, specifically around whether there is a firm contract and whether the service has been provided and  
if so, whether there is a fixed or reasonably determinable pr ice that is reasonably certain to be collected. Complexity  
in advertising revenue recognition is driven by intricate automated and manual processes involved in measuring the 
value delivered to the customer.  
Revenue is recognised when the Group has transferred both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control, 
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue recognition criteria for the Group’s key classes of 
revenue are as follows: 
Applicable segment Class of revenue Recognition criteria 
Broadcast & Online 
 
Advertising (NAR) on transmission 
Video on Demand (VOD) as audience targets are met 
Sponsorship across the period of transmission of the sponsored 
programme or series 
Pay over the term of the contract or per subscriber  
or download 
Participation (Interactive  
and Brand Extensions) 
as the service is provided or the event occurs 
Studios Programme production on delivery of episode and acceptance by  
the customer 
Programme distribution rights when the contract is signed and content is available  
for exploitation 
Format and licences at the point in time when the licence is transferred  
and the customer is able to use and benefit from  
the licence or over the licence period if continued 
involvement of the Group is required 
Digital: archive  on delivery of content (one-off) or over the contract 
period in a manner that reflects the flow of content 
delivered (top-up)

Segmental information 
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are de termined in a manner that is consistent with how the 
business is managed and reported to the Board of Directors. The Board is regarded as the chief operating decision-maker. 
The Board considers the business primarily from an operatin g activity perspective. The reportable segments for the 
years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are th erefore Broadcast & Online and ITV Studios, the results  
of which are outlined in the following tables:

* Revenue of £397 million (2016: £320 million) was generated in the US during the year; the US represented £330 million (2016: £346 million) of non-current 
assets at year end. 
** Adjusted EBITA is before exceptional items and includes the benefit of production tax credits. It is shown after the elimina tion of intersegment revenue  
and costs. This measure represents the continuing operations. 
The Group’s principal operations are in the United Kingdom. Revenue from external customers in the United Kingdom  
is £2,272 million (2016: £2,370 million), and revenue from external customers in other countries is £860 million 
(2016: £694 million). The Operating and Performance Review provides further detail on ITV’s international revenues. 
Intersegment revenue, which is earned on arm’s length terms, is mainly generated from the supply of ITV Studios 
programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on the ITV network. This revenue stream is a measure 
that forms part of the Group’s strategic priority of building a strong international content business, as producing and 
retaining rights to the shows broadcast on the ITV network benefits the Group further from subsequent international 
content and format sales.  
In preparing the segmental information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments  
on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment. This is consistent 
with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.

There is one media buying agency (2016: one) acting on behalf of a number of advertisers that represent the Group’s 
major customers. This agency is the only customer that individually represents over 10% of the Group’s revenue. 
Revenue of approximately £561 million (2016: £552 million) was derived from this customer. This revenue is attributable 
to the Broadcast & Online segment. 
Broadcast & Online  
The Group operates the largest commercial family of chan nels in the UK and delivers content through multiple 
platforms. In addition to linear television broadcast, the Group delivers its content on the ITV Hub, catch up services  
on pay platforms, and through direct content deals. Content commissioned and scheduled by this segment is funded 
primarily by television advertising, where revenue is generated from the sale of audiences for advertising airtime  
and sponsorship.  
Other sources of revenue are from: online advertising; HD digital channels on pay platforms (e.g. Sky and Virgin); SDN 
revenue (which generates licence sales for DTT Multiplex A); and participation revenue (which includes interactive sales 
from competitions) and the ITV Choice subscription service in other countries. 
ITV Studios  
ITV Studios is the Group’s international content business, creating and producing programmes and formats that return 
and travel, namely drama, entertainment and factual entertainment. 
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK and produces programming for the Group’s own channels, 
accounting for 66% of ITV main channel spend on commissioned programming (2016: 63%). Programming is also sold 
to other UK broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky.  
ITV America is the leading unscripted independent producer of content in the US and is growing its scripted presence  
by increasing investment in high-profile dramas. 
ITV Studios also operates in six other international locations, being Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands 
(primarily Talpa) and the Nordics, where content is produced for local broadcasters. This content is either locally 
created IP or formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, primarily in the UK and the Netherlands. 
Global Entertainment and Talpa Global, ITV’s distribution businesses, license ITV’s finished programmes and formats 
and third-party content internationally. Within this business, we also finance productions both on and off ITV to acquire 
global distribution rights.  
Adjusted EBITA 
The Directors assess the performance of the reportable segments based on a measure of adjusted EBITA. The Directors 
use this measurement basis as it excludes the effect of transactions that could distort the understanding of the Group’s 
performance for the year and comparability between periods. See the Operating and Performance Review on pages  
34 to 35 for the detailed explanation of the Group’s use of adjusted performance measures.

 2017 2016 
Broadcast & Online 2,053 2,087 
ITV Studios 4,002 4,034 
 6,055 6,121 
The decrease in full-time equivalent employees is primarily driven by redundancies in the organic business as a result  
of restructuring offset by the weighted average impact of acquisitions completed in 2017. 
Details of Directors’ emoluments, share options, pension entitlements and long-term incentive scheme interests are 
set out in the Remuneration Report. Listed Directors’ gains on share options for 2017 are set out in the ITV plc Company 
financial statements. 
Depreciation  
Depreciation in the year was £30 million (2016: £31 million), of which £11 million (2016: £13 million) relates to Broadcast 
& Online and £19 million (2016: £18 million) to ITV Studios. A further £11 million of accelerated depreciation relating to 
assets made redundant as a result of the property project has been recorded as an exceptional item in 2017. See notes 
2.2 and 3.3 for further details.

* The Group holds transmission supply agreements that require the use of transponder assets for a period of up to ten years wit h payments increasing over 
time, limited by specific RPI caps. The Group has assessed the contracts under the new accounting standard IFRS 16, and consequ ently has reassessed the 
transponder assets under the current accounting standard, IAS 1 7. As a result, the Group has re-presented the transmission supply agreements as service 
agreements as opposed to operating leases. The impact of this is to remove the transponder assets from the operating lease disc losures in this note and 
disclose them instead as a commitment within note 3.1. There is no impact on the income statement, financial position or cash f low of the Group for this 
presentational change. 
The Group’s operating leases relate to offices, studio properties and other assets such as cars and office equipment.  
Property leases run for terms ranging from five to 20 years, depending on the expected operational use of the site. 
Leases may include break clauses or options to renew (optio ns to renew are not included in the commitments table). 
Lease payments are generally subject to market review every five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the 
uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table above. None  
of the lease agreements include contingent rentals.  
The total operating lease expenditure recognised during the year was £21 million (2016: £19 million) and total sublease 
payments received were £1 million (2016: £1 million). 
Audit fees 
The Group engages KPMG LLP (KPMG) on assignments additional to its statutory audit duties where its expertise and 
experience with the Group are important and are in li ne with Group’s policy on auditor independence.

Exceptional 
items 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
Exceptional items are excluded from management’s assessment of profit because  
by their size or nature they could distort the Group’s underlying quality of earnings. 
They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not considered part of 
the core operations of the business (e.g. costs relating to capital transactions, such as 
professional fees on acquisitions). These items are excluded to reflect performance in 
a consistent manner and are in line with how the business is managed and measured 
on a day-to-day basis. 
Accounting policies 
Exceptional items as described above are highlighted on the face of the income statement. See the Operating  
and Performance Review on pages 34 to 35 for the detailed explanation of the Group’s use of adjusted  
performance measures. 
Subsequent revisions of estimates for items initially recognised as exceptional are recorded as exceptional items  
in the year that the revision is made. Gains or losses on di sposal of non-core assets are also considered exceptional  
due to their nature and impact on the Group’s underlying quality of earnings.  
Exceptional items 
Operating and non-operating exceptional items are analysed as follows: 
(Charge)/credit Ref.

A – Acquisition-related expenses 
Acquisition-related expenses of £96 million includes £86 million (2016: £110 million) relating to performance-based, 
employment-linked costs to former owners mainly in relation to Talpa Media. The remaining £10 million (2016: £21 
million) is primarily comprised of integration costs and professional fees (mainly financial due diligence and legal costs). 
See note 3.4 for further details on acquisitions. 
B – Restructuring and property project costs 
In 2017, the Directors made the decision to redevelop the Group’s headquarters at The London Television Centre  
for which the Group owns the freehold. This requires relo cating staff and studios for 4 to 5 years to alternative 
accommodation before moving back into a new freehold building. Therefore, the Group has taken rented office  
and studios space in the interim while the new headquarters are constructed.  
During the course of the construction the Group will ring fence all incremental costs in relation to the redevelopment. 
Move costs, dual rates and rent will be treated as exceptional costs in the financial statements as they relate to the 
one-off property project that runs over several years but the Group will no longer incur them after the return to  
The London Television Centre. 
In 2017, the Group incurred £24 million of costs being: 
• Dual running costs of £7 million while the properties were vacant during refurbishment;  
• £11 million of accelerated depreciation relating to assets made redundant as a result of the property project; 
• £3 million of dilapidation provisions relating to these new property leases; and  
• Other incremental one-off project costs of £3 million. 
As a result of the review of the Group’s London property n eeds, the Directors have decided to close The London Studios 
business incurring £6 million of redundancy costs in 2017.

In 2016, £14 million of costs were incurred as a result of a one-off project stemming from the Group-wide commitment 
to reduce the overhead cost base by £25 million. This cost was primarily comprised of redundancies across the 
Broadcasting, ITV Studios and Shared Services divisions as well as professional support to successfully plan and 
implement the project.  
C – Insured trade receivable provision 
The insured trade receivable provision of £27 million relates to the unpaid portion of revenue from the four-year licence 
deal for The Voice of China with Talent Television and Film Co. Ltd (Talent), the revenue for which was fully recognised 
in 2016 in accordance with accounting standards as th e Group had no further obligations under the terms of the 
agreement.  
Following a breach of the agreement by Talent as they had not fulfilled their payment obligations, the Group have 
taken back the licence for The Voice of China. The Group is pu rsuing Talent vigorously for the £30 million still due under 
the agreement.  
Further, the Group has credit insurance in place and a claim has been submitted. Whilst the Directors continue to pursue 
the amounts due and believe there is ultimately no material financial impact, the Group will need to reflect a provision 
against this unpaid amount in its 2017 results. Whilst th e Directors are confident in recovering the amount due, the 
accounting standards set very specific requirements for the recognition of contingent assets, which is how the recovery 
of the amount due will be accounted for. As discussions with the insurers and the claim against Talent are in progress,  
at this early stage of pursuing recovery the Group is not ab le to demonstrate sufficient certainty for accounting purposes 
to be able to recognise a cash receivable at the year end. Accordingly, The Group has made a provision amounting to  
£27 million (£30 million net of £3 million insurance excess) against the Talent receivable reco rded in the accounts in the 
year ended 31 December 2017. The cash received in the future will also be treated as an exceptional item. 
D – Pension curtailment cost 
In 2016, following a member consultation, the Group decided to close the ITV Pension Scheme to future benefit accrual, 
resulting in a one-off non-cash curtailment cost of £19 million.

Taxation 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
This section sets out the Group’s tax accounting policies, the current and deferred  
tax charges or credits in the year (which together make up the total tax charge  
or credit in the income statement), a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax  
charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Accounting policies 
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the inco me statement, the statement of comprehensive income and 
directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transactions. The tax charge comprises both 
current and deferred tax. The calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in 
respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be full y determined until a resolution has been reached by the 
relevant tax authority.  
Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on th e taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment  
in respect of previous years.  
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely  
to become due, which require judgement. Amounts are accrued based on management’s interpretation of specific tax 
law and the likelihood of settlement. Where the final tax ou tcome of these matters is different from the amounts that 
were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made. 
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.  
The following temporary differences are not provided for: 
• The initial recognition of goodwill; 
• The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and 
• Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expect ed manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available  
to utilise the temporary difference. Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves judgement regarding the 
timing and level of future taxable income.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority 
and the Group has the right of set-off.

Current tax:   
Current tax charge on profit before exceptional items (110) (134)

In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax charge of £87 million (2016: £100 million) arises on a profit 
before tax of £500 million (2016: £553 million), the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK 
corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016 
£m 
Profit before tax 500 553 
Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%) on

Impact of overseas tax rates 7 10 
Impact of changes in tax rates (6) 1 
Production tax credits 32 28 
Total taxation charge in the income statement (87) (100) 
Non-deductible expenses are expenses that are not expected to be allowable for tax purposes. Similarly, non-taxable 
income is income that is not expected to be taxable. 
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcom e is obtained on certain tax matters, which differs from 
expectations held when the related provision was made. Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision 
made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge. Where the outcome is less favourable than  
our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur. The current tax charge includes a £2 million charge 
relating to prior years, and the deferred tax credit in cludes a £6 million credit relating to prior years. 
Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are in relation to deferred tax assets arising on consolidation in relation  
to intangible assets which are now being brought on to the balance sheet in the current period. 
Current year losses not recognised primarily relate to a capital loss arising on the write-down of an investment, as it is 
uncertain whether this loss can be utilised in future periods.  
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other than the  
UK and taxed at rates different from the UK corporation tax ra te. This year, losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions, 
which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit. 
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 20% to 19% from 1 Ap ril 2017 and has been enacted to fall further to 17% from  
1 April 2020. These rates were enacted at the previous balance sheet date, and the carrying value of UK temporary 
differences were adjusted accordingly. To the extent that temporary differences have unwound in the current year,  
this has given rise to a credit of £6 million (2016: charge of £5 million) of which £2 million is recognised as a credit in  
the income statement and £4 million as a credit in other comprehensive income. In addition, as a result of the recent 
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US, the Grou p has recognised a tax charge of £9 million through the

federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 1 January 2018. Changes to enacted rates in other countries have given rise  
to a further credit of £1 million reported in the income stat ement. The total impact of changes in tax rates is therefore  
a charge of £6 million in the income statement and a credit of £4 million in other comprehensive income. 
The production tax credits included within the reconciliation above are UK High-End Television (HETV) tax credits and 
Children’s Television tax credits, which are part of a group of incentives provided to support the creative industries, and 
also Italian production tax credits. The ability to access thes e tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of 
investment decisions in the production of high-end drama and children’s programmes. Under IFRS, these production tax 
credits are reported within the total taxation charge in the income statement. However, ITV considers them to be a 
contribution to production costs, and therefore working capital in nature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax 
charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA. 
The effective tax rate is 17.4% (2016: 18.1%), and is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as  
a percentage of the profit before tax. In the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the effective tax 
rate is comparable to the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 19.25% in 2017 and 20% in 2016. As explained in the 
Finance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that is 
more aligned with the Group’s cash tax position. 
This year, the current year movement on origination and reversal of temporary differences (excluding exceptional 
items) is a credit of £13 million, compared with a credit of £18 million in 2016.  
Taxation – Other comprehensive income and equity 
As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax charge of £39 million on actuarial movements on pensions has been 
recognised in other comprehensive income (2016: £40 million credit). A deferred tax charge of £1 million has been 
recognised in equity in respect of share-based payments (2016: £6 million).  
A current tax credit of £1 million has also been recognised in equity in relation to share-based payments (2016: £2 million).

are £103 million (2016: £118 million). After netting off balances within countries, there is a deferred tax liability of  
£111 million and a deferred tax asset of £31 million (2016: deferred tax liability of £70 million and deferred tax asset  
of £17 million) recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The deferred tax balances relate to: 
• Property, plant and equipment temporary differences arising on assets qualifying for tax depreciation; 
• Temporary differences on intangible assets, including those arising on business combinations; 
• Programme rights – temporary differences on intercompany profits on stock; 
• Pension scheme deficit temporary differences on the IAS 19 pension deficit; 
• Temporary differences arising from the timing of the use of tax losses; 
• Share-based compensation temporary differences on share schemes; and 
• Other temporary differences on provisions and other items. 
The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit reflects the current tax benefit obtained in the current 
year following the employer contributions of £80 million to the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme. The 
adjustment in other comprehensive income to the deferred tax balance primarily relates to the actuarial gain 
recognised in the period.  
A deferred tax asset of £377 million (2016: £377 million) in respect of capital losses of £2,217 million (2016: £2,215 
million) has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to whether capital gains will arise in the appropriate form and 
relevant territories against which such losses could be utilised. For the same reasons, deferred tax assets of £13 million 
(2016: £19 million) in respect of overseas losses that time expire between 2018 and 2026 have not been recognised. 
In line with our accounting policy on cu rrent tax, provisions are held on the balance sheet within current tax liabilities 
 in respect of uncertain tax positions where management believ e that it is probable that future payments of tax will  
be required. At the balance sheet date, these tax provisions were not material for the Group. 
2.4  
Earnings 
per share  
Keeping 
it simple 
 
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each  
share. In 2016, we presented EPS for the continuing business and the discontinued 
operation, UTV Ireland Limited (see note 2.5 for further details). 
Basic EPS is calculated on the Group profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders of £409 million (2016: £448 million) divided by 4,006 million  
(2016: 4,010 million), being the weighted average number of shares in issue  
during the year, which excludes EBT shares held in trust (see note 4.7). 
Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the 
future and so it includes the impact of share options.  
Adjusted EPS is presented in order to show the business performance of the Group  
in a consistent manner and reflect how the business is managed and measured on  
a day-to-day basis. Adjusted EPS reflects the impact of operating and non-operating 
exceptional items on Basic EPS. Other items excluded from Adjusted EPS are 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired through business 
combinations; net financing cost adjustments; and the tax adjustments relating  
to these items. Each of these adjustments is explained in detail in the section below. 
The calculation of Basic EPS and Adjusted EPS, together with the diluted impact on each, is set out below:

Discontinued 
operations 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
A discontinued operation is a distinct component of the business that has been or  
is in the process of being disposed of. Accounting standards dictate that the loss  
from discontinued operations is recognised outside of the Group’s operating results.  
The Group’s 2017 results were all derived from continuing operations.  
During 2016, management agreed to sell UTV Ireland Limited to Virgin Media for  
€10 million. The sale completed on 30 November 2016 and the assets and liabilities 
classified as a disposal group held-for-sale have been disposed of.

Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities  
137 
In this  
section 
 
 
This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance  
and the liabilities incurred as a result. On the following pages, there are notes  
covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and  
disposals, provisions and pensions. 
Liabilities relating to the Group’s financing activities are addressed in section 4. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3. 
3.1  
Working 
capital 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through  
its trading activity. The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution  
rights, programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and  
trade and other payables. 
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its trading 
and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.  
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion ratio, a key performance 
indicator for the Group. The Group’s target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three year 
basis is at least 90%. For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working capital  
at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so that only 
subsequent working capital movements in the period controlled by ITV are reflected 
in this metric. 
In the following section, you will find further information regarding working capital 
management and analysis of the elements of working capital. 
3.1.1 Programme rights, other inventory and commitments 
Accounting policies 
Rights are recognised when the Group controls the respective rights and the risks and rewards associated with them.  
Programme rights and production costs not yet utilised are included in the statement of financial position at the  
lower of cost and net realisable value. In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement 
is required when considering the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.  
Broadcast programme rights 
Acquired programme rights (which include films) and sports rights are purchased for the primary purpose of 
broadcasting on the ITV family of channels, including VOD and SVOD platforms. These are recognised within  
current assets as payments are made or when the rights are ready for broadcast. The Group generally expenses  
these rights through operating costs over a number of tr ansmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which  
the right is consumed. 
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased based on editorial specification and over which  
the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and are generally expensed  
to operating costs in full on first transmission. Where a commission is repeated on any platform, incremental costs 
associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs.  
The net realisable value assessment for acquired and commissioned rights is based on estimated airtime value,  
with consideration given to whether the number of transmissions purchased can be efficiently played out over  
the licence period.  
The Broadcast programme rights and other inventory at the year end are shown in the table below:

Broadcast programme and transmission commitments 
Transmission commitments are the contracted future payments under transmission supply agreements that require 
the use of transponder assets for a period of up to ten years with payments increasing over time, limited by specific  
RPI caps. These have been re-presented as a commitment in 2017 (see operating leases section in note 2.1 for details). 
Programming commitments are transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business with programme 
suppliers, sports organisations and film distributors in respect of rights to broadcast on the ITV network.  
Commitments in respect of these transactions, which are not reflected in the statement of financial position, are due 
for payment as follows:

Studios production costs 
Production inventory comprises the costs incurred by ITV Studios in producing a programme, where the programme  
is part way through the production process and not yet availa ble for delivery to a broadcaster. Inventory is recognised 
within current assets at the value of the production cost incurred, and is expensed in operating costs on delivery  
of episodes. 
Also included here are dramas where production costs are partly funded by the commissioning network licence fee  
and tax credits, if available. The remaining deficit is funded by the Group and is recovered by future distribution sales. 
Once the production is complete, the deficit is classified as a distribution right. 
The Studios programme rights and other inventory at the year end are shown in the table below:

Production costs 247 153 
3.1.2 Distribution rights 
Accounting policies 
Distribution rights are programme rights the Group buys from producers to derive future revenue, principally through 
licensing to other broadcasters. These are classified as non-cu rrent assets as these rights are used to derive long-term 
economic benefit for the Group. 
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income statement  
over a period not exceeding five years, reflecting the valu e and pattern in which the right is consumed. Judgement is 
required when estimating future patterns of consumption. Advances paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are 
disclosed as distribution rights as soon as they are co ntracted. These advances are not expensed until the programme 
is available for distribution. Up to that point, they are assessed annually for impairment through the reassessment  
of the future sales expected to be earned from that title.  
The net book value of distribution rights at the year end is as follows: 
 
2017

During the year, £35 million was charged to the income statement (2016: £38 million).

3.1.3 Trade and other receivables 
Accounting policies 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the 
amounts considered recoverable (amortised cost). Where payments are not due for more than one year, they are 
shown in the financial statements at their net present va lue to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.  
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms. 
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected. 
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK and overseas economies  
and industry specific factors. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. 
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value. Trade and other receivables can be 
analysed as follows: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016 
£m 
Due within one year:   
Trade receivables 311 315

Accrued income and other receivables 8 27 
 27 39 
Total trade and other receivables 541 565 
In 2016, prepaid employment-linked consideration of £21 million related to the acquisition of Talpa Media in 2015.  
This represented the portion of the initial consideration of €150 million that was recoverable from the seller in the 
event he left within the initial two years following acquisition. This amount was amortised over the two years to  
31 March 2017 and recognised as exceptional expense (see note 2.2).  
£330 million (2016: £327 million) of total trade receivables, stated net of provisions for impairment, are aged as follows.

Of the provision total, £4 million relates to balances overdue by more than 90 days (2016: £3 million) and less than  
£1 million relates to current balances (2016: £1 million). £30 million of the provision relates to the overdue Talent 
receivable, which is impairing £14 million of trade receivables and £16 million of accrued income. The provision for  
these insured receivables, net of insurance excess, has been recognised as an exceptional expense (see note 2.2).

Trade payables primarily relate to film creditors for which payment is due after more than one year.  
3.1.6 Working capital management 
Cash and working capital management continues to be a key focus. During the year, the cash outflow from working 
capital was £58 million (2016: outflow of £28 million) derived as follows:

Property, 
plant and 
equipment 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The following section shows the physical assets used by the Group to operate the 
business, generating revenues and profits. These assets include office buildings and 
studios, as well as equipment used in broadcast transmission, programme production 
and support activities. 
The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid for them. A depreciation expense 
is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced 
value of the asset over time. Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of 
years the Group expects the asset to be used (useful economic life). If there has been  
a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review the 
value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.  
If an asset’s value falls below its depreciated value, an additional impairment charge  
is made against profit. 
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific 
estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets. 
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Certain items  
of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair valu e prior to 1 January 2004 (the date of transition to IFRS)  
are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition. 
Leases  
Finance leases are those that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgement as to whether substantially all of the risks and 
benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group. Estimates used by management in making this assessment 
include the useful economic life of assets, the fair valu e of the asset and the discount rate applied to the total 
payments required under the lease. Assets held under such leases are included within property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within 
borrowings. The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease  
on an effective interest basis.  
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term (see note 2.1 for further details of operating lease commitments).  
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful 
life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The major categories of property, plant and 
equipment are depreciated as follows: 
Asset class Depreciation policy 
Freehold land not depreciated 
Freehold buildings up to 60 years 
Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life 
Vehicles, equipment and fittings * 3 to 20 years 
* Equipment includes studio production and technology assets. 
Assets under construction are not depreciated until the point at which the asset comes into use by the Group.

in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may no t be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include 
changes in technology and business performance.

Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in th e course of construction of £41 million (2016: £19 million), 
£16 million of which relates to the London property project (refer to note 2.2 for further details). 
Included within the depreciation charge for the year of £41 million is £11 million of accelerated depreciation relating  
to assets made redundant as a result of the property project. This accelerated depreciation has been recorded as an 
exceptional item in 2017. Refer to note 2.2 for further details. 
In 2013, the Group acquired the freehold for the London Television Centre for £58 million, although the Directors’  
view is that the fair value of the property would be significantly higher than the carrying value. 
Capital commitments 
There are £15 million of capital commitments at 31 December 2017 (2016: £4 million).

Intangible 
assets 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate 
revenue and profits. 
These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, 
contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and 
goodwill. The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where 
there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets 
that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights. In the case of goodwill, 
its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the 
fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired. The value of goodwill is the 
‘intangible’ value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position  
and the outstanding productivity of its employees. 
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the 
number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life,  
via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement. Where there has been  
a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review  
the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their 
amortised value. Should an asset’s value fall below its amortised value, an additional 
impairment charge is made against profit. 
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements  
and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of these assets. 
Accounting policies 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually 
identified and separately recognised. The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of business 
combinations. Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses  
and is allocated to the business to which it relates. 
Due to changes in accounting standards, goodwill has been calculated using three different methods depending on  
the date the relevant business was purchased. 
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition 
method. Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the 
recognition of any part of the business not yet owned (non-controlling interests)), less the fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date. Any contingent consideration expected to 
be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair valu e at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash 
flows. The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the 
discount rate. 
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and ca ll and put options are granted over the remaining interest,  
a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based on the value of the put 
option. A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair value. The put option is recognised 
as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the put option exercise price, and a corresponding 
charge is included in merger and other reserves. Any su bsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is 
recognised within finance income or cost. 
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of the acquisition 
date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date. These adjustments are 
accounted for from the date of acquisition. 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result of such transactions. Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, 
such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred. The Directors consider these 
costs to reflect the cost of acquisition and to form a part of the capital transaction, and highlight them separately as 
exceptional items.

Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued 
144 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Method 2: All business combinations that o ccurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 were accounted  
for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘B usiness Combinations’ (2004). Goodwill on those combinations 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest. Transaction costs incurred in connection with those 
business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in the cost  
of acquisition. 
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents 
the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 December 2003. The 
classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of 
transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered, as permitted under IFRS 1.  
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets other than goodwill are th ose that are distinct and can be sold sepa rately or which arise from legal rights. 
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are formats, brands, licences, contractual arrangements, customer 
contracts and relationships and libraries. 
Within ITV, there are two types of other intangible assets: th ose assets directly purchased by the Group for day-to-day 
operational purposes (such as software licences and development) and intangible assets identified as part of an 
acquisition of a business.  
Intangible assets acquired directly by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Those separately 
identified intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition or business combination are shown at fair value at the 
date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation. 
Each class of intangible assets’ valuation method on initial recognition, amortisation method and estimated useful  
life is set out in the table below:

Determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition requires judgement. The Directors make estimates 
regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows derive d from exploiting the assets being acquired. The Directors 
then estimate an appropriate discount rate to apply to the forecast cash flows. Such estimates are based on current 
budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, operating costs and 
the expected useful lives of assets. Judgements are also made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be 
renewed; this drives our amortisation policy for those assets. 
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired. 
Amortisation 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives 
are judged to be indefinite. Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at 
each year end. 
Impairment 
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that  
the carrying value may be impaired. 
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statemen t of financial position is less than its recoverable amount. 
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement. 
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement. 
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill the cash-
generating unit (‘CGU’),or group of CGUs, related to the goodwill. Total assets (which include goodwill) are grouped  
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use is based 
on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset.  
In testing for impairment, estimates are used in deriving cash flows and the discount rates. Such estimates reflect 
current market assessments of the risks specific to the a sset and the time value of money. The estimation process  
is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting. If different estimates  
of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were 
made, these changes could materially alter the projected valu e of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence 
materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements. 
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment 
loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carryi ng amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Gurney Productions LLC has been treated as if it would have been wound down, with no furt her results to be recognised 
in the accounts. A provision of £13 million has been recognised against onerous contracts and various assets and 
liabilities relating to Gurney Productions LLC, which includes £3 million write-off of goodwill. The net effect of these 
provisions and the derecognition of non-controlling interest is less than £1 million (see note 4.6.6).

£3 million of goodwill was written off in the ITV Studios CGU in relation to Gurney Productions LLC. There has been no 
impairment charge for any CGU during the year (2016: £nil). 
When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations. These calculations 
require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections; long-term growth rates; and a pre-tax market 
discount rate.  
Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s current five year plan. Beyond the five year plan, these projections are 
extrapolated using an estimated nominal long-term growth rate of 1.5% (2016: 2%). The growth rate used is consistent 
with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the countries in which the CGUs are located and is 
appropriate because these are long-term businesses. 
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free rate, the 
equity risk premium and the net cost of debt. There is current ly no reasonably possible change in discount rate that 
would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.

146 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017   
 
147 
Broadcast & Online 
The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the largest of  
which was the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which was treated as an acquisition of Carlton 
for accounting purposes. Broadcast & Online goodwill also incl udes the goodwill arising on acquisition of UTV Limited  
in February 2016. 
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the performance and 
share of the television advertising market; share of commercial impacts; programme and other costs; and the pre-tax 
market discount rate. 
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of the television 
advertising market. In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, the Group has used a 
combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent 
experience. No impairment was identified. Also as part of the impairment review, a sensitivity of up to -10% of growth 
was applied to 2018 and -8% to 2019 with no subsequent recovery, with no impairment identified. The Directors believe 
that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero. 
An impairment charge of £2,309 million was recognised in the Broadcast & Online CGU in 2008, as a result of the 
downturn in the short-term outlook for the advertising market. The current year impairment review, set out above, 
results in significant headroom in excess of the 2008 impairment amount. Even though the advertising market has 
substantially improved since then and the impaired assets are still owned and operated by the Group, due to 
accounting rules the impairment cannot be reversed.  
A pre-tax market discount rate of 9.5% (2016: 10.4%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. 
SDN 
Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN (the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A) in 2005. It 
represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced ability  
to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships wi th the channels which are on Multiplex A and additional 
capacity available from 2010. 
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from renewals of medium-
term contracts; the market price of available multiplex video streams; and the pre-tax market discount rate. These 
assumptions have been determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions  
and in-house estimates of video stream availability and pricing. No impairment was identified.  
As part of the impairment review, sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified  
(2018: -10% growth, 2019: 0% growth). The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the 
cash flow and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero. 
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.4% (2016: 11.7%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. 
ITV Studios 
The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999. Significant 
balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Media’s production businesses in 2000  
and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc. ITV Studios goodwill also includes the goodwill arising 
from recent acquisitions since 2012, with the largest acquisitions being Leftfield in 2014, followed by Talpa in 2015.  
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows for the whole CGU were based include revenue (including 
international revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced),  
margins and the pre-tax market discount rate. These assumptions have been determined by using a combination  
of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth  
rates in all markets. No impairment was identified.  
As part of the impairment review, sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified  
(2018: -10% growth, 2019: 0% growth). The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the  
cash flow assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero. 
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.8% (2016: 11.6%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. 
Following the acquisitions made by ITV Studios in 2017, th e Directors considered how assets and resources are shared 
across the ITV Studios division and the level of integration within the management structure for the purposes of 
reporting and strategic decision-making. They concluded that a single ITV Studios CGU continues to remain appropriate.

Acquisitions 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The following section outlines what the Group has acquired in the year.  
Most of the deals are structured so that a large part of the payment made to the 
sellers (‘consideration’) is determined based on future performance. This is done so 
that the Group can both align incentives for growth, while reducing risk so that total 
consideration reflects actual performance, not expected.  
IFRS accounting standards require some of this consideration to be included in the 
purchase price used in determining goodwill (‘contingent consideration’). Examples  
of contingent consideration include top-up payments and recoupable performance 
adjustments. Any remaining consideration is required to be recognised as a liability  
or expense outside of acquisition accounting (put option liabilities and employment-
linked contingent payments known as ‘earnout’ payments). 
The Group considers the income statement impact of all consideration to be capital in 
nature and so excludes it from adjusted profit. Therefore, for each acquisition below, 
the distinction between the types of consideration has been explained in detail. 
Acquisitions 
During the year, the Group made payments totalling £54 million for five acquisitions.  
All acquisitions have been included in the results of the ITV Studios operating segment. The businesses fit with the 
strategy of strengthening the Group’s existing position as a producer for major television networks in the UK, Europe, 
US and OTT platforms.  
Tetra Media Studios SAS 
On 28 February 2017, the Group purchased 65.04% of the share capital of Tetra Media Studios SAS, a French television 
production group which specialises in drama, including flagship crime series Profilage, now in its seventh series, and 
political crime thriller Les Hommes de l’Ombre.  
Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC 
On 1 April 2017, the Group gained control of Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC due to the conversion of its 75% preference 
share capital into 75% ordinary share capital. The company produced Aquarius, a US period crime series, which aired  
on NBC, and is producing Snowpiercer, an action sci-fi drama series, expected to be released in the US in 2018. 
World Productions Limited 
On 30 April 2017, the Group purchased 92% of the share capital of World Productions Limited, a company which 
specialises in producing drama series with titles including Line of Duty, an award-winning British police crime drama,  
and Born to Kill, a British thriller television mini-series. 
Elk Production AB 
On 21 June 2017, the Group acquired 96% of the share capital of Elk Production AB. Elk is one of the leading 
independent production companies in Sweden. Key titles produced by the company include Ninja Warrior, an obstacle 
course competition series, Dessertmästarna, a dessert cooking competition, and award-winning TV series Wahlgrens 
and Parneviks.  
Cattleya S.r.l. 
On 11 October 2017, the Group purchased 51% of the share capital of Cattleya Srl, an Italian scripted production 
company behind international hit TV dramas Gomorrah, Romanzo Criminale and Suburra, Netflix’s first Italian original 
TV series. 
Acquisition accounting: 
Put and call options have been granted over the non-controll ing interest of all five acquisitions, exercisable over  
the next two to seven years. The total maximum consider ation for the acquisitions is capped at £418 million 
(undiscounted). All future payments are dependent on future performance of the business and linked to ongoing 
employment. 
Goodwill totalling £85 million arising on these acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes and 
represents the value placed on the opportunity to grow the content produced by the Group.

Acquisitions in 2016 
In 2016, the Group completed the acquisition of UTV Limited, which has been included in the results of the Broadcast  
& Online operating segment. The business fits with the strategy of strengthening the Group’s free-to-air business and 
enables it to run a more efficient network. The following section provides a summary of the acquisition.  
UTV Limited 
On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired a 100% controllin g interest in UTV Limited which, together with its 100% 
subsidiary UTV Ireland Limited, owned the television assets of UTV Media plc, for cash consideration of £100 million. 
UTV is the market-leading commercial broadcaster in Northern Ireland, broadcasting ITV content alongside high-quality 
local programming. The strategic rationale for the acquisition was to purchase the Northern Irish Channel 3 licence.  
Before ITV’s acquisition, UTV Limited launched a new dedicated channel for the Republic of Ireland in 2015 via its 
subsidiary, UTV Ireland Limited. Management concluded that the best prospect of delivering a strong and sustainable 
Irish broadcaster was to bring UTV Ireland under common ownership with TV3. ITV therefore sold the company to 
Virgin Media, owner of TV3, on 30 November 2016, for consideration of €10 million.  
Acquisition accounting: 
Intangibles, being the value placed on brands and licences, of £58 million were identified and goodwill was valued at 
£44 million. Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the business by the Group. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other fair value adjustments  
have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none of them are individually significant.

Investments 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The Group holds non-controlling interests in a number of different entities. 
Accounting for these investments, and the Group’s share of any profits and losses, 
depends on the level of control or influence the Group is granted via its interest.  
The three principal types of non-consolidated investments are: joint arrangements 
(joint ventures or joint operations), associates and available-for-sale investments. 
A joint arrangement is an investment where the Group has joint control, with one  
or more third parties. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence (i.e. power to participate in the investee’s financial and operating decisions). 
Any other investment is an available-for-sale investment. 
Accounting policies 
For joint ventures and associates, the Group applies equity accounting. Under this method, it recognises the investment 
in the entity at cost and subsequently adjusts this for its share of profits or losses, which are recognised in the income 
statement within non-operating items and included in adjusted profit. Where the Group has invested in associates by 
acquiring preference shares or convertible debt instruments, the share of profit recognised is usually £nil as no equity 
interest exists. Available-for-sale investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in 
which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.  
The carrying amount of each category of our investments is represented as follows:

£m 
2016 
£m 
Joint ventures 2 4 
Associates 68 60 
Available-for-sale investments 4 12 
 74 76 
The carrying amount of associates has increased in the year due to investments made in Blumhouse and Circle of 
Confusion, two independent studios focusing on original premium scripted and unscripted programming. This was 
offset by the acquisition of a controlling stake in ITV To morrow Studios, in which the Group previously held an 
investment (see note 3.4). Further smaller investments have been made in line with Group’s strategy to grow  
the international content business.

Provisions 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
A provision is recognised by the Group where an obligation exists relating to events  
in the past and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it. 
A provision is made where the Group is not certain how much cash will be required  
to settle a liability, so an estimate is required. The main estimates relate to the cost  
of holding properties that are no longer in use by the Group, the likelihood of settling 
legal claims and contracts the Group has entered into that are now unprofitable. 
Accounting policies 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial po sition when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash will be paid to settle it and the amount can be estimated  
reliably. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate that reflects current  
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount  
is recognised as a financing cost in the income statem ent. The value of the provision is determined based on 
assumptions and estimates in relation to the amount and timing of actual cash flows, which are dependent  
on future events.

Contract provisions comprise onerous commitments on playout and related services that are not expected to be 
utilised over the remaining contract period. 
Property provisions primarily relate to expected dilapidation costs at temporary rental properties. 
Legal and Other provisions totalling £16 million (2016: £21 million) primarily relate to potential liabilities that may  
arise as a result of Boxclever having been placed into administrative receivership, most of which relate to pension 
arrangements. In 2011, the Determinations Panel of the Pensions Regulator determined that Financial Support 
Directions should be issued against certain Group companies, which would require the Group to put in place financial 
support for the Boxclever Scheme. The Group is challengin g this in the Upper Tribunal. The timing of the Upper 
Tribunal’s decision is not yet clear. The Directors, having taken advice, believe that they have a strong case. There  
are significant points of legal principle at issue and consequently any potential liability may take a significant period  
to resolve. The Directors continue to believe that the provision held is appropriate.  
The utilisation of provisions during the year was due to settlement of various other legal matters.

Pensions 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
In this note, we explain the accounting policies governing the Group’s pension 
schemes, followed by analysis of the components of the net defined benefit pension 
deficit, including assumptions made, and where the related movements have been 
recognised in the financial statements. In addition, we have placed text boxes to 
explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure.  
What are the Group’s pension schemes?  
There are two types of pension schemes. A ‘Defined Contribution’ scheme that  
is open to ITV employees, and a number of ‘Defined Benefit’ schemes that have been 
closed to new members since 2006 and closed to future accrual in 2017. In 2016,  
on acquisition of UTV Limited, the Group took over the UTV Defined Benefit Scheme, 
which remains open to future accrual. 
What is a Defined Contribution scheme? 
The Defined Contribution scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into  
a separate fund on behalf of those employees participating in saving for their 
retirement. ITV has no further obligation to the participating employee and the risks 
and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather 
than the Group. Although the Trustee of the scheme makes available a range of 
investment options, it is the members’ responsibility to make investment decisions 
relating to their retirement benefits. 
What is a Defined Benefit scheme?  
In a Defined Benefit scheme, members receive payments during retirement, the  
value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service. The Group 
makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not 
consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit 
pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position. 
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the Scheme 
and its funding position. The Trustee, appointed according to the terms of the 
scheme’s documentation, is required to act in the best interest of the members  
and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the scheme and its  
funding position.  
The Group has a Pension Steering Committee, which liaises with the Trustee and  
has oversight of the management of the pension schemes and underlying risks. 
In the event of poor returns, the Group may need to address this through a 
combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the 
scheme. Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by  
the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money  
or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments but in some cases 
security is required. 
The accounting defined benefit pension deficit (IAS 19) is different from the actuarial 
valuation deficit as they are calculated on the basis of different assumptions, such  
as discount rate. The accounting defined benefit pension deficit (IAS 19) figure is 
calculated as at the balance sheet date, and the actuarial deficit was calculated for 
the last triennial valuation as of 1 January 2014, with the 1 January 2017 valuation 
expected to be agreed in early 2018. 
Accounting policies 
Defined contribution scheme 
Obligations under the Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income 
statement as incurred. For 2017, total contributions expensed were £18 million (2016: £16 million).

Defined benefit scheme 
The Group’s obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) is calculated by estimating the  
amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees (‘members’) have earned during their services. That 
benefit payable in the future is discounted to today’s value and then the fair value of scheme assets is deducted  
to measure the defined benefit pension position.  
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting th e best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using  
the ‘projected unit’ method. These calculations are complex and are performed by a qualified actuary. There are many 
judgements and estimates necessary to calculate the Group’s estimated liabilities, the main assumptions are set out 
later in this section. Movements in assumptions during the year are called ‘actuarial gains and losses’ and these are 
recognised in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income.  
The latest triennial valuation of the ITV Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2014 by an independent 
actuary appointed by the Trustee of the Scheme and agreed in early 2016. The next triennial valuation will be as at  
1 January 2017 and is expected to be agreed during H1 2018. This will drive subsequent contribution rates. 
An unfunded scheme in relation to four former Granada executives is accounted for under IAS 19 and the Group is 
responsible for meeting the pension obligations as they fall due. The unfunded scheme has additional security 
compared with the ITV main scheme, in the form of a charge over gilts held by the Group. Therefore, the £38 million 
securitised gilts have been classified as other pension assets to reflect the Group’s net pension deficit. 
In December 2016, following a member consultation, the Group decided to close the ITV Pension Scheme to future 
benefit accrual with effect from 28 February 2017. Members’ benefits are no longer subject to a capped pensionable 
salary; the benefits are now linked to statutory revaluation until retirement. This decision gave rise to a one-off,  
non-cash £19 million curtailment charge recognised in 2016. 
On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the assets and liabilities of UTV Limited, including responsibility  
for a defined benefit pension scheme. Due to the size of the scheme, within this note the Directors present the results 
and position of the UTV Scheme combined with the existing ITV Schemes. The next triennial valuation will be as at  
30 June 2017 and is expected to be agreed during H1 2018. 
Unless otherwise stated, references to ‘the Schemes’ within this note refer to the ITV Pension Scheme, the unfunded 
scheme and the UTV Scheme combined. The sponsoring company of the ITV Pension Scheme is ITV Services Limited, 
the unfunded scheme is Granada Group Limited and the UTV Scheme is sponsored by UTV Limited.

Net pension deficit of £83 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £328 million) is stated after including the unfunded

(2016: £117 million).

accounted for and the impact on the financial statements.

Defined benefit scheme obligations 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
What causes movements in the defined benefit pension obligations? 
The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation (the pension scheme liabilities) 
position at the year end are as follows: 
• Current service cost – the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned 
by members that relates to the members’ service in the current year. This is charged 
to operating costs in the income statement. 
• Past service cost – is a change in present value of the benefits built up by the 
members in the prior periods; can be positive or negative resulting from changes  
to the existing plan as a result of an agreement between ITV and employees or as  
a result of significant reduction by ITV in the number of employees covered by the 
plan (curtailment). 
• Interest cost – the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted to the 
present value at year end. A discount factor is used to determine the current value 
today of the future cost. The interest cost is the unwinding of one year’s movement 
in the present value of the obligation. It is broadly determined by multiplying the 
discount rate at the beginning of the period by the updated present value of the 
obligation during the period. The discount rate is a key assumption explained later  
in this section. This interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the 
income statement (see note 4.4). 
• Actuarial gains or losses – there are broadly two causes of actuarial movements: 
‘experience’ adjustments, which arise when comparing assumptions made when 
estimating the liabilities and what has actually occurred, and adjustments resulting 
from changes in actuarial assumptions e.g. movements in corporate bond yields or 
change in mortality. Key assumptions are explained in detail later in this section. 
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through other comprehensive income. 
• Benefits paid – any cash benefits paid out by the Scheme will reduce  
the obligation. 
• One-off events – for example, the acquisition of UTV Limited set out above. 
 
The movement in the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is analysed below:

Assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
What are the main assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations? 
The main assumptions are: 
• An estimate of increases in pension payments;  
• The life expectancy of members; 
• The effect of inflation on all these factors;  
• The discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations; 
• Future salary levels for the UTV Scheme; and 
• Future pensionable salary levels for the UTV Scheme. 
How do we determine the appropriate assumptions?  
The Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to the appropriateness  
of the assumptions used. 
IFRS requires that we estimate a discount rate by reference to high-quality  
fixed income investments in the UK that match the estimated term of the  
pension obligations.  
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the difference between the  
yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds. The inflation assumption is  
used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where caps have  
been implemented. 
The discount rate has therefore been obtained using the yields available on AA rated 
corporate bonds, which match projected cash flows. The Group’s estimate of the 
weighted average term of the liabilities is 15 years (2016: 17 years). 
The principal assumptions used in the Scheme’s valuations at the year end were: 
 2017  2016  
Discount rate for:   
Past service liabilities 2.50% 2.60% 
Future service liabilities 2.50% 2.70% 
Inflation assumption for:   
Past service liabilities 3.15% 3.25% 
Future service liabilities 3.15% 3.20% 
Rate of pensionable salary increases   
UTV Pension Scheme 3.65% 3.75%

Total defined benefit scheme assets 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The Scheme holds assets across a number of different classes, which are managed  
by the Trustee, who consults with the Group on changes to its investment policy. 
What are the pension Scheme assets? 
At 31 December 2017, the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio  
that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities. The tables below set out the 
major categories of assets. 
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes  
in market factors (interest rates and inflation), which could act to increase the net 
pension deficit. 
One such instrument is the longevity swap, which the Scheme transacted in 2011  
to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the 
majority of pensioner members at that date. Under the swap, the Trustee agreed  
to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified 
pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and  
their dependants live. The difference in the present values of these two streams of 
payments is reflected in the Scheme assets. The swap had a nil valuation at inception 
and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for changes in the 
market life expectancy and market discount rates, in line with its fair value. 
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets? 
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due  
to the following: 
• Interest income on scheme assets – this is determined by multiplying the fair  
value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning of  
the year. This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement; 
• Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and  
interest income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other  
comprehensive income; 
• Employer’s contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed  
and invested; and 
• Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the  
fair value of the Scheme’s assets. 
 
The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit scheme’s assets is analysed below: 
 
2017

2016

Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 3,833 3,270

Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,866 3,833 
The actual return on the Scheme’s assets, being the sum of the interest income on Scheme assets and return on 
Scheme assets, for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £149 million (2016: £542 million).

How are the Scheme’s assets invested?  
At 31 December 2017, the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity  
and debt securities. The Trustee is responsible for deciding the investment strategy for the scheme’s assets, although 
changes in investment policies require consultation with the Group. The assets are invested in different classes to 
hedge against unfavourable movements in the funding obligation. When selecting the mix of assets to hold, and 
considering their related risks and returns, the Trustee will weigh up the variability of returns against the target  
long-term rate of return on the overall portfolio. 
The fair value of the Scheme’s assets is shown in the following table by major category:

of £244 million (2016: £565 million) and bonds of £734 million (2016: £739 million). 
The Trustee entered a longevity swap in 2011, which provides cash flow certainty by hedging the risk of increasing life 
expectancy over the next 70 years for 11,700 of current pensioners at inception covering £1.7 billion of the pension 
obligation. The fair value of the longevity swap equals the discounted value of the projected net cash flows resulting 
from the contract and has reduced in value in 2017, main ly due to a decrease in gilts yields over the year.

Defined pension deficit sensitivities 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
Which assumptions have the biggest impact on the Scheme? 
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used  
may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and statement  
of financial position. This ‘sensitivity’ to change is analysed below to demonstrate  
how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the estimation of the 
defined benefit pension deficit. The Trustee manages the investment, mortality and 
inflation risks to ensure the pension obligations are met as they fall due.  
The investment strategy is aimed at the valuation obligation rather than IAS 19 
defined pension deficit value. As such, the effectiveness of the risk hedging strategies 
on a valuation basis will not be the same as on an accounting basis. Those hedging 
strategies have significant impact on the movement in the net pension deficit as 
assumptions change, offsetting the impacts on the obligation disclosed below. 
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in 
another assumption (although this is not always the case). Changes in the assumptions 
may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of Scheme assets, which 
may or may not offset the changes in assumptions. 
Changes in assumptions have a different level of impact as the value of the net 
pension deficit fluctuates, because the relationship between them is not linear. 
The analysis below considers the impact of a single change in principal assumptions on the defined benefit obligation 
while keeping the other assumptions unchanged and does not take into account any risk hedging strategies: 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation 
Discount rate 
Increase by 0.1% Decrease by £60 million 
Decrease by 0.1% Increase by £60 million 
Rate of inflation (Retail Price Index) 
Increase by 0.1% Increase by £15 million  
Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by £25 million 
Rate of inflation (Consumer Price Index) 
Increase by 0.1% Increase by £10 million 
Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by £10 million 
Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by £110 million 
The sensitivity analysis has been determined by extrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation  
at the year end with changes in key assu mptions that might reasonably occur.  
While the Scheme’s risk hedging strategy is aimed at a valu ation basis, the Directors estimate that on an accounting 
basis it would significantly reduce the above impact on the defined benefit obligation.  
In particular, an increase in assumption of life expectations by one year would benefit from an estimated increase of 
the value of the longevity swap by £100 million, reducing the net impact on the defined pension deficit to £10 million.  
Further, the ITV Pension Scheme invests in UK Government bonds and interest rate and inflation swap contracts  
and therefore movements in the defined benefit obligation ar e typically offset, to an extent, by asset movements.

The £121 million actuarial gain on the Scheme’s liabilities was principally due to an experience gain of £138 million  
based on the use of updated membership data underlying the Trustee’s triennial valuation as at 1 January 2017.  
The true-up of the membership data has resulted in a decrease in the liabilities. The £51 million gain on the Scheme’s 
assets primarily results from increases in the market values of return-seeking investments, which has led to assets 
outperforming expectations.

Addressing the defined benefit pension deficit 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The Group works closely with the Trustee to agree appropriate levels of funding  
for the Scheme. This involves agreeing a Schedule of Contributions at each triennial 
valuation, which specifies the contribution rates for the employer and, where relevant, 
scheme members and the date these contributions are due. A recovery plan setting 
out the steps that will be taken to address a funding shortfall is also agreed. 
In the event that the Group’s defined benefit scheme is in a net liability position,  
the Directors must take steps to manage the size of the deficit. Apart from the 
funding agreements mentioned above, this could involve pledging additional assets  
to the Scheme, as was the case in the SDN and London Television Centre pension 
funding partnerships. 
The levels of ongoing contributions to the Scheme are base d on the current service costs (as assessed by the Scheme 
Trustee) and the expected future cash flows of the Scheme . Normal employer contributions in 2018 for UTV Scheme 
current service and administration expenses are expected to be in the region of £5 million (2017: £6 million) and deficit 
funding contributions for the main ITV scheme in 2018 are expected to be £66 million (2017: £66 million), assuming 
current contribution rates continue as agreed with the Trustee.  
The Group has two asset-backed pension funding agreements with the Trustee and makes annual payments of 
£11 million for 12 years from 2011 and £2.5 million, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038. In 2018, a payment of  
£14 million is expected as a result of those agreements. 
IFRIC 14 clarifies how the asset ceiling rules should be applie d if the Schemes are expected to be in surplus, for example 
as a result of deficit funding agreements. The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of 
any surplus assets if the Schemes are run off until the last member dies. On this basis, IFRIC 14 rules do not cause any 
change in the pension deficit accounting or disclosures.

Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs 
162 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
In this  
section 
 
 
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related 
financing costs, including its balance sheet liquidity and access to capital markets. 
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically how 
much is raised from shareholders (equity) and how much is borrowed from financial 
institutions (debt) in order to finance the Gr oup’s activities both now and in the future. 
Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the 
Group. Any potential courses of action will take into account the Group’s liquidity 
needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on 
credit ratings. 
The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and dividend policy at least twice 
a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue  
as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities to grow  
the business and enhance shareholder value. 
A Tax and Treasury committee acting under delegated authority from the Board, 
approves certain financial transactions and monitors compliance with the Group’s  
tax and treasury policies. 
4.1  
Net debt 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
Net cash/(debt) is the Group’s key measure used to evaluate total cash resources  
net of the current outstanding debt. 
Adjusted net debt is also monitored by the Group and more closely reflects  
how credit agencies see the Group’s gearing. To arrive at the adjusted net debt 
amount, we add our total undiscounted expected contingent payments on 
acquisitions, our net pension deficit and our undiscounted operating lease 
commitments. A full analysis and discussion of adjusted net debt is included  
in the Operating and Performance Review.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Included within cash equivalents is £nil (2016: £4 million), the use of which is restricted to meeting finance lease 
commitments under programme sale and leasebacks (see note 4.2).  
Loans and facilities due within one year 
At various periods during the year, the Group drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) to meet short-term 
funding requirements. At 31 December 2017, the Group had drawings of £60 million under the RCF (2016: £nil).  
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was £390 million (2016: £500 million). 
The Group also had an unsecured £161 million Eurobond that matured in January 2017 and had a coupon of 6.125%. 
Loans and loan notes due after one year  
In 2016, the Group had a £100 million bilateral loan facility, which was repaid in full in June 2017. 
The Group has issued the following Eurobonds: 
• A seven-year €600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%, which matures in September 2022; and 
• A seven-year €500 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.0%, which will mature in December 2023. The bond  
issued in December 2016 has been swapped back to ster ling using a cross-currency interest swap. The resulting  
fixed rate payable is c. 3.5%.

Borrowings 
and finance 
leases 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The Group borrows money from financial institutions in the form of bonds, bank 
facilities and other financial instruments. The interest payable on these instruments  
is shown in the net financing costs note in note 4.4. 
There are Board-approved policies in place to manage the Group’s financial risks. 
Macroeconomic market risks, which impact currency transactions and interest rates, 
are discussed in note 4.3. Credit and liquidity risks are discussed below. 
• Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails 
to meet its contractual obligations; and  
• Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will no t be able to meet its financial obligations 
as they fall due. 
The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments. The fair value  
is the amount the Group would pay a third party to transfer the liability. It is sourced  
in the capital markets. This estimation of fair value is consistent with instruments 
valued under level 1 in note 4.5. 
Accounting policies 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent 
measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Under the amortised cost method,  
the difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the income  
statement over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest rate basis. 
Finance leases 
Historically, ITV has entered into sale and leaseback agreements in relation to certain programme titles. Related 
outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest, are included within 
borrowings. The finance-related element of the agreement is charged to the income statement over the term  
of the lease on an effective interest basis. Sale and le aseback obligations are secured against an equivalent cash 
balance held within cash and cash equivalents. 
Managing credit and liquidity risk 
Credit risk 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of derivative financial assets  
(see note 4.3), trade receivables (see note 3.1.3), and cash and cash equivalents (see note 4.1).  
Trade and other receivables 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The majority 
of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers. Credit insurance has 
been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the event of a possible default. The 
Group also reviews other significant receivables and will seek to take out credit insurance on an individual basis where 
appropriate. 
In 2016, the Group signed a £100 million non-recourse receivables purchase agreement. As at 31 December 2017,  
£10 million was available under the agreement (2016: £65 million).  
The receivables in relation to the invoices sold were derecognised and the Group collects cash on behalf of the 
counterparty as payments fall due. 
Cash  
The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash that emphasise preservation of capital.  
The guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty risk and maturity profile of cash placed. Counterparty 
limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies. 
Deposits longer than 12 months require the approval of the Board.

Borrowings 
ITV is rated as investment grade by Moody’s and S&P. ITV’s credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap hedging  
and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants in the cost of new borrowings for ITV.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financing policy is to fund itself for the medi um to long-term by using debt instruments with a range  
of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term borrowing facilities with a minimum of £250 million  
of undrawn facilities available at all times.  
Long-term funding comes from the UK and European capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt 
requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling £930 million (see below). Management monitors 
rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash equivalents)  
on the basis of expected cash flows. This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess any possible future impact  
on credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.  
The Group has a £630 million Revolving Credit Facility with a group of relationship banks. This facility, which was 
amended and extended in December 2016, matures in 2022 and is committed with leverage and interest cover 
financial covenants. In addition, the Group has £300 million of financial covenant free financing, which runs to 2021.

Managing  
market risks: 
derivative 
financial 
instruments 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
What is a derivative? 
A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.  
A derivative’s value changes over time in response to underlying variables such  
as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period. A hedge 
is where a derivative is used to manage exposure in an underlying variable. 
The Group is exposed to certain market risks. In accordance with Board-approved 
policies, which are set out in this note, the Group manages these risks by using 
derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures. 
Why do we need them? 
The key market risks facing the Group are: 
• Currency risk arising from:  
i. Translation risk, that is the risk in the period of adverse currency fluctuations in 
the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities (‘balance sheet 
risk’) and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities (‘income 
statement risk’); and  
ii. Transaction risk, that is the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative 
effect on the value of the Group’s non-functional currency trading cash flows.  
A non-functional currency transaction is a transaction in any currency other  
than the reporting currency of the subsidiary.  
• Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates  
on borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates. 
How do we use them? 
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when 
managing its currency and interest rate risk: 
• Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge  
income statement translation risk arising from short-term intercompany loans 
denominated in a foreign currency; 
• Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge 
transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known 
fixed rate on an agreed future date; and 
• Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the 
principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another. 
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various 
methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section. 
Accounting policies 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair  
value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge 
accounting. In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income  
and presented in the hedging reserve within equity. The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the income 
statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transact ion is realised. Derivatives with positive fair values  
are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.  
Financial Statements
166 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017   
 
167 
Determining fair value 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract 
exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date. The fair value of interest rate swaps  
is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking  
into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well as that of our swap counterparties. 
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Group’s inte rest rate derivatives. The valuation techniques use inputs 
such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations 
between inputs. 
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk? 
Currency risk 
As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly sensitive  
to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.  
The Group’s foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material non-functional 
currency denominated costs or revenue for up to five years forward.  
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a minimal level by 
using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot 
rates when necessary. 
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps both to manage foreign 
currency cash flow timing differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items.  
The Group’s net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to  
be material. The Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net investment hedge against its euro 
denominated assets following the acquisition of Talpa Media. 
The following table highlights the Group’s sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% strengthening/weakening 
in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are held constant: 
 
2017 – post- 
tax profit 2017 – equity 
2016 – post- 
tax profit 2016 – equity 
US dollar  £1 million £23 million £3 million £32 million 
Euro £3 million £17 million £10 million £11 million 
The Group’s sensitivity to translation risk for revenue and adjusted EBITA is disclosed in the Finance Review on page 47. 
The key difference between the foreign currency sensitivity for adjusted EBITA and profit after tax is the impact  
on the US dollar and euro denominated exceptional costs, including acquisition-related costs, acquired intangible 
amortisation and net financing cost. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total gross debt  
to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
At 31 December 2017, the Group’s fixed rate debt represented 92% of total gross debt (2016: 92%). Consequently,  
a 1% movement in interest rates on floating rate debt would impact the 2017 post-tax profit for the year by less than  
£1 million (2016: £2 million).  
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to 
changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

Cash flow hedges 
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain foreign curr ency firm commitments and highly probably cash flows 
where the underlying cash flows are payable within the next seven years. In order to fix the sterling cash outflows 
associated with the commitments and interest payments – which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros – the  
Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps for the same foreign 
currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.  
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the 
revaluation loss associated with these contracts. There was less than £1 million (2016: £1 million) ineffectiveness taken 
to the income statement and £20 million cumulative gain (2016: £5 million gain) recycled to the income statement  
in the year.  
On issuing the 2023 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which swapped 
the euro principal and fixed rate coupons into sterling. As a result, the Group makes sterling interest payments at a  
fixed rate. 
Net investment hedges 
The Group uses euro denominated debt to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its euro 
denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of debt in a net investment  
hedge was £177 million (2016: £168 million). A foreign exchange loss of £6 million (2016: £21 million) relating to the  
net investment hedges has been netted off within exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as 
presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Net financing 
costs 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
This section details the interest income generated on the Group’s cash and other 
financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other  
financial liabilities.  
In reporting ‘adjusted profit’, the Group adjusts net financing costs to exclude 
unrealised mark-to-market movements on interest rate and foreign exchange 
derivatives, gains/losses on bond buy-backs, net pension interest, interest and fair 
value movements in acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs. 
Our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the  
Finance Review. 
Accounting policies 
Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains/losses on the disposal of financial instruments, 
changes in the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance leases, unwinding  
of the discount on provisions, unwinding of the discount on liabilities to non-controlling interest, foreign exchange 
gains/losses, and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities. Interest income and expense is recognised as it 
accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Interest on financial liabilities relates to the inte rest incurred on the Group’s borrowings in the year. 
Other finance expense includes the amortisation of facility commitment and upfront fees as well as movements  
in the estimated value of acquisition-related contingent liabilities, which contributed to most of the 2017 expense.  
This is where estimates of the future performance against stretch targets is reassessed, resulting in adjustments  
to the related put option liabilities.

Fair value 
hierarchy 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position  
are measured at either fair value or amortised cost. The measurement of this fair  
value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the 
calculations. ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market 
values (e.g. external share prices). The different valuation methods are called 
‘hierarchies’ and are described below. 
Level 1 
Fair values are measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 
Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within  
Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. 
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon 
termination prices. Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the 
difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange 
rate at the reporting date. 
Level 3 
Fair values are measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based  
on observable market data. 
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position at ‘fair value’.

Acquisition-related liabilities are valued based on the forecast performance of each acquisition and where there has 
been a change in expectations, the Group adjusts the value of future commitments.

Share-based 
compensation 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration 
packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, 
namely the Deferred Share Award (DSA), Performance Share Plan (PSP), Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes. The share-based 
compensation is not pensionable. 
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group receives 
services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.  
If the Group incurs a liability linked to the price or value of the Group’s shares, this will 
also fall under a share-based transaction.  
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at any 
time during the period is set out in the Annual Remuneration Report. 
Accounting policies 
For each of the Group’s share-based compensation schemes, the fair value of the equity instrument granted is 
measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the SAYE 
scheme, a Black–Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.  
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions. For performance-based schemes,  
the relevant Group performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine 
the number of options expected to vest. The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted  
to present value. The Group revises its estimates of the nu mber of options that are expected to vest, including an 
estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised  
in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares. No new 
shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA. During the year, all exercises were satisfied by 
using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees’ Benefit Trust. 
Share-based compensation charges totalled £12 million in 2017 (2016: £10 million).

Employees’ Benefit Trust 
The Group has investments in its own shares as a result of shares purchased by the ITV Employees’ Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). 
Transactions with the Group-sponsored EBT are included in these financial statements and primarily consist of the 
EBT’s purchases of shares in ITV plc, which are accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings. 
The table below shows the number of ITV plc shares held in the EBT at 31 December 2017 and the purchases/(releases) 
from the EBT made in the year to satisfy awards under the Group’s share schemes:

Shares purchased  21,064,677  
 31 December 2017 26,989,521 2,698,952 
The total number of shares held by the EBT at 31 December 2017 represents 0.67% (2016: 0.36%) of ITV’s issued share 
capital. The market value of own shares held at 31 December 2017 is £45 million (2016: £30 million). 
The shares will be held in the EBT until such time as they may be transferred to participants of the various Group share 
schemes. Rights to dividends have been waived by the EBT in respect of shares held that do not relate to restricted 
shares under the DSA. In accordance with the Trust Deed, the Trustees of the EBT have the power to exercise all voting 
rights in relation to any investment (including shares) held within that trust.

Contingent 
assets and 
liabilities 
Keeping 
it simple 
 
A contingent asset or liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify  
for recognition as an asset or provision where uncertainty may exist regarding the 
outcome of future events.  
 
Contingent assets 
In 2017 Talpa Media took back the licence for The Voice of China due a breach of the agreement by the customer, 
Talent, for not fulfilling their payment obligations. The Group is pursuing Talent vigorously for the £30 million still  
due under the agreement. Further, the Group has credit insurance in place and a claim has been submitted. 
Whilst the Directors are confident of recovering the amount due, accounting standards set very specific requirements 
for the recognition of contingent assets, which is how the recovery of the amount due has been accounted for. As 
discussions with the insurers and the claim against Talent are still in progress, at this early stage of pursuing recovery 
the Group is not able to demonstrate sufficient certainty to be able to recognise a cash receivable at the year end.  
See note 2.2 for further details. 
Contingent liabilities 
The Group has initiated legal proceedings against the minority owners of Gurney Productions LLC for alleged breaches 
of contracts and their fiduciary duties, as well as self-deali ng and fraudulent concealment. The minority owners dispute 
the allegations and they have counter-claimed for damages of at least $150 million. The action is ongoing and, having 
taken legal advice, the Directors believe this counter-claim is completely without merit. 
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litiga tion and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect  
of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses. None of these items are expected to have  
a material effect on the Group’s results or financial position.

Notes to the ITV plc Company Financial Statements

Note i  
Accounting 
policies 
 
In this  
section 
 
 This section sets out the notes to the ITV plc Company only financial statements. 
Those statements form the basis of the dividend decisions made by the  
Directors, as explained in detail in note viii below. These financial statements  
were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’.  
Basis of preparation 
The Company is a qualifying entity as it is a member of the ITV plc Group where ITV plc, the ultimate parent,  
prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements. 
Exemptions applied 
The Company is taking advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
• Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flows; 
• Disclosure of key management personnel compensation; 
• Disclosure of related party transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and parents within a group; 
• Disclosures required under IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of group settled share based payments; 
• Disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instrument: Disclosure’; 
• Certain disclosures required under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; and 
• Disclosure of information in relation to new standards not yet applied. 
As permitted by section 408 (3) of the Companies Act 2006 , a separate income statement dealing with the results  
of the parent company has not been presented. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control exists where the Company 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  
The investment in the Company’s subsidiaries is recorded at cost.  
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling  
at the rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in  
the profit and loss account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling  
at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent 
measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The difference between initial fair value  
and the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective 
interest basis. 
Derivatives and other financial instruments 
The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial inst ruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest 
and other foreign exchange rates. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value  
with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account wi thin net financing costs, except where derivatives qualify  
for cash flow hedge accounting. In this case, the effective portion of cash flow hedge is recognised in retained profits 
within equity. The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassifi ed to the profit and loss account in the same period as the 
relevant hedged transaction is realised. Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair 
values as liabilities. 
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract 
exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

182 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated am ount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate  
the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of  
swap counterparties. 
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Company’s derivatives. The valuation techniques use inputs such as 
interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between 
inputs. For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the fair value change and interes t 
income/expense are not separated.  
Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment  
in respect of previous years.  
The Company recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely 
to become due, which require judgement. Amounts are accrued based on management’s interpretation of specific tax 
law and the likelihood of settlement. Where the final tax ou tcome of these matters is different from the amounts that 
were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made. 
Deferred tax 
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement or directly in equity according to the accounting 
treatment of the related transaction. 
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that suffi cient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary 
difference. Recognition of deferred tax assets therefore involves judgement regarding timing and level of future 
taxable income.  
Share-based compensation 
The Company utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration packages, and therefore operates  
a number of share-based compensation schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award (DSA), Performance Share Plan 
(PSP), Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes. 
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from employees  
and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. If the Company incurs a liability based on the price or value  
of the shares, this will also fall under a share-based transa ction. The Company recognises the retained earnings impact 
of the share-based compensation for the Group as awards are settled in ITV plc shares. The cost of providing those 
awards is recharged to subsidiaries that receive the service from employees. 
The fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via  
a charge to the income statement with a corresponding incr ease in equity. The fair value of the share options and 
awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the SAYE scheme, a Black–Scholes model, taking  
into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.  
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions. For performance-based schemes,  
the relevant performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the 
number of options expected to vest. The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to 
present value. The Company revises its estimates of the nu mber of options that are expected to vest, including an 
estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised  
in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares. No new 
shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA. During the year, all exercises were satisfied by 
using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees’ Benefit Trust. The Trust is accounted for as a 
separate entity and therefore is only accounted for in the consolidated financial statements. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.

 Two (2016: two) Directors of ITV plc were employees of the Company during the year, one of whom remains employed 
at the year end. The costs relating to these Dire ctors are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.  
Share-based payments 
The weighted average share price of share options exercised during the year was 44.87p (2016: 55.33p). The options 
outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of nil to 206.83p (2016: nil to 206.83p) and a weighted 
average contractual life of two years (2016: one year) for all the schemes in place for the Group.

 The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed on page 188. The carrying value at 31 December 2017 was £2,191 million 
(2016: £1,861 million). 
In 2017, the Company increased investment in subsidiaries by £330 million mainly due to subscribing to preference 
shares in a newly formed subsidiary in Ireland, North America Studio Investments Designated Activity Company. 
Note iii 
Investments 
in subsidiary 
undertakings 
 
 The Company operates an intra-group cash pool policy with certain 100% owned UK subsidiaries. The pool applies  
to bank accounts where there is an unconditional right of set off and involves the daily closing cash position for 
participating subsidiaries whether positive or negative, being cleared to £nil via daily bank transfers to/from ITV plc. 
These daily transactions create a corresponding intercompany creditor or debtor, which can result in significant 
movements in amounts owed to and from subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet.

The Directors manage the Group’s capital structure as disclosed in section 4  
to the consolidated financial statements. Borrowings, cash and derivative  
financial instruments are mainly held by ITV plc and disclosed in these Company 
financial statements. 
Loans and facilities due within one year 
At various periods during the year, the Group drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) to meet short-term 
funding requirements. At 31 December 2017, the Group had drawings of £60 million under the RCF (2016: £nil).  
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was £390 million (2016: £500 million). 
The Group also had an unsecured £161 million Eurobond that matured in January 2017 and had a coupon of 6.125%. 
Loans and loan notes due after one year  
The Group had a £100 million bilateral loan faci lity, which was repaid in full in June 2017. 
The Group has issued the following Eurobonds: 
• A seven-year €600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%, which matures in September 2022; and 
• A seven-year €500 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.0%, which will mature in December 2023. The bond  
issued in December 2016 has been swapped back to sterling using a cross currency interest swap. The resulting  
fixed rate payable is c. 3.5%.

The Company mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest 
rate risk: 
• Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk  
arising from short-term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency; 
• Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the 
sale or purchase of foreign currency at a kn own fixed rate on an agreed future date; and 
• Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the principal and interest coupons  
in a debt instrument from one currency to another. 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain foreign curr ency firm commitments and highly probably cash flows 
where the underlying cash flows are payable within the next tw o to seven years. In order to fix the sterling cash inflows 
and outflows associated with the commitments and intere st payments – which are mainly denominated in AUD or 
euros – the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest swaps for the same 
foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.  
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the 
revaluation loss associated with these contracts. There was no (2016: less than £1 million) ineffectiveness taken to the 
income statement and £17 million cumulative gain (2016: £2 million) recycled to the income statement in the year.  
Cross-currency interest rate swaps 
On issuing the 2023 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfoli o of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which swapped the 
euro principal and fixed rate coupons into sterling. As a result , the Group makes sterling interest payments at a fixed rate.

Note viii 
Equity and 
dividends 
 
Keeping  
it simple 
 ITV plc is a non-trading investment holding company and derives its profits from 
dividends paid by subsidiary companies.  
The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and dividend policy at least 
twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to 
continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities 
to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.  
The dividend policy is influenced by a number of the principal risks as identified  
on pages 50 to 57 that could have a negative impact on the performance of 
the Group. 
In determining the level of dividend in any year, the Directors follow the dividend 
policy and also consider a number of other factors that influence the proposed 
dividend, including: 
• The level of retained distributable reserves in ITV plc the Company; 
• Availability of cash resources (as disclosed in note 4.1 to the consolidated 
financial statements); and 
• Future cash commitments and investment plans, in line with Group’s  
strategic plan.  
Equity 
The retained earnings reserve includes profit after tax for the year of £351 million (2016: £1,475 million), which includes 
dividends of £426 million from subsidiaries in 2017 (2016: £1 ,500 million). Other reserves of £26 million (2016: £28 million) 
relate to share buy-backs in prior periods and foreig n currency translation net of cash flow hedging. 
Dividends 
The Directors of the Company propose a final dividend of 5.28p per share, which equates to a full year dividend of  
7.8p per share. 
Distributable reserves 
The distributable reserves of ITV plc approximate to the balance of the retained earnings reserve of £1,571 million 
(2016: £1,702 million) as at 31 December 2017.  
Note ix 
Contingent 
liabilities 
 
Keeping  
it simple 
 A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify  
for recognition as a provision where uncertainty may exist regarding the  
outcome of future events. 
Under a Group registration, the Company is jointly and severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2017 of £45 million  
(31 December 2016: £47 million). The Company has guaranteed certain finance and operating lease obligations of 
subsidiary undertakings. 
Financial Statements
186 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017   
 
187 
 
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litiga tion and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect  
of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses. None of these items are expected to have  
a material effect on the Company’s results or financial position. 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies 
within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a cont ingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. 
There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2017 (2016: none).
