Strategic report Performance
I am pleased to report strong financial results from Softcat 
in 2017 against a background of mixed performance in 
the IT reseller market. Growth in gross profit, our primary 
measure of income, was 12.9% to £136.3m and adjusted 
operating profit increased by 10.1% to reach £51.5m. 
Revenue growth was especially strong at 23.8% with 
software, hardware and services all delivering double-digit 
growth. The Company has made significant investments 
in new sales, services and technical resource over the 
past two years and the return on those investments is 
evident in our performance. More information on how we 
performed can be found in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
and Financial Review on pages 7 to 10 and 22 to 23.
Board
We announced in May 2017 that our Chief Executive, 
Martin Hellawell, had decided to step down once his 
successor is in place. Since the announcement, the 
Nomination Committee has been focussed on finding 
a successor with the appropriate energy and passion to 
drive the Company through its next stage of development. 
The search is progressing and, once his successor is 
in place, the Board intends to appoint Martin as Non-Executive 
Chairman at which time I will retire from the Board. I am 
confident that these plans will ensure a very orderly 
transition in due course. Details of the search are set out 
on page 43.
I would like to thank Martin for the exemplary leadership 
role he has played in driving the business forward over the 
past eleven years. Softcat has achieved exceptional growth 
during Martin’s tenure. The start of Martin’s tenure as Chairman 
will open a new chapter and I am very confident that the 
Company will perform strongly in the years ahead. The 
Board’s focus will be on supporting both Martin and the 
new Chief Executive in their new roles for the benefit of 
the Company and shareholders alike. For my own part, it 
has been a privilege to chair Softcat through its IPO in 2015.
Shareholder returns
Our dividend policy remains a progressive one which targets 
an annual dividend of between 40% and 50% of the Company’s 
profits after tax in each financial year before any exceptional 
items. Subject to any cash requirements for ongoing investment, 
the Board will consider returning excess cash to 
shareholders over time. 
We recommend a final dividend of 6.1p, taking the total 
dividend to 9p per ordinary share. In addition, we recommend 
a special dividend of 13.5p per ordinary share is paid at 
the same time as the final dividend. Shareholders will be 
asked to approve the final and special dividends at the 
AGM on 8 December 2017.
Looking ahead
People and succession planning will remain one of the Board’s 
key priorities, alongside the development of strategy and its 
execution. Much of our focus will be on supporting the 
leadership team through the next chapter of growth for the 
benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, 
the business is in a confident mood and its relentless 
focus on customer service and employee engagement 
provides good grounds for optimism going forward. 
Our success this year would not have been possible 
without the passion and commitment of our outstanding 
employees. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
everyone across the Company for their contribution in 
making this a successful year for Softcat. I have always 
found our people to be committed, positive and dedicated 
to our customers. Each and every one shows huge pride 
in working for this unique business, and I would like 
to extend our gratitude to them all.

Business can be complicated; we strive to make it less so.
OUR GOAL: 
To be the leading IT infrastructure provider in terms of employee

DEVELOP OFFERING BUILD SCALE
WIN NEW CUSTOMERS
In 2017 customer numbers grew organically 
for the tenth year in succession, but we still 
only serve around one in five from  
our target markets.
Our ability to develop new capabilities and 
quickly form strong relationships with 
innovative vendors is second to none.
An expanding branch network, growing 
recruitment capacity and flourishing service

OUTSTANDING  
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6 Overall how would you describe the  
performance of the Company last year?
I think we had a very satisfactory financial year 2017 
and I am pleased with the outcome.
Revenue growth was really strong at 24%. I’m always 
most interested in our gross profit growth and that was 
equally pleasing for me, being up 13% despite last year 
containing a one-off benefit that we knew would not 
repeat. So, excluding that, in underlying terms growth in 
gross profit was 16%. Our growth would indicate that once 
again we have taken further market share in our sector.
The gross profit growth resulted in 10% adjusted EBIT 
growth (16% underlying, i.e. excluding the 2016 one-off 
procurement-related profit benefit), while we continue 
to invest in new capabilities. That, combined with another 
year of strong cash generation, resulted in the special 
dividend we’ve proposed alongside these results.
But time doesn’t stand still and we are now focused 
on the opportunity to do it all again in 2018. 
Did any technology area or business line 
particularly stand out for you in 2017?
All our major business lines showed good growth in the 
year. Our security and services businesses were perhaps 
the two standout performers, delivering very strong growth.
Our security business has been one of our key strengths 
for many years now. We saw strong underlying growth in 
this area, which was further assisted by purchases related 
to organisations preparing themselves for General Data 
Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) compliance, which will be 
enforced from 25 May 2018. This is a significant challenge 
for the majority of our customers and there is a lot more 
work required in this area, which is therefore a good 
opportunity for us moving forward. General security risks 
continue to grow in complexity and frequency and are 
now a major boardroom priority, highlighted by high profile 
events like the WannaCry attacks. Softcat was particularly 
proactive in advising and assisting customers on these 
types of threats.
We have invested significantly in our own services 
capability and we continue to work with a number of third 
party organisations to complement our internal offering. 
Particularly in areas such as hybrid cloud migration and 
mobility, in many cases customers are looking to Softcat 
to provide a complete solution rather than trying to stitch 
various technology components together themselves. 
We completed a large number of projects in these areas 
using tried and tested expertise and templates.
OUR COMPANY WORD OF THE YEAR 
FOR 2018 IS OPPORTUNITY
Chief Executive’s statement
I’m delighted by how the 
Company has performed 
in 2017, and our momentum 
into the new financial year 
is strong.
Q&A
with Martin Hellawell
Chief Executive
Strategic report
7 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s statement continued 
Y ou have six branches now; how did they each perform?
Yes, that’s right; we have branches in Marlow, London, 
Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol but have also 
recently announced that we intend to open a seventh location 
on the South Coast in the first half of this new financial year. 
All existing branches met expectations and achieved 
positive growth. For me the standout performers were 
Manchester and London. We very much enjoyed our first 
full financial year in Scotland and are delighted with the 
number of new Scottish customers who are trading with 
Softcat since we became established there.
What about the markets you serve?
The SMB and mid-market remains our largest segment 
and, despite our market leadership position, continues 
to grow very nicely from a very large base. Our public 
sector business saw very strong growth again this year 
and the enterprise segment also outpaced overall Company 
growth and it’s pleasing to see us tapping into that opportunity. 
The vast majority of our business is in the UK but we assist 
an increasing number of our customers with their 
requirements outside the UK.
How have you performed against  
your business model this year?
In essence, our business model begins by recruiting large 
numbers of new employees into the organisation to help 
support and further augment our growth. Most sales 
people join straight from university or at early stages of 
their career. This has been supplemented by a successful 
apprenticeship scheme which has been recognised with 
a number of awards this year. We take more experienced 
people into the organisation for other positions, notably 
in services. Finding the right people to join the Company 
is never easy and perhaps our biggest challenge as a 
business, but we had another excellent year of recruiting 
excellent new talent into the organisation.
Once in the organisation, we strive to be a great place to 
work and to fully motivate our employees. While we are 
well known for this and have received many accolades 
over the years, we are far from complacent and as the 
business gets bigger the employee engagement challenge 
doesn’t become any easier. Last year in our annual employee 
engagement survey we recorded our highest ever employee 
net promoter scores and our score for personal morale was 
exceptionally high, and opportunities for training and 
development is our most improved area over the last 
five years.
If we employ the right people and they are fully engaged 
with the business, we believe our employees will provide 
exceptional customer service. We believe this is the key 
to our success and providing exceptional service is at the 
very heart of our model. Again, we aren’t perfect and know 
that while once again our customer satisfaction survey 
produced outstanding results and our customers continued 
to increase the amount of business they do with Softcat, 
we can still get better and we are very much “on it”, which 
was our Company phrase of the year in 2017 and is the 
theme of this Annual Report.
Which accolades and milestones  
of note have you received this year?
I was delighted Softcat was named as the overall largest 
Microsoft licensing partner in the UK and we also received 
awards from a number of other vendors. These include 
Partner of the Year awards from HPE, Mimecast, Veeam 
and others. 
What is your latest view on  
cloud and how it is affecting you?
It is a very consistent view with what we have been saying 
for the last five years and there are several levels to this. 
We see an increasing proportion of our software licensing 
business transition to a cloud-based platform. For example 
we may previously have sold Microsoft licensing agreements 
for Office which were installed by customers on their sites. 
Today, many customers are choosing to consume Office 
from the cloud with Office 365.

customer  
satisfaction rating
In terms of customers running their own legacy applications 
many have come to the conclusion that they should continue 
running on their own infrastructure, while a preference is 
often given to consuming new applications from the cloud. 
This results in the majority of our customers favouring 
some form of hybrid IT, using some combination of their 
own infrastructure and the cloud.
Some customers may effectively outsource the management 
and possibly ownership of that infrastructure to a third party. 
This is often known as the private cloud and a small part 
of Softcat’s business is running private cloud environments 
for our customers. 
For reasons of control, security, cost and the difficulty of 
porting legacy applications to the cloud, customers’ own 
infrastructure and private cloud infrastructure still has its 
place. Indeed we have seen several instances of customers 
moving back from the public cloud to the private cloud 
environment. Overall, however, we see a continuing trend 
from customers to transition towards the public cloud for 
an increasing number of workloads. Softcat has subsequently 
grown a strong Microsoft Azure business over recent 
years and is working with a number of customers on the 
Amazon AWS platform.
Consequently Softcat sees a growing opportunity to 
develop our services and support business by helping 
customers migrate to a hybrid and public cloud 
environment. We can then work with customers to support 
and manage those environments. This is effectively an 
opportunity to augment our already very large subscription 
licensing business, a part of the business we’ve been well 
known for throughout our history and received many 
plaudits for.
The move to the cloud reduces the hardware opportunity 
as customers need fewer servers and storage as a result. 
But this impact shouldn’t be overly exaggerated as these 
transitions always take longer than anyone predicts and 
the requirement for computer and storage capacity continue 
to increase exponentially as data volumes further expand, 
and with new waves of technology such as artificial 
intelligence this will further accelerate.
As a Company which has evolved from the software world, 
we still have a relatively low market share in the datacentre 
infrastructure business. By helping customers intelligently 
migrate to the hybrid cloud world and by taking share from 
our competition, we believe that we can continue to grow 
our business in this segment despite the changing market. 
That’s exactly what we did very successfully in the last 
financial year. 
In terms of what you do,  
what do you want to be famous for?
We define our business into three broad categories – 
workplace technology, which is all the standard technology 
on or around a customer’s desk; networking and security; 
and cloud and datacentre. All areas are affording us plenty 
of opportunity and we continue to expand our offering in 
each. In the workspace area our managed print offering 
has gained significant traction. Last year we expanded 
our range of extended support services particularly in 
the networking area and this has added considerable 
incremental business and profitability for the Company.
In particular, we want to be the best in cloud and traditional 
subscription software. We want to be the go-to security 
company in the market and the partner of choice for cloud 
and datacentre. There’s plenty to do but we’re well on 
our way.
WE’RE ON IT
Strong performance from our 
new offerings such as 
managed print and contractual 
support services.
Strategic report
9 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s statement continued
And your transition to Chairman? How is that going 
and when will the new Chief Executive be announced?
I haven’t started transitioning to the role of Chairman and I 
am still fully focused and totally committed to being Chief 
Executive of Softcat until a new Chief Executive is on board 
and in place. That will take the time it takes and we are not 
working to any set deadline. That said, the search for the 
new Chief Executive is progressing. I am delighted with the 
way the organisation has responded to the proposed change, 
fully embracing the continuity provided by my transition to 
the Chairman role and the opportunity to kick on under 
new leadership. 
I very much look forward to passing the baton of leading 
Softcat to my successor and to my continued involvement 
as Chairman.
How do you see the opportunity ahead?
While we have performed well for many years now and have 
enjoyed 48 quarters of top-line and bottom-line growth, 
the opportunity ahead of us feels larger than ever. If you 
just take the list of the top 100 VARs in the UK and put our 
turnover against the aggregated total, that gives us c.6.5% 
market share. And there’s a lot more than 100 VARs out 
there. So that gives us at least 93.5% of the market still to 
go for. Our sales force strength and the breadth and depth 
of our capability have never been better and there’s great 
momentum in the Company. Despite questions around the 
economy, our exit from the EU and public sector policy, the 
market for what we do feels quite buoyant. We’re lucky to 
have a very broad portfolio and our customer-centricity 
and flexibility allow us to move quickly to the areas in the 
market where there is most demand, which makes us far 
less vulnerable to more challenging technology segments.
The opportunity is there for the taking but we are well 
aware that only constant hard work, hunger and excellent 
execution will allow us to take it.
We can extend that opportunity by considering further 
geographical expansion both locally and internationally 
and by considering acquisitions. We will continue, as we 
always have done, to consider both extremely carefully 
and cautiously.
I would like to thank our employees for taking the opportunity 
last year and for all their tremendous support, commitment, 
hard work and camaraderie during 2017 and over my last 
eleven years with Softcat. I would also like to thank our very 
valued customers, who continue to be a pleasure to work 
with and who keep pushing us on to ever greater things. 
And finally I would like to thank our business partners, who 
continue to give Softcat a tremendous amount of support 
for which we are extremely grateful.
And to close, Martin, how has  
financial year 2018 started for you?
Our financial year starts on 1 August and as I write this we 
are approximately ten weeks into the new year. It’s very 
early days and there is still all to play for but we are where 
we would like to be at this stage.

tell us that they need our help in modernising their 
infrastructure and understanding how the cloud can 
help them; in doing a better job of delivering devices, 
applications and services to their increasingly mobile 
users; in improving their security in a world where

Our customer relationships
What sets us apart continued
If there’s one single reason why Softcat has delivered such 
strong growth over such a long period of time, it’s the strength 
of our customer relationships.
DELIVERING THE BEST SERVICE
The range of technology offered by Softcat is broad and deep, better 
than most and as good as any. But what really sets us apart is the passion, 
intelligence and integrity with which our people serve their customers. 
Customers know that when they need something from Softcat, we’re on it!
Solution highlights:
Softcat listened to the challenges that the National Gallery 
was facing and suggested solving these issues with a Softcat 
managed print service. The first stage of this was for Softcat 
to perform an audit on the current printing estate at the gallery 
to assess exactly how the current system was being used. 
Softcat found that the gallery was printing over 100,000 
pages a month, a lot more than the customer had thought. 
From this it was clear that the gallery needed a system which 
would allow it to more accurately monitor its printer usage. 
•  Hugely improved printing security
•  Large reduction in help desk requests for printers
•  Dedicated project manager to assist with implementation
•  Continued support from Softcat
The challenge:
The National Gallery needed a new printing, 
photocopying and scanning system due to the 
multiple problems that they were experiencing 
with their existing setup. Printing is a large part of 
the gallery’s business and as such the gallery was 
looking for a partner which could provide a solution 
which solved their problems as well as ensuring 
only minimal disruption.
The gallery’s existing system also had serious security 
issues. There was no way for users to track their 
documents once they were sent to the printer, 
and no way to guarantee that documents would not 
get lost in the system.

Comments
• The employee engagement score is 
derived from responses to an annual 
survey of all staff.
• Enthusiastic, motivated people are at 
the core of the Softcat business model 
and customer proposition.
Comments
• Gross profit per customer is defined 
as gross profit divided by the number 
of customers.
• New customers are included in the 
calculation and tend to create dilution 
of the metric.
• The growth in this metric therefore 
demonstrates the high value of ever 
deepening long-term relationships, 
and the Company’s ability to sell an 
increasing range of technologies 
based on trusted partner status.
Comments
• Customer satisfaction is defined as 
the percentage of customers who rate 
themselves as either ‘satisfied’ or ‘very 
satisfied’ in response to an annual survey 
(possible responses also include ‘dissatisfied’ 
and ‘very dissatisfied’). In 2017 the survey 
had 1,199 respondents (2016: 1,078).
• Maintenance of a very high result in this 
metric is central to our business model.
Comments
• Customer numbers are defined as the 
total number of unique entities that 
traded with Softcat during the period.
• Growth in this metric demonstrates the 
ability of the sales force to win new 
customers while also retaining 
existing relationships.
• Growth in customer numbers therefore 
underpins future growth as well as 
contributing to in-year performance.

21 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Revenue and gross profit
Revenue growth was very strong at 23.8%, rising to 
£832.5m (2016: £672.4m). This reflects good progress 
across all customer segments with public sector business 
once again expanding fastest and rising as a proportion 
of total income to 31% (2016: 29%). Public sector revenue 
performance was boosted by the signing of a large central 
government, low margin deal during the first half worth 
up to £40m over three years, with £14m of income booked 
during 2017. Revenue growth was also very strong across 
the corporate sector by virtue of both new customer wins 
and cross-selling new products to existing customers. 
Revenue mix across technology categories (software, 
hardware and services) was largely unchanged. Services 
expanded slightly as a proportion of the total to 15.6% 
(2016: 15.1%) due to good growth from both the expansion 
of in-house professional service capacity as well as the 
introduction of new vendor support services.
Gross profit grew strongly, up 12.9% to £136.3m 
(2016: £120.7m). Prior year gross profit includes the 
impact of £3.4m non-recurring procurement savings 
within cost of sales. Excluding this impact, gross profit 
grew in 2017 by 16.2% (2016: 14.1%). This acceleration in 
underlying growth reflects further gains in market share 
and pleasing returns on investment in sales and technical 
capabilities over the past 18 months.
Gross profit margin was down during the year from 18.0% 
to 16.4% due to the following key factors:
• non-recurring impact of procurement savings in 2016 
(0.5% pts);
• large low margin central government contract in H1 2017 
(0.3% pts);
• partial impact on Softcat margin from currency-induced 
vendor price rises (0.5% pts); and
• other (0.3% pts).
Customer KPIs
Customer numbers were up 6.0% to 13.0k (2016: 12.2k) 
reflecting the continued efforts of both new hires and 
existing account managers to expand our reach.
Perhaps even more pleasing, gross profit per customer rose 
6.5% (2016: 9.2%), or 9.6% (2016: 6.2%) on an underlying 
basis (excluding the 2016 procurement benefit). This 
acceleration in underlying gross profit per customer 
growth bears close correlation with the Company’s 
ability to cross-sell new product lines to existing 
customers and increase share of wallet. 
DELIVERING GROWTH 
AND INVESTING IN  
NEW CAPABILITIES
Our financial goals are focused 
on the delivery of sustainable, 
profitable growth and cash 
conversion to drive superior 
long-term shareholder return.

Adjusted operating profit
23.8%
Revenue growth
22 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Revenue remains well dispersed across the customer 
base, with the largest customer accounting for less than 
2% of total income.
Operating profit
Operating profit of £50.2m (2016: £42.2m) is 18.9% up due to 
both the growth in adjusted operating profit (see below) and 
the exceptional costs in the prior year related to the IPO.
Adjusted operating profit and operating margin
Adjusted operating profit increased by 10.1% to £51.5m. 
Excluding the impact of the 2016 procurement upside, 
adjusted operating profit grew by 16.4% referred to as 
underlying adjusted operating profit growth. This is a 
strong result in the context of significant investments in the 
form of new graduate account managers as well as 
services and technical staff. 
On an underlying basis, and despite these investments, 
the margin of adjusted operating profit to gross profit 
increased marginally from 37.7% to 37.8%.
Adjusted operating profit margin to sales of 6.2% (2016: 7.0%) 
fell on the back of the gross margin reduction, detailed above. 
Corporation tax charge
The effective tax rate for 2017 fell to 20.3% (2016: 21.8%), 
due mainly to the absence from the current period of the 
non-deductible expenses related to the IPO recognised 
in 2016.
Cash and balance sheet
Cash conversion (defined on page 20) was again strong 
at 97.2% (2016: 85.5%), reflecting the ongoing close 
management of working capital balances as the business 
continues to grow. 
The broad composition of the balance sheet is unchanged, 
reflecting the simple and efficient business model. The 
value of stock is minimal due to the close operational 
partnership with distributors and the value of inventory 
recognised at year end mainly reflects goods in transit.
The Company’s closing cash balance of £61.6m was only 
slightly down on the prior year figure of £62.4m, having 
been replenished by the results of operations following 
the payment of £40.9m dividends during the year.
Dividend
A final dividend of 6.1p per share has been recommended 
by the Directors and if approved by shareholders will be 
paid on 15 December 2017. The record date will be 
3 November and the shares will trade ex-dividend 
on 2 November.
In line with the Company’s stated intention to return excess 
cash to shareholders over time, a further special dividend 
payment of 13.5p per share has been proposed. If approved 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM this would also be 
paid alongside the final dividend in December 2017, and 
would bring total cash returned to shareholders in the two 
years since IPO to £83m.

23 Principal risks
RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach
The Board has identified the 
risks facing the Company and 
considered the likely impact that 
each could have on the business. 
This has enabled the Board to 
target risks on a prioritised basis.
Ownership for each risk has been 
assigned to a member of the senior 
management team based upon 
alignment with operational duties. 
Risk owners take responsibility 
for designing appropriate internal 
controls and policies to mitigate 
the likelihood and potential 
impact of the risk materialising.
A risk register is maintained which 
captures the assessment of each 
risk together with existing controls 
and further actions in progress. 
The risk register is reviewed 
periodically by both the Board 
and the senior management team 
to ensure it remains current as the 
business and its markets evolve, 
and that controls remain effective 
and actions are progressed. Our 
risk profile remained stable during 
the year, with no changes from 
FY16. An outsourced internal audit 
function has been established 
to support and enhance the 
Company’s management 
of principal risks.
Consideration of the risk profile 
is factored into strategic planning 
and annual budgeting.
The impact of Brexit
The ongoing process and 
negotiations to deliver the result 
of the 2016 referendum and take 
Britain out of the EU (‘Brexit’) 
has increased the level of 
macroeconomic uncertainty. 
However, at the present time the 
Board does not consider Brexit to 
be a principal risk to the business 
model, but will continue to monitor 
and revaluate this risk as necessary.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board has established mechanisms to identify, evaluate and 
manage risks with the aim of protecting its employees, customers 
and partners and safeguarding the interests of the Company 
and its shareholders.

Corporate social responsibility
HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE 
ENVIRONMENT
Supporting charities and raising money for such causes is an 
integral part of life at Softcat. We have a designated charities 
team which has been formally operating for almost a decade. 
Charities are chosen by our employees and, where possible, 
for causes staff have existing relationships with or are closely 
connected to or affected by. We strive to get as many people 
involved in our charity work as possible, employees as well 
as customers and suppliers, in order to fulfil what we see as 
a central part of our corporate responsibility. We believe it 
is important to promote awareness of worthy causes, as well 
as hardship, and to show how individuals and teams may come 
together to do something notable for the greater good.
Softcat’s charity work to date has helped to raise over £1.7m, 
as well as providing assistance for our chosen charities. In 2017 
alone, Company and employee initiatives have enabled us to 
raise £210,000. As a Company, we have also benefited from 
these programmes as they continue to help increase employee 
engagement, satisfaction and development through the endless 
activities our employees lead, encouraged and supported by 
the Company. 
We support a large array of charities, large and small, national 
and local. Tuberous Sclerosis Association, The Prince’s Trust, 
Comic Relief and Children in Need have all benefited from 
our charitable activities to date. 
For the last five years we have worked particularly closely with 
Dreams Come True, raising a total of £1.2m over this timeframe. 
We are very proud to have helped children and young people 
with serious or life-limiting conditions fulfil their dreams. This year, 
Softcat has also supported Wycombe Homeless Connection. In 
addition, we support focus events for organisations such as 
Comic Relief, for which we have acted as a contact centre for 
the last four years, on top of other fundraising activities for this cause. 
These events promote team building and unity within Softcat, 
alongside the primary goal of helping those less fortunate 
than ourselves.
We take our social responsibility seriously, particularly in the areas 
of charitable activity, minimising our environmental impact and 
looking after our employees.

In each of the Softcat offices we have a group of volunteers 
who care for the environment; we call them the Green Team. 
The Green Team works together to raise employee awareness 
around environmental issues. 
Decisions at Softcat are influenced by our care and passion 
for the environment. We use video conferencing whenever 
possible to reduce travel. If employees need to travel, Softcat 
offers eco-friendlier travel options including a cycle to work 
scheme or the use of one of our low emission pool cars. 
All of our offices are also within one mile of a train station 
so employees can use public transport. 
Around the office the Green Team has been making positive 
environmental changes. In the current financial year we have 
installed a new managed print solution reducing waste. This has 
saved 50,165 sheets of paper or the equivalent of three trees. 
The managed print solution also recycles used ink cartridges 
increasing our impressive recycling portfolio of paper, cans, 
plastic, obsolete computer equipment and food waste, which we 
compost at our Marlow office. Softcat offices use energy-saving 
technology, such as energy-efficient lighting which automatically 
shuts off when not being used and thin clients rather than 
energy-hungry desktops. All our offices are ISO 14001 and 
ISO 50001 certified.
GHG emissions
Our emissions have been calculated using the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), 
together with the latest emission factors from DEFRA and DECC.

Corporate social responsibility continued
We are extremely passionate about employee satisfaction 
and endeavour to provide a supportive and encouraging 
working environment for all employees across all of our offices. 
The Company provides an extensive array of benefits including 
weekly on-site doctor visits, a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’), as well 
as many social and sporting activities. Likewise, we believe 
in the importance of inspiring our employees to give their best; 
therefore, everyone is given the chance to qualify for our amazing 
incentives. We believe hard work should reap extra rewards. 
Additionally, Softcat strives to support employees in all aspects 
of life, both inside and outside of the workplace. 
Softcat provides exceptional and ongoing training and development 
opportunities. We have developed bespoke training for many 
roles to help employees to identify and realise their aspirations, 
to provide our staff with opportunities to enhance their skills 
and advance their qualifications. Furthermore, we have strong 
feedback mechanisms in place for employees on their 
performance, as well as frequent communication between 
employees and the senior team.
Our recognition as the Great Place to Work ‘Best Large 
Workplace’ 2017 is an achievement that demonstrates 
what a unique place Softcat is to work.
We are mindful that human rights risks can arise within our 
business and supply chain, including labour risks, unsafe work 
place conditions and bribery and corruption. Our code of conduct, 
which is applicable to all employees and those who work for or 
on behalf of Softcat, sets out the standard of behaviour expected 
in relation to human rights risks, bribery and raising concerns 
through the whistleblowing process. We have also published 
a Modern Slavery Statement which is available on our website, 
softcat.com.

We remain committed to gender diversity and to providing 
equal opportunities by recruiting and promoting staff on the 
basis of their experience, skills, attitude and qualifications. 
Additionally, we acknowledge the recommendation from 
the Hampton-Alexander Review targeting 33% representation 
of women on FTSE 350 boards by 2020. Softcat recognises 
the benefits to be gained from having a diverse workforce 
throughout the organisation including at Board level. Diversity 
in its many forms, including, but not limited to, the skills, industry 
experience, race, ethnicity and gender of the workforce, will 
enable the Company to maintain its competitive advantage. 
We recognise that gender diversity within the IT industry, 
and in particular sales within IT, has not been ideal historically, 
and this is indeed reflected in our numbers above. We are 
therefore especially focused on working with the industry to 
improve this position and ensure that Softcat is not missing 
valuable sources of talent.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
30 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 I am pleased to confirm 
that your Company has 
complied in full with the 
2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Brian Wallace, Chairman
31 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to confirm that your Company has complied in 
full with the principles and provisions of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) during the year.
2017 has been a very busy year for the Company. We are pleased 
that the Company continued to perform well with strong profit 
growth and cash generation. In his overview, our Chief Executive, 
Martin Hellawell, explains both the reasons for this outperformance 
and also the actions that the leadership team is taking to capitalise 
on the opportunities ahead.
Changes to the Board
We announced in May 2017 that Martin had decided to step down 
as Chief Executive once his successor is in place. Following that 
announcement the Nomination Committee initiated a search for a 
new Chief Executive which is ongoing. Once his successor is in 
place, the Board intends to appoint Martin as Non-Executive 
Chairman and I will retire from the Board. Details of the search 
are set out on page 43. Martin will not be independent on 
appointment as Chairman. When deciding on his appointment, 
the Board recognised that the Code states that the Chairman 
should on appointment meet the independence criteria set out 
in the Code and that ordinarily the Chief Executive should not go 
on to be the Chairman. The Board’s intention to appoint Martin 
as Non-Executive Chairman was discussed at that time with 
a number of the Company’s largest shareholders.
I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board for their continued 
support, commitment, challenge and passion for our business.
Board effectiveness
I am in frequent and open contact with Martin and the rest of 
the Board, and I aim to ensure that at all times the Board fully 
understands how the business is operating and any risks or 
challenges in our future. Our programme of Board visits to 
Softcat regional offices has continued in 2017, including visits 
to our London and Bristol offices. These visits help to enhance 
the Board’s understanding of business operations as well as 
providing an opportunity for Directors to have an open question 
and answer session with employees. This has been particularly 
helpful this year as it has allowed us a clear view of how well 
our strategy is translating into the day-to-day activities of the 
business as a whole.
On 10 July 2017, I held my annual scheduled meeting with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the executive management 
present. Our discussions focused on succession planning and 
Board composition and, linked to that, the culture of the Board 
and our priorities for 2018. 
We evaluated the performance of the Board for the first time 
this year. I led the process which is described on page 36. 
I am pleased to report that the outcome of the evaluation 
was positive and confirmed that the Board and Committees 
are operating effectively. Particular strengths identified were 
the relationship between Directors and senior management, 
the quality of information supplied to the Board and the open 
and constructive atmosphere in Board meetings. 
Risk management 
Risk management and in particular the principal risks faced by 
the Company are key elements of the Board’s ongoing agenda. 
Our IT governance and security was strengthened during the 
year following a thorough risk assessment of information security. 
Details of our principal risks and uncertainties and how we manage 
and mitigate these risks are set out on pages 24 and 25.
Listening to our shareholders
Effective communication with our shareholders is fundamental 
to our success. We strive to communicate our strategy and 
activities clearly to all our shareholders. We also welcome active 
engagement with all of our shareholders to answer their questions 
and receive their feedback. Further details of our approach to 
shareholder engagement can be found on page 37.

GOVERNANCE AND RISK
WHAT THE BOARD DID THIS YEAR
EFFECTIVENESS 36 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Board recognises that it continually needs to monitor and improve its performance. This is achieved through  
annual performance evaluation, full induction of new Board members and ongoing Board development activities.
This year, the Board carried out an internal evaluation of its performance, its Committees and individual Directors. 
An external evaluation of the Board’s performance will be conducted in 2018.
COMPREHENSIVE 
QUESTIONNAIRE
Each Director completed a confidential 
online questionnaire, designed by 
the Company Secretary. Each Board 
Committee undertook a specific 
self-assessment questionnaire. 
The process was overseen by the 
Nomination Committee, assisted 
by the Company Secretary.
STAGE 1 STAGE 2
EVALUATION
The Chairman reviewed the 
Directors’ contributions and the 
Senior Independent Director led 
the review of the performance 
of the Chairman.
REPORTING AND DISCUSSION 
WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND  
THE BOARD
A report was prepared based 
on the completed questionnaires. 
The Chairman led the discussion 
of the report with the Nomination 
Committee and the Board at its 
meeting in July 2017. 
STAGE 3
Board development 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Non-Executive 
Directors receive ongoing training and development. Our 
Non-Executive Directors are conscious of the need to keep 
themselves properly briefed and informed about current issues.
Topics covered at sessions attended by our Directors during 
the year included cyber security, bribery and ethics update, 
modern slavery and share dealing rules. Specific and tailored 
updates, delivered by the Company’s external auditor, were also 
provided to the members of our Audit Committee during the year 
covering key themes surrounding financial and narrative 
reporting, and accounting and auditing standards. 
Regular updates on regulatory and legislative developments 
are provided to the Board by the Company Secretary.
There is a procedure to enable Directors to take independent 
legal and/or financial advice at the Company’s expense, managed 
by the Company Secretary. No such independent advice was 
sought in 2017.
The Company Secretary also:
• assists the Chairman by organising induction and 
training programmes and ensuring that all Directors 
have full and timely access to all relevant information;
• ensures that the correct Board procedures are 
followed; and
• advises the Board on corporate governance matters.
The removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole.
Conclusions from the 2017 review
The conclusions of this year’s review have been positive 
and have confirmed that the Board and its Committees operate 
effectively and that each Director contributes to the overall 
effectiveness and success of the Company. 
The main points arising from this year’s review included: 
• Strategy: The Company’s strategy was rated highly. 
Continued support would be given to the CEO and senior 
management team to seamlessly execute our strategy 
particularly in view of the upcoming changes to the Board.
• Risk: Whilst the Board noted the progress which had 
been made in developing the Company’s risk management 
process, it was agreed that this process would continue 
to be developed, overseen by the Audit Committee.
• Board changes and succession: The Board would continue 
to support the further development of talent and succession 
planning. Directors would also continue to take the opportunity 
to regularly meet with the broader management team.
• Shareholder views: The Board would continue to develop 
its approach to its interaction with the Company’s shareholders. 
The Board will address these matters during the 2018 
financial year and will report on progress in our 2018 
Annual Report.

Corporate governance
We hold analyst and investor 
meetings and presentations 
following the release of our annual 
and half-year announcements. 
We aim to ensure that all questions 
are comprehensively dealt with at 
these meetings. We also ensure 
that the presentations are available 
on our website.
ANALYST AND INVESTOR 
MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS
Throughout the year, numerous 
meetings and conference calls 
were held with existing and 
potential shareholders. These 
meetings were attended by either 
the Chief Executive or the Chief 
Financial Officer or sometimes both. 
The meetings focus primarily on 
trading operations and the 
implementation of our business 
strategy. Any significant views 
expressed are recorded and 
reported to the Board to keep 
them up to date with shareholder 
and investor sentiment.
OTHER SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
The 2017 Annual General Meeting 
will be held on 8 December at 
Softcat plc, Fieldhouse Lane, 
Marlow SL7 1LW. Details of the 
meeting and the resolutions to 
be proposed are set out in the 
Notice of AGM which is available 
to download on our website (www.
softcat.com/investors). The Annual 
General Meeting gives shareholders, 
in particular our private shareholders, 
an opportunity to hear about the 
general development of the 
business and to ask questions 
to the Board.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Board development continued
As there have been no new appointments to the Board during 
the year, we have not had to deliver an induction programme. 
Our approach to induction, led by the Chairman with support 
from the Company Secretary, remains to ensure that we provide 
a comprehensive introduction to Softcat as a whole, focusing 
on the practical delivery of information rather than just supplying 
reading materials and providing new Directors with the opportunity 
to meet with the Company’s key stakeholders.
A full and tailored induction is being developed for the new 
Chief Executive. Full details of this induction will be disclosed 
in our 2018 Annual Report.
Independence and conflicts
The Board, excluding me as Chairman, is currently comprised 
of three Independent Non-Executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors and we therefore comply with the 
independence requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The independence of our Non-Executive Directors is 
reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee (described in the 
Nomination Committee’s report on page 44). Their independence 
could be impinged where a Director has a conflict of interest, 
and the Board therefore operates procedures to identify and 
manage situations where such a conflict could arise. An element 
of the procedure operates to restrict a Director from voting 
on any matter in which they have a material personal interest 
unless the Board unanimously decides otherwise, and where 
necessary, Directors are required to absent themselves from a 
meeting of the Board while such matters are being discussed.
During the year, all Directors confirmed (as they are required to 
do annually) that they have been able to allocate sufficient time 
to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Directors are also 
required to notify me and the Board of any alterations to their 
external commitments that arise during the year with an 
indication of the time commitment involved.
We are committed to proactive and constructive engagement 
with shareholders and recognise the important and valuable 
role that shareholders play in safeguarding the Company’s 
governance. The Board received regular updates during 
the year on the views of our shareholders through briefings 
and reports from our interaction with shareholders and 
from our brokers. 
In the event that shareholders have any concerns, which the 
normal channels of communication to the Chief Executive 
or the Chief Financial Officer have failed to resolve or for 
which contact is inappropriate, our Chairman or Senior 
Independent Director are available to address them. Both 
make themselves available, when requested, for meetings 
with shareholders on issues relating to the Company’s 
governance and strategy.
The Board’s intention to appoint Martin Hellawell as 
Non-Executive Chairman was discussed with a number 
of the Company’s largest shareholders and shareholder 
feedback provided to the Board. The Board and Committees 
also receive correspondence from shareholders, institutional 
investors and proxy voting agencies, typically in the lead up 
to the AGM.

the framework for the Committee’s work in the year and can 
be summarised as providing oversight of the:
• appropriateness of the Company’s external financial reporting;
• relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor;
• Company’s system of internal control, including risk 
management framework and the work of the internal 
audit function; and
• Company’s system of compliance activities.
Membership
The membership of the Committee has been selected with the 
aim of providing the range of financial and commercial expertise 
necessary to meet its responsibilities. Given my experience, 
I continue to be designated as the financial expert on the 
Committee for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. In order to ensure that the Committee continues to have 
experience and knowledge relevant to the sector in which Softcat 
operates, all of the Non-Executive Directors receive regular updates 
on business, regulatory, financial reporting and accounting matters. 
An independent evaluation of the Committee’s performance will 
also be carried out every three years, with the first evaluation 
in 2018. There were no changes to the membership of the 
Committee during the year, all of whom are Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company.

How the Committee operates
The Committee met three times during the year and each meeting 
had full attendance. Meetings of the Committee generally take 
place on the same day as the Board meeting to maximise the 
efficiency of interaction with the Board and I report to the Board, 
as a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee 
and matters of particular relevance to the Board in the conduct 
of its work.
The external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’), is invited to each 
meeting together with the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary.
The Committee also meets separately with each of EY and 
the Chief Financial Officer without others being present.
Financial reporting
The Committee’s primary responsibility in relation to the Company’s 
financial reporting is to review with both management and the 
external auditor the appropriateness of the half-year and annual 
financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
• the quality and acceptability of accounting policies 
and practices;
• material areas in which significant judgements have been 
applied or where significant issues have been discussed 
with the external auditor;
• the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements, including the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code;
• any correspondence from regulators in relation to our 
financial reporting; and
• an assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy. This assessment forms the basis of the advice given 
to the Board to assist them in making the statement required 
by the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code.
Accounting policies and practices
The Committee received reports from management in relation 
to the identification of critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty, significant accounting policies 
and proposed disclosure of these in the 2017 Annual Report. 
The disclosures also addressed IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases, both of which may have an 
effect on the Company’s accounting when adopted.
Following discussions with management and the external 
auditor, the Committee approved these critical accounting 
judgements, significant accounting policies and disclosures 
which are set out in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the 
financial statements.
Regulators and our financial reporting
The FRC’s Audit Quality Review team (‘AQR’) carried out a review 
of the audit of our financial reporting for 2016 financial year. The 
AQR engaged with the Committee during the review process. 
There were no significant findings resulting from the review.
The Committee is committed to improving the effectiveness and 
clarity of the Company’s corporate reporting and has continued 
to encourage management to consider, and adopt where 
appropriate, initiatives by regulatory bodies which would 
enhance our reporting.
Significant judgements and issues
The significant areas of focus considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation to the 2017 Annual Report are outlined below.
We discussed these with the external auditor during the year and, where appropriate, these have been addressed as areas of audit 
focus as outlined in the Independent Auditors Report on pages 66 to 71.
Matter considered Action
Inappropriate revenue recognition: misstatement of revenue 
recognised at or near year end
The Committee has reviewed the Company’s revenue recognition 
policy and discussed in detail with management and members 
of the finance team the processes applied to accurately record 
revenue at period ends. The Committee also receives detailed 
monthly reporting on business performance to include revenue 
recognition data and trends. The Committee discusses the 
performance and data trends regularly with the Chief Financial 
Officer. The Committee has concluded that the timing of 
recognition is in line with current IFRS requirements.
Misstatement of rebate income The Committee has taken steps to understand the nature and 
quantum of supplier rebates received by the Company. The 
Committee receives management information on rebates accrued 
as part of monthly performance reporting and monitors trends 
against prior period results. Rebates, and the process to accrue 
rebates, have been the subject of internal audit review during 
the year. The Committee is satisfied with the Company’s ability 
to accurately record rebates earned within the financial period. 40 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other matters
The Committee also undertook a range of further activities 
in relation to the Company’s accounting and external reporting 
in the year:
Recent accounting developments
The Committee received regular reporting from management on the 
Company’s implementation of the following accounting standards:
• The new revenue recognition standard – IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers – which would be effective 
for FY19.
• The new lease accounting standard – IFRS 16 Leases – 
which would be effective for FY20 and requires lessees 
to recognise assets and liabilities for most leases.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The processes and controls that underpin the Committee’s 
assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy include ensuring that:
• all contributors are fully briefed on the fair, balanced 
and understandable requirement;
• an experienced core team is responsible for the co-ordination 
of content submissions, verification, detailed review and challenge;
• senior management confirms that the content in respect 
of their areas of responsibility is considered to be fair, 
balanced and understandable; and 
• the Committee receives an early draft of the Annual Report 
to enable timely review and comment.
These processes allowed us to provide positive assurance 
to the Board to assist them in making the statement required 
by the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code.
Going concern and viability statement 
The Committee received a report on the Company’s viability 
statement. This report enabled the Committee to evaluate a 
stress test of the Company’s three-year profit and loss, balance 
sheet and cash flow plan against the impact of key risks selected 
from the risk register. The strength of the Company’s balance sheet 
was comfortably able to absorb the impact of the stress test. 
Accordingly, the Committee has considered and recommended 
to the Board the viability statement which seeks to examine 
the Company’s longer-term solvency and viability, and which is 
detailed on page 65. It was agreed that three years continued 
to be an appropriate timeframe on which to base the long-term 
viability statement as it is in line with the strategic planning 
process undertaken by the Company and reflects the pace 
of change in the technology sector.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing 
the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. 
This includes making the recommendation on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing 
their independence on an ongoing basis and for negotiating 
the audit fee.
Auditor appointment
EY was appointed as the Company’s external auditor in July 2013 
following an audit tender. The Company will be required to put 
the external audit contract out to tender by 2023. In addition, 
EY will be required to rotate the audit partner responsible for 
the Company audit every five years and, as a result, the current 
lead audit partner will be required to change in 2018. Dave Hales 
replaces Karl Havers as the lead audit partner for the financial 
year commencing 1 August 2017.
The Committee continues to review the auditor appointment and 
the need to tender the audit, ensuring the Company’s compliance 
with reforms of the audit market by the UK Competition and 
Markets Authority. Accordingly, the Company confirms that it 
complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets 
Authority’s Order for the financial year under review. For the 
financial year ending 31 July 2018, the Committee has recommended 
to the Board that EY be reappointed under the current external 
audit contract and the Directors will be proposing the reappointment 
of EY at the Annual General Meeting in December 2017.
Audit risk
At the start of the audit cycle we received from EY a detailed 
audit plan identifying their audit scope, planning materiality 
and their assessment of key risks.
The audit risk identification process is considered a key factor 
in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process, and 
the key risks for the 2017 financial year were as follows:
• inappropriate revenue recognition; and 
• misstatement of rebate income.
These risks are regularly reviewed by the Committee to ensure 
the external auditor’s areas of audit focus remain appropriate.
Working with the auditor
We hold private meetings with the external auditor to provide 
additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditor without management being present. 
Matters typically discussed include the external auditor’s assessment 
of business risks, the transparency and openness of interactions 
with management, confirmation that there has been no restriction 
in scope placed on them by management, the independence of 
their audit and how they have exercised professional scepticism. 
I also met with the external lead audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process.

Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout 
the year and considered the performance of EY, taking into 
account the Committee’s own assessment, the conclusions of 
the FRC’s AQR team (mentioned on page 39) and the firm-wide 
audit quality inspection report issued by the FRC in June 2017.
Based on this review, the Committee concluded that there had 
been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary areas of 
audit focus from EY.
Independence and objectivity
The Committee has a policy governing the engagement of the 
external auditor to provide non-audit services. This precludes 
EY from providing certain services. The policy can be found at 
softcat.com/investors.
For certain specific permitted services, the Committee has 
preapproved that EY can be engaged by management, subject 
to the policies set out above, and subject to a total 10% of the 
current external audit fee on an annual basis.
For all other services or those permitted services that exceed 
these specified fee limits, I, as Chairman, or in my absence another 
Committee member, can preapprove permitted services.
The Committee also received confirmation from EY that there 
are no relationships between the Company and EY that may 
have a bearing on their independence.
For the 2017 financial year, the Committee considered the ongoing 
fee proposal and, following the receipt of formal assurance that 
their fees were appropriate for the scope of the work required, 
agreed a charge from EY and related member firms of £190,000 
for statutory audit services.
In addition to the statutory audit fee, EY and related member 
firms charged the Company £20,000 for audit-related services 
primarily in connection with the review of the Company’s IFRS 15 
assessment and related disclosures. Further details of the fees 
paid, for audit and non-audit services, to EY for the 2017 and 2016 
financial years can be found in note 3 to the financial statements.
Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight 
of the Company’s system of internal control, including the risk 
management framework and the work of the internal audit function.
Assessment of the Company’s system of internal control, 
including the risk management framework
The Company’s risk assessment process and the way in which 
significant business risks are managed is a key area of focus 
for the Committee. Our activity here was driven primarily by the 
Company’s assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties, 
as set out on pages 24 to 25.
The Company has in place an internal control environment to 
protect the business from the material risks which have been 
identified. Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting 
and we have responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness 
of these controls.
The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness 
of the Company’s system of internal control, including risk 
management, during the year and up to the date of this Annual 
Report, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting published by the FRC.
We confirm that no significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified in the review for the 2017 financial year and allowed 
us to provide positive assurance to the Board to assist them 
in making the statements required by the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Where areas for improvement were identified, 
processes are in place to ensure that the necessary action is 
taken and that progress is monitored.
Internal audit
Monitoring and review of the scope, extent and effectiveness of 
the activity of Grant Thornton LLP (‘Grant Thornton’), the Company’s 
internal auditor, is regularly considered by the Committee. We 
approve the annual audit plan prior to the start of each financial 
year and receive updates from Grant Thornton on audit activities, 
progress against the approved audit plan, the results of any 
unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these areas.

Chief Executive succession
In light of Martin Hellawell’s decision to step down as Chief Executive 
and take on the role of Non-Executive Chairman, the Committee 
considered the skills and experience desired in his successor 
and prepared a candidate profile. The Committee appointed an 
independent search and selection agency, Odgers Berndtson 
(‘Odgers’), to assist in the search for suitable candidates. Odgers 
had no prior connection with the Company. 
The criteria for the selection of the new Chief Executive included: 
• leadership of a business of scale;
• a track record of driving strategic growth; and
• an understanding and appreciation of the Company’s culture 
and values.
The search is ongoing with potential candidates being presented 
to the Committee for their consideration. A further announcement 
on this appointment will be made in due course.
CHAIRMAN SUCCESSION: STATEMENT FROM LEE GINSBERG 
As the Senior Independent Director I led the process of appointing a new Non-Executive Chairman. 
The criteria set by the Board for the role of Chairman included: 
• a strong commitment to shareholder value creation; 
• the ability to command the respect of the Board, shareholders, employees and other key stakeholders, including an ability 
to work effectively with the new Chief Executive; and
• a deep knowledge of the IT and reseller sector.
It was clear to the Board that Martin Hellawell is the outstanding candidate for the role. Martin, who is very highly regarded 
in our sector, will continue to give the Company the benefit of his experience and expertise during this period of change. 
The Board is confident that the transition of roles by both Martin and the new Chief Executive, once appointed, will be effective 
and that the Chief Executive/Chairman relationship will thrive under the new arrangements. 
Under Martin’s tenure Softcat has consistently delivered strong results and he has built a business which is in robust shape with 
great people and a highly motivated corporate culture that celebrates success and drives our growth.
The Board recognises that the UK Corporate Governance Code states that, ordinarily, the chief executive should not go on to 
be the chairman, but that if it does decide to appoint the chief executive as chairman, then the Board should consult shareholders. 
The decision to appoint Martin as Non-Executive Chairman has been discussed with a number of the Company’s largest shareholders 
and reflects the Board’s strong view that, in addition to the leadership role Martin has played in driving the business forward, 
he also enjoys an outstanding reputation in the sector and has well-developed relationships built over many years and it is in 
the interest of the Company and its shareholders to continue to benefit from these attributes going forward.
In light of the above, no use was made by the Committee of an external search agency or open advertising for the appointment 
of the Chairman. 44 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Assessment of the independence of the Non‑Executive Directors
The Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external 
commitments of its Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors 
(set out on pages 32 and 33) do not conflict with their duties and 
commitments as Directors of the Company. Our Directors must:
• report any changes to their commitments to the Board;
• notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a change 
in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation; and
• complete an annual conflicts questionnaire.
Any conflicts identified are considered and, as appropriate, 
authorised by the Board. 
All Directors will retire from the Board and submit themselves for 
election or re-election at the AGM. 
The Committee reviewed the independence of all the 
Non-Executive Directors. All Non-Executive Directors are considered 
independent and their contributions continue to be effective. 
They have all submitted themselves for re-election at the 2017 AGM. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ appointment letters are available for inspection at our 
registered office and at our AGM.
Board evaluation
The Committee oversaw the internal evaluation of the Board 
and Committees. A description of the evaluation is set out on 
page 36.
Succession planning
The Committee received presentations on succession planning for 
senior management throughout the year from the Chief Executive. 
The Committee will keep succession planning under review and 
monitor the progress and success of the development plans 
which have been established for relevant employees with a 
particular focus on ensuring over time all senior management 
positions have at least one internal successor.
The Committee also monitors a schedule on the length of 
tenure of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors and the 
mix and skills of the Directors. 
Diversity
The Company acknowledges the importance of diversity and 
inclusion to the effective functioning of the Board. This includes 
diversity of skills and experience, age, gender, disability, sexual 
orientation, cultural background and belief. Currently, 17% of our 
Board roles are held by women. The Board aims to have 33% 
of Board positions held by women by the end of 2020. We also 
endeavour to only use the services of executive search firms 
which have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on 
Gender Diversity. 
Diversity extends beyond the boardroom. The Board supports 
management in its efforts to build a diverse organisation.

Corporate governance
Dear shareholder
This year, the business has made significant progress with our 
key strategic goals and initiatives as well as delivering strong 
financial performance. We have made significant investments in 
new sales, services and technical resource over the past 24 months 
and the return on those investments is evident in the strong 
performance over the year.
The business continues to evolve and develop as a listed company. 
As part of that evolution, in May 2017, Martin Hellawell announced 
his decision to step down as Chief Executive once his successor 
is in place. Martin has led Softcat for the past eleven years and 
has made a significant contribution to the development and 
success of Softcat.
Since the announcement, the Nomination Committee has worked 
to find a successor to Martin who can drive the Company through 
its next period of development with the energy and passion that 
Martin showed during his time with Softcat.
Once his successor is in place, the Board intends to appoint 
Martin as Non-Executive Chairman. Brian Wallace, currently the 
Non-Executive Chairman, would then retire from the Board.
The remuneration changes that accompany the changes to 
the Board are set out in this letter and also in detail on 
pages 49 to 50.
This report lays out the core principles of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and our practice over the past year. 
I trust we have done this with the transparency and clarity that 
aid your understanding of both our intent and our activity.

CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL STATEMENT CONTINUED
Remuneration Committee report continued
Company highlights for the 2017 financial year
It has been another strong year for the Company in the context 
of an uncertain economic environment. The key highlights were:
• Revenue growth: 24%
• Gross profit growth: 13%
• Adjusted operating profit growth: 10%
• Employee engagement: 98%
• Customer satisfaction: 99%
The continued effectiveness of the senior management team 
in implementing the Company’s strategy has been substantiated 
in the actual level of achievement of the Company’s KPIs (outlined 
on pages 20 to 21), in particular our strong performance against 
our operating profit targets which resulted in 100% of the 
maximum bonuses being earned by the Executive Directors.
What have we done during the year 
• On stepping down as Chief Executive, Martin will receive no 
termination payments from the Company. However, under the 
terms of the existing Long Term Incentive Plan and Softcat’s 
policy around loss of office, he will be treated as a good 
leaver (further details are provided on page 49).
• We have reviewed the base salary of our Chief Financial Officer, 
Graham Charlton. Graham joined Softcat in 2015 to support 
the Company on its journey as a listed organisation. His base 
salary level was set at the lower end of the range of the other 
FTSE 250 Chief Financial Officers to reflect his tenure and 
experience in the role. 
  The Remuneration Committee committed to reviewing Graham’s 
salary position year on year to ensure his total remuneration 
opportunity moves towards a market-competitive level as he 
develops in the role. Last year his salary increase was 3%, in line 
with the rises provided to all employees of Softcat. However, 
with Graham’s development as a FTSE 250 Chief Financial 
Officer and the enhanced role and responsibility he will take 
in working with the new Chief Executive to drive the next phase 
of development of the business, the Committee has decided to 
increase his salary to £200,000 to apply for the 2018 financial 
year. The new salary remains below the median levels for 
Chief Financial Officer roles in the FTSE 250.
• The Committee also reviewed the base salary of our incumbent 
Chief Executive, Martin Hellawell, and decided to increase his 
salary by 3% in line with the rises provided to all employees 
of Softcat.
• Reviewed the fees for the Non-Executive Directors (see pages 
50 and 59).
• Reviewed the performance against our FY17 annual bonus 
for the Executive Directors, which was 100% of their maximum 
opportunity, equating to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive 
and 120% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer. The payouts 
reflect strong performance of the Company over the year. 
Further detail of the annual bonus is provided on page 48.
• Reviewed the performance targets for the 2017 LTIP award 
and made awards under LTIP for the Executive Directors, 
Executive Leadership Team and selected senior managers. 
Grant levels are consistent with our normal award policy. 
Further details are provided on pages 49 and 55.
In conclusion
Our goal as a Remuneration Committee last year was to formulate 
a Remuneration Policy and strategy which delivers sustainable, 
value-creating growth and performance for the business and 
rewards management accordingly. The Policy we put forward 
at last year’s AGM received over 99% support, for which I would 
like to thank shareholders.
Even though there was strong support for the Remuneration Policy, 
the Committee will continue to review the Policy annually to ensure 
that it still meets our goals. We believe the Policy continues to be 
fit for purpose and therefore it will remain unchanged this year.
The Annual Report on Remuneration (pages 54 to 59) together 
with this letter will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote 
at the forthcoming AGM on 8 December 2017. It details decisions 
and actions taken by the Committee based on the performance 
of the Company and remuneration outcomes.
Our goal has been to be thoughtful and clear in the layout of the 
report and I look forward to receiving your support for the resolution 
seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration at our 
forthcoming AGM.
I welcome any feedback from the Company’s shareholders.

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended in 2013, the provisions of the current Corporate Governance Code 
and taking into account the new UK Corporate Governance Code (applying for 
financial years beginning on or after 17 June 2016) (the ‘Code’) and the Listing 
Rules. The report consists of two sections:
• the Annual Statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman and associated 
‘at a glance’ section, containing a summary of our approved Remuneration 
Policy; and 
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out payments made to the Directors 
and details the link between Company performance and remuneration for the 
2017 financial year.
The Chairman’s Annual Statement and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be

PART A – AT A GLANCE
Our Remuneration Policy and its link to our Company strategy
The Company’s strategy is laid out on page 6. 
Ensuring the alignment of the proposed Remuneration Policy to the Company strategy was key for the Remuneration Committee 
in developing the proposed Policy below in conjunction with our core principles of remuneration.
Our core principles of remuneration:
•  to ensure Senior Executives are attracted, retained and motivated to drive the next stage of development in the 
Company as a listed organisation; 
• to incentivise the management team in extending the Company’s position in the IT infrastructure solutions industry; and
• to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
The key elements of the Company’s strategy and how its successful implementation is linked to the Company’s remuneration are 
set out in the following table.

profit growth will be 
measured through the 
long-term EPS growth 
targeted by the LTIP. In 
addition, sustained value 
generation will be 
reflected in the share 
price of the Company, 
which will be measured 
through the Company’s 
TSR performance under 
the LTIP.

TSR
The generation of profit 
growth targeted by the 
annual bonus will help 
enhance the value of the 
Company, which will be 
measured through the 
success of the Company’s 
TSR performance against 
its comparators (a 
performance condition 
under the LTIP).

EPS
An incentive to grow 
this market in the longer 
term is provided through 
EPS growth targeted by 
the LTIP. The success 
of this element of the 
strategy should be 
reflected in long-term 
TSR performance.

INTRODUCTION
In this section, we set out our Remuneration Policy, its link to corporate strategic 
objectives and the performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2017 
financial year. 48 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously 
and these views are taken into account in shaping Remuneration 
Policy and practice. Shareholder views are considered when 
evaluating and setting the remuneration strategy and the Committee 
commits to consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant 
changes to its Remuneration Policy.
The Committee consulted with the Company’s key shareholders 
along with the Investment Association (‘IA’) and the Institutional 
Shareholder Services (‘ISS’) in developing our Remuneration 
Policy and was delighted to receive 99.6% of votes for from 
our shareholders at our 2016 AGM.
Considerations of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Policy for all employees is determined in 
terms of best practice and ensuring that the Company is able 
to attract and retain the best people. This principle was followed 
in the development of our Policy. 
The remuneration strategy of the Company has been designed 
to ensure all employees share in its success. This is facilitated 
through the annual bonus and LTIP for Executive Directors and 
for some members of the senior team and the SIP for all employees. 
The table below shows how our incentive schemes support the 
Company strategy.

The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements nor have employees been consulted directly on the Policy. 
In setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of the Company are taken into account, 
including any base salary increases awarded. 
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management-level tiers below the Executive Directors 
and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company.
How we performed during the 2017 financial year 
In respect of FY17, the bonus awards payable to Executive Directors were agreed by the Committee having carefully reviewed the 
Company’s results. The performance measures and targets under the Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan for the 2017 financial year 
and the extent to which they were satisfied is set out below:

No discretion was exercised by the Committee in relation to the outcome of the annual bonus awards. The FY17 bonus will be paid 
two-thirds in cash and one-third in deferred shares.

50% of the award will be subject to the Company’s relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and 
investment trusts) over a three-year performance period and the remaining 50% will be subject to the adjusted EPS at the end 
of the period. Further details are on page 55.
Single figure remuneration for our Executive Directors
The tables below set out the single total figure of remuneration and breakdown for each Executive Director in respect of FY17.

Remuneration changes for the Board
When Martin Hellawell steps down from his role as Chief Executive and takes on the role of Non-Executive Chairman, he will 
receive no termination payments from the Company on his cessation of employment as the Chief Executive. However, under the 
terms of the existing LTIP and Softcat’s policy around loss of office, as a good leaver he will receive the following:
Plan Outstanding awards Committee determination
LTIP 2016
176,129
2015
208,333
Martin Hellawell will be treated as a good leaver under the terms 
of the LTIP on stepping down from his role as Chief Executive.
As a good leaver his award will be pro-rated to the amount 
of the vesting period completed on this date of cessation as 
Chief Executive. The final payout will be based on Softcat’s 
achievement of the LTIP performance conditions at the end 
of the three-year performance period.
The table above shows the awards he currently holds under the LTIP. The awards outstanding (including any proration for time served) 
on his transition to Chairman will be set out in the 2018 Annual Report. 50 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Remuneration changes for the Board continued
The Remuneration Committee reviewed Martin’s salary as Chief Executive and decided to increase his salary by 3% in line with the 
rises provided to all employees of Softcat. 
As outlined on page 46, the Remuneration Committee reviewed Graham’s salary position to reflect his development as a FTSE 250 
Chief Financial Officer. The Committee has decided to increase his salary to £200,000 to apply for the 2018 financial year. The increase 
reflects his development as a FTSE 250 Chief Financial Officer and the enhanced role and responsibility he will take on working 
with the new Chief Executive. The new salary remains below the median levels for Chief Financial Officer roles in the FTSE 250.
The fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were reviewed and they will increase by 3% in line with increases in the 
overall employee population.
Equity exposure of the Executive Directors
It is a core focus in our Remuneration Policy to encourage Executive Directors to acquire and build up shareholding in the Company, 
in order to align their interests with those of the Company’s shareholders. The following table sets out all subsisting interests in the 
equity of the Company held by the Executive Directors at 31 July 2017.
The Chief Executive’s shareholdings are substantially in excess of the Company’s minimum shareholding requirement of 200% of 
base salary. The Chief Financial Officer, who joined the Company in March 2015, is building up his shareholding. The Committee 
expects him to build up to the minimum shareholding requirement of 150% of salary over a five-year period from approval of the 
Remuneration Policy.

Remuneration Policy table summary
In accordance with the remuneration reporting regulations, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) summarised below was 
approved at the AGM on 8 December 2016, and will apply for a period of three years from the date of approval.
The Committee’s objective is to operate this policy to ensure that our Executive Directors have a remuneration structure and total 
remuneration opportunity that is aligned to Softcat’s business and is competitive when assessed against the market in which we 
compete for talent.
The implementation of the Policy for the 2018 financial year is outlined on page 59.

Corporate governance
Remuneration Policy table summary continued
Element of remuneration Operation
Salary An Executive Director’s basic salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually or when there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Company;
• the general performance of the Company;
• salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used for remuneration benchmarking;
• any change in scope, role and responsibilities; and
• the economic environment.
In general, salary increases for Executive Directors will be in line with the increase for employees.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level 
until they become established in their role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for 
employees until the target positioning is achieved.
Benefits The Executive Directors receive private health insurance, life insurance and death-in-service benefit.
Additional benefits may be offered, such as relocation allowances on recruitment.
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.
Pensions The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a maximum employer contribution into the DC scheme or a salary supplement 
in lieu of pension of 20% of basic salary per annum.
Annual and Deferred 
Bonus Plan (the ‘Bonus 
Plan’)
The Remuneration Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual Bonus Plan for each year, which will 
not exceed 200% of salary. 
The maximum value of deferred shares is up to 50% of the bonus earned, which vest after a minimum deferral period of three years 
based on continued employment.
Long T erm Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’)
LTIP maximum grant is 200% of salary p.a. (250% in exceptional circumstances). 
The Committee considers and sets the performance measures and targets for each LTIP award. See page 55 for the performance 
conditions of the grant made in the year. 
The LTIP contains clawback and malus provisions.
Share Incentive Plan 
(‘SIP’)
The Company operates an SIP and Sharesave Plan in which the Executive Directors are eligible to participate (which is in line with 
HMRC legislation and is open to all eligible staff) to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the Company and thereby 
align their interests with shareholders.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
The following table sets out the minimum shareholding requirements:
Role Shareholding requirement (% of salary)
Chief Executive 200
Chief Financial Officer 150
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman fees
The Board is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for setting the Chairman’s fees.
Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee and additional fees for chairmanship of Committees. The Chairman does not receive 
any additional fees for membership of Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually based on equivalent roles in the comparator group used to review salaries paid to the Executive Directors. 
Fees are set at broadly the median of the comparator group.
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman do not participate in any variable remuneration or benefits arrangements.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
There are no changes to the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The full Policy was approved by shareholders on 8 December 2016 
and is available to view in full on the Company’s website at softcat.com/investors.
The implementation of the Policy for the 2018 financial year is outlined on page 59. 52 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy
The charts below illustrate the remuneration that would be paid to each of the Executive Directors for the 2018 financial year 
under three different performance scenarios: (i) minimum; (ii) on-target; and (iii) maximum. The elements of remuneration have been 
categorised into three components: (i) fixed; (ii) annual bonus (deferred bonus); and (iii) LTIP.

Notes:
1.  Based on 2017 benefits payments and pension values as per the single figure table. The actual benefits and pension contributions for 2018 will only be known at the 
end of the financial year.
2.  In accordance with the regulations, share price growth has not been included. In addition, dividend equivalents have not been added to the deferred share bonus 
and LTIP share awards.
3. Participation in the SIP has been excluded given the relative size of the opportunity levels.
Pay at risk 
The charts below set out the single figure of each Executive Director based on whether the elements remain ‘at risk’. For example:
• payment is subject to continuing employment for a period (deferred shares and LTIP awards); or
• performance conditions have to still be satisfied (LTIP awards); or
• elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting.
Figures have been calculated based on target performance. The charts have been based on the same assumptions as set out 
above for the illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy.

Fees retained for external non‑executive directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors and retain the fees. Martin Hellawell 
and Graham Charlton currently hold no external directorships.
Comparison of overall performance and pay
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index. 
The graph shows the total shareholder return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the 
same period of dividend income. 
The Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this since the first 
review of the index since the IPO. This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations. It should be noted that the 
Company listed on 18 November 2015 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 18 November 2015 to 31 July 2017.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the Remuneration Policy and for 
determining specific packages for the Executive Directors and other selected members of the senior management team. Prior to 
the establishment of the Remuneration Committee, remuneration decisions were made by the Board of the Company. The Company 
consults with key shareholders in respect of the Remuneration Policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website, softcat.com/investors, and from the Company 
Secretary at the registered office.
Our main responsibilities are: 
• to determine and agree with the Board the broad Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and other selected members 
of the senior management team;
• to review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy; and
• to review any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company and to administer all aspects of any 
share scheme.
The Committee receives assistance from the Company Secretary, who will attend meetings by invitation. The Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Officer attend by invitation on occasion. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and selected 
members of the senior management team. PwC also provided the Company with tax and assurance work during the year. The Committee 
is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure 
objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fixed fees of £40,000 (2016: £15,000) were provided to 
PwC during the year in respect of remuneration advice received.

Corporate governance
Statement of implementation of the Remuneration Policy in the 2018 financial year
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed and considered the key components of remuneration to ensure that the Remuneration 
Policy (summarised below) is fit for purpose, continues to drive success within the remuneration framework and meets the shareholder 
and governance expectations of a FTSE 250 company.
What was implemented in 2016/2017 Implementation in 2017/2018
Base salary For 2017, base salaries for the CEO and the CFO were 
£257,500 and £175,100 respectively. This is a rise from 
the previous year of 3%.
For 2018, base salaries for the CEO and the CFO will be 
£265,225 and £200,000 respectively. This is a rise from the 
previous year of 3% and 14% respectively.
Pension Martin Hellawell did not receive any pension entitlements 
and Graham Charlton received 3% of salary employer pension 
contributions into the defined contribution scheme.
No change.
Benefits Benefits in the year comprised private medical insurance. No change.
Annual Bonus Plan  
(‘ABP’)
• Cash
• Deferred share award
The Committee can determine the proportion of the bonus earned 
under the ABP that is provided as an award of deferred shares.
For 2017, the maximum bonus opportunities for the CEO 
and the CFO was 200% and 120% of salary respectively.
The level of deferral in shares was one-third of the 
bonus earned.
No change in the annual bonus opportunities 
or deferral mechanics.
No change in the annual bonus performance measures.
LTIP The performance conditions for LTIP awards was equally 
weighted between earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth and 
comparative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) assessed over 
a three-year performance period.
For the achievement of threshold performance, 25% of 
the award will vest. 100% of the award will vest for maximum 
performance. There is straight-line vesting between 
these points.
In 2017, the maximum annual LTIP award of 200% of salary 
was awarded to the CEO and the CFO.
2017 LTIP awards:
• No change in the LTIP grant levels.
• No change to the performance measures or their weighting 
– 50% EPS growth and 50% relative TSR.
• The relative TSR comparator group and the vesting schedule 
for this element will remain unchanged from the 2015 award.
• The Committee will review the EPS performance target range 
in light of the Company’s strategic plan over the next period. 
Taking into account these factors the Committee will set the 
EPS range for the 2017 LTIP grant at challenging levels over 
the next period. The targets will be communicated on grant.

Powers of Directors
The general powers of the Directors are contained within 
UK legislation and the Company’s Articles of Association (the 
‘Articles’). The Directors are entitled to exercise all powers of 
the Company, subject to any limitations imposed by the Articles 
or applicable legislation. 
Directors’ interests 
The interests of the Directors in the issued shares of the 
Company at 31 July 2017 are disclosed in the Remuneration 
Report on page 56. The Remuneration Report also sets out 
details of any changes in those interests between the year 
end and 18 October 2017.
No Director had a material interest in any contract of significance 
with the Company at any time during the financial year.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors 
are contained in the Articles. They provide that Directors may be 
appointed by ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution 
of the Directors. Any Director so appointed must retire and put 
themselves forward for election at the next Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’). Directors wishing to continue to serve as 
members of the Board will seek re-election annually in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 
(the ‘Code’), at the 2017 AGM each Director will stand for re-election.
Indemnification of Directors
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity provision contained 
in the Articles. The provision was in force during the year ended 
31 July 2017 and remains in force and relates to certain losses 
and liabilities which the Directors may incur to third parties in the 
course of acting as Directors of the Company. In addition, Directors 
and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Compensation for loss of office and change of control
There are no agreements in place with any Director that would 
provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting 
from a change of control. Change of control provisions for the 
Company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted 
under such plans to vest on a takeover.
The Company is not party to any other significant agreements 
that take effect after, or terminate upon, a change of control.
Articles of Association
The Articles may be amended by a special resolution of the 
members. At the AGM held on 12 November 2015, shareholders 
approved by special resolution the amended Articles which 
took effect at the date of the initial public offering (‘IPO’) on 
18 November 2015.

Share capital and control
The Company’s ordinary issued share capital as at 31 July 2017 
was 197,606,143 ordinary shares of 0.05p each, which have a 
premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. The ordinary 
share class represents over 99.9% of the Company’s total 
issued share capital.
In addition to the ordinary shares, the Company also has a class 
of 18,933 deferred shares which were created following the 
share capital reorganisation at IPO and which are not admitted 
to trading on a regulated market.
Shares acquired through the Company’s share schemes and 
plans rank equally with the other shares in issue and have no 
special rights. The Company has an Employee Benefit Trust 
(‘EBT’) and a Share Incentive Plan Trust (‘SIP Trust’) for the 
benefit of employees and former employees of the Company. 
At 31 July 2017, the EBT holds nil ordinary shares and the SIP 
Trust holds 777,234 ordinary shares in the Company.
During the year ended 31 July 2017, share options were exercised 
pursuant to the Company Share Option Plan, resulting in the 
additional listing and allotment of 200,000 new ordinary shares.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak 
at general meetings of the Company, to appoint one or more 
proxies and, if they are corporations, corporate representatives 
who are entitled to attend general meetings and to exercise 
voting rights. 
The deferred shares carry no voting rights or rights to receive 
any of the profits of the Company available for distribution by 
way of dividend or otherwise. On a return of capital on a winding 
up of the Company (but not otherwise), the holder is entitled 
only to the repayment of the amount paid up on that share after 
payment of the capital paid up on each other share in the capital 
of the Company and the further payment of £10,000,000 on 
each such share. The deferred shares represent less than 0.01% 
of the Company’s total issued share capital.
Further information on the Company’s issued share capital 
can be found in note 16 to the financial statements. 
The Company passed the following resolutions on 8 December 2016:
• An ordinary resolution providing the Directors with authority to:
 (i)  allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£32,901.02, to be reduced by the nominal amount allotted 
or granted under paragraph (ii) below in excess of such 
sum; and
 (ii)  allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£65,802.04 in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way 
of a rights issue, such amount to be reduced by any 
allotments made under paragraph (i) above.
• Special resolutions providing Directors with authority to:
 (i)  allot shares or sell treasury shares for cash up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £4,935.15;
 (ii)  allot shares or sell the treasury shares for cash up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £4,935.15, in connection with 
an acquisition or other capital investment
  otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to 
their shareholding.
These authorities are due to expire at the Company’s AGM to 
be held on 8 December 2017 and proposals for the renewal 
of the authority to allot ordinary shares are set out in the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting. The Company has no intention 
to complete a market purchase of its shares and will not seek 
this authority at the 2017 AGM.
The ordinary shares are freely transferable. Lock-up arrangements 
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated 13 November 2015 
and deed polls of election entered into prior to the IPO placing 
the following restrictions expired during the year: 
• each Director (and each of his or her family members and 
each trustee of a trust, the beneficiary of which is a Director 
and/or a family member of a Director) undertook not to sell 
any further ordinary shares, other than at IPO, for a period 
of 365 days after the date of the IPO;
• each ‘selling shareholder’, other than the ‘core selling 
shareholders’ (as such term is defined in the IPO prospectus), 
who was an employee of the Company and who had a holding 
of ordinary shares of 0.5% or more of the Company’s issued 
share capital, in each case as at the date of the IPO Prospectus, 
undertook not to sell any further ordinary shares, other than 
at IPO, for a period of 365 days after the date of the IPO; and
• certain ‘non-selling shareholders’ undertook not to sell any 
ordinary shares for a period of either 180 or 365 days after 
the date of the IPO.
There are no further restrictions on the transfer or limitations 
on the holding of ordinary shares and no requirements to obtain 
approval prior to any transfers other than: certain restrictions 
which may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example, insider trading laws); and pursuant to the Market 
Abuse Regulation and the Company’s own rules whereby Directors 
and certain employees of the Company require the approval of 
the Company to deal in the ordinary shares; and pursuant to the 
Articles where there is default in supplying the Company with 
information concerning interests in the Company’s ordinary 
shares. There are no special control rights in relation to the 
Company’s ordinary shares.
There are no agreements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. 62 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Principal shareholder and Relationship Agreement
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4R(14), the Company has set 
out below a statement describing the Relationship Agreement 
entered into by the Company with its principal shareholder (the 
‘Relationship Agreement’). As at 18 October 2017, Peter Kelly, the 
founder of Softcat plc, held 32.91% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company.
On 13 November 2015, the Company and Peter Kelly entered 
into the Relationship Agreement. The principal purpose of the 
Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company will be 
capable of carrying on its business independently of Peter Kelly 
and certain persons deemed to be connected with him 
(‘Connected Persons’).
Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, Peter Kelly, inter alia: 
• shall procure that all transactions, agreements or arrangements 
entered into between the Company and Peter Kelly (or any 
of his Connected Persons) are conducted on an arm’s length 
basis, on normal commercial terms and in accordance with 
the related party transaction rules set out in Chapter 11 of the 
Listing Rules and Peter Kelly shall abstain from voting on any 
resolution to which LR 11.1.7R(4) of the Listing Rules applies 
relating to a transaction with Peter Kelly (or any of his 
Connected Persons) as the related party;
• shall (and shall procure that each of his Connected Persons 
shall) (i) not take any actions that would reasonably be expected 
to have the effect of preventing the Company from complying 
with its obligations under the Listing Rules or be prejudicial to 
the Company’s status as a listed company or the Company’s 
eligibility for listing; (ii) not propose or procure the proposal of 
a shareholder resolution that would circumvent or appear to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules; and (iii) 
not exercise his voting rights or other rights to procure any 
amendment to the Articles which would be contrary to the 
maintenance of the Company’s independence, including its 
ability to operate and make decisions independently from 
Peter Kelly, or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions 
of the Relationship Agreement; 
• has agreed that for a period of two years from 18 November 2015, 
he shall not be entitled to operate, establish or acquire an 
undertaking which constitutes a competing business; and 
• has agreed that for a period of two years from 18 November 2015, 
he shall not (and shall procure that each of his Connected 
Persons shall not) solicit or encourage for service or employment 
any of the Executive Directors or members of senior management.
Furthermore, the Company and Peter Kelly have agreed that for 
so long as Peter Kelly (together with any of his Connected Persons) 
holds 10%. of the Company’s issued share capital, he shall be 
entitled to appoint one Non-Executive Director of the Company, 
although no such Director has been appointed as at the date of 
this Annual Report.
The Relationship Agreement will remain in effect for so long as: 
(a) Peter Kelly (and/or any of his Connected Persons) holds at 
least 10%. of the Company’s issued share capital; and (b) the 
ordinary shares are admitted to the premium listing segment of 
the Official List maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority.
The Company has and, in so far as it is aware, Peter Kelly and 
his Connected Persons have complied with the independence 
provisions set out in the Relationship Agreement from the date 
of the agreement.

Corporate governance
consideration in the Notice of AGM. The Company does not 
intend to make any payments to political organisations or to 
incur other political expenditure; however, this resolution has 
been proposed to ensure that the Company has authority under 
the wide definition used in the Companies Act 2006 of matters 
constituting political donations.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Information relating to the Company’s greenhouse gas 
emissions is detailed on page 27 of the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report.
Corporate social responsibility
Details on our commitment to corporate social responsibility 
can be found on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report.
Equality and diversity 
The Company operates an equal opportunities policy which 
endeavours to treat individuals fairly and not to discriminate 
on the basis of gender, disability, race, national or ethnic origin, 
sexual orientation or marital status. Applications for employment 
are fully considered on their merits, and employees are given 
appropriate training and equal opportunities for career 
development and promotion.
The Company is committed to ensuring that adequate policies 
and procedures are in place to enable disabled applicants to 
receive training to perform safely and effectively and to provide 
development opportunities to ensure they reach their full potential. 
Where an individual becomes disabled during the course of their 
employment with the Company, the Company will seek to provide, 
wherever possible, continued employment on normal terms and 
conditions. Adjustments will be made to the environment and 
duties or, alternatively, suitable new roles within the Company 
will be secured with additional training where necessary.
Details of the Company’s gender breakdown are given in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report on page 29.
The Company places considerable value on the involvement of 
its employees and continues to keep them informed on matters 
affecting them as employees. This is undertaken through a variety 
of methods including, but not limited to, weekly all-Company 
meetings, team briefings, Company days, email and the intranet. 
At team meetings, managers are responsible for ensuring that 
information sharing, discussion and feedback take place on a 
regular basis. As a result of these meetings management can 
communicate the financial and economic factors affecting the 
Company and ensure that the views of employees are taken 
into account in Company decisions which are likely to affect 
their interests.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the 
end of the financial year and the profit or loss of the Company, 
so far as concerns members of the Company, for the financial 
year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select and apply accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state that applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Company’s financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which are sufficient to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Fair and balanced reporting
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement pursuant to FCA’s Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rule 4 (‘DTR 4’)
Each Director of the Company (whose names and functions 
appear on pages 32 to 33) confirms that (solely for the purpose 
of DTR 4) to the best of his or her knowledge:
• the financial statements in this document, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors in office at the time of approval of the Directors’ 
Report are listed on page 60 and have each confirmed that:
• so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any 
such relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern 
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 29. The financial 
position of the Company, its cash flows and liquidity position are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 23. In addition, 
note 20 to the financial statements includes the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Corporate governance
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 revision of the 
Code, the Board has assessed the prospects of the Company 
over a longer period than the twelve months that has in practice 
been the focus of the ‘going concern’ provision.
The Board conducted the review for a three-year period, 
corresponding with the period covered by its strategic level 
three-year plan process. These forecasts are updated on an 
annual basis and reflect the Company’s policy of growth, increased 
customer offerings and available internal and financial resources 
without the need for external funding. They consider profits, 
cash flows, funding requirements and other key financial ratios 
over the period, as well as the desired minimum cash float.
The principal risks are set out on pages 24 to 25 and the 
most relevant potential impact of these risks on viability 
was considered to be:
• a substantial and sustained decrease in revenue 
resulting from a loss of Softcat culture or inability to 
satisfy customer needs;
• a substantial fall in achievable gross margins resulting 
from margin pressure associated with a fall in levels 
of customer service; and
• an ongoing increase in the working capital cycle.
The Board overlaid the potential impact of the principal risks 
which could affect the financial position in ‘severe but plausible’ 
scenarios onto the three-year forecasts and concluded that the 
business would remain viable. As part of this they performed 
sensitivity analyses that flexed the forecasts including reduced 
income, profitability and increased working capital cycle, 
both individually and in unison, to reflect these severe but 
plausible scenarios.
Based on the results of the procedures outlined above, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period of assessment.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s 2017 AGM will take place on 8 December 2017 
at the Company’s registered office: Softcat plc, Fieldhouse Lane, 
Marlow, Buckinghamshire SL7 1LW. Subject to any restrictions 
set out in this section, on a show of hands every holder of ordinary 
shares who is present in person or by proxy at a general meeting 
has one vote on each resolution and, on a poll, every holder of 
ordinary shares who is present in person or by proxy has one 
vote on each resolution for every ordinary share of which he/she 
is the registered holder. A proxy will have one vote against a 
resolution on a show of hands in certain circumstances specified 
in the Articles. The Notice of AGM specifies deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. The Notice of AGM can be found in the investor 
relations section of the Company’s website, www.softcat.com, 
and is being posted at the same time as this Annual Report. 
The Notice of AGM sets out the business of the meeting and 
provides explanatory notes on all resolutions. Separate resolutions 
are proposed in respect of each substantive issue.
A holder of ordinary shares may vote personally or by proxy at 
a general meeting. Any form of proxy must be delivered to the 
Company not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for 
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person 
named in the appointment proposes to vote (for this purpose, 
the Directors may specify that no account shall be taken of any 
part of a day that is not a working day). A corporation which is 
a holder of ordinary shares in the Company may authorise such 
persons as it thinks fit to act as its representatives at any general 
meeting of the Company. 
No holder of ordinary shares shall be entitled to attend or vote, 
either personally or by proxy, at a general meeting in respect of 
any ordinary share if any call or other sum presently payable to 
the Company in respect of such ordinary share remains unpaid 
or in certain other circumstances specified in the Articles where 
there is default in supplying the Company with information 
concerning interests in the Company’s ordinary shares.
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication 
with private shareholders. In addition to the formal business, 
there will be a presentation by the Chief Executive on the 
performance of the Company and its future development. The 
Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen of the Committees, 
together with the Directors, will be available to answer 
shareholders’ questions at the meeting.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Softcat plc
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Softcat plc’s financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2017 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of Softcat plc, which comprise:
Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income for the year then ended
Statement of Financial Position as at 31 July 2017
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended
Related notes 1 to 26 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report below. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us 
to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the Annual Report (pages 24 to 25) that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation (page 24) in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement (pages 64 to 65) in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the Directors’ explanation (pages 64 to 65) in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. Financial statements

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material 
misstatement
• Inappropriate revenue recognition: misstatement of revenue recognised at or near year end
• Rebates: misstatement of rebate income
Audit scope • The Company performs all transaction processing and financial statement preparation centrally in the 
UK and operates under one legal entity. Our audit procedures cover a single set of accounts and our 
audit scope covers 100% of revenue, profit and balance sheet items by way of full scope procedures
Materiality • Materiality of £2.5m, which represents 5% of profit before tax 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Inappropriate revenue recognition:  
misstatement of revenue recognised at or near year end Supporting references in the Annual Report and Accounts:
During the year the Company recognised revenue of £832m 
(2016: £672m)
We focused on this due to the susceptibility of this account to 
manual override related to year end adjustments and journals posted
The Audit Committee Report (pages 38 to 41); 
Accounting policies (pages 76 to 81); and
Note 2 of the Company Financial statements (page 81).
Summary of the nature of the risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
• Revenue is a key value driver 
for the business as a whole and 
is one of the key performance 
indicators used to measure the 
value of the business.
• The Company may at times be 
under pressure to meet ambitious 
growth targets and analyst 
expectations as a newly listed 
entity. When targets are exceeded 
there may be a risk that revenue is 
inappropriately deferred into the 
following fiscal year.
• Certain compensation incentives 
are based on quarterly and annual 
revenue targets, creating a 
risk of revenue and gross 
margin misstatement and 
management override.
• Management’s process for 
accounting for certain revenue 
transactions, particularly those at or 
near the year end, is mostly manual 
and therefore susceptible to 
management override.
• To gain assurance that the requirements for 
revenue recognition have been met during the 
period, we tested the two-way correlation between 
revenue and trade receivables and three-way 
correlation between revenue, trade receivables and 
cash for the year. We also tested other revenue and 
receivables transactions that didn’t conform to our 
expectation of typical revenue postings.
• We performed substantive testing on a sample 
of deferred revenue transactions taken from the 
year-end deferred revenue balance to obtain 
assurance over the completeness and existence  
of the year-end deferred revenue balance.
• We tested revenue cut-off by obtaining and 
testing management’s sales cut-off analysis 
and independently testing transactions therein 
on a sample basis.
• To address the risk of management override, 
we tested a sample of manual journal entries 
recorded at or near year end and credit notes 
issued subsequent to the year end.
• We made inquiries of certain sales personnel and 
management as to their awareness of sales and 
discounting practices that may indicate the existence 
of side agreements which could impact revenue 
recognised during the account period.
We concluded that revenue is 
materially correct and has been 
recognised in accordance with 
Company policy and IFRSs. Financial statements

Key audit matters continued
Rebates: misstatement of rebate income Supporting references in the Annual Report and Accounts:
During the year the Company earned rebate income of £23.6m 
(2016: £20.1m) 
We focused on this due to the manual processing required, 
as well as the potential for management override of controls
The Audit Committee Report (pages 38 to 41); 
Accounting policies (pages 76 to 81); and
Note 1.7 of the Company Financial statements (page 78).
Summary of the nature of the risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
• The rebate process is manual and 
is considered complex due to the 
various types of contracts and 
contract terms.
• While most rebates are agreed with 
the supplier and paid during the 
year, due to a manual process there 
is a potential for management to 
override control.
• We tested management’s controls around the 
rebate process, which covers verification of 
amounts reported by suppliers, accuracy of the 
calculated rebate receivable accrual, and a 
retrospective review of cash received against 
amounts accrued. 
• We tested transactions from throughout the year and 
the year-end rebate receivable by vouching a sample 
of transactions to third party source documentation 
and cash receipts.
• We tested the rebate income received post year-end 
by confirming a sample of rebates to ensure they 
were accrued at the year end where appropriate.
• We challenged the Company’s rebate accrual at year 
end, by assessing consistency of methodology 
applied with the prior year and throughout the period 
and classification of rebates. 
We concluded that rebate 
income and rebate accrual is 
materially correct and has been 
recognised in accordance with 
Company policy and IFRSs.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
The Company has business operations in various locations throughout the UK; however, all transaction processing and financial statement 
preparation occurs centrally at the Company’s headquarters in Marlow. Additionally, as the Company operates under one legal entity, 
our audit is of one UK statutory entity that covers 100% of revenue, profit and balance sheet items by way of full scope procedures.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of 
our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Company to be £2.5m which is 5% of profit before tax. For the 2016 audit, we determined 
materiality for the Company to be £2.3m calculated as 5% of normalised profit before tax, which was calculated by adding back 
exceptional items related primarily to the Company’s initial public offering in November 2015. There has been no equivalent items 
in the current year. 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and the only change in final materiality was to reflect the actual 
reported performance of the Company in the year. Financial statements
69 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Softcat plc
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Company’s overall control environment and the level of 
audit differences previously identified, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, 
namely £1.25m (2016: £1.1m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage in order that the total amount of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements does not exceed our planning materiality of £2.5m for the financial statements as a whole. 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We did not increase our reporting threshold following the increase in final materiality.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report (pages 1 to 65), including the Strategic Report set 
out on pages 1 to 29 and corporate governance set out on pages 30 to 65, other than the financial statements and our Auditor’s Report 
thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet 
the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable (page 64) – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit Committee reporting (pages 38 to 41) – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (page 31) – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Financial statements

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Softcat plc
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 64, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
The objectives of our audit in respect to fraud are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both 
those charged with governance of the entity and management. 
Financial statements Financial statements
71 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Softcat plc
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements continued
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Company and determined 
that the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (IFRS as adopted by the EU, the Companies Act 2006 
and Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are 
certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements, being the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange and the Bribery Act 2010. 
• We understood how Softcat plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, those responsible 
for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board 
minutes, discussions with the Audit Committee and any correspondence received with regulatory bodies. 
• We assessed the susceptibility of the Company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might 
occur, by meeting with management to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered 
performance targets and their influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of 
analysts. Where this risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. 
These procedures included testing manual journal entries. 
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Our procedures involved review of board minutes to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations, review of 
reporting to the Audit Committee on compliance with regulations and enquires of the Company Secretary and management.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an Auditor’s Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.
Other matters we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed as auditors by the Board of Directors and signed an 
engagement letter on 9 March 2017. We were appointed by the Company at the AGM on 8 December 2016 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 31 July 2017 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
including previous renewals and reappointments is five years, covering the years ending 31 July 2013 to 31 July 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Company and we remain independent 
of the Company in conducting the audit. 
The audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Softcat plc website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditor does not involve consideration 
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditor accepts no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially 
presented on the website.

1 Accounting policies
1.1 Corporate information
The financial statements of Softcat plc for the year ended 31 July 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 18 October 2017. Softcat plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and whose 
shares are publicly traded. The registered office is Solar House, Fieldhouse Lane, Marlow, Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom.
The principal activity of the Company continued to be that of a value-added IT reseller and IT infrastructure solutions provider to the 
corporate and public sector markets.
1.2 Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’) and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are presented in the Company’s 
presentational and functional currency of Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (‘£’000’), except 
when otherwise stated.
The Company applied all standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that were effective as of 31 July 2017. The accounting 
policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Going concern
The financial information has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to be able 
to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing 
these financial statements. At the date of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances that 
could lead to the Company being unable to settle commitments as they fall due during the twelve months from the date of signing 
these financial statements.
1.3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Company’s accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future. These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including 
historical experience that may differ significantly from the actual outcome. The key assumptions concerning the future and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include:
Revenue cut-off
The Company’s management information systems are configured to recognise revenue upon notification of dispatch from the 
supplier or distributor which in instances, especially regarding physical shipments, may not be aligned to when the risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred. Under IFRS the point of recognition on physical shipments should be aligned to 
the date of delivery, not dispatch. Management therefore performs an exercise to capture items that may have been dispatched 
from distributor but not delivered in the financial year, and subsequently defers the recognition of revenue into the following year. 
The exercise applied includes several assumptions, which management believes are reasonable, in order to identify items that 
fit the criteria for deferral. Separately, management reviews individual large deals on a case-by-case basis, which reduces the 
opportunity for error.
1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, see below
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 2 (Amendments) Share-based Payments
• IAS 7 (Amendments) Statement of Cash Flows
• IFRS 16 Leases, see below
• IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 July 2017 Financial statements
77 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards continued
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the financial statements of the Company, except for:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange 
for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements 
under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is in the process of analysing the impact of IFRS 15 on its reporting. This analysis has identified some discrete areas 
in which adjustments may be required to reporting under the principal versus agent assessment. This change is driven by the application 
of the control principle, where the business would need to establish ‘control’ of goods, whether hardware, software or services, 
prior to delivery to the customer. Application of the control principle and guidance in IFRS 15 may have an impact on the classification 
of principal versus agent which could result in the Company recognising certain revenue as net.
Management is still to formally conclude this treatment. The Company’s IFRS 15 impact assessment and implementation work remains 
ongoing, alongside a quantification exercise which is expected to be finalised during the year ending 31 July 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting 
model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with the exception of those with a lease term of less than 
twelve months or where the underlying asset has a low value.
The Company is assessing the impact of this standard, which is effective from periods beginning 1 January 2019.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking 
into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty. The Company assesses its revenue arrangements 
against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The following specific recognition criteria must also 
be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
The Company sells hardware and software that is sourced from and delivered by a number of suppliers. Revenue from the sale of 
these goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on 
delivery of the goods.
The Company has primary responsibility for the acceptability of goods sold, is exposed to inventory risk during the delivery period, 
establishes the selling price itself and bears the customer’s credit risk. It is therefore considered to be acting as principal in these 
sales and revenue is measured using the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Provision of services
The Company also provides datacentre, cloud and software services. Revenue in respect of these services is recognised when 
the service has been satisfactorily completed or in line with the stage of completed work. It is measured at either the sales prices, 
excluding sales taxes, or by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
In addition, the Company sells services provided by third parties. Revenue for services provided by third parties is recognised 
at the point of sale to the customer, as the Company has no ongoing obligations. The Company establishes the selling price 
and is exposed to customer credit risk on this revenue and therefore considers itself to be acting as principal, measuring 
revenue as the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (‘EIR’) 
applicable. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life 
of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. 
Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement. Financial statements

1.6 Cost of sales
The Company recognises cost of sales at the point at which it recognises revenue as explained above except for contracts which 
are recognised on a cost of completion percentage methodology. Cost of sales predominantly relates to the cost of goods and 
services purchased from suppliers and then sold to customers. In addition to these costs, the following elements are also included 
within cost of sales:
Rebates
Included within cost of sales are rebates received from commercial partners. Further details are provided on rebates in 1.7, below.
Managed service infrastructure costs
The Company operates its own network operating centre which facilitates the selling of Softcat hosted managed services. 
The costs of maintaining this ability include, but are not limited to, the rental of space in data warehouses, energy and licensing 
costs. These costs represent the cost of sale of selling hosted managed service solutions and are included within cost of sales.
Marketing costs and related credits
The Company carries out numerous training programmes, activities and schemes that aim to educate its sales force and internally 
promote the products the business resells. These activities are often funded by the Company’s partners. Both the cost of the 
programmes borne by the Company and the credits received, where applicable, are included within cost of sales.
Settlement discounts
Through the normal course of business, the Company receives credits from distributors and suppliers for the prompt settlement 
of invoices. Softcat recognises these discounts in cost of sales as they are considered to be a reduction in the cost of goods sold.
1.7 Rebates
Rebates from suppliers are accounted for in the period in which they are earned and are based on commercial agreements with 
suppliers. Rebates earned are mainly sales volume related and are generally short term in nature, with rebates earned but not yet 
received typically relating to the preceding quarter’s trading. Rebate income is recognised in cost of sales in the Statement of Profit 
or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and rebates earned but not yet received are included within accrued income in the 
Statement of Financial Position.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment other than freehold land is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or impairment losses, 
if any. If the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the 
item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each 
asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years straight line
Building improvements remaining period of lease – ten years straight line
Computer equipment three–five years straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment six years straight line
Motor vehicles three years straight line
Land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
Building improvements relate to expenditure on improving both leasehold property and the freehold property of Solar House in Marlow. 
Improvements to Solar House are depreciated over a ten-year period, which represents their useful life. Leasehold improvements 
are depreciated over their useful life which is the lesser of the remaining length of the lease or ten years.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for reasonableness at each financial year end and 
adjusted for prospectively if appropriate. Financial statements
79 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
1.9 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Amortisation is provided for at rates 
calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
Computer software  three–five years straight line
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense category 
consistent with the function of the intangible assets. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at 
the end of each reporting period. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the 
asset is derecognised.
1.10 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if payments 
are not made on such a basis. Onerous property leases are provided for in the Statement of Financial Position and represent the 
present value of the onerous element of an operating lease. This arises when the Company ceases to use premises and they are 
left vacant to the end of the lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. At inception or on 
reassessment of the arrangement that contains a lease, the Company separates payments and other consideration required by 
such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values.
1.11 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell.
Inventories are predominantly goods in transit and items for which a customer purchase order has been received but the goods 
have yet to be delivered to the customer.
1.12 Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Company’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are 
recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment. Trade receivables do not 
carry interest.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income 
statement in administrative expenses.
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. The Company’s financial 
liabilities comprise trade and other payables. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value. Trade payables due after one year are measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method.
1.13 Pensions
The pension costs charged in the financial statements represent the contributions payable by the Company during the year on the 
defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently 
administered fund. The amounts charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable to the scheme in respect 
of the accounting period and represent the full extent of the Company’s liability. Financial statements

1.14 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
1.15 Current taxation
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Statement of Profit or Loss 
and Other Comprehensive Income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
1.16 Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences 
are taken to the income statement.
1.17 Share-based payments
During the year the Company operated the following equity-settled share option schemes:
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
The CSOP provides share options for nominated employees. The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of grant. 
The CSOP operates both approved and unapproved schemes with vesting dependent on continued employment with the Company. 
Options typically vest between one and three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant.
The fair value of the CSOP options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and is charged as an expense 
in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The Company operates an SIP for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015. 
Shares were allocated to employees on the basis of length of service. Free shares awarded to an employee under the SIP are subject 
to a holding period ending not earlier than the third anniversary and not later than the fifth anniversary of the date on which 
beneficial interest in the relevant ordinary shares is conferred by the SIP Trustee to the employee.
The fair value of the SIP shares is determined by the share price at date of grant, on 9 December 2015, and the number of shares 
expected to be transferred following the three-year vesting period. The assumption used for expected leavers within three years 
from the date of award has been calculated with reference to historical employee retention rates. The resulting fair value charge 
is charged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The Company’s voluntary partnership share purchase programme, which is open to all employees is administered through the SIP. Financial statements

1.17 Share-based payments continued
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 49.
The awards will only vest and become exercisable upon achievement of performance targets, linked to earnings per share and 
total shareholder return, as well as being conditional upon continued employment with the Company. The fair value is measured 
using a suitable valuation model where appropriate. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of LTIP shares expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is 
based on the number of LTIP shares that will eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the LTIP 
shares granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition. The resulting fair value 
charge is charged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Employee Benefit Trust and SIP Trust
The Company operates an Employee Benefit Trust and an SIP Trust for the benefit of eligible employees. The Company recognises 
the assets and liabilities of these trusts as its own until such assets held vest unconditionally with identified beneficiaries. The Company 
meets all costs incurred by the trusts.
1.18 Company accounts
Softcat plc is a single entity with no subsidiary undertakings. The Employee Benefit and SIP Trusts, which hold shares on behalf 
of employees, are not consolidated within the results of Softcat plc and instead are treated as extensions of the Company.
1.19 Exceptional items
Items that are material in size and unusual in nature are included within operating profit and disclosed separately in the income statement. 
The separate reporting of these items helps to provide a more accurate indication of the underlying business performance.
2 Segmental information
The information reported to the Company’s Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the 
purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Company. The 
Company has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is that of ‘value-added IT reseller 
and IT infrastructure solutions provider’. The Company’s revenue and results and assets for this one reportable segment can be 
determined by reference to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position. 
An analysis of revenues by product, which form one reportable segment, is set out below:
Revenue by type:

Share reorganisation
On 12 November 2015, pursuant to special resolutions of the Company and conditional upon admission to the official list of the FCA 
(which took place on 18 November 2015), it was resolved that:
• 188,500 ‘MR’ shares of £0.01 each be redesignated as ordinary shares of £0.01 each and their rights varied accordingly;
• 588,322 ‘A’ ordinary shares of £0.01 each be redesignated as ordinary shares of £0.01 each and their rights varied accordingly;
• 18,933 ‘A’ ordinary shares of £0.01 each be redesignated as deferred shares of £0.01 each; and
• each ordinary share of £0.01 be sub-divided into 20 ordinary shares of £0.0005 each.
In the year ended 31 July 2017, 200,000 new ordinary shares were issued to satisfy the exercise of share options.
No issued ordinary shares of £0.0005 each were unpaid at 31 July 2017 (2016: nil unpaid).
All ordinary shares rank pari passu in all respects.
Deferred shares do not have rights to dividends and do not carry voting rights.
Own share transactions
In the year ended 31 July 2017 the SIP Trust returned £317,000 (2016: £nil) to the Company through share recycling. In the prior year

20 Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables. The primary purpose of these financial liabilities is 
to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash that 
derive directly from its operations.

The financial assets of the Company were as follows:
2017

Cash at bank and in hand 61,643 62,361
Trade and other receivables 173,506 132,787
235,149 195,148
The Directors consider that the carrying amount for all financial assets approximates to their fair value.

2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Trade payables (100,312) (67,759)
Accruals (28,708) (24,000)
(129,020) (91,759)
The Directors consider that the carrying amount for all financial liabilities approximates to their fair value.
Financial risk management
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management 
oversees the management of these risks and ensures that the Company’s financial risk taking is governed by appropriate policies 
and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Company policies and Company 
risk appetite.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. At the year end the Company has no borrowings and therefore the exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the rates 
received as interest income on cash deposits. The Company accepts the risk of losing interest on deposits due to interest rate 
reductions. Due to the limited exposure to interest rate risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared. Financial statements
91 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
20 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
Financial risk management continued
Foreign currency risk
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk when dealing with customers and suppliers who wish to be billed in a currency 
other than Pounds Sterling. As the vast majority of transactions are with UK customers and are denominated in Pounds Sterling, the 
Directors consider this foreign currency risk to be small and do not hedge this risk due to the limited exposure. The level of foreign 
currency transactions is monitored closely to ensure that the level of exposure is manageable. Due to the limited exposure to 
currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to 
a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and from its 
financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Trade receivables
Credit risk from trade receivables is managed in accordance with the Company’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. A customer’s credit quality is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard 
and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. At 31 July 2017, the Company had 1,013 accounts (2016: 871) that owed 
the Company more than £25,000 each. These accounts accounted for approximately 14% (2016: 14%) of total customers and 84% 
(2016: 82%) of the total value of amounts receivable. There were 297 customers (2016: 250 customers) with balances greater than 
£100,000 accounting for just over 4% (2016: 4%) of the total number of receivable accounts and 63% (2016: 58%) of the total value 
of amounts receivable.
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each reporting date. The calculation is based on actual incurred historical data. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The Company does 
not hold collateral as security. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low as there 
is limited reliance on single, or a few, customers; instead, sales are typically small in size but large in volume as are the number 
of customers. This is illustrated by the fact that no more than 3% of receivables are due from any one customer at the year end.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from cash balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with Company policy. The Company 
has significant cash reserves which are accessible immediately and without restriction. Credit risk with respect to cash deposits 
is managed by carefully selecting the institutions with which cash is deposited and spreading its deposits across more than one 
such institution to ease concentration risk. Financial statements

Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk
The Company generates positive cash flows from operating activities and these fund short-term working capital requirements. 
The Company aims to maintain significant cash reserves and none of its cash reserves are subject to restrictions. Access to cash 
is not restricted and could all be drawn upon immediately if so required. The Board carefully monitors the levels of cash deposits 
and is comfortable that for normal operating requirements, no external borrowings are currently required.

Capital risk management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while also maximising the operating 
potential of the business. The capital structure of the Company consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Company Statement of Changes in Equity. The 
Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

substantial sale or substantial business asset sale. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. Furthermore, the vesting of these share options is dependent on continued employment.
Following the public listing of shares in the Company, share options become readily convertible assets for which the Company is liable 
for employer’s National Insurance contributions. The Company accrues for National Insurance contributions on a straight-line basis 
from the date of award to the vesting date. Financial statements

Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
The CSOP provides share options for nominated employees. The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of grant. 
Options typically vest between one and three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant. Options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Company before the options vest.
At 31 July 2017, share options outstanding under the CSOP were as follows:

Total 300,000 500,000 
All CSOP share options outstanding at the year end are in respect of unapproved schemes. No CSOP options were granted in the 
year (2016: 500,000). The fair value of CSOP options granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes model, incorporating relevant 
assumptions for weighted average share price, weighted average exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, 
risk-free interest rate and share option term. The resultant fair value was then spread over the relevant performance period for each 
tranche of share options.

During the year 200,000 (FY16: 4,237,740) CSOP options were exercised with an average weighted share price at the date of exercise 
of £4.09 (2016: £1.18). The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding CSOP options is 8.07 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, 
restrictions and behavioural considerations at the date of granting the options.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the term commensurate 
with the expected term immediately prior to the date of grant. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP provides share awards to Executive Directors and Senior Management.
Executive Directors
Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 49. The awards will vest in 2019 upon achievement of certain performance targets and are

Executive Directors continued
During the year 295,896 (2016: 350,000) share awards related to LTIP schemes were issued to two Executive Directors at nil exercise 
price with a performance period of three years. The performance conditions on these awards include the Executive Director’s 
continued employment at the date of vesting and satisfaction of the performance conditions which are linked to earnings per share 
and total shareholder return over the vesting period. The EPS linked element of the LTIPs awarded in the year were valued using 
the Black-Scholes model and a Monte-Carlo simulation was used for the TSR linked element of the award. The following assumptions 
were used:

Senior Management
An award of 288,244 (2016: nil) shares was made to members of the Executive Leadership Team and other Senior Management in 
the year. These shares had an exercise price of £nil at the date of grant and a performance period of three years. As the exercise 
price of the options awarded in the year was £nil, fair value has been calculated by multiplying the number of share awards issued 
by the share price on the date of grant. The resultant fair value is then recognised over the performance period.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of all LTIP awards is 8.98 years
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The Company operates a SIP for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015. 
Shares were allocated to employees on the basis of length of service. Free shares awarded to an employee under the SIP are subject 
to a holding period ending not earlier than the third anniversary and not later than the fifth anniversary of the date on which beneficial 
interest in the relevant ordinary shares is conferred by the SIP Trustee to the employee.
Historical employee attrition rates have been used to calculate the expected number of shares expected to vest. The resulting income 
statement charge is spread over the three-year vesting period with a corresponding entry in equity.
No free shares were issued in the year under the SIP (2016: 629,883). In total, 63,712 free shares were forfeited in the year. The weighted 
average remaining contractual life of free shares is 1.36 years.
In addition, the Company’s voluntary partnership share purchase programme, which is open to all employees, is administered 
through the SIP.
