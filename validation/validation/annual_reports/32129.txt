Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
6 Halma’s purpose is to protect life 
and improve the quality of life 
through innovative safety, health 
and environmental solutions. 
This provides us with exciting 
opportunities for growth in a diverse 
range of markets and with a strong 
motivation to make a positive 
difference to people’s lives worldwide.
We have a clear growth strategy, a 
simple financial model and a unique 
organisational structure, which is 
customer-focused and enables us 
to adapt quickly to market changes.
Halma has had a well-established 
financial target that aims to double 
our earnings every five years, without 
becoming highly geared or seeking 
further equity, provided there are 
similar rates of organic, acquisitive and 
dividend growth. This aspiration pushes 
our businesses to deliver sustainable 
revenue growth by increasing 
investment in innovation, talent and 
international expansion rather than 
limiting their focus only on operational 
efficiency and short-term profitability.
Over the past five years, we have 
achieved compound annual growth 
rates of 10% for revenue and 11% for 
profit with a good balance between 
organic, acquisition and dividend 
growth. This strong performance 
reflects not only our sound growth 
strategy but also the exceptional 
commitment, abilities and dedication 
of talented individuals in every part 
of Halma. I thank all of them for their 
contribution to this financial success 
and, in the process, realising our 
shared purpose and making a positive 
difference to people’s lives worldwide.
Record revenue and profit
Halma performed strongly over the 
past year, achieving its fourteenth 
consecutive year of record revenue 
and profit.
Revenue increased by 19% to £962m 
(2016: £808m) including 4% organic 
constant currency growth and 10% 
favourable currency impact. Adjusted
1
 
profit increased by 17% to £194m (2016: 
£166m), also including 4% organic 
constant currency growth and 10% 
favourable currency impact. There were 
52 weeks trading in this year compared 
with 53 weeks trading last year.
Returns were maintained at a high level 
with Return on Sales of 20.2% (2016: 
20.6%) well within our targeted range 
of 18% to 22%. Return on Capital 
Employed for our operating companies 
remained high at 72% (2016: 72%). 
The Group’s Return on Total Invested 
Capital was 15.3% (2016: 15.6%).
Cash generation and balance sheet 
supports future growth
Cash generation was good and we 
ended the year with net debt of £196m 
(2016: £247m) after spending £10m on 
current year acquisitions (2016: £193m), 
£24m on capital expenditure 
(2016: £24m), £50m on dividends 
to shareholders (2016: £47m), and 
paying £33m of tax (2016: £27m).
With gearing at the year end (net 
debt to EBITDA) of 0.86 times (2016: 
1.27 times), we have a strong balance 
sheet which can support further 
strategic investment. In November 
2016, we increased and extended our 
revolving credit facilities from £360m 
until 2018 to £550m until 2021. 
Final dividend to increase by 7%
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend increase of 7%, giving a final 
dividend of 8.38p (2016: 7.83p) and a 
total dividend for the year of 13.71p 
(2016: 12.81p). The final dividend 
per share is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 
2017 and will be paid on 16 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 14 July 2017.
Growth in all major regions
A major benefit for businesses within 
Halma is the support they receive 
to build their business in key export 
markets. This year, once again, this 
was reflected in the widespread 
revenue growth achieved in both 
developing and developed regions.
There was impressive growth in Asia 
Pacific where revenue increased 21% 
to £152m (2016: £125m), including 9% 
organic constant currency growth. 
Revenue from China was up by 25% to 
£68m (2016: £54m), with 11% organic 
constant currency growth. Revenue 
from Other regions grew by 16% to 
£99m (2016: £86m) with good growth 
in Canada.
Revenue from Mainland Europe grew 
by 17% to £210m (2016: £179m) 
including 6% organic constant 
currency growth while UK revenue was 
up by 7% to £155m (2016: £145m) with 
5% organic constant currency growth.
The USA remained our largest regional 
market with revenue increasing by 
27% to £345m (2016: £273m) and 1% 
organic constant currency growth. 
Growth in all four sectors
There was revenue and profit growth 
in all four sectors. All sectors achieved 
record revenue and all, except Process 
Safety, also generated record profit.
The Medical sector became our largest 
profit sector for the first time, with 
profit
2
 up by 29% to £66.7m (2016: 
£51.7) including 6% organic constant 
currency growth. Revenue grew by 31% 
to £261m (2016: £199m) with organic 
constant currency growth of 4%. 
Return on Sales remained strong at 
25.6% (2016: 26.0%).
Regionally, the highest rate of organic 
constant currency revenue growth was 
in Asia Pacific and there was good 
progress in China. There were lower 
rates of organic growth in the UK and 
the USA, which is the largest region 
representing 52% of the sector. 
There was a small organic constant 
currency decline in Mainland Europe. 
Visiometrics and CenTrak, acquired 
in December 2015 and February 2016 
respectively, delivered improved 
performances as the year progressed.
Infrastructure Safety profit
2
 grew 
by an impressive 17% to £65.1m 
(2016: £55.6m) and revenue rose 
by 19% to £315m (2016: £265m). 
Both included organic constant 
currency growth of 7%. Return 
on Sales was 20.7% (2016: 21.2%).
There was strong organic constant 
currency revenue growth in Asia Pacific, 
the UK and Mainland Europe (the 
largest region at 30% of the sector) 
supported by excellent progress from 
our Fire and Door Safety businesses. 
There was organic constant currency 
revenue decline in the USA, partly due 
to a weaker performance from our Fire 
businesses, including Firetrace which 
we acquired in October 2015. We have 
continued to strengthen Firetrace’s 
management team from within Halma 
and we expect its performance to 
improve as we move through 2017. 
We remain confident in its longer-term 
growth potential, especially in 
international markets.
The Environmental & Analysis sector 
increased profit
2
 substantially by 
21% to £41.7m (2016: £34.5m), which 
continued the excellent progress made 
last year and included 6% organic 
constant currency growth. Revenue 
grew by 16% to £219m (2016: £189m) 
with organic constant currency growth 
of 4%. Return on Sales improved from 
18.3% to 19.0%.

 rose by 2% to

was a 4% organic constant currency

growth of 4% in the second half of 
the year. Return on Sales for the year 
remained strong at 24.1% (2016: 25.4%).
There was impressive organic constant 
currency growth in the Near and Middle 
East and modest improvements in the 
USA and Mainland Europe. There was 
a small organic revenue decline in the 
UK and reduced demand in our pipeline 
management sub-sector contributed to 
organic revenue decline in Asia Pacific.
In overall terms this was an encouraging 
year and Process Safety is now much 
better placed to sustain growth, with 
less reliance on energy and resources 
markets than one year ago.
One acquisition completed;  
M&A resource strengthened
Our core acquisition strategy is to find 
privately-owned businesses operating 
in niches within safety, health or 
environmental markets. Our search 
efforts are typically focused on our 
core, or closely adjacent, market niches 
although each Halma sector has the 
freedom to find new niches which 
possess the right product, market and 
financial characteristics. In almost all 
cases we acquire 100% of an entity but 
we will consider a minority investment 
to gain access to potentially valuable 
intellectual property if an outright 
purchase is not appropriate or possible.
Our sector-focused organisation 
model gives us the scalability to 
continue acquiring small-to-medium 
sized businesses to achieve our 
strategic growth objectives. We are 
also able to sell and merge businesses 
relatively easily should specific market 
dynamics change. This active portfolio 
management has meant the number 
of businesses within Halma has 
been relatively stable, reducing 
the potential for concerns over 
management’s increasing span-of-
control as we grow. In 2007, Halma 
had revenue of £355m from 39 
operating companies while today, 
we have revenue of £962m from 42 
operating companies.
During the year, we added further M&A 
resource to our four sector boards and 
the benefits of this are becoming 
apparent in the improved balance 
of our acquisition pipeline across 
The highest rates of organic constant 
currency revenue growth were 
achieved in Asia Pacific, with China 
achieving double-digit growth and 
now contributing 12% of sector 
revenue. There was good growth in 
the USA and solid progress in the UK. 
Mainland Europe saw organic revenue 
decline after weaker demand 
from certain OEM customers 
headquartered in the region.
During the year we completed the 
restructuring of our photonics 
coatings business, Pixelteq. The 
exceptional costs associated with this 
project were reported in our first half 
results. The profitability benefits 
started to emerge in the final quarter 
of 2016/17 and are expected to make a 
positive contribution to profit growth 
in the 2017/18 financial year, despite 
the small revenue reduction arising 
from this consolidation.
The Process Safety sector’s 
performance improved as the year 
progressed, benefiting from sustained 
increased investment in market 
diversification and improving demand 
from the US onshore energy market in 
the second half of the year. Revenue 
increased by 7% to a record £167m 
(2016: £155m) with a relatively

8 sectors and in the increasing number 
of visits made to targeted businesses. 
The M&A market continues to be 
competitive with high multiples being 
paid for businesses in many of our 
attractive market niches. This 
highlights the need for us to build 
strong relationships with business 
owners, sometimes over a number of 
years, so that they already see Halma 
as a great home for their business 
when they eventually decide to sell. 
Every transaction is approved by the 
Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director, with all deals 
£10m or over requiring Halma plc 
Board approval.
In January 2017, we acquired FluxData, 
a New York based manufacturer of 
advanced multi-spectral and digital 
imaging systems for multiple market 
segments including industrial and 
medical applications. FluxData builds on 
multi-spectral imaging capabilities that 
already exist in our Environmental & 
Analysis sector. Joining Halma offers 
FluxData the opportunity to access 
new niches and regions for safety, 
health and environmental markets. 
The consideration paid was 
US$12m (£9.9m) with further 
contingent consideration of up 
to US$15.5m (£12.8m) based on 
its performance to 31 March 2019.
Increasing strategic investment for 
growth and the 4
th
 Industrial Revolution
We have a clear understanding of how 
we want our businesses to benefit 
from being part of Halma. We 
demonstrate this by making targeted 
central investments and building a 
strong collaborative culture. Over 
the past decade, our primary focus 
has been on Talent Development, 
Innovation and International 
Expansion. These central investments 
have led to individual sector initiatives 
targeted at opportunities and 
challenges which are particularly 
relevant to that sector.
Increasingly, we are seeing the 
opportunities and challenges of the  
‘4
th
 Industrial Revolution’ and we are 
gaining a better appreciation of the 
influential role that we can play in the 
development of our safety, health and 
environmental markets. Many of 
our businesses have been using or 
experimenting with technologies such 
as robotics and 3D printing for some 
time. Increasingly our products are 
sensing, analysing and communicating 
data either as part of a larger 
connected system or as stand-alone 
solutions. In order to be successful in 
this changing world the ability to 
combine technologies is increasingly 
important and we are relentlessly 
improving our collaborative capabilities. 
We have completed the search for 
the new role of Chief Innovation 
and Digital Officer for the Halma 
Executive Board and are pleased to 
announce that Inken Braunschmidt will 
be joining the Group in early July 2017. 
Inken will be joining us from innogy SE, 
a renewables energy company based in 
Essen, Germany and spun out of RWE 
in 2016. In recent years, Inken led the 
innovation and digital transformation 
at RWE with a customer and people-
centred approach. Prior to that, Inken 
was MD of RWE’s Strategy and 
Management Consultancy practice. 
Her role at Halma will similarly be 
critical in both accelerating the 
development of innovative digital 
strategies and in building a stronger 
collaborative community both inside 
the Group and with external partners.
In April 2017, we held our biennial 
innovation, collaboration and 
experimentation event, HITEx in 
San Diego, USA. Board members 
from all Halma companies attended 
a three-day event which included 
sessions focused on harnessing new 
technologies, developing more 
ambitious growth strategies and 
understanding the value of strategic 
partnerships. As always, the event 
highlighted the impressive capabilities 
and growth potential of our businesses 
but also reminded us of the need to 
constantly improve and change in 
order to be successful in the future.
R&D spend increased  
to 5.3% of revenue
New product innovation is a vital 
component of creating organic 
growth and enables each Halma 
company to increase its revenue 
and profitability through market 
share gain and market expansion.
Our investment in new product 
development increased substantially, 
with a record R&D spend up by 23% 
to £50.6m (2016: £41.2m). This was a 
13% increase at constant currency and 
represented 5.3% of Group revenue 
(2016: 5.1%), also a new record.
The decentralised nature of Halma 
means that each Halma company 
determines its own R&D spend 
according to its market opportunity. 
All four sectors increased R&D spend 
with the relative investment levels 
ranging from 3.6% of revenue for 
Process Safety up to 6.9% for 
Environmental & Analysis.
We track the effectiveness of this 
investment in a variety of ways 
including the proportion of revenue 
generated from new products 
launched in the past three years. 
Over the past four years, the average 
contribution to Group revenue from 
products launched in the past three 
years has been around 22% although 
the individual company metrics range 
from single digit to over 50%.
Since 2004, the best examples of 
innovation in Halma have been 
celebrated and recognised each year 
through the Halma Annual Innovation 
Awards. All employees are able to 
enter, offering them a first prize of 
£20,000. This year the winner of 
the New Product award was BEA’s 
Flatscan laser sensor, which has 
transformed safety in swinging doors 
as well as promising further growth 
opportunities in other markets. 
First prize in the Process award was 
Fortress Interlocks’ online interactive 
tool which helps customers easily 
configure and order customised 
products from a standard product 
platform. The Collaboration 
category was won by Ocean Optics 
and Fiberguide who co-developed 
a product to test the authenticity 
of bank notes in China.
Corporate responsibility and 
sustainability is at Halma’s core
Halma’s core strategy is to protect 
life and improve quality of life for 
people worldwide. Our primary market 
growth drivers mean that Halma 
companies operate in markets in 
which their products contribute 
positively to the wider community. 
These market characteristics and our 
commitment to health and safety, the 
environment and people development 
are reflected in the values held by our 
employees and our operating culture. 
A detailed report on our approach to 
Corporate Responsibility, including 
our CO
2
 emissions reduction 
performance, is on pages 56 to 59.
Outlook
Halma operates in a diverse range 
of market niches where demand 
is supported by resilient long-term 
growth drivers. We are able to grow 
faster than our markets through 
sustainable and increasing investment 
in innovation, international expansion 
and strategy-led talent management. 
Our growth mind-set extends to our 
M&A activity where we buy businesses 
to increase investment for growth 
rather than reduce costs.
Since the period end, order intake has 
continued to be ahead of revenue and 
order intake last year. We expect to 
make further progress in the year 
ahead in line with our expectations.

stakeholders’ needs 
Chief Executive Q&A
Q
What is Halma’s  
financial model?
Halma has a simple financial model. 
Our aspiration is to double every five 
years, through a mix of acquisitions 
and organic growth. Because we 
generate high returns and strong cash 
generation, we are able to invest for 
growth as well paying an increasing 
dividend to shareholders.
Q 
What is  
Halma’s strategy?
We choose markets with resilient 
growth drivers, including increased 
safety regulation, increasing demand 
for healthcare and life-critical 
resources (e.g. water). Within these 
markets, we select product niches 
with strong intellectual property that 
deliver high, sustainable returns. 
We have an agile, de-centralised 
operating model which makes 
sure resources are placed close to 
customers. We drive organic growth 
through investment in innovation 
(e.g. R&D spend has grown from 
£15.3m to £50.6m since 2007), 
international expansion (e.g. revenue 
from outside the UK, Europe 
and the USA has increased from 
£67.8m to £251.1m since 2007) 
and talent (a major priority and 
competitive differentiator for us). 
Acquisitions are also an important 
part of our growth.
Q 
How do this year’s results 
reflect Halma’s strategy?
These results show the benefits of 
our market and geographic diversity. 
Having an agile and flexible operating 
model means our businesses can 
adjust quickly to their markets, as 
opportunities change. Having a 
de-centralised model is at the heart 
of our financial performance – 
supporting 14 consecutive years of 
record revenues, profits and dividends.
Q
How has Halma performed  
over the long term?
Very strongly. Halma’s growth and 
consistency is a key differentiator. 
The Group has delivered revenue 
growth in 41 of the past 43 years, 
and a return on sales higher than 16% 
for the past 32 years. Over the past 
decade, revenue has grown every year, 
from £355m to £962m, a CAGR of 
c.10%. In the same period, profit has 
grown from £66m to £194m. This has 
enabled us to increase our dividend 
by 5% or more every year for the 
past 38 years.
Q 
What does Halma look 
for in acquisitions?
We typically acquire relatively small 
businesses, in the £10m to £100m 
price range, that share Halma’s 
key characteristics. They operate in, 
and adjacent to, our existing markets 
and are financially strong. Most of 
these deals we source ourselves.
Q
What is Halma’s acquisition track 
record over the past ten years?
Our strong financial resources have 
enabled us to spend £645m on 
26 acquisitions since 2007. In the 
last few years, we have added 
dedicated M&A resources at sector 
level, making us well placed to 
continue this successful track record.
Q
How will Halma sustain  
its future growth?
Halma’s strategy is based on growth, 
organically and through acquisitions. 
In 2014 we created four sectors, 
‘mini Halmas’ – Process Safety, 
Infrastructure Safety, Medical and 
Environmental & Analysis – each with 
the potential to be the size of Halma 
today. This gives us a structure to 
support growth over the medium to 
long term, while retaining the unique, 
decentralised operating model that 
has driven our success. The sector 
set-up means we can maintain the 
current pace of acquisitions and 
continue to focus on relatively small 
companies. It is also helping to drive 
organic growth – for example, through 
sharing technology, pooling information 
on our customers and collaborating 
for international expansion.

Market Review
Understanding and responding  
to changes in market trends
our expertise in this area enables 
us to respond quickly and build 
competitive advantage.
Halma is exposed to a very diverse 
range of carefully selected niche 
markets, each with its own unique 
drivers. As a result, macro-economic 
Macro-economic, regulatory 
and competitive environment 
Halma’s strategy is to develop market 
positions primed for growth over 
10 years or more. Our operating 
companies have growth strategies 
with three to five year horizons.
Our focus is on supplying safety, 
health and environmental products 
that protect life and improve the 
quality of life worldwide. We position 
our businesses in relatively resilient 
markets. Our chosen markets benefit 
from resistance to cyclical economic 
downturn, high barriers to entry and 
long-term growth driven by:
 — increasing health and 
safety regulation
 — increasing demand for healthcare
 — increasing demand for life-
critical resources
Most of our markets are underpinned 
by regulation. This drives sustained 
demand throughout economic cycles 
and often makes customer spending 
non-discretionary. Our companies’ 
strong market positions deliver 
upgrade and replacement sales 
opportunities as customers seek 
to maintain regulatory compliance 
and conform with best practice.
Our competitive environment is 
influenced by global, regional and 
national product approvals and 
technical validations. Compliance 
with new and updated product 
regulations is a steadily increasing 
cost and technical challenge, but 
factors affect our businesses’ 
competitive environment very 
differently depending on their market 
segment and geographic exposure.
Our operating companies develop and 
execute their own growth strategies 
and respond to changes in their 
specific markets. Sector management 
teams provide strategic support and 
oversight for wider-reaching and 
longer-term market dynamics. More 
detail about our market segments and 
competitive environment is given in 
the sector reviews on pages 30 to 51.
Our strategy of focusing on 
non-cyclical niche markets with growth 
underpinned by resilient regulatory 
drivers and product approvals provides 
our businesses with genuine stability: 
resilience in challenging economic 
conditions and organic growth 
above prevailing market rates. 
This underlying intrinsic strength 
enables us to plan and to invest for 
the longer-term with confidence.

11 Market Review
continued
In 2017 global economic growth is 
forecast to rise moderately to 3.4%. 
In the advanced economies growth 
is expected to edge up to 1.9%. 
Growth in our largest market, the USA, 
is forecast at 2.5% but government 
fiscal stimulus could raise growth 
higher. Steady growth is anticipated 
in both Europe and Central Asia during 
2017 with a forecast of 2.4%. The 
strongest economic growth in 2017 is 
expected in emerging markets and 
developing economies, where it should 
rise to 4.5%. The fast-growing Chinese 
and Indian economies are predicted 
to grow by 6.5% and 7.2% respectively 
during 2017.
Growth trends in the global economy 
for 2017/18, in both developed and 
developing economies, are broadly 
favourable for our businesses. We 
expect developing socio-economic 
conditions in Asia and South America 
to drive rising demand for our 
products used to make workplaces 
safer, provide healthcare, improve 
infrastructure safety and manage 
life-critical resources.
Increasing health and safety regulation 
Most of the world’s work-related 
deaths, injuries and illnesses are 
preventable and employers must 
comply with increasingly strict 
government laws and regulations  
to protect their workers, the 
environment and their assets 
from workplace hazards.
Each year more countries give higher 
priority to occupational safety and 
health, and the prevention of accidents 
and work-related illness. Governments 
and employers increasingly recognise 
the major impact that workplace 
accidents and disease have on 
productivity, competitiveness and 
business reputation, as well as on 
the health and livelihoods of workers 
and their families.
Alongside increasing regional,  
country and industry-specific laws  
and regulations, globalisation has 
encouraged many multinational 
employers to extend workplace health 
and safety practice across their 
worldwide operations, particularly 
in developing economies. These factors 
drive demand for our Process Safety 
and Infrastructure Safety products.
Every year more than 2.3 million 
workers die from occupational 
accidents or work-related disease; 
a death every 15 seconds. 317 million 
non-fatal work accidents occur 
annually. Workplace fatalities, injuries 
and illness are a serious human and 
financial problem for workers and 
their families and a social and 
economic burden for businesses, 
communities and national economies.
There is a global trend for governments 
and employers to recognise the 
significant social and economic impact 
of poor occupational safety and 
health practice. In addition to the 
effects of work accidents and illness 
on individuals, the resulting absence, 
disability benefits, compensation, 
interruption of production and medical 
expenses are a financial burden. 
The macro-economic cost of 
occupational injuries, illness, disability 
and incapacity is estimated to average

12 4% of global GDP. In countries with 
less developed occupational health 
and safety, a far higher proportion of 
GDP is spent on work-related injury 
and illness, reducing capital resources 
for productive economic investment. 
The International Labor Organization 
estimates that work-related illness 
and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP 
in Latin America, compared with 
under 4% in the EU. In the USA, 
worker illness and injury now costs 
employers US$225 billion each year.
Safety and health at work standards 
and practices vary considerably 
between countries, economic sectors 
and social groups. However, they are 
generally improving and becoming 
more closely aligned. Deaths and 
injuries take a particularly heavy toll 
in developing countries, where a large 
part of the population may work 
in hazardous conditions. However, 
greater investment and advances in 
occupational safety are reducing the 
number of fatal accidents at work.
Governments around the world are 
prompted by deaths and injuries 
caused by accidents to introduce 
new and tougher regulations to 
protect people from harm in 
commercial buildings and public 
places. The continuous introduction 
of new, mandatory building codes 
affecting fire protection, building 
security, automated doors and 
elevators drives demand for our 
Infrastructure Safety products.
Increasing demand for healthcare 
The continuous rise in healthcare 
demand and spending worldwide is 
driven by a combination of factors:
 — growth and ageing of the 
global population
 — rising life expectancy
 — increasing chronic disease
 — medical innovations
 — rising incomes
 — increasing patient expectations
Population ageing, together with a 
rising prevalence of age-related 
chronic disease, is affecting all regions 
of the world in both the developed 
and developing economies. These 
demographic changes combine to 
form a strong long-term driver 
for healthcare services and products 
in our Medical and Environmental & 
Analysis sectors. Continuous advances 
in medical technology and therapies 
stimulate demand for new equipment. 
Driven by a global trend of declining 
fertility and rising longevity, the 
number of people aged over 65 is 
forecast to more than triple between 
2010 and 2050. Life expectancy 
is expected to rise from 72.7 years in 
2013 to 73.7 years by 2018. As a result, 
over 10% of the world’s population will 
be over 65. In the USA, the world’s 
largest healthcare market, increasing 
life expectancy is predicted to double 
the number of people over 65 by 2050.
Although developed countries have 
the oldest population profiles (about 
20% of people in Japan, Germany 
and Italy are aged 65 or over), the 
large majority of older people, and 
the fastest rates of population ageing, 
are in the less developed economies. 
About 9% of China’s population 
is currently aged over 65, but the 
proportion is expected to rise to 
around 12% in 2020. By that time 
health services for the elderly will 
account for nearly 23% of China’s 
total healthcare spending. Almost two 
thirds of the world’s older people will 
live in Asia by 2050.
As fertility rates fall globally, the pace 
of population growth is slowing in 
almost every region except Africa. 
In 2015 the global population reached 
7.3 billion, almost three times higher 
than in 1950. Despite the falling rate 
of growth, world population is still 
projected to rise to 8.5 billion by 2030. 
Almost 40% of growth in the global 
population during 2015 to 2030 is 
expected in Africa.
Global healthcare spending – about 
10% of global GDP – is forecast to 
grow faster than the global economy 
over the next few years, rising from 
US$7 trillion in 2015 to US$8.8 trillion 
by 2020. While the global healthcare 
market is still dominated by the 
developed world, government 
spending as a proportion of GDP 
is projected to rise at the fastest 
rate in the developing economies. 
Advanced economies such as the USA, 
Europe and Japan spend about 12% 
of GDP on healthcare; developing 
economies average about 6% of GDP. 
Almost two thirds of the world’s total 
healthcare expenditure occurs in the 
developed economies, with the USA 
alone responsible for 40% of the 
global spend.
In addition to the powerful 
demographic healthcare demand 
drivers of global population ageing and 
population growth, rising affluence is 
also a strong driver in the developing 
world. Healthcare spending in 
emerging nations is forecast to rise 
dramatically. The strongest growth 
forecast of 15% is India, with annual 
growth in China estimated at over 
12% supported by government 
investment and initiatives to improve 
the accessibility and quality of 
healthcare.

13 The incidence rates of cancer, heart 
disease, stroke, respiratory disease, 
diabetes and hypertension have risen 
sharply in the past decade, particularly 
in developing regions. These chronic 
diseases are the leading cause of 
mortality worldwide due to population 
ageing, more sedentary lifestyles, 
changing diets and rising obesity. 
Halma’s focus on ophthalmology and 
advanced blood pressure monitoring 
products directly relates to the 
diagnosis and treatment of these 
chronic and age-related diseases. 
Increasing demand for  
life-critical resources 
Continuous growth in demand for 
life-critical resources is the result 
of social and economic development. 
According to the United Nations, 
almost 3 billion people in 48 countries 
will be facing water shortages within 
10 years that could cause conflict and 
political destabilisation. By 2030 there 
will be a global freshwater deficit of 
40%. Global electricity demand is 
forecast to double by 2060.
Rising energy consumption and water 
usage is driven by four key trends:
 — population growth
 — economic growth
 — rising living standards
 — dietary and agricultural changes
During the 20
th
 century water 
consumption grew twice as fast as 
the world population. Water scarcity 
is now highlighted by the World 
Economic Forum as the most 
serious risk that our planet faces. 
Water consumption is driven by 
long-term trends: growing populations, 
rising affluence, industrialisation and 
urbanisation in emerging markets, 
and outdated water infrastructure 
in industrialised countries. These same 
trends have led to the pollution of 
water resources, further reducing 
the capacity of the natural water  
cycle to meet the world’s growing 
water demand.
The problem with access to fresh 
water is not its finite volume but 
inadequate distribution which 
is largely dependent on economic 
resources. Affluent countries manage 
water resources to meet demand, 
but developing economies often lack 
basic infrastructure to deliver clean, 
safe water.
Over 4 billion people (about two thirds 
of the global population) currently 
live with severe water scarcity for at 
least one month a year. Half a billion 
people live in regions where water 
consumption from underground 
aquifers is continuously depleted 
because abstraction is double the 
volume of water replenished by 
rain every year. By 2025, 1.8 billion 
people are predicted to face 
absolute water scarcity.
Climate change and global warming 
also raise pressure on the world’s 
freshwater resources. Rising 
temperatures in agricultural areas 
increase the rate of water evaporation 
from soil and crop transpiration, 
raising irrigation demand. Higher 
temperatures also raise energy 
consumption through increasing 
use of air conditioning.
Current water consumption patterns 
are unsustainable. By 2050, the United 
Nations expects global agriculture to 
produce 60% more food (100% more 
in developing countries), but the current 
growth rate of agricultural water 
consumption cannot be sustained. 
Industrial demand for water is 
predicted to rise by 400% between 
2000 to 2050, with the highest 
increases in emerging economies.
Competition for water resources 
is forecast to increase between 
industries and economic sectors, and 
between countries in both developed 
and developing regions. The rising 
value of finite water resources drives 
demand for our water conservation, 
treatment and testing products.
Market Review
continued
Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
14 Rising affluence in developing 
economies lets people change their 
diet from starch-based foods to meat 
and dairy, which significantly raises 
agricultural water consumption. 
Producing one kilo of rice uses  
3,500 litres of water but it takes 
15,000 litres to produce a kilo of beef. 
Dietary change has been the primary 
driver of global water consumption 
over the past 30 years, a trend which 
is expected to continue well into the 
middle of the 21
st
 century.
Rising demand for energy and water 
is strongly linked. Power generation, 
fossil fuel extraction, transport and 
processing, and biofuel crop irrigation 
all consume large volumes of water. 
Water used in energy production can 
also degrade freshwater resources by 
reducing the downstream volume and 
quality. Energy is vital to provide fresh 
water, powering the systems that 
collect, transport, distribute and treat 
it. After agriculture, energy production 
is the second largest water consumer 
worldwide. Energy uses about 15% 
of the world’s total water withdrawal, 
but this is expected to rise by 20% 
by 2035.
In recent years water shortages have 
shut down thermal power plants in 
India, affected energy production 
in US power plants and threatened 
hydropower electricity generation in 
many countries, including Sri Lanka, 
China and Brazil.
The World Energy Council reports that 
energy demand growth is slowing and 
that per capita energy demand will 
peak before 2030. New technology, 
government policies and reduced 
expectations of economic growth will 
significantly affect the energy sector in 
coming decades. Despite a levelling of 
the per capita energy demand, global 
energy consumption will continue to 
rise due to population growth, rising 
affluence and urbanisation.
While global GDP is forecast to  
double over the next 20 years, total 
energy demand is predicted to rise 
by only 30% due to technological 
improvements in energy use and 
environmental concerns. The large 
majority of the extra energy will be 
consumed in fast-growing emerging 
economies; energy use within 
developed economies is predicted 
to remain largely unchanged.
The oil and gas segment of the energy 
market consists of three sectors: 
upstream (exploration and production), 
midstream (storage, processing 
and distribution), and downstream 
(oil refining and raw gas processing).
Although industry analysts predict 
that oil prices will rise gradually during 
the next few years, the impact of the 
heavy price downturn in 2014 is 
continuing to limit capital investment 
by the oil majors in most regions. 
During 2016 capital investment in 
upstream projects remained under 
extreme pressure. The deepest 
upstream spending cuts have been 
in the USA, but capital investment is 
largely unchanged in Saudi Arabia 
and most of the Middle East. 
Investment continues in midstream and 
downstream oil and gas storage and 
refinery projects where our Process 
Safety products have most exposure.
The oil price downturn is expected to 
have a long-term effect on capital 
investment in the oil and gas sector 
and the recent capital allocation trend 
has shifted towards shorter-cycle 
projects. It is estimated that around 
US$620 billion of projects through to 
2020 have been deferred or cancelled.
We expect several of our businesses 
will see a continued fall in revenue 
from upstream oil and gas projects. 
However, a combination of long-term 
growth in energy demand, rising 
capital expenditure in refining, 
petrochemicals and pipelines in the 
oil and gas midstream/downstream 
sectors, and in alternative energy 
markets like wind farm power 
generation, will offer growth and 
diversification opportunities for our 
businesses affected by the short-term 
oil price fall.
As global demand for water resources 
becomes unsustainable, the value of 
conservation, improving efficiency 
and effective monitoring is growing. 
Several of our Environmental & 
Analysis sector businesses operate 
in markets driven by the global trends

Through careful selection of our market niches 
and strategic investment in people development, 
international expansion and innovation we aim to 
achieve organic growth in excess of our blended 
market growth rate, broadly matching revenue 
and profit growth in the medium term. We buy 
companies with business and market characteristics 
similar to those of existing Halma operations. 
Acquired businesses have to be a good fit with our 
operating culture and strategy in addition to being 
value-enhancing financially.

Organic profit growth is 
calculated at constant currency 
and measures the change in 
adjusted profit achieved in the 
current year compared with the 
prior year from continuing Group 
operations. The effect of 
acquisitions and disposals 
made during the current or 
prior financial year has 
been eliminated.
Organic profit growth at 
constant currency was just 
below our target, however 
adjusting for the shorter 
accounting period in 2016/17 it is 
estimated to be above target. 
There were strong performances 
in Environmental & Analysis, 
Infrastructure Safety and 
Medical sectors, with a good 
recovery in Process Safety. 
The Board has established a 
long-term organic growth target 
of 5% per annum, slightly above 
the blended long-term average 
growth rate of our markets.
Growth in organic profit is a key 
element of the economic value 
added performance which forms 
the basis of the annual bonus 
plan, requiring consistent 
annual and longer-term growth, 
rewarding disciplined financial 
performance.

Acquisition profit growth 
measures the annualised profit 
(net of financing costs) from 
acquisitions made in the year, 
measured at the date of 
acquisition, expressed as a 
percentage of prior year profit. 
Acquisition profit fell short of 
our target of 5% for the year, 
with only one acquisition 
completed. Sector acquisition 
resource has been increased 
further and the acquisition 
pipeline is more balanced across 
the sectors.
Acquisitions must meet our 
demanding criteria and we 
continue to have a strong 
pipeline of opportunities to  
meet our 5% growth target.
Growth in acquired profit is 
the second key element of 
the Economic Value Added 
performance which forms the 
basis of the annual bonus plan, 
requiring consistent annual and 
longer-term growth, rewarding 
disciplined financial performance.
The measure of how successful we are in growing our 
business organically and by acquisition coupled with 
strong financial disciplines, including those related 
to tax and capital allocation, is captured in the 
Group’s adjusted earnings per share.

Performance was strong and

We aim for the combination of 
organic and acquisition growth 
to exceed 10% per annum over 
the long term. The Directors 
consider that adjusted earnings 
represent a more consistent 
measure of underlying 
performance.
EPS provides a clear link to the

provides a clear line of sight for

2017 saw our inaugural engagement survey 
(building on our previous values survey) and 
established a baseline engagement level 
which sets our future target. It is pleasing 
that the Group’s results were on par with the

The results will be communicated throughout

of hours worked in that period by employees 
(including temporary staff and any overtime) 
multiplied by 100,000 hours (representing the 
estimated number of working hours in an

represents an indication of how many incidents 
employees will have in their working lives.
*  Specified major injury incidents are reportable 
incidents which result in more than three working 
days lost
The Health & Safety AFR performance this 
year was 0.12 (2016: 0.11) representing a 
slight increase on last year. We continue 
to review all reported incidents and there 
are no specific underlying patterns which 
cause concern.
The target is maintained at 0.09 to match 
the health and safety performance which 
was achieved in 2014, with a view to 
ultimately setting a reportable incident 
target rate of zero.
Halma development programmes provide key

Engagement of Group employees as 
measured through an externally facilitated 
survey over nine dimensions: engagement, 
empowerment, accountability, collaboration 
& teamwork, communication, development, 
ethics & fair treatment, innovation and 
leadership.
2017 saw our inaugural engagement survey 
(building on our previous values survey) and 
established a baseline engagement level 
which sets our future target. It is pleasing 
that the Group’s results were on par with the 
external normative data.
The results will be communicated throughout 
the Group and used to inform organisational 
goals; we aim to ensure that our results 
match or improve on our target of 74% and 
are comparable or better than the external 
peer group benchmark.
Safety is critical and a major priority for the Group. 
Halma collects details of its worldwide reported 
health and safety incidents and encourages all Group 
companies to seek continuous improvement in their 
health and safety records and culture.

The year-to-date Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR) is the total number of reportable* 
incidents in the period divided by the number 
of hours worked in that period by employees 
(including temporary staff and any overtime) 
multiplied by 100,000 hours (representing the 
estimated number of working hours in an 
employee’s work lifetime). The AFR figure 
represents an indication of how many incidents 
employees will have in their working lives.
*  Specified major injury incidents are reportable 
incidents which result in more than three working 
days lost
The Health & Safety AFR performance this 
year was 0.12 (2016: 0.11) representing a 
slight increase on last year. We continue 
to review all reported incidents and there 
are no specific underlying patterns which 
cause concern.
The target is maintained at 0.09 to match 
the health and safety performance which 
was achieved in 2014, with a view to 
ultimately setting a reportable incident 
target rate of zero.
Halma development programmes provide key 
personnel with the necessary skills they need in their 
current and future roles; new programmes include 
non-executive director opportunities, enterprise 
programmes and sales management development, 
alongside our refreshed executive, manager and 
graduate programmes.

19 Risk Management and Internal Controls
Maintaining a robust risk
and control framework
Group internal control system
The processes which the Board has applied in reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control are 
summarised below:
Internal control
The Board meets regularly throughout 
the year with agenda planning looking 
forward at least one year designed to 
ensure all significant topics are 
scheduled for discussion. This is within 
the framework of an adopted schedule 
of matters which are required to 
be brought to it for decision. This 
procedure ensures that the Directors 
maintain full and effective control over 
all significant strategic, financial and 
organisational issues and is subject to 
routine review.
During the year, actions to strengthen 
the control environment continue to be 
taken centrally by Group management. 
The sector structure provides additional, 
dedicated personnel who supplement 
and reinforce our controls and the 
culture in which we operate within the 
subsidiaries themselves. The duties 
and responsibilities of management 
are continually refreshed as well as 
documented. The Group’s policies and 
procedures were relaunched on a secure 
web-based portal and have been 
updated to be in a more user-friendly 
format. The portal also includes links 
to the additional guidance given to all 
subsidiary managing directors and 
subsidiary finance directors. Such 
guidance not only includes compliance 
and financial policies but also includes 
aspects ranging from our Group 
benefits and incentives to information 
related to the internal  financial review 
procedures conducted to complement 
the operating control environment. 
We continue to strengthen the internal 
and external resources utilised in the 
identification of, and investigation into, 
potential acquisitions. Our approach 
and policies are particularly designed 
to ensure a rapid and successful 
integration following acquisition. The 
scope of the Group’s policies and the 
programme of compliance audits are 
regularly reviewed to ensure they are 
sufficient to address current risks. 
The Group placed additional emphasis 
on updating our business continuity 
plans over recent years ensuring that 
they are mutually complementary to 
our insurance programme.
The Group’s treasury-related policies 
are kept under review to ensure that 
appropriate accounting and banking 
arrangements are aligned with 
the Group’s growth and to ensure 
continued compliance with covenants 
and accounting requirements.
The Internal Audit function operates 
independently, reporting to the Audit 
Committee. Reporting to the Director 
of Risk and Internal Audit, the team of 
three internal auditors, residing in the 
UK, the USA and China, schedule visits 
to Group companies to conduct internal 
audit procedures which have recently 
been benchmarked to reflect changing 
circumstances, specific requirements 
and to enhance effectiveness. The 
results of each internal audit are 
documented for internal distribution 
and action, with an executive summary 
going to the Audit Committee; any 
significant shortcomings identified 
are subject to an escalation process 
to ensure matters are assessed 
and disclosed to the Committee on 
a timely basis. The team may also be 
involved in any special investigations 
that may arise at the direction of the 
Company Secretary.
Group risk is mitigated by means of an 
operating structure which spreads the 
Group’s activities across a number of 
autonomous subsidiary companies. 
Each of these companies is overseen 
by sector executives and led by a 
high-quality board of directors 
including a finance executive. 
The introduction of internal non-
executive director opportunities within 
the Group during 2017 will provide 
further, mutually beneficial, oversight 
of operations.
Operating companies, with the oversight of their sector boards, carry out a detailed risk assessment each year and identify 
mitigating actions in place or proposed for each significant risk. A risk register is compiled from this information, against which 
operational risk action is monitored through to resolution and strategic risks are reported to the Group. Management also 
compiles a summary of significant Group risks, documenting existing or planned actions to mitigate, manage or avoid risks. 
Each month the board of every operating company meets, discusses and reports on its operating performance, its opportunities, 
the risks facing it and the resultant actions. The relevant Sector Chief Executive or Sector Vice President chairs this meeting. Sector 
Chief Executives meet regularly with the Chief Executive and Finance Director and report on sector progress to the Executive Board.
 
Financial and trading ‘warning signs’ are reported to Group and sector management. Weekly data on cash management, sales 
and orders are also reported directly to the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the Group finance team. This framework 
is designed to provide an early warning of potential risks and to direct appropriate action where necessary.
The Chief Executive submits a report to each Halma plc Board meeting which includes the main features of Group operations and 
an analysis of the significant risks and opportunities facing the Group. The papers also cover progress against strategic objectives 
and shareholder-related issues. The Finance Director also submits a separate financial report to each Halma plc Board meeting.
Regular Director visits to Group companies are scheduled and open access to the subsidiary company boards is encouraged; 
periodic and risk-based internal control visits are carried out by internal audit or senior finance staff resulting in actions being 
fed back to each company and followed up by senior finance executives and Sector Chief Executives. Reviews are coded in terms 
of risk and a summary of all such reviews is given to the Audit Committee, with any significant control failings being reported 
directly to the Audit Committee; senior finance staff also conduct financial reviews at each operating company before 
publication of half-year and year end results. We have a Group-wide IT policy supported by a programme of IT health checks. 
Group IT manages aspects of our cyber security risks and IT development needs.
The Chief Executive, Finance Director and Internal Audit function report to the Audit Committee on all aspects of internal 
control, and the Company Secretary reports any significant matters raised through the whistleblowing channels with the Audit 
Committee and the Board. Regular reports are received by the Board from the Audit Committee Chairman and the papers and 
minutes of the Audit Committee meetings are used as a basis for its annual review of internal control.

Strategic Risk Management
 — review and management of the strategic risks of 
the Group with visibility of the sector risks;
 — consideration of the environment in which the 
Group operates; and
 — setting the risk appetite of the Group.
 — delivery of Group strategic actions; and 
 — monitoring Group key risk indicators.
 — execution of any Group–level strategic actions; and 
 — reporting on any identified key risks and mitigation 
progress.

The diagram below summarises our complementary integrated approach to risk management which is consistent 
with the Group’s structure. Halma has also refined the timings of the Group-wide risk assessment as well as the 
division of responsibility for the risk review cycle throughout the year.
Bottom Up 
Operational Risk Management
 — assessment of the effectiveness of risk 
management systems across the Group; and
 — reporting principal risks and uncertainties in the Group.
 — reviewing completeness and consistency across 
the sectors and adequacy of mitigation actions;
 — consideration of the aggregation of risk exposures 
across the businesses; and
 — review/management/consolidation of operational 
risks (both sector and business, delegated as 
the Sector Chief Executive deems appropriate).
 — reporting of significant and emerging risks to the Group;
 — identification, evaluation, prioritisation, mitigation 
and monitoring of operational risks which are the 
responsibility of each subsidiary company; and
 — identification of strategic risks which are reported 
to the Group.

Embedding internal control and risk 
management within the operations 
of the business and dealing with 
areas of improvement which come 
to management’s and the Board’s 
attention is a continuous process 
and one which is subject to 
rigorous scrutiny.
Group companies operate under a 
system of controls which includes 
but is not limited to:
 — a defined organisational 
structure with an appropriate 
delegation of authority to 
operational management which 
ensures appropriate segregation 
of key duties
 — the identification and appraisal of 
risks both formally, through the 
annual process of preparing 
business plans and budgets, 
through an annual detailed risk 
assessment carried out at local and 
sector level and informally through 
close monitoring of operations
 — a comprehensive financial reporting 
system, regularly enhanced, within 
which actual and forecast results 
are compared with approved 
budgets and the previous year’s 
figures on a monthly basis. Weekly 
cash/sales/orders reporting, 
including details of financial 
institutions, is also maintained 
within the financial reporting 
system, all of which is reviewed at 
both local, sector and Group level
 — an investment evaluation procedure 
to ensure an appropriate level of 
approval for all capital expenditure 
and other capitalised costs
 — self-certification by operating 
company and sector management 
of compliance and control issues 
with additional verification 
performed centrally
 — a robust structure for electronic 
communication and conducting 
e-commerce to ensure that the 
Group is not adversely impacted by 
threats to its IT infrastructure and 
to minimise potential for business 
disruptions. The Group has a wide 
range of measures and policies and  
a framework in place which includes  
a virtual private network covering 
over 100 sites worldwide, secure 
firewalls, an IT security and threat 
monitoring system, information 
management audits, disaster 
recovery and a mobile devices 
management system
 — an acquisitions and disposals 
framework which governs the due 
diligence, negotiation, approval and 
integration processes to ensure 
that value-enhancing, quality 
investments are made in order to 
meet our strategic objectives.

Globalisation 
The global interconnectedness of 
operations poses wide-ranging challenges 
across the Group especially where 
businesses manage operational matters 
via remote locations; the increasing global 
spread of our businesses, particularly in 
China, requires additional vigilance over 
communication, culture, training and 
export controls/sanctions in order to 
anticipate and contain any vulnerabilities.
 — Weakening of financial, tax, audit and legal 
control and divergence from overall Group 
strategy in remote operations, leading to 
businesses taking on more risks than intended 
or unexpected financial outcomes.
 — Failure to comply with local laws and regulations 
in unfamiliar territories, leading to reputational 
issues and legal or regulatory disputes.
 — Continued international growth increases risk.
 — Missed opportunities due to failure to mobilise 
resources efficiently.
 — Control is exercised locally in accordance with the Group’s policy of autonomous 
management. We seek to employ local high-quality experts.
 — The increasing geographic diversity of operating personnel emphasises 
the importance the Group places on local knowledge and experience.
 — The Group’s acquisition model supports retention of management and 
staff in acquired businesses, meaning that local expertise is retained.
 — Sector Chief Executives ensure that overall Group strategy is fulfilled through 
ongoing review of the businesses. The right balance between autonomy and 
adherence to the overall objectives of the Group is a key function of the Sector 
Chief Executives, Sector Vice Presidents and Senior Finance Executives.
 — Regular visits to remote operations and maintenance of key adviser 
relationships by senior management, finance staff and Internal Audit 
support local control.

 — Reduced financial performance arising from 
competitive threats both from third parties 
and customers bringing production in-house.
 — By empowering and resourcing innovation in local operations to respond to 
changing market needs, the potential adverse impact of downward price 
pressure and competition can be mitigated and growth maintained.
 — We recognise the competitive threat coming from emerging economies and 
by operating within these economies, typically using local staff, we are 
better placed to make fast progress ourselves.

Economic conditions 
In times of uncertain economic conditions, 
businesses face additional or elevated 
levels of risk. These include market and 
customer risk, customer default, fraud, 
supply chain risk and liquidity risk. The 
decision made in the UK to leave the EU 
(Brexit) creates additional uncertainty.
 — Reduced financial performance.
 — Loss of market share.
 — Unforeseen liabilities.
 — Disruption of service to customers.
 — Breaches of legal or regulatory requirements 
resulting in fines/penalties impacting the Group 
financially and reputationally.
 — Potential impairment of goodwill.
 — Risks are primarily managed at the operating company level where local 
knowledge is situated. The financial strength and availability of pooled 
finances within the Group mitigates local risks faced by operating companies 
as does the robust credit management processes in place across the Group.
 — The Halma Executive Board identifies any wider trends which require action.
 — A Brexit Committee has been created to assess, monitor and publish 
guidance on potential impacts due to Brexit. The agility of Group 
operations is expected to help mitigate any adverse impacts of Brexit.
 — The Group’s geographic diversity limits its exposure to economic risk arising in 
any one territory. The Group does not have significant operations, cash deposits 
or sources of funding in economically uncertain regions.

Funding 
A key risk is that the Group may run out 
of cash or not have access to adequate 
funding. In addition, cash deposits are 
required to be held in a secure form 
and location.
 — Constraints on trading and/or acquiring new 
companies limiting the Group’s growth aspirations.
 — Availability of additional funding in traditional 
debt markets.
 — Permanent loss of shareholders’ funds  
and/or restrictions on dividend payments.
 — The strong cash flow generated by the Group provides financial flexibility. 
Cash needs are monitored regularly. Gearing has reduced during the year.
 — The Group increased its funding capacity in January 2016 via a US$250m 
US Private Placement. In addition to short-term overdraft facilities, the 
Group renewed and increased to £550m its five-year revolving credit facility 
in November 2016 providing security of funding and sufficient headroom for 
its current needs.
 — Cash deposits are monitored centrally and spread amongst a number of 
high credit-rated banks.

Treasury 
Breaches of banking/US Private 
Placement covenants and foreign 
currency risk are the most significant 
treasury-related risks for the Group. 
In times of increased volatility this can 
have a significant impact on performance. 
The Group is exposed to a lesser extent to 
other treasury risks such as interest rate 
risk and liquidity risk.
 — Volatile financial performance arising from 
translation of earnings from the Group’s 
increasing proportion of overseas operations or 
poorly-managed foreign exchange exposures.
 — Deviation from core strategy through the use of 
speculative or overly complex financial instruments.
 — Financial penalties, reputational damage and 
withdrawal of facilities arising from breach of 
banking/US Private Placement covenants.
 — Increased interest rate risk on higher borrowings.
 — Currency markets continue to be volatile 
causing uncertainty.
 — The risk has increased because more of the Group’s profits are derived from 
non-Sterling currencies. Currency profits are not hedged. Currency hedging 
must fit with the commercial needs of the business and we have in place a 
hedging strategy to manage Group exposures. This requires the hedging of 
a substantial proportion of expected future transactions up to 12 months 
(and in exceptional cases 24 months) ahead. Longer-term currency trends 
can only be covered through a wide geographic spread of operations.
 — The Group does not use overly complex derivative financial instruments 
and no speculative treasury transactions are undertaken.
 — We closely monitor performance against the financial covenants on our 
revolving credit facility and US Private Placement and operate well within 
these covenants.

Keeping Chinese workers 
safe from hazardous gases
Hazardous gases can be problematic in industries as 
diverse as water treatment, oil and gas, construction, 
food processing and manufacturing. In addition to 
portable gas detectors, which are worn by workers 
to keep them safe, we also manufacture fixed gas 
detectors for installation in confined spaces such 
as utility tunnels. Y ou may also see these installed 
in underground car parks to keep you safe.
In response to different requirements, standards and 
specifications, Crowcon’s development team in China 
specifically tailored the company’s fixed gas detector 
range for the Chinese market. The team identified 
that the range needed to evolve and added the 
additional features now expected in the fastest

30 Sector progress summary
The sector has delivered both 
revenue and profit growth in 
difficult market conditions. 
In the first half of the year our major 
market, energy, was still impacted by 
low oil prices. The second half saw 
improvements with a combination 
of stabilised oil prices and positive 
progress in our diversification strategy.
These factors and investment made 
during the year have positioned the 
sector to continue to grow in 2017/18.
Market trends and growth drivers
Population growth and economic 
development drive demand for 
life-critical resources. The industrial 
processes supporting this 
development are at risk from 
accidents caused by explosions, 
radiation, fire, corrosion and other 
hazards. Workers and assets 
are exposed to these dangers.
Every year, industrial accidents have 
significant human, environmental 
and economic consequences. These 
accidents have many causes, including 
component failure, human error or 
procedure deviations. The consequences 
vary in severity from minor (such as loss 
of production) to major (serious injury, 
death, closure of business).
The companies in Halma’s Process 
Safety sector have a deep 
understanding of our customers’ 
safety challenges. We offer 
innovative and reliable products 
and technology that reduce accidents 
and enhance the efficiency of 
industrial processes by isolating, 
detecting or removing hazards.
Our end markets are diverse and 
our products can be found in energy 
(mainly oil and gas), chemical, 
pharmaceutical, food and beverage, 
automotive, transport and logistics 
installations across the globe.
The underlying long term drivers in 
our Process Safety markets remain 
relatively unchanged, despite some 
sectors, such as oil and gas, having 
faced economic challenges over the 
last 18 months.
Our main drivers are:
 — increasing health, safety and 
environmental regulations
 — industrialisation and population 
growth, stimulating rising 
energy demand
 — increasing development, 
complexity and geographic 
spread of energy resources and 
their safety requirements
 — automation and digitalisation, 
requiring connected safety 
controls systems
Governments continue to support 
increased health and safety 
regulations to protect people and 
the environment. This drives the 
demand for our products at rates 
that are higher than general economic 
growth. In a challenging oil and gas 
environment, the Process Safety 
sector delivered performance in 
2016/17 that demonstrated the 
robustness of our growth drivers.
Oil prices fell from a high in 2014 due 
to oversupply and reduced demand 
as economic growth slowed. The 
reduction in capital expenditure by 
the oil majors was significant in the 
upstream segment, and to a lesser 
extent in the midstream segment. 
The sector started to see the 
impact of this in mid-2015. 
Chemicals and petrochemicals 
processing benefited from the 
low oil price and, in those markets, 
we saw more resilient demand.
In the first half of 2016/17, market 
conditions did not change significantly. 
Oil price stability offered some 
comfort, but overall, capital 
expenditure in upstream and 
midstream markets remained subdued.

Business Review
Process Safety 
continued
In the second half of 2016/17 the oil 
and gas market was more active, 
with oil price stability, cost-efficiency 
efforts, and non-conventional oil 
extraction in the US creating a slightly 
more positive environment for our 
businesses. Although upstream 
capital expenditure remained tightly 
controlled, the need to upgrade and 
maintain safety products led to higher 
activity levels. These improvements 
were, however, modest relative to 
levels seen a couple of years earlier.
In these challenging and complex 
market conditions, we adapted our 
strategy by diversifying into non-oil and 
gas end markets. This demonstrated 
our flexibility and deep understanding of 
the applications in which our products 
can be used. This ability to use our 
technologies for new applications 
and new end markets has been a key 
factor in our improved performance.
Geographic trends
Revenue increased in most major 
regions. The US revenue grew by 
12% helped by the gradual increase 
in non-conventional oil extraction 
in the second half of the year. 
Europe revenue rose as we diversified 
our explosion protection business 
into chemical and pharmaceutical 
applications, while our safety 
interlocks businesses saw good 
momentum in the automotive, food, 
beverage and transport/logistics 
markets. UK market activities were 
flat compared to last year, with 
continuing low activity in the 
North Sea.
In China, our business grew by 
18% with good progress in the gas 
detection and machine automation/
sequential safety sub sectors. 
Stricter safety regulations continue 
to be enforced, creating growing 
demand for our products in China.
Sales in the Middle East grew strongly 
by 37% as oil and gas production has 
been maintained at reasonable levels. 
In South America, economic conditions 
were still depressed. Supported by our 
Brazil sector hub, we were able to 
achieve some growth, mainly in the 
explosion protection market.
We saw good growth in India 
particularly in our pipeline 
management sub-sector.
Strategy
Our strategy of investing in new 
products in order to diversify our 
end markets and meet specific local 
requirements has delivered improving 
results. We reduced costs in some of 
our oil and gas-exposed businesses 
and were able to focus our activities 
on new application niches in non-oil 
and gas markets.
At the start of the year we combined 
some of our businesses in order to 
raise operating efficiency and 
support diversification. This strategy 
has led to faster product innovation, 
increased geographic market reach 
and improved customer service. 
Combining these businesses also 
allowed us to offer customers an 
extended product portfolio. 
Investment in innovation and 
application engineering capabilities 
was increased, providing local markets 
with quick product adaptation for 
specific requirements.
Our companies embrace globalisation, 
diversification and the need to develop 
connected technology. We are 
upgrading and developing talent 
across our businesses.
Greater emphasis has been placed 
on strategic marketing, with our 
companies researching new 
market opportunities.
Our acquisition strategy is to focus 
on businesses that will reinforce our 
diversification, accelerate our digital 
transformation, and contribute to 
our geographic expansion.
Performance
Sector revenues grew by 7% to £167m 
and profit grew by 2% to £40m. 
At constant currency, organic revenue 
was up by 1% and profit down 4%. 
Return on Sales was 24.1%.
The first half of the year was 
challenging, while the second half 
saw some positive signs in the non-
conventional oil market. This welcome 
increase in activity, combined with 
our restructuring efforts aimed at 
increasing diversification, delivered 
revenue and profit growth through 
the second half of the year.
Our machine automation, sequential 
safety and gas safety companies 
enjoyed good levels of demand 
for existing safety products, while 
offering innovative solutions in 
new, specific niche applications.
The newly combined sequential 
safety businesses delivered excellent 
performance thanks to strong 
regional activity and centrally-located 
innovation. Our machine automation 
business continues to perform well, 
with good progress in North America 
and China. The gas detection business 
also made good progress in China.
Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
32 Our pressure management companies 
performed better in the second half, 
due to efforts in chemical and 
pharmaceutical markets and a slight 
recovery in the US oil industry.
Our pipeline management businesses 
had mixed results. The corrosion 
monitoring business delivered flat 
profit while our valve interlock 
businesses faced difficult market 
conditions, as their products come late 
in the cycle when capital expenditures 
are released. Efforts to grasp new 
opportunities with valve drive units 
and valve monitoring solutions have 
started to improve results.
New products (not older than three 
years) accounted for 29% of sector 
revenues. R&D spend has remained at 
good levels, providing new products and 
innovations to support our growth 
ambitions.
Outlook
Overall industrial production is 
expected to increase on the three 
major continents, with China and 
the US leading this growth. In parallel, 
the food and beverage, automotive, 
and transport and logistics industries 
will continue to be attractive markets 
for the sector.
Non-conventional US oil extraction is 
set to rebound in 2017 and we will 
benefit from this increased activity. 
The chemical market will continue to 
develop further mainly in the USA. 
The evolution of smart factories 
using the internet of things and 
cloud computing will continue to 
drive the demand for safety products. 
We see the possibility to offer 
extended capabilities as we move 
to digitalise our products.
We will continue to push on our 
diversification strategy, constantly 
looking at specific niche applications. 
The combination of market 
diversification, our newly-combined 
businesses, and a slow improvement in 
the oil and gas industry will enable us 
to make further progress in the 
coming year.
Case study
Castell, Kirk and STI
At the beginning of last year, three 
of our sequential safety businesses, 
Castell, Kirk and STI, began 
collaborating as a single business 
group, creating a global market 
leader in trapped key interlocks and 
other sequential safety products. 
All three companies were already 
market leaders and so well known 
that, in some industries and 
geographies, safety interlocks are 
commonly known as ‘Castell Locks’ 
or ‘Kirk Locks’.
Each business unit now offers 
products from all three companies 
and operates in a specific 
geographic region. Kirk covers the 
Americas, STI manages Western 
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 
and Castell covers the UK, Asia and 
the rest of the world, ensuring the 
companies are closer to their client 
base and can be responsive to local 
needs. This has improved the 
business agility, impacting sales, 
engineering and technical support 
to provide a better quality of service 
for customers. Importantly each 
business can focus their resources 
on their specific zone.
In addition, there is now tight 
collaboration across the 
companies, with capabilities being 
shared, enabling co-ordinated and 
accelerated new common product 
developments and market 
diversification. The collaboration 
of products and resources has 
enabled higher levels of innovation 
in smart technologies advancing 
the progress to industry 4.0.
Sequential safety products such 
as trapped-key interlocks ensure 
human error is removed from a 
potentially dangerous sequence of

A huge advance in 
automatic swing door safety
Conventional automatic swing door safety 
sensors can be subject to false detection and 
activation due to environmental factors such 
as bunched carpets, stray leaves or snow. They 
do not protect against the potential of fingers 
being trapped in the hinge area, meaning hinge 
areas often need to be covered with physical 
protection, especially in buildings such as 
nurseries, schools, hospitals and care homes. 
This can often be difficult to keep free of bacteria.
BEA has developed the LZR Flatscan, an 
extremely small, thin door sensor that uses a 
laser for detection rather than conventional 
infra-red. It automatically adapts to any 
door width, scans the whole door area, is 
not subject to environmental interference 
and has extra measurement points that 
cover the hinge area to detect small objects 
like fingers. It was awarded ‘Best Product’ at 
Halma’s internal Innovation Awards this year. Focus on: BEA

36 Sector progress summary
The Infrastructure Safety sector 
delivered strong organic revenue and 
profit growth with revenue growth 
across all geographic regions and most 
sub-sectors. Record results in the Fire 
detection and People and vehicle flow 
sub-sectors more than compensated 
for a more challenging year for the Fire 
suppression sub-sector. 
Return on Sales and Return on Capital 
Employed remained comfortably 
above the Group’s targets with good 
cash generation. Investment in R&D in 
absolute terms and as a percentage 
of sales continued to increase. New 
sensing technologies, increased 
product functionality and inter-
connectivity were the predominant 
themes in building the sector’s new 
product pipeline.
Market trends and growth drivers
The long-term growth drivers of global 
population growth, urbanisation and 
increasing health and safety regulation 
worldwide remain central to our 
strategy. We are also increasingly 
focusing on two additional drivers: 
 — the need for increased efficiency 
in buildings and people movement
 — the need for protection from 
increasing threats to security
panels expected to grow beyond 
the general market growth rate. 
Increased regulation continues to 
be important in the fire market. 
For example, China’s fire regulator 
(CCCF) will introduce more 
stringent standards in the next few 
years. A change to Underwriter 
Laboratories’ (UL) fire regulation 
requirements to deal with new 
types of fire and to eliminate 
nuisance alarms will increase 
detector specifications in 40% of 
the global market by 2020. The 
global fire suppression market is 
expected to grow at 5% per year
 — the core of our People and vehicle 
flow sub-sector is pedestrian 
sensing. Our strategy of 
diversification into other 
applications such as vehicle sensing 
and people counting is reducing 
our dependence on the 4% growth 
global door market and providing 
higher growth opportunities
 — increasingly home owners are 
looking to integrate their home 
security systems with the 
automation of other functions 
of property management, all 
controlled and monitored from 
smart phones. These connected 
systems are poised to deliver 
annual growth of 9% as part of 
the total security market growth 
of 5% annually
These growth drivers provide the 
potential for each of our sub-sectors 
to grow at a faster rate than their 
wider markets.
Technology trends across all sector 
businesses include the increasing 
inter-connectivity of devices and 
systems, wireless technology and an 
increase in the use of cloud based 
applications to share data and 
facilitate data analysis.
The combined effect of the market 
growth drivers and technology trends 
are reflected in each sub-sector’s 
market growth rates:
 — the global elevator market is 
expected to grow at around 6% per 
year. The elevator refurbishment 
market is forecast to grow above 
that due to an ever-increasing 
installed base. Due to the high cost 
of fixed telephone lines, mobile 
telecommunications technology 
is increasingly being utilised to 
connect elevator cars to call centres 
for emergency communications 
and to facilitate data transmission 
for applications such as predictive 
maintenance 
 — the fire detection market is 
forecast to grow at over 5% 
annually with premium products 
such as multi-function sensors, 
wireless detectors and networked

37 Strategy
The Infrastructure Safety sector is 
focused on improving the safety and 
mobility of people and protecting 
commercially and publicly owned 
infrastructure worldwide. We target 
high return, niche markets that have 
low cyclicality and have high barriers 
to entry. We build our business globally 
by developing products and services 
within our sector companies or by 
acquiring companies that are already 
leaders in targeted, adjacent markets.
The trend towards the interconnectivity 
of devices to form more intelligent 
systems is playing an increasingly 
important part in the sector’s strategic 
actions, with the opportunity to offer 
customers broader solutions than 
simply detecting hazards. Many sector 
companies are well placed to generate 
data and data analysis through their 
sensor technologies. This trend is 
driving increased collaboration 
between our companies as they  
co-operate on joint development 
programmes. 
Geographic expansion remains a 
priority. We continue to strengthen 
our teams and our product offerings 
in China, India and South East Asia. 
These geographies are particularly 
attractive due to their higher growth 
rates and the support that the Halma 
hub infrastructure can provide.
Our key strategic objectives to drive 
growth include:
 — acquiring companies to 
strengthen our core technologies
 — acquiring companies in 
adjacent niche markets
 — launching new products to 
create additional value in 
existing and new applications
 — developing new products to 
expand our offerings along the 
digital value chain
 — establishing R&D capabilities 
close to our customers
 — developing top talent and hiring 
a capable and diverse team to 
meet the changing challenges in 
our markets
 — operational excellence and the 
sharing of best practice to sustain 
growth in existing product areas 
and market segments

Natural History Museum
The Natural History Museum in 
London is protected by our fire 
panels, installed at the heart of 
its fire system.
Established in 1881, and comprising 
seven blocks, the museum is the 
third most popular in the United 
Kingdom. Its irreplaceable 80 million 
strong collection of life and earth 
specimens is of global importance.
Due to their performance, quality 
and ease-of-use, and the fact that 
they were backward-compatible 
with parts of the system that were 
already installed, a network of 
24 fire panels from Advanced 
Electronics were used to help 
protect the building, its contents 
and visitors.
Geographic trends
While all sub-sectors enjoy positive 
market growth worldwide, there are 
regional variations. These are driven 
by specific local opportunities (for 
example vehicle inspection in China), 
local changes in regulations (for 
example fire regulations changes) 
or regional economic growth rates. 
For example, the fire detection 
market is due to grow 12% per year 
in India, 7% in China and below 5% 
in the USA and Europe.
The sector’s regional companies can 
see changes within a geographic 
market. For example, the Chinese 
elevator OEM supply market is very 
large but highly competitive. The 
elevator service and refurbishment 
market in China is much less mature 
and offers both higher margin and 
higher growth opportunities. Another 
example is the opportunity created for 
people flow technologies created by 
China’s significant investment in its 
high-speed rail network.

Revenue grew by 19% to £315m 
(2016: £265m) and profit by 17% to 
£65m (2016: £56m). Organic constant 
currency revenue and organic constant 
currency profit growth were both 7%.
All geographic regions contributed 
strongly to revenue growth. Mainland 
Europe grew by 29%, the US grew by 
16% and the UK increased by 11%. 
Growth outside these established 
markets was particularly encouraging 
at 20%.
The Fire detection and People and 
vehicle flow sub-sectors performed 
very well. The Security and Elevator 
sub-sectors delivered a solid 
performance, while the Fire 
suppression sub-sector declined.
New products played an important 
role in driving revenue growth. A new 
generation laser product achieved 
rapid success in the People and vehicle 
flow sub-sector and a new Fire 
detection platform, consisting of 
multiple products complete with a 
new operating protocol, was launched.
Our recent acquisitions made 
a significant impact on the sector’s 
results. Advanced Electronics 
(Fire detection), acquired in 2014, 
performed above expectations. 
In 2015 we acquired Firetrace, our 
specialist Fire suppression company. 
The company’s performance was 
below expectations and we made 
senior management changes to 
position the business for growth.
Return on Capital Employed remained 
high and well ahead of the Halma 
minimum target of 45%. There was 
significant investment in capitalised 
R&D programmes and substantial 
spend on targeted automation 
of our manufacturing processes. 
The benefits of the investment in 
automation contributed immediately 
in increased capacity and increased 
labour efficiency.
Gross margins were maintained 
and Return on Sales was 20.7%, 
after increased investment in R&D. 
Cash generation was strong.

Outlook
The strategic growth drivers of 
population growth, urbanisation and 
increasing regulation remain key to the 
sector. Our new product pipeline is 
strong, with significant products 
due to be launched across multiple 
sub-sectors in the next year. As 
devices are becoming increasingly 
interconnected, new opportunities 
are being created which we are 
positioned to exploit. Consequently, 
in the medium-term we expect all 
sub-sectors to grow at, or better than, 
market rates through the increased 
penetration of core markets and 
geographic expansion.
The level of acquisition activity has 
increased. We expect acquisitions to 
both enhance our technology offering 
in our core markets and accelerate our 
regional growth in core sub-sectors. 
Acquisitions also provide an 
opportunity to build platforms 
in adjacent sub-sectors. The sector 
is positioned to make further

Market trends and growth drivers
The Medical sector growth driver of 
increasing demand for healthcare is 
underpinned by:
 — worldwide population ageing and 
increasing life expectancy 
 — increasing prevalence of diabetes, 
obesity and hypertension 
 — increasing healthcare access in 
developing economies 
 — new medical diagnostic technologies 
 — new or improved surgical and 
pharmaceutical therapies 
Global healthcare spending is forecast 
to rise over 4% per year through to 
2020 with higher rates in Asia Pacific. 
The world population is expected to 
increase by 1 billion by 2025 with 300 
million of that increase predicted to 
come from people over 65. Because 
eyesight problems and high blood 
pressure are both age-related, 
population ageing is a key driver for our 
businesses, especially in ophthalmology 
and hypertension management. 
With the continued growth of the 
middle class in developing economies, 
it is forecast that 65% of the global 
population will be middle class by 
2025. Coupled with increased 
urbanisation, rising affluence is likely 
to lead to more sedentary lifestyles 
which increases obesity and 
hypertension-related illness and 
diabetes-related eye disorders. 
Currently, one in every three US 
adults has high blood pressure and 
only half of these individuals have their 
condition under control. A further one 
third have prehypertension which 
means they should continue to have 
their blood pressure monitored by the 
type of products made by our patient 
assessment companies. 
Cataract surgery is one of the most 
frequent surgical operations carried 
out worldwide at more than 25 million 
annually. Continued growth in the 
number of cataract surgeries and an 
ongoing shift towards disposable 
instrumentation will drive global 
spending on ophthalmic surgical 
instrumentation over 5% per year 
through to 2022. 
In addition to the prevalence of 
eye disease with ageing, demand 
is increasing for improved visual 
outcomes and premium procedures 
due to people’s lifestyles. By 2020, 
premium cataract procedures are 
expected to account for 34% of total 
cataract surgery revenue as wealthier 
and younger patients are demanding 
perfect vision at every stage in life. 
This market for high-revenue, personal 
payment premium procedures is 
of increasing importance to our 
ophthalmic companies which focus 
on improved patient outcomes.

Medical 
continued
The Chinese ophthalmology market 
could double by 2021 and we continue 
to expand our engineering, sales 
and marketing staff to drive the 
development and commercialisation of 
local products. Changing government 
restrictions from pricing controls to 
regulatory tightening continue to 
make this a dynamic market. 
The Latin American market continues 
to experience volatility although 
should continue to grow on average 
across the region. The in vitro 
diagnostic business, a focus of our 
diagnostic companies in the region, is 
forecast to grow 7% annually to 2020. 
Globally regulated markets continue 
to shift as increased medical product 
and procedure approvals delay 
product launches, especially in 
geographies such as China and Brazil, 
and more recently Europe. Recent 
changes suggest India is introducing 
tighter regulation too. Overall, our 
strong channels and regulatory 
experience position us well to navigate 
this environment and provide barriers 
to entry for new entrants.
Geographic trends
There continues to be considerable 
geographic variation in the global 
medical device market due to local 
economic conditions, government 
spending programmes and currency 
fluctuations. Our growth strategies 
will continue to vary by region. 
The global medical device market is 
expected to continue to grow at 5% 
through to 2021. North America will 
remain the largest market for medical 
device technologies, growing at 4%. 
In the Asia Pacific market growth 
is forecast to continue above 7%, 
with Europe recovering at 5% 
through to 2021. 
US healthcare expenditure continues to 
have the highest spending per capita, 
but we may see significant change 
under the new political administration. 
Hospitals are seeing relief from 
covering the uninsured as more 
Americans benefit from health 
insurance through the Affordable Care 
Act, allowing them to invest in new 
technologies, although, this may 
change. We expect continued growth 
for our single-use surgical devices in the 
USA and growing demand in Europe. 
Hospitals remain under pressure to 
improve patient outcomes, reduce 
costs, improve throughput and ensure 
safety of staff and patients. The 
global market for the real time 
location systems that we recently 
added to our portfolio, is forecast to 
grow at 24% per year between 2016 
and 2022. 
The increasing prevalence of lifestyle-
connected and chronic disease, 
along with a growing acceptance of 
molecular diagnostics in personalised 
medicine, is driving growth in the in 
vitro diagnostics and laboratory 
markets served by our diagnostic 
companies. This market is projected to 
grow at 5.5% through to 2021. 
We are starting to see other macro 
trends around healthcare delivery 
impacting our markets and offering 
growth opportunities. Telemedicine is 
growing at almost 19% annually as it 
offers dramatically different ways 
to deliver healthcare by sharing 
information and data across a wide 
range of service providers. One of our 
ophthalmology companies is using 
remote diagnosis via telecoms to help 
prevent blindness in diabetic patients.
Trends like increasing global healthcare 
costs are putting pressure on product 
pricing and government expenditure, 
increasing market volatility in some 
geographies. 
Case study
Chronic Disease is Growing Worldwide
Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, 
cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes, are growing 
worldwide due to ageing populations and lifestyle 
changes. The steady global rise in middle class 
affluence, combined with urbanisation, means that 
people are living more sedentary lifestyles which raises 
obesity and diseases like diabetes. The World Health 
Organization expects chronic disease prevalence to rise 
by 57% by 2020, with emerging markets hit hardest by 
increased demand on healthcare systems due to their 
faster population growth. 
Medical technology has a key role to play in mitigating 
the impact of chronic disease. Advances in detection 
and diagnosis will improve patient outcomes and 
minimise the cost of chronic condition treatment.

better meet market needs. 
Collaboration between our Medical 
sector businesses continues to 
increase with shared R&D projects 
reaching commercialisation and sales 
and marketing projects like shared 
service technicians in Brazil.
R&D spending increased by £2.4m to 
4.3% of revenue, which is above Group 
target.
Case study
Telemedicine Prevents Baby Blindness
Louise Allen, Consultant Paediatric 
Ophthalmologist for Addenbrooke’s 
Hospital in Cambridge, uses our 
digital ophthalmoscopes, from 
Keeler, to diagnose babies’ eye 
conditions remotely.
In the past at-risk babies would have 
to be transferred to Addenbrooke’s, 
sometimes over long distances, to be 
examined in person. Addenbrooke’s 
Charitable Trust has now provided 
our indirect ophthalmoscopes to 
other hospitals throughout the 
region. Now staff at local hospitals 
can take high-quality digital images 
of the insides of babies eyes and 
send them instantly to a specialist, 
such as Louise.
With innovative use of technology 
like this, patients can receive better, 
faster care and hospitals can avoid 
unnecessary disruption – and the 
critical expertise of specialists like 
Dr. Allen can reach those who need 
it in the blink of an eye.
Growth outside the UK, the USA 
and Europe was 29%, contributing 
25% of sector revenue. 
The sector continues to deliver high 
returns. Return on Sales remained high 
at 25.6% (2016: 26.0%). Return on 
Capital Employed and cash generation 
remained strong.
We did not complete any acquisitions 
in 2016/17, but continued the 
integration of the three businesses 
acquired in the prior year. These 
businesses delivered strong second 
half performances and will continue 
to contribute to sector growth in the 
year ahead.
Outlook
In the medium term, we expect our 
Patient care and Provider solutions 
segments to outperform the market 
with rising revenue driven by export 
growth, new products, increased 
penetration in existing markets 
and acquisitions.
We will continue to build our 
acquisition targets pipeline within 
existing and adjacent niches, and 
expect continued growth from 
the businesses acquired in 2015/16.

45 Business Review: Environmental & Analysis
Global insight
Water demand worldwide 
is predicted to increase 
significantly due to increasing 
usage by agriculture, 
manufacturing, domestic 
consumption and energy 
production. Outdoor air 
pollution is a major health risk 
in both the developed and the 
developing world. There is 
increasing demand for 
environmental protection, 
safer food and water, and 
improved health and 
sanitation.
Key trends:
 — increasing demand for life-critical 
resources such as energy and water
 — increasing governmental policies 
and environmental regulations
 — technological and scientific advances 
transferring into new industries
 — worldwide population ageing and 
increasing standards of living
Our strategy
Our growth strategy centres on market-
led new product development, geographic 
expansion and collaboration to increase 
market reach. R&D is focused on 
applications with long-term drivers 
and defensible positions. We are 
increasingly exploring new ways to 
capture, manage, manipulate and 
utilise data. We continue to target 
acquisitions that tie in with our existing 
technologies and/or market knowledge.  Local agility
Raising the bar on water 
conservation and leak detection
Water leaks are a problem for all water 
networks, with billions of litres of drinking water 
lost globally every day. With demand for water 
predicted to increase significantly, detecting 
leaks quickly is becoming more and more 
important. Working closely with customer 
Affinity Water, HWM used their in-depth 
knowledge of the market to develop 
PermaNET +. The next stage in water leak 
detection and logging, it is also a step 
towards data-driven ‘smart’ water networks.
Located entirely below ground, data generated 
by the logger is automatically sent to the user , 
removing the need to visit sites to carry out data 
collection. It identifies leaks more quickly than 
traditional methods, significantly reducing both 
water loss and the cost of identifying leaks. 
PermaNET + recently was awarded the 
Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation. Focus on: HWM
HWM’s PermaNET+ is 
the next stage in water 
leak detection and 
logging and a step 
towards data-driven 
‘smart’ water networks Business Review

48 Sector progress summary
The Environmental & Analysis sector 
achieved record results with good 
organic revenue and profit growth, 
continuing the progress made last year. 
Global emphasis on climate change 
and pollution monitoring continues 
to strengthen the position of our 
environmental applications. We grew 
significantly in emerging markets, 
particularly in the Asia Pacific region, 
led by environmental monitoring 
applications. Our water businesses 
had a successful year with a strong 
performance in North America. 
Our photonics businesses continued 
to find new applications in a variety 
of diversified markets and industries.
The acquisition of FluxData 
strengthened our technological 
capabilities, greatly increasing the 
number of opportunities for the 
sector in spectral imaging and sensing.
We completed the restructuring 
of our photonics coating business, 
Pixelteq, by transferring key 
technologies and assets into Ocean 
Optics, while Ocean Optics Asia was 
folded back into the Ocean group 
under a strong leadership team and 
co-ordinated strategy. We expect to 
see the benefits of this restructuring 
in the coming financial year.
Market trends and growth drivers
The Environmental & Analysis sector’s 
long-term growth is sustained by three 
key drivers:
 — rising demand for life-critical 
resources such as energy, water 
and food
 — increasing environmental 
monitoring and regulations
 — worldwide population growth, 
urbanisation and rising standards 
of living
Globally, water demand is predicted to 
increase significantly over the coming 
decades in all sectors from agriculture 
and industry to energy production. 
Accelerated urbanisation and the 
expansion of municipal water supply 
and sanitation systems, particularly in 
developing regions, also contribute to 
the rising demand. At the same time, 
limited water resources are increasingly 
stressed by over abstraction, pollution 
and climate change.
Two thirds of the world’s population 
currently live in areas that experience 
water scarcity for at least one month 
a year. About 500 million people live 
in areas where water consumption 
exceeds the locally renewable water 
resources by a factor of two. Our 
products monitor surface, municipal 
and waste water conditions, helping 
improve water conservation both in 
developing and developed countries.
Water quality testing applications use 
our products to assess the presence of 
faecal coliforms, which originate from 
human and animal excreta, and are 
used as an indicator of the presence 
of all potential pathogens in surface 
waters. This is especially important in 
developing countries and rural areas. 
It is estimated that severe pathogen 
pollution affects around one third of 
all river stretches in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America, putting the health of 
millions of people at risk.
Population growth has outpaced 
gains in sanitation and drinking water 
coverage, especially in urban areas. 
Only 26% of urban sanitation and 
wastewater services effectively prevent 
human contact with contaminants 
along the entire sanitation chain. Our 
water testing systems help identify the 
contaminants in these water networks, 
while our UV systems disinfect drinking 
and waste water in major cities around 
the world as well as being the primary 
method of disinfection for many 
bottled water plants.
Outdoor air pollution is a major 
environmental health risk affecting 
everyone in developing and developed 
countries alike. In 2014, 92% of the 
world population lived in places where 
the World Health Organization air 
quality guidelines levels were not met, 
and ambient air quality (outdoor air 
pollution) in both cities and rural areas 
was estimated to cause three million 
premature deaths worldwide. For 
example, in China only 25 of 190 cities 
studied could meet the country’s 
National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards.

Business Review
Environmental  
& Analysis 
continued
We provide systems that assist in the 
precise detection of contaminants as 
well as other products that aid in the 
calibration of pollution monitoring 
equipment. Further, our gas 
conditioning equipment is ideally 
suited for stack emission monitoring 
of gases such as SO
2
 and NO
x
 as well 
as for measuring the fine particles 
(PM
2.5
) which are believed to be 
the greatest risk to health. These 
applications are also beginning to find 
success in India, which overtook China 
in air pollution levels in cities in 2015.
Our recent acquisition of FluxData 
has strengthened our position in 
spectroscopy and spectral specific 
imaging. By looking at specific 
spectral bands, they provide much 
more information in far less time than 
traditional methods, thus allowing for 
higher efficiency and decreased waste. 
Applications include inspection during 
industrial processes including the 
production of food and beverages, 
pharmaceuticals and agriculture. The 
non-invasive nature of the technology 
is also best suited for security 
applications such as detection of 
explosive or hazardous chemicals, 
non-invasive medical diagnostics, and 
environmental and remote sensing 
applications. Process spectroscopy 
is forecasted to grow at 6% annually 
until 2020, but some of the newer 
technologies that we employ such 
as Raman spectroscopy and spectral 
imaging are forecast to grow at 
even faster rates.
Geographic trends
We sell into a wide variety of diverse 
market niches. These niches exhibit 
different characteristics that vary 
according to each specific country’s 
requirements, their economy and 
their regulatory environment.
The China National 13
th
 Five-Year Plan is 
having a profound impact on the 
environmental landscape of China. 
Stricter compliance measures for 
urban air quality, standardisation of the 
regulations around industrial pollutant 
emissions and ultra-low emissions of 
coal-fired power plants are all aimed at 
improving the quality of air, especially 
in urban areas. Similarly, other control 
plans are being enacted for water and 
soil pollution. For example, there is 
continued emphasis on improving rural 
access to clean water and improving 
the water distribution network and 
wastewater treatment.
In India, emissions monitoring and 
concerns over air pollution are 
increasing and we have designed 
products that specifically address the 
needs of this market. We expect that 
stronger water monitoring protocols are 
next. We are ready to supply products 
suited to their needs, benefiting from 
our experience in China.
We continue to grow well in the 
developed countries. While growth in 
pollution monitoring in some regions 
might not be as significant as in the 
emerging markets, there are other 
niches that we continue to serve 
through a variety of technologies. 
Performance in the USA was 
particularly strong this year, as our 
life science and research products 
continued to grow sales, as did some 
of our water monitoring businesses. 
Designing products in, and for, emerging 
markets is important to our growth, 
although we continue to develop 
products for our core markets too.
Strategy
Our products improve the quality 
of air, water and food for everyone 
on the planet. They enable the 
development and manufacture of 
products that improve our health 
and well-being. Our growth strategy 
centres on market-led new product 
development, geographic expansion 
and collaboration between the 
companies in the sector. Through this 
we will enhance our ability to help 
solve the problems our world faces.
We continue to seek, foster and invest 
for growth in emerging markets. 
Revenue from countries outside the 
UK, the USA and Europe has grown 
55% in the past five years, as we have 
captured larger opportunities thanks 
to more stringent regulations driven 
by a demand for environmental 
protection, safer food and water, 
and better health and sanitation.
Water stress – forecast ratio of withdrawals to supply, 2040
Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
50 Most of our companies provide 
sensors that are a data collection 
point. Data availability 
has dramatically changed in the last 
few years, and our companies are 
increasing their efforts in exploring 
new ways to capture, manage, 
manipulate and utilise data.
Talent management and development 
has been a major contributor to the 
continued success of the sector. The 
introduction of a Sector Talent Director 
has supported our sector-level initiative 
to achieve stronger and more diverse 
company boards across the sector.
We are targeting acquisitions in 
segments that tie to our existing 
technologies and/or market knowledge, 
have good long-term growth drivers 
and defensible positions through 
regulations or intellectual property. 
For example, our most recent 
acquisition, FluxData, extends our 
spectroscopic capability into spectral 
imaging to provide more valuable 
information to our customers. 
Performance
The sector grew revenue by 16% 
to £219m (2016: £189m) and profit 
by 21% to £42m (2016: £34m). At 
constant currency, organic revenue 
growth was 4% and organic profit 
growth was 6%. Return on Sales 
improved to 19.0% (2016: 18.3%) and 
was within the Group target range.
Case study
Intelligent water monitoring for Smart Village project in India
Water is not just needed for 
drinking, but is vital for all kinds 
of food production. Sensorex 
is helping a pioneering 'Smart 
Village' in India maintain its water 
quality and improve the efficiency, 
yield and reliability of its shrimp 
farming industry.
The aim of the project is to see how 
the integration of connected, digital 
technology can help the over 3 billion 
people who still live in rural 
communities worldwide.
Although population trends are still 
moving from rural areas towards 
cities, we are also seeing the 
'urbanisation' of rural areas – 
bringing modern technology and 
infrastructure to smaller and more 
remote locations as the connected 
world becomes more portable, 
scalable and accessible. 
Our expertise in water quality 
monitoring, as well as data capture 
and digital connected technologies, 
positions us well to help make this 
future a reality.
United Nations sanitation facts
This year, and following the geographic 
consolidation of our photonics 
coatings business (Pixelteq) in 
2014/15, we transferred its core 
technology and assets to Ocean 
Optics. This restructuring benefited 
the sector’s full year adjusted profit 
by £0.5m in 2016/17 and will also add 
£1.5m in 2017/18, while simultaneously 
improving key returns metrics. This 
restructuring resulted in exceptional 
costs amounting to £1.9m, which are 
included within the adjustments to 
the Income Statement.
The acquisition of FluxData during 
the year opens up many new growth 
opportunities. Prior to joining Halma, 
FluxData worked with two of our 
existing businesses and we expect 
that number to rise as they become 
fully integrated.
Outlook
Global population growth, population 
ageing and increasing standards of 
living will continue to drive demand 
for basic energy resources, cleaner 
air, safer water and food, and 
improved health. Our products and 
companies are well-positioned to 
continue to take advantage of these 
long-term growth drivers both in 
developing and developed countries.  
 
We will continue to improve 
collaboration between our sector 
companies in terms of technology, 
processes, and sales and marketing, 
to improve efficiency, innovation 
and performance. 
Our acquisition pipeline is growing 
and we expect to add complementary 
businesses in the coming years.

52 Autonomy
We believe in empowerment. Our 
decentralised management structure 
allows local managers to be 
autonomous and responsible for 
making timely decisions in the best 
interests of their business. Halma 
supports personal and professional 
development through a range of 
training programmes. These 
programmes aim to enable and 
prepare leaders to continue to 
grow their businesses regardless 
of changing competitive pressures. 
The value of this investment is shown 
both in our financial performance 
and succession planning. Almost all 
of the members on our Executive 
Board have been promoted from 
our subsidiary companies.
Achievement
Halma employees are highly motivated 
by the impact that they directly have 
on the performance of their business, 
and most importantly, the impact they 
have on the world. We strive each day 
to protect life and improve the quality 
of life of people worldwide. Our culture 
of achievement is not driven by 
personal egos but by a relentless 
ambition to solve life critical problems. 
We invest a lot of time finding and 
developing the right people who have 
the initiative, knowledge and 
leadership qualities to make such a 
difference.
To unleash their potential, we provide 
them with:
 — the opportunity to make a 
difference – our products make the 
world a safer and healthier place
 — an entrepreneurial business 
opportunity
 — a portfolio of cutting edge 
technologies and the ability to 
add more
 — in-house training for personal 
and professional development
 — international career development 
opportunities
 — performance-linked rewards
 — the opportunity to learn from 
peers tackling similar challenges
 — an environment in which success 
breeds success
Innovation
We are committed to innovation and 
customer satisfaction. Creating and 
developing new products and new 
ways of working gives us a competitive 
edge, while delivering solutions to 
some of the world’s major problems 
in safety, health and the environment.
We encourage the sharing of 
knowledge and technology throughout 
Halma. This ability to transfer state-
of-the-art technology from company 
to company, from one sector to 
another, is something most of our 
competitors simply do not have. 
Through collaboration and sharing 
best practice we continue to deliver 
market-leading innovations that 
create benefits for our customers.
Our biennial HITEx (Halma Innovation, 
Technology and Experimentation) 
Conference was held recently in San 
Diego, California. This event brought 
together the leadership teams of all 
Halma operating companies and 
provided an inspiring look at the 
potential future of Halma and the role 
that each of them can play in realising 
it. Company leaders came together to 
learn from one another, identify ways 
to collaborate, share technologies or 
simply learn from other’s experience. 
We believe that this combination of 
empowered business leaders, who also 
have access to peer companies and 
thought leaders to accelerate their 
performance, is unique to Halma 
and a key part of our current and 
future success.
Diversity and inclusion
We see diversity and inclusiveness as 
an essential part of our productivity, 
creativity, innovation and competitive 
advantage. It is the foundation of a 
performance culture that promotes 
respect, understanding and 
appreciation of different perspectives, 
backgrounds and experiences.
By increasing the diversity and inclusion 
of our workforce and leveraging the 
insights of our diverse talent through 
an inclusive environment, we enhance 
our ability to compete in the world’s 
increasingly diverse marketplace. 
Our efforts are directed towards 
developing policies and actions which 
support our long-term aims, as well as 
establishing appropriate measurable 
targets. We believe the former evolves 
into being embedded into corporate 
culture more readily.
As part of our Diversity and Inclusion 
Initiative, we have a new programme, 
which encourages our operating 
companies to review the diversity 
of their directors. Where companies 
decide that they need greater diversity 
to enhance their discussions and 
decision making, they now invite 
a member of staff to join board 
meetings as ‘co-opted’ board 
members. Co-opted board members 
are chosen for their ability to make 
a valuable contribution to board 
discussions. Their participation is 
entirely voluntary and they have no 
legal responsibilities. They usually 
contribute to board discussions for 
a year and then another employee 
is invited to fill the role.
We held our biennial Innovation 
focused event in San Diego, 
California over three days in  
April 2017. The goal for HITEx 2017 
was to launch a new spirit for 
innovation and collaboration, and 
to be the start of us creating a living, 
learning community across Halma.
Collaboration has always been a 
focus of HITE and it is one of the 
powerful differentiators that we 
can benefit from at Halma – both 
as individuals and as businesses.
In changing the HITE name from 
meaning the Halma Innovation 
and Technology Exposition to 
Halma Innovation, Technology 
and Experimentation (HITEx), 
we signified the shift in our focus 
toward seeing more, excluding 
less and innovating with speed.

The class of 2015 Halma Graduates 
had an opportunity not just for 
them to learn but to get some real, 
valuable work done on behalf of 
a Halma company, Texecom.
Initially the group were led through 
market scoring tools and how to 
explore market attractiveness. They 
then applied these to 5 potentially 
transformational opportunities for 
Texecom. The group participated in a 
workshop on building business model 
and value proposition canvasses. 
A series of market sensing exercises 
followed – getting real input from 
potential stakeholders in the new 
business market.
Geographic diversity
As our businesses continue to expand 
globally, it is imperative that the 
insights and perspectives of local 
markets be represented on our 
leadership teams. Several Group 
initiatives have been implemented to 
support and encourage our operating 
companies to put leaders on the 
ground in key markets.
We have well-established Halma hubs 
in China and India and have expanded 
into Brazil as well. The China hub 
has introduced innovative R&D 
programmes to incentivise local 
product development for local markets.  
 
We continue to seek ways to ensure 
that local leadership is contributing 
to the global business strategies.
Diversity and inclusion policy
At Halma we recognise that the 
diversity of the people in our business 
and the inclusion of all enriches our 
products, performance and the lives 
of our employees. We believe that 
the diversity of our workforce 
contributes significantly to our 
aim to protect and improve the 
quality of life for people worldwide.
We are building a culture that 
encourages talented people of all 
backgrounds, beliefs or any form 
of personal identity to be involved, 
respected and inspired to develop 
to their full potential.
Employee engagement survey
In 2017, we launched our first all- 
employee engagement survey. The 
insights provided by this survey will 
help us to ensure that we motivate, 
engage and empower employees 
across Halma and create the culture 
that will enable our success. Overall 
we were very pleased with the results, 
with nearly 8 out of 10 Halma 
employees providing their feedback 
and 74% of them reporting to be 
highly engaged. We were able to 
identify areas of best practice in the 
group to leverage and learn from, as 
well as a few themes to focus our 
attention and actions. 
Finishing up the module, the 
graduate group collated all they’d 
explored, learned and researched, 
and presented to the Texecom board 
on the topic, suggesting several 
potential routes to market and 
even a couple of product concepts.
Texecom believes that running 
experiments like this with the grads 
will become a key part of Halma’s 
future growth, and having 
ambassadors within the 
graduate cohorts will 
help to spread the message.
Grads learn, companies benefit
Talent development
We offer challenging personal 
development programmes to raise 
the quality of leadership throughout 
Halma. Our development programmes 
are designed to promote personal 
growth, enhance leadership and 
relationship skills. They also offer the 
chance for employees from diverse 
Halma companies to come together 
and learn from each other. 
Our objective is to provide these 
individuals with the tools and training 
they need to achieve more in their 
existing role and potentially to 
advance through the organisation 
if their achievements merit it.
The following courses are offered 
in China, the USA and Europe:
 — Innovating the Organisation – 
developing ability at Managing 
Director and Sector Vice President 
level to innovate across all aspects 
of the business
 — Talent Mindset – ensuring the

the capability to maximise the 
quality of talent on their teams
 — HPD Executive – focusing on the 
leadership skills needed at board 
level in our operating companies
 — HPD Management – personal 
development, enhancing self-
awareness and teamwork skills 
for managerial roles

Such was the case when one of our 
company Managing Director roles 
was vacated, and remained so for 
the best part of the year. In the 
interim, Jo Smith, finance director, 
(pictured above) had stepped up to 
lead the team in the void. She 
proved her ability to influence, 
create momentum and keep the 
team aligned. Mike Dakin, the 
company’s Chairman and SVP, 
noticed that Jo was the right person 
for the business and the team and 
over time, convinced her of that!
Diversity and Inclusion
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by 
disabled people are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff 
becoming disabled, every effort will be 
made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that 
appropriate training is arranged. 
It is the policy of the Group that the 
training, career development and 
promotion of disabled people should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that 
of other employees.
Employees consultation 
The Group places considerable value 
on the involvement of its employees 
and has continued to keep them 
informed on matters affecting them 
as employees and on the various 
factors affecting the performance 
of the Group. This is achieved 
through formal and informal 
meetings, internal communications, 
the Group collaboration platform 
and our Annual Report.
Employee representatives are 
consulted routinely on a wide range 
of matters affecting their current 
and future interests.
Cumulative number of candidates 
that have completed each programme
According to an August 2014 Harvard 
Business Review article, women are 
less likely to apply for roles unless 
they feel they meet 100% of the job 
requirements. When Mike asked Jo 
why she didn’t initially apply for the 
MD role, she shared:
“It was my confidence in believing I 
was ready for that next step up to 
MD. I was really fortunate in feeling 
so supported by Mike and the Halma 
leadership team. During the time as 
acting MD I was able to get involved 
in every area of the business and in 
doing so I felt more and more 
confident in the value I was adding 
as a leader. I enjoyed the additional 
responsibility and realised I would 
miss the additional challenges. Mike 
also worked with me to ensure I 
could commit to the role without 
having to compromise on work-life 
balance, so that my family 
commitments can be managed 
without having to compromise on 
career goals. The final and most 
important factor in building my 
confidence was the support and 
backing I received from the other 
board members and wider Fortress 
team – they actively encouraged me 
to take on the role and I knew that I 
had earned their trust and respect 
to become their leader.“
Halma encourages diversity and 
inclusivity, and the benefits that 
come from considering different 
perspectives. We strive to work 
with all individuals to bring their 
best to work every day.

55 Sustainability 
Our commitment
Halma companies are involved in 
the manufacture of a wide range of 
products that protect and improve the 
quality of life for people worldwide. 
This section of the Report focuses 
on areas of progress and our 
performance for all areas of 
sustainability which are considered to 
be material by our stakeholders and 
are also important to the success of 
our business. Halma has developed 
meaningful key performance 
indicators (KPIs) that reflect the 
importance that the Group places on 
sustainability and enables the Board 
to monitor the Group’s progress 
in meeting its objectives and 
responsibilities in these areas. 
The Group's non-financial KPIs 
are set out on pages 18 and 19.
The areas of emphasis include health 
and safety, employee engagement and 
development, human rights, ethics and 
sustainability. Safety is critical to the 
Group and is a major priority. We 
recognise the necessity of safeguarding 
the health and safety of our own 
employees while at work and operate 
so as to provide a safe and comfortable 
working environment for employees, 
visitors and the public. Our policy is to 
manage our activities to avoid causing 
any unnecessary or unacceptable 
risks to health and safety and the 
environment. Halma has an excellent 
health and safety record and a culture 
of safety is deeply embedded within 
the Group. 
Our core values are Achievement, 
Innovation, Empowerment 
and Customer satisfaction, and 
our culture is one of openness, 
integrity and accountability. 
We encourage our employees to 
act fairly in their dealings with 
fellow employees, customers, 
suppliers and business partners. 
We recognise that our employees 
determine our success and we 
continue to invest in, and encourage 
further development of, our employees 
each year, not only utilising the suite 
of Halma development programmes, 
but also by providing clear leadership 
and decisive action. Jennifer Ward, our 
Group Talent and Communications 
Director, champions our talent 
leadership and works with our teams 
to ensure that we have the right 
capabilities and best talent to 
match Halma’s growth ambition. 
We support the concept of 
sustainability and recognise that, 
in common with all businesses, our 
activities have an environmental 
impact. Our strategy is not to have 
capital-intensive manufacturing 
processes and to operate close to our 
end markets in terms of geography, 
so the environmental impact of our 
operations is relatively low compared 
to manufacturers in other sectors. 
We also recognise that we can 
improve our own environmental 
performance and so resources are 
deployed to actively reduce our own 
carbon footprint. 
The Environment
We have an excellent long-term record 
and a clear strategy for addressing 
environmental issues that affect 
our businesses and for developing 
products that protect the environment 
and improve safety at work and in 
public places.
Our products
Many of our innovative products play 
a very positive role in monitoring and 
improving the environment. Halma 
brands lead the world in a number 
of technologies which help to minimise 
environmental damage. Our principal 
environmental technologies are 
water leakage detection and wireless 
monitoring, gas emissions monitoring, 
water and effluent analysis, UV 
water treatment and optical sensing. 
We promote the use of UV water 
sterilisation which eliminates the 
need to use dangerous chemicals, 
as well as making products that 
minimise the waste of clean water.
Health and safety
Our commitment to safeguarding the 
health and safety of our employees 
while at work is demonstrated by our 
culture of safety and our excellent 
health and safety record. 
Corporate responsibility and 
sustainability
Our commitment to managing our 
business activities in a sustainable 
way and minimising the environmental 
impact is evidenced by our 
performance against the Group’s 
carbon reduction target. 
Human rights and ethics
Our commitment to respecting human 
rights and operating in an ethical way 
is embedded throughout our Group 
and underpins the way that we work.

Our commitment to the development 
of equipment for measuring and 
monitoring environmental changes 
and controlling the damaging impact 
of industrial activities is long term. 
We are the major world supplier 
in several of these areas.
Our impact
The environmental effect of our 
operations is relatively low compared 
to manufacturers in other sectors. Our 
manufacturing model is decentralised, 
permitting our operations to be located 
close to their customers, which helps 
us to minimise the impact on the 
environment. The ethos of being  
close to our customers reflects the 
importance we place on the quality 
of our products and the service levels 
we provide to our customers. It also 
makes our operations more flexible 
and responsive to their markets and 
customers. With operations spread 
around the globe, our supplier base 
is understandably fragmented. 
Therefore, responsibility for vetting 
and managing suppliers is devolved 
to local management while meeting 
the Group’s ethical standards. 
Environmental Management 
System (EMS)
We are committed to developing and 
implementing an EMS throughout 
the Group to measure, control and 
reduce our environmental impacts. 
We have developed performance 
indicators that assist local 
management in implementing the 
policy and ultimately developing 
an EMS. All Group companies are 
encouraged to undertake ISO 14001 
accreditation, where warranted. The 
requirement to implement an EMS will 
be extended to the rest of the Group 
in the medium term. 
Group companies are also encouraged 
to improve energy efficiency, to reduce 
waste and emissions and reduce the 
use of materials in order to minimise 
their environmental impact. 
The Group has identified its 
key environmental impacts as 
emissions to air and water, water 
and energy consumption, and 
waste production. In addition to the 
information set out in this section of 
the Report, we publish data annually 
on energy consumption, waste and 
transportation on our website. 
We support innovation and investment 
that drives environmental 
performance. Recent examples include: 
 — Apollo China, BEA, Fiberguide and 
Perma Pure replacing lighting 
installations with more energy 
efficient LED lamps
 — Keeler replacing their ageing 
oil boilers with more efficient 
gas boilers
 — Medicel recovering heat from 
machinery connected to cooling 
circuits and utilising it for heating
Opportunities are also being explored 
by some businesses to expand existing 
solar installations or switch to green 
energy suppliers. 
Carbon Footprint
The Group’s policy on carbon is 
published on our website and has been 
distributed to all Halma businesses. 
A senior executive in each of our higher 
impact businesses is responsible 
for implementing the carbon policy at 
local level. Our Finance Director, Kevin 
Thompson, has principal responsibility 
for co-ordinating and monitoring 
the policy.
We are committed to reducing our 
carbon footprint. The Board recognises 
that a growing international business 
such as Halma would struggle to 
reduce absolute CO

on-year as it acquires and grows its 
GHG emissions data for the period 2 April 2016 to 1 April 2017

portfolio of companies and sales

absolute reduction in 2015/16). The 
Group set a target of reducing its total 
carbon emissions relative to revenues 
by 10% over the three years from 
March 2010, which was met in March 
2013. The same target was set for the 
three year period to March 2016 and 
was significantly exceeded. The Board 
set a further target to reduce total 
carbon emissions relative to revenues 
by a further 10% for the period to 
March 2019. Our CO
2
 emissions reduced 
between 2016 and 2017 on an intensity 
basis by 10%, although the impact 
of currency movements over the 
period has distorted our underlying 
performance. On a constant currency 
basis, the reduction between 2016 
and 2017 has been around 3%. We will 
continue to report on our performance 
against our 2019 target each year. 
* Due to changes in Defra reporting guidance, 
the 2013/14 figures onward have been calculated 
to include Well to Tank (WTT) emissions and 
Radiative Forcing on air travel. It is not required 
to restate years prior to 2013/14 due to the 
methodological changes.
** The figures for 2013/14 onwards have also been 
calculated on the same basis as prior years 
(excluding Well to Tank (WTT) emissions and 
Radiative Forcing on air travel) to allow for a  
direct comparison over the longer time scale.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Our commitment 
continued
Since 2010, Halma has worked with 
external providers of energy efficiency 
and carbon reduction solutions to 
ensure compliance with the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme (CRC) which is 
the UK's mandatory energy savings 
scheme administered by the 
Environment Agency. We are in 
full compliance with the CRC 
requirements and will continue to 
purchase allowances to meet our 
compliance obligation until the 
scheme comes to an end in 2019.
Halma has complied with the Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) 
regulations and submitted its first 
compliance report to the Environment 
Agency in November 2015. Observations 
made following site energy surveys were 
shared with local management and 
reviewed centrally at Group level. The 
next four-year compliance period to  
5 December 2019 has commenced and 
the Group will repeat the exercise of 
identifying energy saving opportunities 
over this period.
The Group does not operate a fleet 
of distribution vehicles although there 
are a number of company cars. To 
support the Group’s commitment to 
sustainability, our policy, which is 
subject to regular review, operates a 
cap on permissible CO
2
 emissions for 
all company-owned vehicles and 
vehicles used by employees who have 
taken a cash allowance in lieu of a 
company car. 
We comply with the mandatory 
carbon reporting requirements which 
UK listed companies are subject to and 
have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
We have employed the Operation 
Control definition to outline 
our carbon footprint boundary; 
included within that boundary 
are Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 
manufacturing sites and offices 
which we own and operate. Excluded 
from our footprint boundary are 
emissions from manufacturing sites 
and offices which we do not own and 
control, and emissions considered 
non-material by the business. We have 
reported on emissions from Scope 1 
and 2 emissions sources with some 
Scope 3 emissions sources included 
(business air travel for all years, and 
Well to Tank emissions from 2013/14).
We have also used the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
and guidance provided by the UK’s 
Department for Environment, Food 
& Rural Affairs (Defra) on voluntary 
and mandatory carbon reporting. 
Emission factors were used from the 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2016. 
In addition, IEA 2016 factors were 
used for electricity.
The Group’s environmental 
performance will continue to be 
reported both in our Annual Report 
and Accounts and on our website. 
Health and Safety
Halma companies are involved in 
the manufacture of a wide range 
of products that protect and 
improve the quality of life for people 
worldwide. Therefore, safety is critical 
to the Group and is a major priority 
for management and to demonstrate 
the Group’s added emphasis on health 
and safety. The Board has endorsed 
the inclusion of the Group’s Accident 
Frequency Rate (AFR) as one of our 
non-financial KPIs on pages 18 and 19. 
The Group manages its activities 
to avoid causing any unnecessary 
or unacceptable risks to the health 
and safety of our employees in the 
workplace or to the public as a result 
of our activities. Health and safety 
performance is closely monitored 
to ensure that adequate processes, 
procedures and reporting are 
in place, and operating, to ensure 
a safe working environment for  
our employees and visitors to our sites. 
Halma has an excellent health and 
safety record and a culture of safety 
is deeply embedded within the Group. 
Health and safety performance is 
regularly reviewed at multiple levels 
within the Group – at subsidiary 
board level, at sector level and  
by the Halma Board. Each Group 
company is required to have an 
independent health and safety 
review carried out every three years, 
with a view to ensuring a consistent 
approach in the quality of reporting, 
adherence to internal processes and 
procedures, adequate reporting and 
investigation and to further promote 
our health and safety culture. 
The health and safety performance 
remains above our target to match 
our lowest ever recorded Accident 
Frequency Rate of 0.09 in 2014. As we 
strive to have zero accidents in our 
businesses, we thoroughly review the 
root cause of any accidents to ensure 
that we take preventative measures, 
including further training and 
education of our employees. During 
2017, we are rolling out a programme 
of online health & safety training with 
mandatory and optional modules 
being offered to all employees across 
the Group. Topics being covered 
include: 
 — health & safety at work
 — Control of Substances Hazardous 
to Health (COSHH) awareness
 — display screen equipment & 
workstation safety
 — repetitive strain injury
 — slips trips and falls
 — manual handling
 — working with hazardous substances
 
Given the autonomous structure of 
the Group, operational responsibility 
for compliance with relevant local 
health and safety regulations resides 
with the board of each operating 
company. However, the Halma plc 
Board sets the tone and minimum 
standards expected of companies, 
in addition to its role in monitoring 
health and safety performance. 
Kevin Thompson, Finance Director, 
is the director responsible for Halma’s 
health and safety compliance and he 
is provided with sufficient information 
to routinely monitor health and safety 
performance across the Group. 
We are pleased to report that there 
were no work-related fatalities in 
2016/17 or prior years.

58 Ethics
The Group's culture is one of openness, 
integrity and accountability. Halma 
requires its employees to act fairly in 
their dealings with fellow employees, 
customers, suppliers and business 
partners. Halma has a Code of Conduct 
which applies to all Group company 
employees and our external business 
partners. The Code of Conduct aims 
to ensure that Halma maintains 
consistently high ethical standards 
across the globe, while recognising that 
our businesses operate in markets and 
countries with cultural differences and 
practices. Our Code of Conduct is being 
updated for 2017 and, once it has been 
translated into a variety of languages, 
will be issued to all employees via our 
businesses and will be published on 
our website.
Whistleblowing
We require our employees and business 
partners to maintain the highest 
standards of integrity and act in good 
faith. Halma implemented a group-
wide whistleblowing policy in 2017 
which applies to all employees 
and Halma operations (including newly 
acquired businesses) and to joint 
venture partners, suppliers, customers 
and distributors relating to our 
businesses. While we encourage an 
open culture whereby any issues can be 
raised and handled locally at business 
level, we recognise that there will be 
times when it is not appropriate, or a 
person will not be comfortable, raising 
a concern through line management. 
An independent third party provider, 
Expolink, has been appointed to 
operate a confidential reporting service 
which enables employees to raise any 
concerns they may have in confidence 
and, if they wish, anonymously via the 
telephone or by web-reporting. All 
reports are treated confidentially and 
are provided to the Group Company 
Secretary for review and to ensure that 
they are appropriately investigated 
and concluded. Halma is committed to 
ensuring that anyone raising a concern 
in good faith is not subject to any 
victimisation or detrimental treatment, 
although a malicious allegation may 
result in disciplinary action.
Anti-bribery and corruption
Halma has a zero-tolerance policy 
on bribery and corruption which 
extends to all business dealings and 
transactions in which we are involved. 
This includes a prohibition on making 
political donations, offering or 
receiving inappropriate gifts or 
making undue payments to influence 
the outcome of business dealings. Our 
robust policy and guidance in this area 
is routinely reviewed and compliance 
with the policy is checked as part of 
the half-year and year-end process.
During 2017, we are rolling out anti-
bribery and corruption training to 
senior management across the Group.
Responsible investment
Investing in Halma shares meets 
the criteria of many professional 
and private investors who base 
their decisions on environmental, 
ethical and social considerations. 
The Group is a world leader in several 
key environmental technologies and 
has a reputation for honesty and 
integrity in its relationships with 
employees, customers, business 
partners and shareholders.
Halma has been a member of the 
FTSE4Good UK index since its 
establishment in July 2001. In 2016, 
Halma participated in CDP’s Climate 
Change Questionnaire, which assesses 
how companies are incorporating 
sustainability into their business 
strategy and practices, and achieved a 
score of ‘Awareness C’. It is our 
intention to participate in CDP’s 2017 
Questionnaire.
Social conditions can be improved 
for all through the creation of wealth. 
Halma creates wealth responsibly 
allowing our employees, customers, 
business partners and shareholders 
to determine where this wealth is 
best distributed.
Human rights 
Halma’s Human Rights and Labour 
Conditions Policy reflects the core 
requirements of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and 
the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, 
including the conventions relating 
to forced labour, child labour, non-
discrimination, freedom of association 
and right to collective bargaining. 
We do not tolerate practices which 
contravene these international 
standards. Regulatory demands 
upon us vary considerably around 
the world, so Halma establishes the 
core structure to ensure that Group 
companies fully comply with legislative 
and regulatory requirements while 
permitting them to tailor their 
approach to their particular needs.
Compliance with, and respect for, 
these core requirements are 
integrated within our organisation. 
Everyone working for Halma is 
responsible for having due regard 
for human rights. Managers and 
supervisors must provide leadership 
that promotes human rights as an 
equal priority to other business issues. 
All employees are responsible for 
ensuring that their own actions do not 
impair the human rights of others, and 
are encouraged to bring forward, in 
confidence, any concerns they may 
have about human rights. Our Chief 
Executive, Andrew Williams, has 
overall responsibility for ensuring 
that human rights considerations are 
integral to the way in which existing 
operations and new opportunities 
are developed and managed.
Modern Slavery Act 
Halma published its first Modern 
Slavery Act Statement in September 
2016. Since the introduction of 
the Act, we have worked to raise 
awareness of this important agenda. 
During the year, a guidance note was 
prepared and sent to all businesses 
raising awareness of the Act and the 
issue of modern slavery in business 
and supply chains. Each business was 
requested to consider the potential 
issue of modern slavery and human 
trafficking within their business and 
supply chain. In addition, we are rolling 
out Modern Slavery Act training to 
senior management across the Group 
during 2017/18 to ensure that our 
business management understand 
their responsibilities and consider the 
Act in their operations. 
The Group will publish its next annual 
Modern Slavery Act Statement 
for this year in September 2017.

Record results
Halma achieved record revenue and

year. Revenue increased by 19.0% 
to £961.7m (2016: £807.8m) and 
adjusted

 profit was up by 16.9% 
to £194.0m (2016: £166.0m). Our 
balance sheet remains strong with 
increased financial capacity to invest 
in growth and to acquire. The Board is 
proposing a dividend increase of 7%, 
the 38
th
 consecutive year of 5% or 
more dividend growth. 
Statutory profit before taxation 
increased by 15.7% to £157.7m 
(2016: £136.3m). Statutory profit 
is calculated after charging the 
amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangible assets of £43.9m 
(2016: £23.1m) and after crediting 
acquisition related items, including 
revisions to provision for acquisition 
contingent consideration and related 
foreign exchange movements, of 
£9.5m (2016: £7.2m charge) arising 
from current and prior year 
acquisitions. The reduction in forecast 
acquisition contingent consideration, 
and the related impairment 
of acquired intangible assets are 
primarily attributable to Visiometrics 
and are discussed in the Acquisition 
section below. There was a gain on

Revenue grew by 16.5% in the first 
half increasing to 21.3% in the second 
half. There was a significant positive 
contribution from currency translation 
in both halves, but this was greater in 
the second half. Organic revenue 
growth at constant currency was 2.1% 
in the first half increasing to 6.2% in 
the second half with particularly good 
growth in the two safety sectors.

Statutory profit is also after charging 
£1.9m for the restructuring of Pixelteq,

The amount is less than the figure of 
£2.1m included in the Half Year report. 
There were 52 weeks in 2016/17

 profit growth was also 
higher in the second half at 20.8% 
compared to 12.0% in the first half. 
The contribution to profit from 
currency translation was greater in the 
second half. Organic profit growth at 
constant currency was 2.0% in the first 
half increasing to 5.0% in the second 
half. The first half/second half split of 
adjusted
1
 profit was 43%/57% slightly 
more weighted to the second half than 
our more typical 45%/55% pattern. 
All four sectors delivered revenue 
and profit growth. Process Safety 
grew strongly in the second half as 
expected, to deliver revenue and profit 
growth following a decline in the first 
half. The highest rates of revenue and 
profit growth were in the Medical 
sector boosted by the contribution 
from acquisitions and currency. 
Infrastructure Safety grew by less in 
the second half than in the first half 
although delivered a strong result for 
the year. Environmental & Analysis 
built on the strong performance in the 
prior year, with high profit growth in 
the second half. 
At organic constant currency all sectors 
achieved revenue growth. All except 
Process Safety delivered profit growth 
for the year, although it did deliver 
profit growth in the second half. 
Central administration costs were 
£10.5m (2016: £8.3m). As expected 
there was an increase in investment 
in talent development, international 
expansion and improvements in cyber 
security. In the prior year there was 
a profit on sale of a Group freehold 
property. We expect a further increase 
in the underlying costs in 2017/18 as 
we continue to invest in the growth 
of the Group.
Widespread growth
There was strong revenue growth 
in all regions. Widespread organic 
growth was boosted by positive 
currency impacts and the benefit 
of acquisitions. 
The USA continues to be our largest 
revenue destination increasing by 
27% to contribute 36% (2016: 34%) of 
Group revenue. All sectors grew in the 
USA with the largest increase in the 
Medical sector. In Mainland Europe 
revenue increased by 17% and all 
sectors grew, with a particularly 
strong performance by Infrastructure 
Safety. Asia Pacific was up 21%, with 
all except Process Safety growing 
strongly. Asia Pacific revenue is now 
only 2% lower than revenue in the UK, 
where revenue rose by 7%. Africa, Near 
and Middle East grew by 9% and Other 
countries increased by 29% with good 
growth in Canada and some recovery 
in South and Central America.
Revenue from territories outside UK/
Mainland Europe/USA grew by 19%, 
ahead of our 10% growth target. 
This was in line with growth in 
revenue in UK/Mainland Europe/USA.
Due to the significant currency and 
acquisition impacts the underlying 
performance is better understood when 
measured at organic constant currency. 
The USA grew in the year by 1% at 
organic constant currency with 
Infrastructure Safety showing a decline. 
Some larger contracts towards the end 
of the second half of the prior year did 
not repeat contributing to a flat second 
half performance in the USA in 2016/17 
for the Group. Mainland Europe 
grew by 6% in the year, well ahead of 
the 2% growth in the first half with 
Infrastructure Safety delivering very 
strong second half growth. The UK 
grew by 5% in the year following 1% first 
half growth again with Infrastructure 
Safety performing well in the second 
half together with a good performance 
in Environmental & Analysis. 
Asia Pacific grew by 9% at organic 
constant currency ahead of the 7% 
first half growth, with strong growth 
in Medical and good growth 
in Environmental & Analysis and 
Infrastructure Safety. China grew by 
11% with growth in all sectors. Africa, 
Near and Middle East performance 
was mixed with Process Safety up and 
Environmental & Analysis down. There 
was organic constant currency growth 
in all four sectors in Other countries. 
Continued high returns
Halma’s Return on Sales
2
 has 
exceeded 16% for 32 consecutive years. 
We aim to deliver Return on Sales in 
the range of 18-22%. This year Return 
on Sales was 20.2% (2016: 20.6%). 
Return on Sales for Process Safety 
reduced this year but strengthened 
in the second half and remains at 
the high rate of 24%. Medical and 
Infrastructure Safety sectors 
remained broadly in line with last year. 
Environmental & Analysis improved 
profitability, building on the increase 
in the prior year and achieved 19% 
Return on Sales. Higher financing 
costs and lower Return on Sales from 
recent acquisitions contributed to 
the slightly reduced Return on Sales 
for the Group.
Adjusted
1
 gross margin (revenue less 
direct material and direct labour costs) 
remained steady at 64.5% (2016: 
64.2%) continuing a long trend of 
stability and reflecting strong 
management of pricing and input costs.
Return on Total Invested Capital
2
 
(ROTIC), the post-tax return on the 
Group’s total assets including all 
historic goodwill, remained at the 
high level of 15.3% (2016: 15.6%). 
ROTIC is a relentless metric. Every year 
the addition of prior year retained 
earnings to Total Invested Capital 
mean that high rates of organic 
constant currency profit and 
acquisition growth are needed just to 
maintain ROTIC. Currency movements 
also have an impact on ROTIC. Total 
Invested Capital, which includes 
significant US Dollar and Euro assets, 
has typically been affected by 
currency movements more than the 
post-tax return. 
Our objective is to continue to invest in 
our businesses to deliver growth whilst 
maintaining a high level of ROTIC. At 
15.3% ROTIC was once again ahead of 
our target of 12% and well in excess of 
Halma’s Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (WACC), estimated to be 
7.1% (2016: 8.1%).
Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
62 Significant currency impacts
Halma reports its results in Sterling. 
Our other key trading currencies are the 
US Dollar, Euro and to a lesser extent 
the Swiss Franc. Over 45% of Group 
revenue is denominated in US Dollars 
and approximately 15% in Euros.
The Group has both translational 
and transactional currency exposure. 
Translational exposures arise on the 
consolidation of overseas company 
results into Sterling. Translational 
exposures are not hedged. 
Transactional exposures arise where 
the currency of sale or purchase 
transactions differs from the 
functional currency in which each 
company prepares its local accounts.
After matching currency of revenue 
with currency costs wherever 
practical, forward exchange contracts 
are used to hedge a proportion (up to 
75%) of the remaining forecast net 
transaction flows where there is a 
reasonable certainty of an exposure.
We hedge up to 12 months and, in 
certain specific circumstances, up to 24 
months forward. At 1 April 2017 over 
50% of our next 12 months’ currency 
trading transactions were hedged. 
There is a good degree of natural 
hedging within the Group in US Dollars 
but we typically spend less in Euros 
than we sell and so have a net exposure 
of approximately €40m at any time.
We saw continued volatility in 
currencies throughout the year and 
this had a significant impact on the 
results. Average exchange rates are 
used to translate results in the Income 
Statement. Sterling weakened in the 
first half of the year, in particular 
following the result of the EU 
referendum in the UK, by an average 
11% relative to the US Dollar and 12% 
against the Euro. For the year as a 
whole Sterling was on average 13% 
weaker against both the US Dollar 
and the Euro. Currency translation 
therefore had a positive impact of 
9.8% on revenue and 10.5% on 
adjusted
1
 profit for 2016/17. 
Based on the current mix of currency 
denominated revenue and profit, 
a 1% movement in the US Dollar 
relative to Sterling changes revenue by 
£4.4m and profit by £0.8m. Similarly, 
a 1% movement in the Euro changes 
revenue by £1.2m and profit by £0.3m.
We expect currency rates to continue 
to be volatile. If currency rates through 
the 2017/18 year were as follows: 
US Dollar 1.30/Euro 1.15 relative to 
Sterling, and assuming a constant mix 
of currency results, we would expect 
approximately 1% positive currency 
translation impact on revenue and 
profit in 2017/18 compared with 
2016/17. On this basis there would 
be a positive impact in the first half 
of the year, mostly reversing in the 
second half of the year. 
Increased financing cost
The net financing cost in the Income 
Statement of £9.3m was higher than 
the prior year (2016: £7.1m). The 
average cost of financing was higher 
due to the increased interest rate on 
long-term borrowing following the 
US Private Placement completed 
in January 2016. Average debt for 
the year was also higher, following 
acquisition expenditure made in the 
second half of the prior year (see the 
‘Average debt and interest rates’ table 
on page 65 for more information).
Interest cover (EBITDA as a multiple of 
net interest expense as defined by our 
revolving credit facility) was 30 times 
(2016: 46 times) which was well in 
excess of the four times minimum 
required in our banking covenants.
The net pension financing charge 
under IAS 19 is included within the 
net financing cost. This year it 
decreased to £1.6m (2016: £2.0m) due 
to a combination of a lower net pension 
deficit at the start of the year and 
lower discount rate than the prior year. 
Steady group tax rate
The Group’s approach to tax is to 
ensure compliance with the tax 
regulations in all of the countries in 
which it operates. The key features of 
this are: (1) Tax compliance – Halma 
is committed to maintaining good 
relationships with tax authorities 
based on cooperation, transparency 
and paying in full the tax due in each 
jurisdiction; (2) Tax strategy – our 
tax arrangements have an underlying 
business purpose and, where possible, 
we consider mitigating tax in 
compliance with local legislation; and 
(3) Tax policy – the Board of Directors 
is regularly updated, either directly or 
through the Audit Committee, on the 
Group’s Tax policy and management 
of tax risks.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
63 Financial Review  
continued
The Group has major operating 
subsidiaries in 10 countries so the 
Group’s effective tax rate is a blend 
of these national tax rates applied to 
locally generated profits. A significant 
proportion (approximately one 
quarter) of Group profit is generated 
and taxed in the UK. The Group's 
effective tax rate on adjusted profit 
was just below the prior year at 
21.5% (2016: 21.9%). 
We benefit from widely claimed R&D 
related tax incentives, exemptions 
and reliefs (for example under the 
UK ‘Patent Box’ rules).
There remains significant uncertainty 
over potential tax legislation changes 
in the USA, our largest region. Such 
changes are not expected to be 
imminent. We would benefit from a 
reduction in the rate of corporation 
tax but the overall impact on Halma 
would depend on the package of 
changes. We continue to monitor 
the position closely. 
Strong cash generation
Cash generation is an important 
component of the Halma model 
underpinning further investment in 
our businesses, supporting value 
enhancing acquisitions and funding 
an increasing dividend. Our cash 
conversion in 2016/17 was strong. 
Adjusted operating cash flow was 
£175.5m (2016: £148.3m) and 
represented 86% (2016: 86%) of 
adjusted operating profit, ahead of 
our cash conversion KPI target of 85%.
A summary of the year’s cash flow is 
shown in the table on page 66. The 
largest outflows in the year were in 
relation to dividends and taxation 
paid. Working capital outflow, 
comprising changes in inventory, 
receivables and creditors, totalled 
£13.9m (2016: £5.8m). This outflow 
was higher than typical following 
strong revenue growth in the final 
quarter leading to increased year 
end debtor balances. Debtor days 
remain in line with the prior year 
and outstanding debtor balances 
are actively reviewed as part of 
our year end process. 
Dividends totalling £49.8m 
(2016: £46.5m) were paid to 
shareholders in the year. Taxation 
paid was £33.2m (2016: £27.2m).
Capital allocation and funding
Halma aims to deliver high returns, 
measured by Return on Total Invested 
Capital (ROTIC), well in excess of 
our cost of capital. Future earnings 
growth and strong cash returns 
underpin ROTIC and our capital 
allocation as follows:
Investment for organic growth
Organic growth is our priority 
and is driven by investment in our 
businesses, in particular through 
capital expenditure, innovation of 
new products, international expansion 
and the development of our people.
Regular and increasing 
returns to shareholders
We have maintained a long-term 
progressive dividend policy as 
our preferred route for delivering 
cash returns to shareholders.
Value enhancing acquisitions
We supplement organic growth 
with acquisitions in related markets. 
This brings new technology and 
intellectual property into the Group 
and can expand our market reach.
Investment for organic growth
All sectors continue to innovate and 
invest in new products with R&D 
spend determined by each individual 
Halma company. This year R&D 
expenditure grew by 23% with 
increased investment through the 
year, in particular in the Infrastructure 
Safety sector. Excluding currency 
impacts, R&D expenditure increased 
by 13%. R&D expenditure as a 
percentage of revenue increased to 
5.3% (2016: 5.1%). In the medium 
term we expect R&D expenditure to 
increase broadly in line with revenue.
Under IFRS accounting rules we 
are required to capitalise certain 
development projects and amortise 
the cost over an appropriate period, 
which we determine as three years. 
In 2016/17 we capitalised £10.7m 
(2016: £8.6m), and amortised £6.8m 
(2016: £5.0m). This results in an asset 
carried on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, after £1.4m of foreign 
exchange gain, of £28.8m 
(2016: £23.5m). All R&D projects 
and particularly those requiring 
capitalisation, are subject to rigorous 
review and approval processes.
Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and computer software this year was 
£24.4m (2016: £24.1m). The prior year 
included additional investment of £4m 
in Group properties. The underlying 
increase in fixed assets was spread 
across the four sectors supporting 
our operating capability, capacity 
and growth. We anticipate increased 
capital expenditure in the coming year. 
Regular and increasing  
returns for shareholders
Adjusted
1
 earnings per share increased 
by 17% to 40.21p (2016: 34.26p). 
Statutory earnings per share 
increased by 19% to 34.25p (2016: 
28.76p). We deliver shareholder value 
via consistent growth in earnings per 
share and this is reflected in our senior 
management share-based incentives.
The Board is recommending a 7.0% 
increase in the final dividend to 8.38p 
per share (2016: 7.83p per share), 
which together with the 5.33p per 
Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
64 share interim dividend gives a total 
dividend of 13.71p (2016: 12.81p), up 
7.0%. This year dividend cover (the 
ratio of adjusted profit after tax 
to dividends paid and proposed) is 
2.93 times (2016: 2.67 times). 
The final dividend for 2016/17 is 
subject to approval by shareholders at 
the AGM on 20 July 2017 and will be 
paid on 16 August 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at 14 July 2017. 
We continue with a long-term 
progressive dividend policy, 
maintaining a prudent level of 
dividend cover. The aim is to 
deliver consistent, sustainable 
and affordable dividend growth. 
Dividend growth has been an 
important contributor to our Total 
Shareholder Return over many years. 
The Board’s determination of 
recommended annual dividend 
increases takes into account the 
medium-term rate of organic 
constant currency growth, organic 
investment needs and acquisition 
opportunities, while maintaining 
moderate debt levels. 
One acquisition in the year
Acquisitions and disposals are 
an important part of our growth 
strategy. We buy businesses 
already successful in, or adjacent 
to, the niches in which we operate. 
Sector acquisition resources to 
support this strategy have been 
further increased in the year. 
In January 2017 we acquired FluxData, 
based in New York State, which joins 
our Environmental & Analysis sector. 
The initial consideration was US$12m 
(£9m). Deferred contingent 
consideration of up to US$15.5m 
(£12m) is payable for growth to March 
2019. Our current estimate is that 
Average debt and interest rates
2017 2016
Average gross debt (£m) 300.5 208.1
Weighted average interest rate on gross debt 2.00% 1.54%
Average cash balances (£m) 67.3 57.7
Weighted average interest rate on cash 0.32% 0.38%
Average net debt (£m) 233.3 150.4
Weighted average interest rate on net debt 2.49% 1.99%
US$11m (£9m) will be paid in deferred 
contingent consideration and this has 
been provided for in these accounts. 
There were three acquisitions 
completed in the second half of 
2015/16. In the first half of 2016/17, 
in aggregate, these contributed less 
to revenue and profit than their run 
rates at acquisition. As expected their 
contribution increased in the second 
half of this year with contracts in 
place at acquisition progressing to 
plan. An increased contribution is 
anticipated in the coming year and 
we expect a good performance from 
these acquisitions over the long term. 
The acquisition of Visiometrics S.L. in 
the prior year was structured with a 
high element of deferred contingent 
consideration to reduce the financial 
risk to the Group if the vendor's 
growth forecast targets were not 
met. Deferred contingent consideration 
previously provided for of £10m has 
been released in 2016/17 relating to a 
specific customer where sales targets 
will not be achieved. Offsetting this is 
the £12m impairment of the customer-
related intangible asset attributable 
to the same customer. Both of these 
items are included in the adjustments 
to profit detailed in Note 1 to the 
accounts. Our current estimate is 
that £12.0m remains to be paid in 
deferred contingent consideration 
on this acquisition and this amount 
is provided for in these accounts. 
Funding capacity increased 
Halma operations are inherently cash 
generative and the Group has access 
to competitively priced debt finance 
providing good liquidity for the Group. 
Group treasury policy is conservative 
and no speculative transactions 
are undertaken. We continue to 
fund organic and acquisition 
growth through our strong cash 
flow and use of debt facilities. 
In November 2016 we increased 
our Revolving Credit Facility from 
£360m to £550m for five years 
to 2021 on favourable terms. This 
supplements the US$250m US Private 
Placement drawn down in January 
2016 which provided diversification 
of Group funding. 
At the year end net debt was £196.4m 
(2016: £246.7m), a combination of 
£265.2m of debt and £68.8m of cash 
held around the world to finance local 
operations. The gearing ratio at year 
end (net debt to EBITDA) reduced to 
0.86 times (2016: 1.27 times) following 
cash inflows this year. We are 
comfortable operating at this level of 
gearing and would increase to 2 times 
gearing if the timing of acquisitions 
required it. Net debt represents 5% 
(2016: 7%) of the Group’s year end 
market capitalisation. The Group 
continues to operate well within its 
banking covenants with significant 
headroom under each financial ratio.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

continued
These sources of funding provide 
Halma with the financial resources to 
operate within its existing business 
model for the medium term, 
continuing investment in our 
business and with substantial 
capacity for further acquisitions.
Pensions update
We closed the two UK defined benefit 
(DB) plans to new members in 2002. 
In December 2014 we ceased future 
accrual within these plans with future 
pension benefits earned within the 
Group’s Defined Contribution (DC) 
pension arrangements. These 
changes have reduced Group risk.
The Group accounts for post-
retirement benefits in accordance 
with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The 
Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects 
the net deficit on our pension plans 
at 1 April 2017 based on the market 
value of assets at that date and the 
valuation of liabilities using year 
end AA corporate bond yields. 
On an IAS 19 basis the deficit on the 
Group’s DB plans at the 2016/17 year 
end has increased to £74.9m (2016: 
£52.3m) before the related deferred 
tax asset. The value of plan assets 
increased to £265.0m (2016: £221.9m). 
In total, about 50% of plan assets 
are invested in return seeking assets 
providing a higher expected level 
of return over the longer term. 
Plan liabilities increased to £339.9m 
(2016: £274.2m) primarily due to the 
reduction in the discount rate from 
3.4% to 2.5%.
The plans’ actuarial valuation reviews, 
rather than the accounting basis, 
determine any cash deficit payments 
by Halma. Following the most recent 
triennial actuarial valuation of the two 
UK pension plans, cash contributions 
aimed at eliminating the deficit were 
agreed with the trustees. In 2016/17 
these contributions amounted to 
£10.2m (2016: £7.7m) with agreed 
modest future increases. The next 
triennial valuations are due in late 
2017 and early 2018 and following 
these appropriate revised contribution 
rates will be set as necessary.

Strategic Report Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
66 Risk management
Halma has a well-established business 
and financial model which has 
delivered success consistently over 
the long term. The model is based 
on considerable autonomy and 
accountability at operating company 
and sector level, within a robust 
strategic framework supported by 
strong policies and clear procedures. In 
the year we have continued to develop 
risk and control capability within each 
sector and we recruited a Director 
of Risk and Internal Audit at Group 
level to help support growth of our 
businesses and our proactive 
approach to risk management.
Risk is managed closely and is spread 
across well-resourced companies, each 
of which manages risk to its individual 
level of materiality. There are 
extensive review processes in place 
including peer financial review and 
risk-based internal audit. The principal 
Group risks have been referenced 
in this Annual Report primarily on 
pages 22 to 27 and in the Chief 
Executive’s Strategic Review and 
Sector Reviews. In addition principal 
risks are highlighted in the Audit 
Committee Report on page 83 
and Auditor’s Report on page 114.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) requires regular 
monitoring of risk by the Board. 
As noted above, for many years we 
have had comprehensive and regular 
review of risk taking place at many 
levels throughout the organisation 
and this is discussed more fully in 
the Strategic Report and Corporate 
Governance Report.
The UK referendum decision in June 
2016 to leave the European Union 
has added a new dimension to the 
uncertainties surrounding global 
economic growth. In 2016/17, 
approximately 10% of Group revenue 
came from direct sales between 
the UK and Mainland Europe. Our 
decentralised model with businesses in 
diverse markets and locations enables 
each Halma company to adapt quickly 
to changing trading conditions, such 
as weaker Sterling, offering 
competitive pricing opportunities 
for exports from the UK. 
Halma has formed an executive 
working group that is tasked with 
assessing and monitoring the impacts 
on our business and to communicate 
updates and guidance as the Brexit 
process evolves. To date, the following 
risks have been identified as having 
an actual and/or potential impact on 
our business:
 — Economic conditions – increased 
overall uncertainty including the 
specific impacts on growth, inflation, 
interest and currency rates
 — Defined benefit pension liability – 
movements in bond yields affecting 
discount rates which may increase 
the liability
 — Laws and regulations – potential 
changes to UK and EU-based law 
and regulation including product 
approvals, patents and import/
export tariffs
Cyber security represents an ongoing 
risk to our businesses. This year, in 
addition to continuing our online 
employee awareness programme, 
we have further strengthened 
the proactive monitoring of threats 
and our system resilience. We continue 
to extend our international team and 
also continue to design cyber security 
into our products. 
The Board considers all of the above 
factors in its review of ‘Going Concern’ 
as described on page 82. In addition 
the Viability Statement is presented on 
page 82, extending the Board’s review 
over a three year period. Both reviews 
have been concluded satisfactorily.
This Annual Report and Accounts 
is prepared in line with the latest 
requirements for integrated reporting 
and the Board has taken care to 
ensure that it is ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’. The Audit Committee 
took a key role in assessing compliance 
with reporting requirements supported 
by robust management processes.

and compliance statements
Good governance is 
essential for enabling 
our Board to operate 
effectively in the 
leadership of the Group 
and in promoting the 
success of the Company 
in the long term.
Paul Walker
Chairman
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present Halma's Corporate 
Governance Report. This Report 
aims to provide shareholders and other 
stakeholders with an appreciation of 
how our Group is managed and the 
governance and control framework 
in which Halma operates. Good 
governance is essential for enabling 
our Board to operate effectively in 
the leadership of the Group and in 
promoting the success of the 
Company in the long term. 
Our culture of openness, transparency, 
constructive challenge and support, 
facilitates management in embedding 
our governance and control procedures 
throughout the business.
The Board is committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and this Report sets out 
how we have applied the main 
principles and relevant provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014. 
Leadership
Our focus on improving the quality 
and performance of Halma's 
management team continued 
throughout 2016/17. Senior 
management appointments have 
been made in a number of key areas 
to support Halma's growth strategy, 
including sector talent, M&A, 
communications and strategic 
development in Asia Pacific.
At Board level, we promoted Jennifer 
Ward in September 2016, to an 
expanded role and main Board position 
of Group Talent and Communications 
Director. In October 2016, Jo Harlow 
joined the Board as a non-executive 
Director. Jo offers complementary and 
new skills to our Board and her global 
experience in innovation, product 
development and marketing has been 
particularly valuable. As I highlighted 
in last year's Report, Carole Cran 
assumed the role of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee in July 2016 and 
successfully led a competitive audit 
tender process during the year.
Governance Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
68 I believe that we continue to have the 
right balance of skills, experience and 
knowledge on our Board to deliver 
strong leadership, to make clear and 
effective decisions and to harness the 
open and transparent culture which 
encourages our businesses to be 
innovative and entrepreneurial. 
Compliance statements
Throughout the year ended 1 April 
2017, the Company has complied with 
the provisions as set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
(a copy of which is available on the 
Financial Reporting Council's website 
at www.frc.org.uk). The Group's 
approach to risk management and 
internal control is set out on pages 
20 to 21. 
The Directors confirm that they 
consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Company's position and performance.
How the Board supported strategy 
Governance at Halma, like its business model, is ingrained in the operating culture throughout the organisation and 
within the Board of Directors. With a model that has had great success in terms of consistent dividend growth and 
financial performance, the Board has not needed to oversee any large scale changes but has not been complacent and 
has continued to improve the discipline around its processes and procedures to ensure that they are fitting for a company 
that is near the top of the FTSE 250.
Strategy The Board’s governance role What we have achieved
grow

4 2
The Board has set a clear strategy for 
growth and provides businesses with the 
necessary resources and support to enable 
them to contribute to the Group's growth 
objective.
 — Our autonomous, but supportive, business 
model has enabled our Process Safety sector 
companies to respond rapidly to changing 
market conditions and to diversify into new 
markets, while maintaining a presence in the 
oil and gas markets. 
acquire

The Board monitors the diversity of the 
Group's portfolio of businesses to ensure 
that proposed acquisitions or new market 
niches of strategic interest complement 
the strategic objectives of the Group.
 — The increase in M&A resource within the sectors 
during 2016/17 has enabled the Group to build 
more relationships and explore more opportunities 
to collaborate with other businesses, which will 
assist us in securing appropriate acquisitions to 
support our growth objective. 
empower

The Board empowers local management 
to operate with relative autonomy, within 
a clear structured governance framework 
that provides the necessary tools and 
guidance without stifling the agile and 
entrepreneurial approach that underpins 
Halma's business model.
 — Our biennial HITEx conference, which 
encourages innovative thinking and 
collaboration between our businesses, was 
attended by over 200 of our business leaders, 
providing our companies with the tools and 
insight that they will need to adapt their 
respective businesses quickly to changes in this 
digital age.
innovate

4 2
The Board recognise that part of Halma's 
fundamental strength is derived not 
only from its selection of specialist 
technologies in markets with resilient 
growth drivers but also in targeting 
investment in the development of new 
and existing products and services. 
 — Investment in developing new products and 
services in existing and adjacent markets is a key 
strength that our businesses can leverage by 
being part of Halma. Our R&D investment 
across the Group has been over £50m in the 
past year.
Halma's business model is set out on 
pages 4 and 5 and an explanation of 
the strategy and longer-term 
objectives of the Company is 
contained within the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 67.
Board priorities
Our priorities for 2017/18 are to: 
focus on delivering a robust 
performance across all sectors 
during a time of political and economic 
change in many regions; build on the 
foundations we have established with 
talent and innovation; continue to 
encourage our businesses to innovate, 
collaborate and seek out opportunities 
that keep pace with digital 
developments; and seek acquisition 
opportunities in new and existing 
markets which complement our 
strategy and portfolio and can 
deliver the growth that we expect. 
 
Paul Walker
Chairman
13 June 2017
At Executive Board level, Paul 
Simmons was promoted to Sector 
Chief Executive, Infrastructure Safety, 
following Nigel Trodd's retirement. 
We also created a new Executive 
Board position of Chief Innovation and 
Digital Officer to assist our businesses 
in the development and execution of 
digital strategies and support them 
in advancing innovation. The search 
process for this position has now 
concluded and Inken Braunschmidt is 
joining the Group in July 2017 from 
innogy SE, a renewables energy 
company spun out of RWE in 2016.
I am proud of our achievements 
on gender diversity at Board level 
and am mindful of the need to 
increase ethnic and cultural 
diversity at a senior level.
Biographies for each of the Directors 
and for the Executive Board are 
set out on pages 70 to 72. You can

72 The role of the board 
The ultimate role of the Board is to 
promote the long-term success of the 
Company by delivering sustainable 
shareholder value. In order to fulfil 
its duty, the Board must ensure that 
the Group operates within a clearly 
defined operating structure which 
fits within a robust governance and 
control framework.
The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for the management, direction and 
performance of the Group, and 
sets the strategic goals which the 
Company’s businesses implement 
through their business plans. The 
Board is also responsible for ensuring 
appropriate resources are in place 
to achieve its strategy and deliver 
sustainable performance.
The Board’s powers are derived from 
the Company’s Articles of Association 
but certain decisions and oversight roles 
have been delegated to its committees. 
The Board has established a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision and has approved terms of 
reference where it has delegated 
responsibilities to its committees.
The chairman of each committee 
reports to the Board on the activities 
of their committee. Committee minutes 
are approved by the committee and 
then reviewed by the Board.
Division of responsibilities
Chairman’s

 — ensuring that the Board and its committees’ performances are evaluated on a regular basis;
 — ensuring adequate time is available for all agenda items and that the Board receives accurate, 
clear and timely information; and
 — ensuring that there is effective communication with shareholders.

standing Board agenda items and 
a summary of the matters that 
are formally reserved for the Board 
(as set out in writing) are summarised 
on pages 76 and 77.
Corporate governance framework 
Halma companies benefit from a highly 
decentralised organisational structure 
which delivers sustainable competitive 
advantage while maintaining the 
benefit of being part of a larger group 
(through collaboration with other 
Group companies and central 
investment in areas such as talent 
development, innovation and 
international expansion). A robust 
corporate governance framework is 
essential in a decentralised group in 
order to maintain good oversight 
and control over: financial and 
management reporting; compliance 
and regulatory matters; risk 
management; and the approval 
of significant decisions (such as 
acquisitions, disposals or material 
agreements). The operation of 
the Board and the committees is 
described in this Report and further 
information on each committee is 
detailed within the separate 
committee Reports.

The diagram opposite sets out the top 
level corporate governance framework 
for Halma and how the Board and its 
Committees interact. The interface 
between the operating companies 
and this governance framework is 
described below and is illustrated in 
the diagram on page 21 in relation 
to Group risk management.
Each operating subsidiary company 
within the Group has its own board 
of directors, which meets regularly to 
fulfil its legal duties and operational 
and financial obligations in managing 
the affairs of the company. The Sector 
CEO, or a Sector Vice President, is 
appointed as a director of each 
subsidiary within their sector and acts 
as Chairman at each board meeting. 
Each subsidiary must operate in 
accordance with the Group’s internal 
procedures, which set out the 
minimum standards required in the 
areas of financial reporting, health 
and safety, ethics, HR, administration 
and information technology. These 
procedures are made available 
throughout the Group via a centrally 
managed electronic portal and are 
subject to regular review and update. 
By way of example, a new policy has 
been added during the year relating to 
the Modern Slavery Act and many 
policies have been updated to reflect 
changes in legislation, financial 
reporting or best practice.
Each of the four sectors has a 
management board which meets 
regularly to review financial and 
operational performance, M&A 
and governance matters relating 
to companies within that sector. 
Reports prepared by each Sector 
CEO are provided to, and reviewed 
by, the Executive Board.
Division of responsibilities
Board meetings
The Board has six regular meetings 
scheduled each year but will meet, 
as required, to consider urgent or 
non-routine matters. In March 2017, 
an additional meeting was held to 
consider the recommendation from 
the Audit Committee to propose to 
shareholders, at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting, the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as Auditor for the accounting year 
ending 31 March 2018.
All Directors are issued with an agenda 
and meeting papers via an electronic 
board portal in the week preceding 
each Board meeting. The Board 
and each Director has access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, as well as the option of 
obtaining independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense.

Principal Committees of the Board
The Board has established three  
principal Committees:
 — the Nomination Committee;
 — the Audit Committee; and
 — the Remuneration Committee.
Details of their constitution, the roles 
and responsibilities and activities of 
each Committee during the year are 
set out in their respective Reports, 
which follow this Governance Report.
The Board has also established three 
formal, topic-specific, Committees 
to which it has delegated certain 
powers to negotiate, review and 
administer matters within their 
area of responsibility:
 — the Share Plans Committee;
 — the Bank Guarantees and Facilities 
Committee; and
 — the Acquisitions and Disposals 
Committee.
Each Committee operates under its 
own terms of reference, which have 
been approved by the Board.
In addition, the Board has established 
an informal management committee, 
the Executive Board, which is chaired 
by the Chief Executive. This Executive 
Board provides a forum in which the 
executives, representing their sector 
or functional area, can review and take 
decisions on operational and financial 
matters that arise in the day-to-day 
business operations. The Executive 
Board is also an effective means 
of implementing actions from the 
Halma Board and providing oversight 
of operational matters.

Effectiveness
Independence 
The Board has reviewed the 
independence of the Chairman and 
each non-executive Director and 
considers the Chairman and all of 
the non-executive Directors to be 
independent of management and free 
from business or other relationships 
that could interfere with the exercise 
of independent judgement. The Board 
believes that any shares in the Company 
held by the Chairman and non-executive 
Directors serve to align their interests 
with those of the shareholders. 
Tony Rice was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director in July 2015.
Time allocation 
The Board benefits from the wide 
variety of skills, experience and 
knowledge that each Director has. 
However, being available and 
committing sufficient time to the 
Company is essential and therefore 
the number of external directorships 
that a non-executive Director holds 
is an important consideration when 
recruiting and when performing the 
annual evaluation of non-executive 
Directors effectiveness.
Executive Directors are permitted to 
accept one external appointment, 
subject to the prior approval of the 
Chairman. Approval will only be given 
where the appointment does not 
present a conflict of interest with the 
Group’s activities and where the role 
is considered to be beneficial to the 
development of the individual, which 
will also benefit the Company.
In addition to the scheduled Board 
meetings (six per year), non-executive 
Directors are expected to attend the 
AGM, the annual strategy meeting 
and certain other Company events 
and site visits throughout the year. 
A time commitment of around 
20 days per annum is the anticipated 
requirement for each non-executive 
Director. Confirmation is obtained on 
appointment from each non-executive 
Director that they can allocate 
sufficient time to the role. Details of 
Board attendance during the year are 
Composition of the Board Board diversity
outside the formal meeting. This forum 
has proven useful for a number of years. 
The Chairman and non-executive 
Directors also meet after each Board 
meeting without executive Directors 
present to ensure there is an 
opportunity to discuss potentially 
sensitive matters. The Chief Executive 
will join for part of these meetings at 
least once per annum.
The Senior Independent Director 
meets with the non-executive Directors 
without the Chairman present, at least 
annually, to evaluate the Chairman’s 
performance. The Executives are 
also given the opportunity to meet 
with the Chairman and/or the Senior 
Independent Director separately. 
The outcome of these meetings is fed 
back to individuals by the Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director or 
Chief Executive, as appropriate.
Re-election of Directors 
All of the current Directors will stand 
for re-election, and in the case of Jo 
Harlow and Jennifer Ward, election, 
at the forthcoming AGM. Following 
the annual evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees, all Directors 
standing for election or re-election 
at the AGM continue to be effective, 
hold recent and relevant experience 
and continue to demonstrate 
commitment to the role. Biographical 
details of each Director standing for 
election or re-election are set out in 
the Notice of Meeting.
Liability insurance
Each Director is covered by 
appropriate directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance, at the Company’s 
expense. In addition, there are Deeds 
of Indemnity in place, which provide an 
indemnity from the Company to the 
Director in respect of any proceedings 
brought by third parties against 
Directors personally in their capacity 
as Directors of the Company. The 
indemnity does not extend to certain 
areas, including: any liability to pay 
a fine levied in criminal proceedings; 
defending criminal proceedings where 
the Director is convicted and such 
conviction is final; defending any civil 
proceedings brought by the Company 
or an associated company; or in any 
proceedings for disqualification of 
the Director.
set out on page 77 and biographical 
details of each Director are set out 
on pages 70 and 71.
Induction of new Directors
Newly appointed non-executive 
Directors follow a tailored induction 
programme, which includes dedicated 
time with Group executives and visits 
to companies within each of the four 
sectors. 
Jo Harlow met with the Company 
Secretary to review the tailored 
induction materials, which provide a 
comprehensive overview of: the Group 
and the legal and organisational 
structure; the governance framework; 
the role of non-executive Director; key 
business contacts at Group, sector and 
operating company level; and details 
of the external advisers. In addition to 
the latest Annual Report and Company 
announcements, further materials such 
as recent broker coverage, the last 
Board evaluation and CEO conference 
presentations were also provided. 
Jo met the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Finance Director on a one-to-one 
basis on her appointment and has 
subsequently met the other members 
of the Board and Executive Board 
along with senior managers from 
Head Office functions and the sectors. 
A varied programme of site visits to 
operating companies across the 
sectors was arranged.
The Chairman reviews training and 
development needs of the Board, 
and each individual Director, at least 
annually. Briefings and presentations 
from subject specialists form part 
of the ongoing training needs for 
the Directors. 
Performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal 
evaluation of its performance, and 
of each Director, on an annual basis. 
The principal Committees of the 
Board undertake an annual evaluation 
of their effectiveness, in accordance 
with their terms of reference.
As in prior years, the Board met in 
January 2017 before its scheduled 
meeting to provide a forum for 
discussion of the Board evaluation

Stakeholder engagement in action
In September 2016, Andrew Williams hosted a site 
visit for institutional investors and analysts at 
Apollo Fire Detectors in Havant, UK. 
The objective of the day was to give investors 
an in-depth view of both Halma's largest sector 
(Infrastructure Safety) and its largest company.  
Apollo is one of the world's largest manufacturers 
of smoke detectors, modules and notification 
devices. Throughout the day, investors were given 
an insight into how our businesses have continued 
to deliver growth and strong returns in 
competitive global markets and how this has been 
underpinned by its investment in innovation, 
talent and international expansion.
A summary of the presentation, including the 
slides and a video of the investor day, is available

Acquisition prospects 
and business partners
Our M&A teams are in frequent 
dialogue with numerous businesses 
that could be potential acquisition 
prospects or business partners in  
the future. The Executive Board  
take a strategic lead in driving the 
acquisition pipeline. Our Executives 
act as the primary contact in M&A 
discussions – promoting the benefits 
of working with Halma to business 
owners and evaluating the cultural 
and strategic fit with our Group.
Operating companies 
The executive members of the Board 
have frequent contact with our 
companies and make regular visits 
across all of the sectors. The non-
executive members of the Board carry 
out company visits as part of their 
induction and routinely thereafter. 
The Board members also engage with 
our current and future business leaders 
by their personal contributions to our 
development programmes and their 
attendance at the annual Leadership 
Conference and biennial HITEx event. 
This regular interaction between the 
Board and the businesses provides 
a vital channel of communication 
and forum for open dialogue, which 
encourages the sharing of knowledge 
and experience.

Nomination Committee Report
Role of the committee
The Committee is appointed by the 
Board and operates under written 
terms of reference, which are available 
on the Group’s website. The primary 
role and responsibilities of the 
Committee are to:
 — review the size, balance and 
composition (evaluating the skills, 
knowledge and experience) of the 
Board and its Committees, ensuring 
that they remain appropriate and 
making recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes;
 — lead the process for Board 
appointments;
 — oversee the succession planning 
requirements for the Board and 
other senior executives, including 
the identification and assessment 
of potential candidates and making 
recommendations to the Board for 
its approval; and
 — keep under review the leadership 
needs of the Group in relation to 
both its executive Directors and 
other senior executives, including 
any recommendations made by the 
Chief Executive for changes to the 
executive membership of the Board.
Composition of the committee
The Committee currently comprises 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
and five independent non-executive 
Directors, therefore comprising a 
majority of non-executive members. 
The Chairman acts as the Chairman 
of the Committee but would not chair 
a meeting which was dealing with 
Committee Chairman's overview
As I outlined in last year's Report, 
our focus for 2016/17 was building 
the operations and talent in the sector 
structure. I am pleased to report 
that during the year we strengthened 
our M&A resource by completing our 
recruitment of M&A executives for 
each sector. The Committee considered 
the balance of the executive Directors 
on the Board and determined that the 
Board would benefit from an additional 
executive perspective – one that 
complemented the strengths of 
our existing team. Accordingly, the 
Committee promoted Jennifer Ward 
to the Board, not only in recognition 
of the importance of the role and 
the pivotal part that she has played 
in recruiting and developing talent 
within our Group, but also her clarity 
of understanding of Halma's 
strategic aspirations.
In October 2016, we were delighted 
to appoint Jo Harlow to the Board 
as non-executive Director. Jo brings 
a wealth of experience gained in 
international organisations and new 
skills to the Board around innovation, 
product development and marketing.
Shortly after our financial year end, 
the Board announced that Kevin 
Thompson, Finance Director, had 
indicated his intention to retire during 
2018. The Committee will assist the 
Board in identifying and selecting a 
successor. The search process, under 
the direction of the Committee, has 
now commenced.

the appointment of Jo Harlow;
 — recommending the appointment of 
Jo Harlow as non-executive Director

Board appointments and process
Prior to making a recommendation 
to the Board for the appointment 
of Jo Harlow, the Committee 
undertook the following process:
 — identification of skills, experience 
and knowledge that would be 
complementary for the general 
role of non-executive Director, 
in particular skills and experience 
of digitalisation, datafication, 
new product development and 
innovation;
 — selection and recommendation of 
global search firm Lygon Group, 
which has no connection with 
the Company;
 — a shortlist of candidates was 
reviewed by the Committee 
based on candidate reports 
prepared by Lygon Group;
 — interviews and meetings were 
arranged with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and several members of the 
Committee; and
 — a full review of the candidates was 
undertaken by the Committee and 
a unanimous recommendation 
made to the Board.
Prior to making a recommendation 
to the Board for the appointment 
of Jennifer Ward, the Committee 
undertook the following process:
 — Held regular discussions on the 
composition and balance of the 
Board including consideration 
regarding the reduction in executive 
Directors on the Board following 
Neil Quinn’s retirement;
 — identified the skillset required to 
contribute most effectively to 
Halma’s strategic discussions 
balanced with the operational 
and financial experience within 
the existing executives;
 — recognised the broad perspective 
Jennifer offers having made 
enormous strides on talent while 
demonstrating good commercial 
skills in terms of her own 
contribution and her insight into 
how our businesses can achieve 
their own strategic aspirations;
 — considered wider succession 
planning amongst the executives;
Non-executive Director tenure
 — considered the scope of Jennifer’s 
influence throughout the Group 
both internally and externally; and
 — a full discussion was undertaken 
by the Committee at its meeting 
in September and a unanimous 
recommendation made to the Board.
Diversity
The Board recognises the benefits 
to an International group of greater 
diversity on the Board and in 
management positions throughout 
the Group. At the year end, and at 
the date of this Report, the Board 
comprised ten Directors, including 
four women (40%).
The spread of nationalities are six British, 
three American and one Brazilian.
Halma has the ambition to increase 
the number of operating company 
executives based outside Europe and 
the USA to better reflect the revenue 
generated outside those markets 
and to embrace diversity and inclusion 
across the Group. To support this 
ambition, the Board has adopted a 
Diversity and Inclusion policy and a 
programme of training to support the 
policy has been rolled out to senior 
executives and head office personnel.
Operating subsidiary company 
boards are encouraged to invite local 
personnel with diverse skill sets to 
attend board meetings to provide a 
fresh perspective and bring a diverse 
and inclusive approach to the decision-
making body. 
Further details on diversity and 
inclusion are set out in the Our people 
section on page 52.
Priorities for the coming year
The Committee’s priorities for 2017/18 
will be:
 — to recruit a Finance Director, to fill 
the vacancy when Kevin Thompson 
retires in 2018, with the relevant 
financial experience and business 
acumen to be able to support the 
Chief Executive in his leadership 
of the Company as it continues 
its growth trajectory; and
 — a focus on succession planning 
and talent development at 
executive and Board level.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
During the year, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks affecting the Company, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal risks and 
uncertainties, including an analysis of the potential impact and mitigating 
actions, are set out on pages 22 to 27 of the Strategic Report. 
The Board has assessed the viability of the Company over a three-year 
period, taking into account the Group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks and uncertainties. Whilst the Board has no 
reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a longer period, 
it has determined that three years is an appropriate period. In drawing its 
conclusion, the Board has aligned the period of viability assessment with 
the Group’s strategic planning process (a three-year period). The Board 
believes that this approach provides greater certainty over forecasting and, 
therefore, increases reliability in the modelling and stress testing of the 
Company’s viability. In addition, a three-year horizon is typically the period 
over which we review our external bank facilities, and is also the performance 
period over which awards granted under Halma’s share-based incentive plan 
are measured.
In reviewing the Company’s viability, the Board has identified the following 
factors which they believe support their assessment: the Group operates in 
diverse but relatively non-cyclical markets;
 — there is considerable financial capacity under current facilities and the 
ability to raise further funds;
 — the decentralised nature of our Group ensures that risk is spread across 
our businesses and sectors, with limited exposure to any particular 
industry or market;
 — there is a strong culture of local responsibility and accountability within 
a robust governance and control framework; and
 — an ethical approach to business is set from the top and flows throughout 
our business.
In making their assessment, the Board carried out a comprehensive exercise 
of financial modelling and stress-tested the model with various scenarios 
based on the principal risks identified in the Group’s annual risk assessment 
process. In each scenario, the effect on the Group’s KPIs and borrowing 
covenants was considered, along with any mitigating factors. Based on this 
assessment, the Board confirms that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three-year period to 31 March 2020.
Internal control statement
The Board’s responsibilities
The Board has overall responsibility 
to the shareholders for the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk 
management, and the review of the 
system’s effectiveness is carried out 
with the assistance of the Audit 
Committee. Whilst not providing 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatements or loss, this system 
is designed to identify and manage 
those risks that could adversely 
impact the achievement of the 
Group’s objectives. The Group’s risk 
management structure and process 
is detailed on pages 20 and 21. 
The Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties are detailed 
on pages 22 to 27.
The Board confirms that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group 
and for determining the nature and 
extent of the significant risks it is 
willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The Board, advised by the 
Audit Committee, regularly reviews 
the process, which has been in place 
for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Accounts. This process is 
in accordance with the Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting. The Board has continued 
to improve and embed controls 
throughout the Group and will 
continue to keep the systems under 
review to ensure that the internal 
control and risk management 
framework remains fit for purpose.
Review of internal 
control effectiveness
The Board regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls. 
The review is principally based on 
reviewing reports from management 
to consider whether significant risks 
have been identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled. 
The Group’s external Auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, has audited the 
financial statements and has 
reviewed the financial control 
systems to the extent considered 
necessary to support the audit report.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the main trends and 
factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and 
position, and the financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities, 
are set out in the Strategic Report. 
In addition, note 26 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities, and its exposures 
to currency and liquidity risks.
Having issued the US Private 
Placement in 2015, and renegotiated 
its £550m five-year Revolving Credit 
Facility in November 2016, of which 
£469m remains undrawn at the 
date of this report, the Group has 
considerable financial resources. The 
Group contracts with a diverse range 
of customers and suppliers across 
different geographic areas and 
industries and no one customer 
accounts for more than 2% of Group 
turnover. As a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is 
well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
After conducting a formal review 
of the Group’s financial resources, 
the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts.
Longer-term viability
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board 
has considered the Company’s  
longer-term viability and sets  
out its Viability Statement below.

82 Audit Committee Report
Committee chairman’s overview
It is a pleasure to be presenting my 
first Report as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, in what has been a very 
busy nine months in the role. During the 
year, the Committee has continued 
to focus on the effectiveness of the 
controls across our Group. The 
appointment to a newly created role 
of Director of Risk and Internal Audit 
has not only strengthened the internal 
audit resource but also added 
dedicated resource to help to develop 
our approach to risk management 
and further embed our risk processes 
across the Group. The evolution of our 
risk management process is an area 
which the Committee will continue 
to focus on over the coming year.
The Committee agreed with the 
Board that the external audit tender 
process would be brought forward 
and, under my leadership, a rigorous 
process was successfully concluded 
in the first quarter of 2017, with a 
recommendation being proposed to 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM to 
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers 
as auditor to the Company. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank 
Deloitte for the work carried out as 
Halma's auditor over the last 14 
years and I look forward to building 
as strong a relationship with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers over 
the coming years.

Report continued
The Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Finance Director are also in 
attendance at Committee meetings, 
along with the Group Financial 
Controller and Director of Risk and 
Internal Audit. Representatives from 
the external Auditor also attend each 
Committee meeting. 
The Committee, and separately the 
Committee Chairman, meet with  
the Director of Risk and Internal Audit 
on a regular basis.
Activities in 2016/17
The Committee spent a considerable 
amount of time outside formal 
Committee meetings on the external 
audit tender process. Details of 
the main areas of review by the 
Committee throughout the year 
are set out in the table opposite.
Allocation of time
Governance
The Committee meets at least three  
times per year and routinely meets 
with the external Auditor without 
the executive Directors present. It is 
chaired by Carole Cran, independent 
non-executive Director, who 
is a chartered accountant with recent 
and relevant financial experience. 
The Finance Director and Group 
Financial Controller work closely with 
the Committee Chairman to facilitate 
open communication and regular 
information flow. Each Committee 
member brings a wealth of 
professional and practical knowledge 
and experience which is relevant to the 
Company's industry. Such abilities 
ensure that the Committee as a whole 
functions with competence and 
credibility. The Committee receives 
regular updates on changes to 
financial accounting standards and 
reporting requirements, regulatory 
and governance changes and 
developments around risk 
management, fraud prevention & 
detection and cyber security.
In its advisory capacity, the 
Committee confirmed to the Board, 
that based on its review of the Annual 
Report and Accounts and internal 
controls that support the disclosures, 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provide 
the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
its business model and strategy.
Whistleblowing
The Committee has responsibility for 
ensuring that arrangements are in 
place for employees to raise concerns 
or suspicions they may have about 
possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters. An 
external organisation, Expolink, 
operates a 24 hour confidential 
reporting service for the Group, which 
provides employees with the choice of 
making a report via a multilingual 
The Committee's activities during the year

telephone line or by web reporting. 
The service allows employees to 
remain anonymous (subject to local 
legislation) and also provides a case 
reporting number which ensures that 
there is a mechanism for two-way 
communication between the reporter 
and the Company, even if they have 
chosen to remain anonymous. 
Confidential reports from this service 
are provided to the Company 
Secretary for investigation and to 
report any significant cases to the 
Committee. The Director of Risk and 
Internal Audit investigates cases 
relating to financial matters (including 
fraud) and the Company Secretary

During the year, the Committee 
carried out a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements. 
Engagement of the external auditor
The external Auditor is engaged to  
express an opinion on the Group and 
Company financial statements. The 
audit includes the review and testing 
of the data contained in the financial 
statements to the extent necessary

on the truth and fairness of the 
financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the external 
Auditor of the Group since 2003 and a 
review of the independence of Deloitte 
LLP is undertaken each year. At the 
year end, the Auditor formally 
confirmed its independence and 
that objectivity has been maintained. 
The Committee concluded that the 
relevant independence continues to be 
met. In addition, the Senior Statutory 
Auditor responsible for the Group audit 
is rotated at least every five years – the 
most recent Senior Statutory Auditor 
change, to Nigel Thomas, having taken 
effect from the financial year ended

In accordance with UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Committee has 
primary responsibility recommending 
to the Board the appointment/
Policy on auditor independence and services
Permitted audit-related services
Audit-related services are non-audit services, as specified in the Ethical 
Standard, that are largely provided by the external auditor and where 
the work is closely related to the work performed in the audit and where 
threats to auditor independence are clearly insignificant and safeguards 
need not be applied. These audit related services include:
 — reporting required by law or regulation to be provided by the auditor;
 — reviews of interim financial information;
 — reporting on regulatory returns; 
 — reporting to a regulator on client assets; 
 — reporting on government grants; 
 — reporting on internal financial controls when required by law or regulation; and
 — extended audit work that is authorised by those charged with governance 
performed on financial information and/or financial controls where this 
work is integrated with the audit work and is performed on the same 
principal terms and conditions.
Prohibited non-audit services
Under this policy, the external auditor must not provide non-audit services to 
Halma or any of its EU subsidiaries (or to any of Halma’s non-EU subsidiaries 
with effect from 1 April 2018) which fall within the general categories of 
services listed under the policy (including tax, bookkeeping, payroll, design 
or implementation of risk management procedures, valuation services, 
legal services, internal audit services, services relating to financing/capital 
structure/investment/promotion or dealing in shares, HR services, 
organisational design or cost control) or any of the specific services 
as set out in the Ethical Standard and Staff Guidance Note 05/2016.
Fee cap
The external auditor can be engaged to perform audit-related services without 
the requirement for a separate tender process unless the anticipated fees 
exceed £150,000. If the anticipated fees are above £150,000, the Audit 
Committee must approve the decision to engage the external auditor in 
advance, and always subject to the overall fee cap. The total fees for audit 
related and non-audit services paid to the external auditor in any year cannot 
exceed 70% of the average fees for audit services charged over a three-year 
period. The Audit Committee will be notified of all projects with the external 
auditor with estimated fees between £75,000 and £150,000 and, at each 
meeting, the Committee will receive a summary of all fees, audit and non-audit, 
payable to the external auditor.
re-appointment of the external Auditor 
and will lead the process for putting 
the audit contract out to tender at 
least every 10 years. As reported last 
year, Halma was required to re-tender 
the external audit by June 2023 and 
it was anticipated the process would 
be completed before the end of 
December 2018. The Board, on the 
recommendation of the Committee, 
agreed that it was in the best interests 
of the Company to commence an 
external audit tender process during 
the first quarter of 2017. Following a 
thorough selection process, the Board 
is recommending to shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers as auditor 
of the Company for the financial year 
commencing 2 April 2017 onwards.
Accordingly, it is not envisaged, at 
the date of this Report, that another 
competitive auditor tender process 
will be conducted before 2027. The 
Committee confirms that the 
Company was in compliance with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014, during the financial year 
ended 1 April 2017. 
Tender process
In January 2017, the Board, on the 
recommendation of the Committee, 
agreed that a tender process for the 
appointment of the external auditor 
should be undertaken. Under the 
direction of Carole Cran, the following 
process was carried out on behalf of 
the Committee:
 — a desktop review of external audit 
providers to the FTSE 100 was 
carried out (the FTSE 100 was 
considered to be the most suitable 
benchmark given the global reach, 
market capitalisation and growth 
potential of Halma). Based on 
the review, given their extensive 
FTSE 100 experience and global 
reach, the four biggest audit firms 
(Deloitte, Ernst & Young, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and 
KPMG) were invited to tender for 
the external audit. Deloitte 
indicated that they did not intend 
to participate in the tender process 
and the tender proceeded with the 
three firms; 
 — a Request for Proposal was issued 
which set out the timetable and 
process for the tender, scope of 
the work and key requirements 
that Halma would assess against, 
information to be provided in an 
externally hosted data room, access 
to key Board and management 
personnel and details of a data 
analytical review to be undertaken 
by each firm; 
 — data room access granted to each 
firm providing key management 
and financial information;
 — meetings between each firm and 
Halma management, including the 
Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
Company Secretary, Head Office 
functions, Sector CEOs and Sector 
Finance Directors;
 — meetings between the audit partner 
from each firm and Carole Cran;
 — external references for each firm 
taken up personally by Carole Cran;
 — audit firm presentations to Halma; 
 — completion of scorecards for each 
firm, focusing on audit quality 
(including the Financial Reporting 
Council's Audit Quality Review 
Inspection Reports), strength 
and experience of the audit team, 
data analytics offering and their 
fee proposal;
 — the Committee agreed two firms 
to recommend to the Board, 
with their preference being 
PricewaterhouseCoopers; and
 — the Board approved the 
recommendation and announced 
the outcome of the audit tender in 
the Company's Trading Update 
announcement on 23 March 2017.

Auditor independence 
The Group’s ‘Policy on Auditor 
Independence and Services provided 
by the External Auditor’ sets out 
restrictions on the categories of 
non-audit services which the external 
auditor is allowed to provide to the 
Group, in order to safeguard auditor 
objectivity and independence. This 
Policy was updated to reflect the 
changes to the FRC's Ethical Standard 
and approved by the Board in April 
2017. A summary of the non-audit 
services which are permitted and 
prohibited under the Policy, is set  
out above.
At each meeting, the Committee 
receives a summary of all fees,  
audit and non-audit, payable to  
the external Auditor.
The audit fees payable to Deloitte LLP 
for the year ended 1 April 2017 were 
£1,017,000 (2016: £957,000) and 
non-audit service fees were £142,000 
(2016: £290,000). The principal 
non-audit service undertaken by 
Deloitte was tax advisory related. A 
summary of fees paid to the external 
Auditor is set out in note 6 to 
the Accounts.
The external Auditor confirmed  
its independence as Auditor of the 
Company, in a letter addressed to  
the Directors. 
External audit effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit 
process is assessed by the Committee, 
which meets regularly throughout 
the year with the Senior Statutory 
Auditor and senior audit manager. 
A key component to the overall 
effectiveness of the process is the 
open approach adopted by the Group 
and the Auditor, under which each 
party raises potential accounting and 
financial reporting issues when they 
arise, rather than limiting the 
exchange to the period in which the 
formal audit and review are taking 
place. This approach is supported 
by a formal annual survey process. 
Surveys are tailored and issued to 
three distinct groups of respondents: 
 — Subsidiary Finance Directors, 
including Group Finance; 
 — Sector Chief Executives and 
Sector Finance Directors; and 
 — Audit Committee members 
and attendees.
The survey completed by the first 
group is divided between questions 
focusing on audit quality and client 
service. As this group is involved 
primarily in the execution phase of the 
audit, the responses cover practical 
audit management issues as well as 
observations made on the integrity 
and quality of audit field teams. As 
the second and third group interact 
mainly with the senior audit team 
and the Senior Statutory Auditor, the 
questions are focused more on general 
audit planning and wider areas of the 
audit relationship.
In addition to assessing the 
effectiveness of the external Auditor, 
the Committee recognises that Group 
management has an important role 
to play in the overall effectiveness 
of the external audit process and the 
Auditor is therefore asked to conduct 
its own survey of both subsidiary and 
head office companies with which 
Deloitte interacts. This survey 
addresses items such as the 
timeliness, quality and reliability 
of data provided to the Auditor.
Taken together, the Committee 
believes that sufficient and appropriate 
information is obtained to form an 
overall judgement on the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. The 
external audit effectiveness process 
findings from last year’s review  
were incorporated into the audit 
processes for this year, to maintain the 
process of continuous improvement.
During the year, Halma's financial 
statements for the period ended  
2 April 2016 were selected by the Audit 
Quality Review (AQR) team at the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for a 
cyclical review of the quality of 
Deloitte's audit. While disclosure of the 
audit quality category awarded is 
not permitted in this Report, the 
Committee can confirm that it received 
and reviewed the FRC's report and 
noted its findings. Furthermore, Carole 
Cran carried out a separate review of 
the findings with the Audit partner and 
has confirmed that there is nothing 
raised in the report which should be of 
concern to the Committee. The actions 
which Deloitte proposed in response to 
the FRC's report were supported by 
the Committee. 
Taking into account the internal 
review of the Auditor's effectiveness, 
along with the findings of the FRC's 
AQR report, the Committee is 
satisfied that Deloitte remains 
effective as auditor to the Company. 
As Deloitte will be resigning as 
Auditor, no recommendation for 
their re-appointment will be made 
at the forthcoming AGM and, 
following the audit tender process 
described above, the Board will be 
recommending the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers as Auditor. 
Risk management and internal controls
Through monitoring of the 
effectiveness of its internal controls 
and risk management processes, 
the Committee is able to maintain 
a good understanding of business 
performance and key areas of 
judgement and decision-making 
within the Group.
Details of risk management and 
internal controls are set out on 
pages 20 and 21. 
Significant issues in relation to 
financial reporting matters in 2016/17
During the year, the Committee 
considered significant risks and issues 
in relation to the Group’s financial 
statements and disclosures 
relating to:
 — the assessment of the carrying 
value of goodwill due to the 
significance of the amounts 
recorded on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet and the judgements 
involved in assessing goodwill 
for impairment;
 — the risk that acquisitions are not 
accounted for correctly in line with 
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ 
including the recording of fair 
value adjustments and the 
identification and valuation of 
acquired intangible assets;
 — the valuation of any contingent 
consideration arising on acquisitions 
in current and prior periods;
Governance Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
86  — the judgements involved in valuing 
defined benefit pension plans 
including the discount rate, the 
mortality assumption and the 
inflation rate; and
 — risk that revenue is incorrectly 
recognised for significant contracts 
which have unusual elements.
These issues were discussed with 
management at various stages during 
the year and during the preparation 
and finalisation of the financial 
statements. After reviewing the 
presentations and reports from 
management, the Committee is 
satisfied that the financial statements 
appropriately address the critical 
judgements and key estimates, both in 
respect of the amounts reported and 
the disclosures made. The Committee 
is also satisfied that the significant 
assumptions used for determining  
the value of assets and liabilities 
have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are sufficiently robust. 
The Committee has discussed these 
issues with the Auditor during the 
audit planning process and at 
the finalisation of the year-end audit 
and is satisfied that its conclusions are 
in line with those drawn by the Auditor 
in relation to these issues.
The Committee’s process for 
challenging the assumptions of 
management and addressing 
the risks identified includes the 
following activities:
 — assessing treatments of 
contingent consideration payment 
arrangements against the 
requirements of IFRS 3 and IFRS 13;
 — focusing on, monitoring regularly 
and constructively challenging, the 
reasonableness of the assumptions 
used in impairment calculations by 
management; challenging the 
appropriateness of judgements and 
forecasts used including discount 
rates, growth rates, the level of 
aggregation of individual cash 
generating units and methodology 
applied, and any other associated 
disclosures in note 11 to the Accounts;
 — assessing capitalisation of 
development costs in line with the 
accounting policy and standards;
 — assessing the assumptions in 
determining the pension 
obligations, particularly given 
market volatility and determining 
whether the key assumptions were 
reasonable. These assumptions 
were also benchmarked against 
other listed companies and 
variances highlighted for 
consideration; and
 — considering the appropriateness 
and reasonableness of stated 
judgements and conclusions and 
that reporting was accurate.
As part of the above process the 
Committee specifically considered 
the following:
 — the treatment and valuation of the 
contingent consideration payable 
in relation to FluxData;
 — the fair value of acquired intangible 
assets and carrying values; 
 — management's assessment and 
reasons for the lower than expected 
returns at Visiometrics, CenTrak 
and Firetrace, and the likelihood of 
contract delays at the latter two 
companies being resolved and 
fulfilled;
 — composition of the cash generating 
units and related calculations;
 — the evidence supporting the going 
concern basis of accounts 
preparation, the Viability 
Statement and the risk 
management and internal control 
disclosure requirements; 
 — the terms of two significant 
contracts which have elements 
of revenue which would require 
appropriate deferral under 
ISA 240;  and
 — accounting assumptions and 
disclosures of the defined benefit 
pension plans.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
report and accounts
One of the key governance 
requirements is for the report 
and accounts to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. Ensuring  
that this standard is met requires 
continuous assessment of the financial 
reporting issues affecting the Group 
on a year-round basis in addition to 
a number of focused exercises that 
take place during the Annual Report 
and Accounts production process.
These focused exercises can be 
summarised as follows:
 — a qualitative review, performed by 
the Group's finance and secretarial 
functions, of disclosures and a 
review of internal consistency 
throughout the Annual Report and 
Accounts. This review assesses 
the Annual Report and Accounts 
against objective criteria drawn 
up for each component of the 
requirement (individual criteria 
that indicate ‘fairness’, ‘balance’ 
and ‘understandability’ as 
well as criteria that overlap 
two or more components);
 — a risk comparison review, which 
assesses the consistency of the 
presentation of risks and significant 
judgements throughout the main 
areas of risk disclosure in the 
Annual Report and Accounts;
 — a formal review of all Board and 
Committee meeting minutes by 
the Company Secretary to ensure 
that all significant issues are 
appropriately reflected and given 
due prominence in narrative 
reporting; and
 — preparation and issue to the Audit 
Committee of the key working 
papers and results for each of the 
significant issues and judgements 
considered by the Audit Committee 
in the period.

balanced and understandable Annual 
Report and Accounts is set out on

87 Remuneration Committee Report
Committee Chairman’s overview
On behalf of the Board, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 1 April 2017.
Our executive remuneration framework 
operates within a culture of strong 
governance, a discipline which is 
reflected throughout the Company’s 
activities. Halma’s strategy is to build 
a strong competitive advantage 
in specialised safety, health and 
environmental technology markets 
with resilient growth drivers. This 
strategy has long been underpinned 
by the remuneration framework which 
balances a short-term incentive related 
to improvements in the Economic 
Value Added (EVA) in a financial year 
– including an element deferred for two 
years in the form of shares – with a 
longer-term share incentive related 
to Return on Total Invested Capital 
(ROTIC), Earnings per Share (EPS) 
and, formerly, Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR).
The Committee undertook a significant 
review of the remuneration policy in 
2015 leading to a new policy receiving 
the support of 98% of shareholders at 
our 2015 AGM. This represented our 
first full policy review for 10 years 
and coincided with the need to seek 
shareholder approval for a new 
long-term equity incentive plan to 
replace the previous time-expired plan.
Having now had two years following the 
implementation of the policy, I remain 
pleased to say that no structural 
changes are considered necessary to 
the policy or its implementation for the 
forthcoming year.
Internal appointments in 2016/17
As referenced in Paul Walker’s 
Nomination Committee narrative, 
Jennifer Ward was appointed to 
the Board mid-year, at which time 
the Committee considered her 
remuneration and set it in accordance 
with our policy. In this case, her salary 
was elevated to £300,000 per annum 
and her incentive opportunities aligned 
with those of her fellow Executive 
Director, Adam Meyers.
Remuneration outcomes in 2016/17
The Company has delivered another 
year of solid performance against 
our KPIs.
In particular, revenue grew by 19%, 
adjusted EPS grew by 17% and the 
Board is proposing a further 7% 
increase in dividend per share for 
shareholders. With tight controls on 
capital, the Economic Value Added 
performance condition generated 
total annual bonus payments to 
executive Directors of between 42% 
and 65% of base salary. Of these 
amounts one third will be deferred for 
two years and is payable in shares.
Performance was similarly robust 
over the three-year performance 
period for the performance share 
awards granted in 2014, with averaged 
ROTIC of 15.7% and Total Shareholder 
Return of 79% putting Halma in the 
top quartile of its comparator group.
Accordingly, 91.58% of the 
performance share awards is 
expected to vest. The Committee 
is satisfied that there has been a 
robust link between reward and 
performance over these periods.

Implementation of  
the policy for 2017/18
As mentioned, there are no 
structural changes proposed to 
the implementation of the policy for 
2017/18. Base salaries for executive 
Directors have been increased by 
1.8% to 4.0%, in line with the average 
increase for the workforce generally.
The Committee has determined 
appropriately stretching economic 
profit based targets for the annual 
bonus and has determined that the 
range of EPS and ROTIC targets for 
the performance share awards should 
be unchanged from the prior year.
As reported last year, the Committee 
is also responsible for determining the 
fee level for the Chairman and in 2016, 
we reviewed the fee level against 
market positions in peer companies. 
The shortfall in the fee level in relation 
to our assessment of an appropriate 
mid-market positioning, resulted in 
the Committee determining that Paul 
Walker’s fee should be increased to a 
mid-market level in two stages. The 
initial increase to £210,000 occurred 
effective 1 April 2016 and we anticipate 
this could be increased further in one 
years’ time, coincident with the next 
triennial policy review, subject to the 
Committee considering this to be 
appropriate in the circumstances.
The next review of the remuneration 
policy will occur during 2017/18 with a 
policy vote at the 2018 AGM. We do 
not anticipate the necessity to make 
any significant changes and will 
concentrate on ensuring the most 
appropriate metrics are set for 
incentive arrangements.
Shareholder voting at the 2017 AGM
As we are not making any further 
changes to our remuneration policy as 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
annual general meeting, there is no 
vote to approve the remuneration 
policy this year. There will be the 
usual advisory resolution to approve 
the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which focuses on the remuneration 
outcomes for the year under 
review and how the Remuneration 
Committee intends to implement 
the policy next year.
The Committee is aware of the latest 
developments in the executive pay 
arena, particularly those from 
institutional shareholders and we 
monitor these closely.
My colleagues on the Remuneration 
Committee and I hope that you will 
support the resolution approving 
the Remuneration Report.

89 Remuneration Policy
This section of the report details the remuneration policy for executive and non-executive Directors which shareholders 
approved at the 2015 annual general meeting. This policy formally came into effect from 23 July 2015, being the date of 
the 2015 AGM, and is effective for up to three years.
Compliance statement
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and Regulation 
11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors’ remuneration in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
In line with the Regulations, the following parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration are audited: the single figure 
for total remuneration for each Director, including annual bonus and performance share plan outcomes for the 
financial year ending 1 April 2017; plan interests awarded during the year; pension entitlements; payments to past 
Directors and payments for loss of office; and Directors’ shareholdings and share interests. All other parts of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration are unaudited.
Element and objective Operation and process Opportunity Performance measures
Executive Directors
Salary 
A fair, fixed remuneration reflecting 
the size and scope of the executive’s 
responsibilities which attracts and 
retains high calibre talent necessary 
for the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
Reviewed annually or following a material change in responsibilities. 
Salary is benchmarked periodically against appropriate comparators 
of a similar size and operating in a similar sector, and is linked to 
individual performance and contribution.
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of annual reviews (normally 
with effect from 1 April). Salaries for the financial year under review (and the following year) 
are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Salary increases for executive Directors will not normally exceed the average of the wider 
employee population other than in exceptional circumstances. Where increases are awarded 
in excess of the wider employee population, for example where there is a material change 
in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the Committee will provide the rationale 
in the relevant year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Not applicable
Benefits 
To provide benefits that are competitive 
within the relevant market.
Benefits are appropriate to the location of the executive and typically 
comprise (but are not limited to) a company car, life insurance, 
permanent disability insurance, private medical insurance, relocation 
and tax advice for international assignments.
Benefits may vary by role, and the level is determined to be appropriate for the role and 
circumstances of each individual executive Director. The maximum value will equate to 
the reasonable market cost of such benefits.
It is not anticipated that the current cost of benefits (as set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration) would increase materially over the period for which this policy applies.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances 
(e.g. relocation expenses or an expatriation allowance on recruitment, etc.) or in 
circumstances where factors outside the Company’s control have changed materially 
(e.g. market increases in insurance costs).
The rationale behind the exercise of such discretion will be provided in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Not applicable
Pension 
To provide competitive post-retirement 
benefits, or the cash allowance equivalent, 
to provide the opportunity for executives 
to save for their retirement.
Executive Directors participate in either a Group Defined Contribution 
pension plan or the US 401k money purchase arrangement. 
Cash supplements in lieu of Company pension contributions may be 
made to some individuals at a level dependent upon seniority and length 
of service. Cash supplements may be reduced to reflect the additional 
employer social costs thereon.
To the extent the pension contributions exceed the local tax allowance, 
the contributions may be paid to the executive, subject to taxes and 
social charges.
Some executives are deferred members of the Group defined benefit 
pension plan which closed to future accrual in December 2014.
Defined Contribution: maximum contribution of 20% of pensionable salary which is capped 
at £155,528 (2015/16: £155,528). The cap increases annually relative to CPI. The maximum 
contribution rate for executives joining prior to 2014/15 was 27.5%.
Cash supplement: Halma contributes up to 26% of full salary if the executive Director is 
a former active member of the defined benefit pension plan. Defined Contribution members 
whose contributions exceed the local tax allowance are paid the excess contributions, on the 
capped pensionable salary, as a cash supplement, net of employer social costs.
401k: contributions of 3% of salary with a discretionary 2% profit share component subject 
to IRS caps. 
Defined benefit: now closed to future accrual, but provides a maximum pension equivalent 
to two thirds of final pensionable salary, up to a CPI-indexed cap; £155,528 for 2016/17 and 
£157,083 for 2017/18.

90 Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy is designed to promote the long-term interests of the Company by securing the high calibre 
executives needed to manage the Group successfully, and to align their interests with those of our shareholders by 
rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value. The policy also seeks to reward achievement of stretching performance 
targets without driving unacceptable behaviours or encouraging excessive risk-taking.
The Committee carried out a comprehensive review of remuneration during the 2014/15 year coincident with the expiry 
of the life of the 2005 Performance Share Plan. It noted that there were aspects of the previous policy that work well 
and were therefore retained. However, it also noted that both the Company and market practice have moved on in 
the 10 years since the last formal review. Accordingly, it introduced changes to the policy to reinforce the link between 
executive remuneration and the Company’s long-term performance enhancing the executives’ alignment with the 
long-term interests of shareholders.
There are six elements of the remuneration policy for executive Directors, which are summarised in the table below.

Annual Incentive 
To incentivise and focus management on 
the achievement of an objective annual 
target which is set to support the short- 
to medium-term strategy of the Group.
The structure of the Annual Incentive is reviewed at the start of the 
year to ensure that the performance measures and their weightings 
remain appropriately aligned with the Group’s strategy and are 
sufficiently challenging.
Performance targets are calibrated and set at the start of the year, with 
reference to a range of relevant reference points including the annual 
budget agreed by the Board. At the end of the year, the Committee 
determines the extent to which these targets have been achieved.
Payment of one third of any bonus is in the form of an award of shares that 
is deferred for two years, with vesting normally subject to continued service.
Dividend equivalents accrue over the vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents are paid in cash or shares at the end of the vesting period.
Deferral into shares provides a link to the long-term strategy of the 
Group and enhances the retentiveness of the policy.
A recovery and withholding provision enables the Company to recoup 
overpayments in the event of misstatement, error or misconduct, either 
through withholding future remuneration or requiring the executive to 
repay the requisite amount.
Maximum opportunity: 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
and 125% of base salary for other Directors.
Target opportunity: 60% of maximum.
Bonus payable at threshold: 0% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion to 
override the formulaic bonus outcome within the limits of the scheme where it believes the 
outcome is not truly reflective of performance and to ensure fairness to both shareholders 
and participants.
The bonus is based 
100% on the 
achievement of 
financial performance 
targets. The primary 
measure used to 
determine bonus 
outcomes is EVA, 
although the 
Committee may, 
at its discretion and 
from time to time, 
supplement EVA with 
additional financial 
measures that reflect 
Halma’s strategic 
priorities for the year, 
provided any such 
additional measure 
accounts for no more 
than 30% of the overall 
bonus opportunity.
Executive Share Plan (ESP) 
To incentivise executives to achieve 
superior returns to shareholders over 
a three-year period rewarding them 
for sustained performance against 
challenging long-term targets; to retain 
key individuals and align interests with 
shareholders, reflecting the sustainability 
of the business model over the long term 
and the creation of shareholder value.
Executive Directors are granted annual awards over Halma plc shares 
or a cash equivalent where required by regulations as determined by 
the Committee; awards vest after a period of at least three years 
based on Group performance.
Dividend equivalents accrue over the vesting period. Dividend equivalents 
are paid in cash or shares at the end of the vesting period, and only on 
those shares which vest.
A recovery and withholding provision enables the Company to recoup 
overpayments in the event of misstatement, error or misconduct, either 
through withholding future remuneration or requiring the executive to 
repay the requisite amount.
Maximum opportunity: Up to 200% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as to facilitate the recruitment of an external candidate, 
the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, exceed this maximum annual opportunity, 
subject to a limit of 250% of salary.
Threshold performance will result in the vesting of 25% of the maximum award.
Vesting of performance 
share awards is 
subject to continued 
employment and 
the Company’s 
performance over 
a three-year 
performance 
period. To the 
extent performance 
conditions are not met, 
awards will lapse.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
To encourage share ownership across 
all UK-based employees using HMRC-
approved schemes.
The SIP is an HMRC-approved arrangement. It entitles all UK-
based employees to receive Halma shares in a potentially tax-
advantageous manner.
Participation limits are in line with those set by HMRC from time to time. Not applicable
Chairman and non-executive Director fees
To attract individuals with the requisite 
skills, experience and knowledge to 
contribute to the Board.
Non-executive Director fees are determined by the Board and may 
comprise a base fee, committee chairmanship fee and Senior 
Independent Director fee.
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Committee.
Fees are normally reviewed annually in April, but typically only reset triennially. Increases 
are effective from 1 April.
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined by the Committee, and fees to NEDs are 
determined by the Board. The fees are calculated by reference to market levels and take 
account of the time commitment and the responsibilities of the NEDs.

Notes to the Policy Table
Payments from Existing Awards
The Committee will honour any commitment entered into, and executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award made, prior to the 
approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy on 23 July 2015. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Selection of Performance Measures
The performance measures used in Halma’s executive incentives have been selected to ensure incentives are challenging and reinforce the Group’s strategy 
and align executive interests closely with those of our shareholders.
In the annual bonus, the use of EVA, in summary, profit less a charge for capital employed (definition is provided on page 100) reinforces the Group’s 
business objective to double every five years through a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. Profit is a function of the extent to which the Company has 
achieved both its organic growth target and its success in identifying appropriate acquisition targets in current and past years. Ensuring that the cost of 
funding acquisitions is reflected in the bonus model means that executives share the benefit of an acquisition that outperforms expectations, but equally 
bear the cost of overpaying for an acquisition. Good or poor management of working capital is also reflected in the calculation of EVA.
In the ESP, EPS provides a disciplined focus on increasing profitability and thereby provides close shareholder alignment through incentivising shareholder 
value creation, and ROTIC reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong returns, thereby further strengthening the alignment of 
remuneration with the Group strategy. Performance targets are set to be stretching yet achievable, taking into account the Company’s strategic priorities 
and the economic environment in which it operates. Targets are calibrated taking into account a range of reference points, but are based primarily on the 
Group’s strategic plan.

Our approach to salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the level of responsibility, experience, individual performance, 
market levels and the Company’s ability to pay. The Committee considers remuneration surveys to establish market rates, as appropriate, but uses such 
data carefully so as to avoid an upward ratchet.

Component Approach
Salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, 
experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of any incumbent  
in the same role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make 
phased increases over a period of several years to achieve the desired position, subject to the 
individual’s development and performance in the role.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the current policy, as well as 
expatriation allowances and any necessary expenses relating to an executive’s relocation on 
appointment.
Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Company’s Defined Contribution pension plan, 
receive a cash supplement or local equivalent.
Annual bonus The scheme as described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year employed.
ESP New appointees will be granted performance awards under the ESP on the same terms as other 
executives, as described in the policy table.
SIP New appointees in the UK will be eligible to participate on identical terms to other employees.
External appointments
In the case of appointing a new executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing elements of 
remuneration, as follows:
In addition to the elements of remuneration set out in the policy table, in exceptional circumstances the Committee may 
consider it appropriate to grant an incentive award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of 
an individual or to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In making such awards, the 
Committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as closely as possible and in doing so consider relevant 
factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the payment mechanism, expected value and 
the remaining vesting period of these awards. 
Internal Appointments
Remuneration for new executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line 
with the policy for external appointees, as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior 
to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour those commitments. Incentive opportunities for 
below-Board level employees are generally no higher than for executive Directors, and incentive measures vary to ensure 
they are appropriate. 
Share Ownership Guidelines
To ensure alignment between the interests of executive Directors and those of shareholders, the Company requires 
executive Directors to progressively build up and maintain a beneficial holding of Halma plc shares equivalent to a 
minimum of 200% of salary (2014/15: 100%). Until such time as this threshold is achieved, executive Directors are 
required to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax value of any vested performance share award or deferred bonus 
share award.
Governance Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
94 Executive Director service contracts and exit payment policies
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a 
maximum of one year’s notice. The details of the Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below. Contracts  
will be available for inspection at the AGM and throughout the year at the Company’s registered office. 
Executive Director Date of service contract Date of service contract
Andrew Williams April 2003 One year
Kevin Thompson April 2003 One year
Adam Meyers July 2008 One year
Jennifer Ward January 2014 One year
The Company’s policy is to limit payments on cessation to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event 
that the employment of an executive Director is terminated, any amount payable will be determined in accordance with 
the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. 
No predetermined amount is provided for in the Directors’ contracts. The UK executive Director contracts enable the 
Company to pay up to one year’s salary in lieu of notice, with no contractual entitlement to any other benefits, and, 
under the rules, the Remuneration Committee may determine the individual’s leaving status for share plan vesting 
purposes. If the financial year end has passed, any bonus earned is payable to the individual. Adam Meyers’ service 
contract permits him to remain an employee for the entire period of notice enjoying any benefits related to employment. 
The share plan and bonus provisions are identical to the UK. Both contracts contain appropriate non-compete 
restrictions for a suitable period post-employment.
When considering termination payments under incentive schemes, the Committee reviews all potential incentive 
outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants. The table below summarises how the awards 
under the annual bonus and share plans are treated in specific circumstances under the rules of the relevant plan and 
the extent to which the Committee has discretion:

Pay-for-performance
The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future rewards for executive Directors, and the potential split 
between different elements of pay, under three different performance scenarios: ‘Fixed’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Halma’s remuneration policy, applied to salaries as at 1 April 2017. In the 
case of the Chief Executive, Finance Director and other executive Directors this assumes a performance share award 
level of 200%, 175% and 150% of salary respectively (which is the basis on which the policy will be applied in 2017/18). 
The projected values exclude the impact of any share price movements and dividend equivalents.
The ‘Fixed’ scenario shows base salary, pension and benefits only.
The ‘On-target’ scenario shows fixed remuneration as above, plus a target level of 60% of the maximum under the 
annual bonus and vesting of 50% of a single year’s award under the ESP.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus maximum level of annual bonus and ESP awards.

96 Non-executive Directors
Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors (NEDs) have a specific three-year term of engagement, subject 
to annual re-election at the AGM, which may be renewed for up to two further three-year terms if both the Director 
and the Board agree. The remuneration of the Chairman and the NEDs is determined by the Committee and the Board 
respectively, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders.
The contract in respect of the Chairman’s services provides for termination, by either party, by giving not less than 
six months’ notice.
The non-executive Directors have contracts in respect of their services, which can be terminated, by either party, 
by giving not less than three months’ notice. Contracts are available for inspection at the AGM and throughout the 
year at the Company’s registered office. Summary details of terms and notice periods for NEDs are included below.
Non-executive Director Date of appointment Notice period
Paul Walker April 2013 6 months
Daniela Barone Soares November 2011 3 months
Roy Twite July 2014 3 months
Tony Rice August 2014 3 months
Carole Cran January 2016 3 months
Jo Harlow October 2016 3 months
NEDs do not receive benefits from the Company and they are not eligible to join the Company’s pension plan or 
participate in any incentive schemes. Any reasonable expenses that they incur in performing their duties are reimbursed 
by the Company.
Paul Walker’s personal assistant is an employee of the Company.
Details of the policy on NED fees are set out in the table on pages 92 and 93.
NED recruitment
In recruiting a new Chairman or NED, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on pages 92 and 93.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining 
remuneration for executive Directors. However, the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees 
on the executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account the views of our shareholders and ‘best practice’ 
guidelines set by shareholder representative bodies. As part of their consideration of the new remuneration policy, 
the Committee consulted widely with the Company’s major institutional shareholders and their representative bodies. 
The Committee always welcomes feedback from shareholders on the Company’s remuneration policy. Detail on the  
votes received on the remuneration policy and Annual Report on Remuneration at the previous annual general meeting is 
provided on page 98.
External directorships
The Committee acknowledges that executive Directors may be invited to become independent non-executive directors 
of other listed companies which have no business relationship with the Company and that these roles can broaden their 
experience and knowledge to Halma’s benefit.
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one such appointment with the prior approval of the Chairman. Approval 
will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities and the 
wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual. Where fees are payable in respect of 
such appointments, these are retained by the executive Director.
Andrew Williams is a non-executive director of Capita plc. Fees paid to him during the period to 1 April 2017 were 
£64,500 (2016: £64,000).

97 Annual Remuneration Report
The following section provides details of how Halma’s remuneration policy was implemented during the financial year 
ending 1 April 2017, and how it will be implemented in 2017/18.
Role and responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to:
 — make recommendations to the Board on the framework for executive Directors’ and senior executives’ remuneration 
based on proposals formulated by the CEO;
 — determine and agree with the Board the policy and framework for the remuneration of the Chairman, CEO, other 
executive Directors, the Company Secretary and members of the Executive Board;
 — approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-related pay plans operated by the Company and 
agree the total annual payments made under such plans;
 — review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders, and determine, each year, 
whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to executive 
Directors and other senior executives and the performance targets to be set; and
 — determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each executive Director and other senior executives.
The Committee also monitors and considers, with the CEO, the framework of remuneration for sector and subsidiary 
executives and ensures a consistent approach is applied.
The Committee terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website.
As at 1 April 2017, the Committee comprised the following non-executive Directors:
 — Tony Rice (Chairman)
 — Paul Walker
 — Daniela Barone Soares
 — Roy Twite
 — Carole Cran
 — Jo Harlow (from 3 October 2016)
Jane Aikman was a member of the Committee during part of the year, until her retirement from the Board at the July 
2016 annual general meeting.
All members of the Committee are considered independent within the definition set out in the Code. None of the 
Committee has any personal financial interest in Halma (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year the Committee met formally three times. Attendance by individual members of the Committee is 
disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 77. In addition, Jo Harlow met with senior executives at the 
Company as part of her induction process when joining the Committee.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings. The CEO, Group Talent & 
Communications Director and Company Secretary attend the Committee’s meetings by invitation, but are not present 
when their own remuneration is discussed. The Committee also takes independent professional advice as required.
External advisers
New Bridge Street (NBS) acted as the independent remuneration adviser to the Committee during the year, having been 
appointed by the Committee in October 2014. NBS attends Committee meetings, as appropriate, and provides advice 
on remuneration for executives, analysis on all elements of the remuneration policy and regular market and best practice 
updates. NBS reports directly to the Committee Chairman and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Consultants of UK-listed companies (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). NBS provides 
no other services to the Company, and is therefore considered independent. NBS’s fees for the year were £7,000 
(2016: £72,000).

Incentive outcomes for 2017
Annual bonus in respect of 2017
In 2017, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive Directors was 125% to 150% of salary, solely linked to performance 
as measured by an Economic Value Added (EVA) calculation.
For the CEO and FD (150% maximum) and Group Talent and Communications Director (125% maximum), bonuses are 
calculated based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years 
after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions. As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three 
years in the comparator calculations, executives must consider the medium-term interests of the Group otherwise there 
is the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
EVA calculation:
Minus  
a charge  
on cost of 
acquisitions
Minus  
a charge on 
working 
capital
Plus / minus 
unrealised 
profit 
in inventory
Minus  
the resultant 
bonus itself 
(to make it 
self-financing)
Profit for  
each year
Equals  
the EVA for 
each year
In the case of a Sector CEO (125% maximum), a bonus is earned if the profit of the sector for which they are responsible 
exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years. The profits calculated for this purpose 
regard each sector as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost 
of acquisitions.
Bonuses for 2017 are based on the sectoral allocation that existed throughout 2017. Transitional provisions exist for 
restructuring to ensure Sector CEOs remain appropriately incentivised. Subsidiary executives participate in bonus 
arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
Further details of the bonuses payable (cash and deferred share awards) and performance against targets are provided 
in the tables below.

100 Performance Share Plan (PSP): 2014 Awards (vesting during the year to 31 March 2018)
In August 2014, the executive Directors received awards of performance shares under the PSP. The performance targets 
for the 2014 awards are illustrated below and the vesting criteria are 50% TSR-related and 50% ROTIC-related.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2013/14 and 2014/15

14.5% 33.3% 50.0% 83.3%
17.0% 50% 66.7% 100%
The three-year period over which these two independent performance metrics is measured ends on 1 August 2017. ROTIC 
is 15.7% (the average ROTIC for financial years 2015, 2016 and 2017) and TSR relative to the FTSE 250 excluding financial 
companies was 79th percentile through year end, which results in vesting of 91.58% of the maximum award. The vesting

Director salary and the higher permitted maximum; the second face value percentage represents the combined awards.
 
The percentages above are relative to base salaries. UK executive Directors had part of their award delivered by the 
Share Incentive Plan.
The three-year performance period over which ROTIC and EPS performance will be measured is April 2016 to March 2019. 
The ROTIC element will be based on the average ROTIC for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The EPS element will be based on EPS 
growth from April 2016 to March 2019. The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of 
grant (26 July 2019), subject to 50% on ROTIC performance and 50% on EPS performance.

The maximum annual bonus opportunity for 2018 will remain at 150% of salary for the Group CEO and FD and 125% 
of salary for other executive Directors with one third of the bonus earned being payable in shares which are deferred 
for two years.
Bonuses will continue to be based on EVA performance against a weighted average target of EVA for the past three 
years for an executive’s sector, in the case of a Sector CEO, or the Group, in the case of the Group CEO, FD and Group 
Talent and Communications Director.
Bonus payments will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions during a period of three years from the date 
of payment.
ESP
Under the ESP, performance share awards and deferred bonus awards will be made in June 2017. The number of shares 
over which awards will be made is determined by the share price leading up to the award.
The value of each performance share award, relative to salary has been fixed as follows:
Executive Director
Salary for 
2017/18
Performance 
share award
Value of 
award
Andrew Williams £625,000 200% £1,250,000

Adam Meyers $490,000 150% $735,000
Jennifer Ward £306,000 150% £459,000
The performance share awards to be granted in July 2017 will be subject to an earnings per share performance target for 
50% of the award and a ROTIC target for 50% of the award measured over the three financial years 2018, 2019 and 
2020. The performance targets are set out below:

Pay-for-performance
The eight-year graph below shows the Company’s TSR performance over the eight years to 1 April 2017 as compared 
to the FTSE 250 and the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment indices. Over the period indicated, the Company’s 
TSR was 781% compared to 379% for the FTSE 250 and 692% for the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment Index.
The FTSE 250 has been selected as a broad market comparator, and the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment 
index has been selected because the Company believes that the constituent companies of this index are the most 
appropriate for this comparison as they are affected by similar commercial and economic factors to Halma. The table

The SIP shares are held in an external trust and become the employee’s absolutely after three years. There are tax 
benefits for retaining the shares in the trust for at least five years. Adam Meyers does not participate in the SIP  
as he is not UK based.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the 
financial year.
Directors’ pensions
As noted below, two UK executive Directors are deferred members of the Halma Group Pension Plan (Plan). Their benefit 
is a funded final salary occupational pension from a plan registered with HMRC providing a maximum pension of two 
thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years’ service at normal pension age (60). Up to 5 April 2006, final 
pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving 
service. From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at £139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI 
(£155,528 for 2016/17).
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension 
supplement. The Plan also provides pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants’ pensions 
of one-half of the member’s prospective pension. Where an executive has a form of pension protection, life cover is 
provided by a separate trust.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the trustees of the Plan, 
are subject to actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price 
inflation (subject to a maximum of 5%) through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Two UK executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual 
entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan is limited by the pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006 or 
the Lifetime Allowance. The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan 
made in the Pension Act 2006.
The Company closed the DB section to future accrual with effect from 1 December 2014. The Company obtains external 
advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and provides educational seminars on the 
impact of pension legislation changes (annual and lifetime allowances) on individuals. Otherwise, executive Directors are 
responsible for obtaining advice specific to their circumstances.
Prior to drawing his pension, to the extent that a DB executive’s current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company 
compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess. In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease future service 
accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary. In April 2014, Andrew Williams chose to cease 
future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary. This change is, broadly, cost neutral.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director. Instead they 
represent a potential liability of the pension plan. The transfer values are Gilt-related and depend upon the relative 
standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates. The increase in transfer values in recent years is 
predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts. Other factors that have increased 
the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inflation and any real salary increases 
as well as the anticipated ageing of the member. These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in 
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Adam Meyers is a member of the US 401k money purchase scheme. Company contributions paid in the year were 
US$16,761 (£12,824) (2016: US$18,156 (£12,024)).

Activities
Halma plc is a holding company. A list of its subsidiary companies is set out on pages 187 to 193. Our businesses by sector 
and their activities are set out on pages 200 to 205.
Ordinary dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 8.38p per share and, if approved, this dividend will be paid on 16 August 2017 
to ordinary shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 July 2017. Together with the interim dividend of 
5.33p per share already paid, this will make a total of 13.71p (2016: 12.81p) per share for the financial year.
Share capital and capital structure
Details of the share capital, together with details of the movements in the share capital during the year, are shown in 
note 22 to the accounts. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no other classes of share capital. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer 
of shares, with both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. No person 
has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Rights and obligations of ordinary shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company and to appoint one 
or more proxies or, if the holder of shares is a corporation, one or more corporate representatives. On a show of hands, 
each holder of ordinary shares who (being an individual) is present in person or (being a corporation) is present by a duly 
appointed corporate representative, not themself being a member, shall have one vote, as shall proxies (unless they are 
appointed by more than one holder, in which case they may vote both for and against the resolution in accordance with 
the holders’ instructions). On a poll every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for 
every share of which they are the holder. Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must be 
received not later than 48 hours before the meeting. A holder of ordinary shares can lose the entitlement to vote at 
general meetings where that holder has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests held in those shares. Except as set out above and as permitted under applicable 
statutes, there are no limitations on voting rights of holders of a given percentage, number of votes or deadlines for 
exercising voting rights.
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust and the trustee has waived its right to all dividends.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal 
does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis or where the 
Company has a lien over that share. The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share unless 
the instrument of transfer is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered office of the Company or any 
other place as the Board may decide accompanied by the certificate for the share(s) to be transferred and/or such other 
evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) in respect 
of only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who is not a minor, infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; 
or (iv) in favour of not more than four persons jointly.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer 
of an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation of CREST.
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company except certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example insider trading laws); or where a shareholder with 
at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated shares has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
on voting rights.
Treasury shares
Shares held in treasury do not have voting rights and are not eligible for dividends.
Governance Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
108 Employee share plans
Details of employee share plans are set out in note 23 to the accounts.
The Company introduced a new Executive Share Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and reflects 
current legislation, best practice and corporate governance requirements including recovery and withholding provisions. 
In addition, the new Plan includes flexibility to grant performance-related share awards, other share awards and 
deferred bonus awards.
The Plan will be used primarily to grant performance-related awards and deferred bonus awards to executive Directors 
and selected senior employees. The Remuneration Committee believes that the ability to continue to grant long term 
share-based incentives as part of a balanced remuneration package will create a strong alignment of long term interest 
between senior management and shareholders.
Initial performance awards were made to executive Directors and selected senior management in July 2015, following 
shareholder approval of the Plan. The first grants of the merit deferred bonus awards were made in July 2016, shortly 
after the payment of the cash element of the bonus.
Dilution limits
The Company operates three share plans: the 2005 Performance Share Plan, under which no further awards can be 
made; the 2015 Executive Share Plan, under which all new discretionary awards are made; and the Company’s Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP), a tax approved share plan for UK employees. 
Overall dilution through the issuance of new shares for employee share schemes (including treasury shares) may not 
exceed an amount equivalent to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over a 10-year period and for discretionary 
share awards to senior management, 5% over a 10-year period. Over the last 10 years, the Company has granted 
discretionary awards over 3.3% of the Company’s issued share capital and a further 0.5% in respect of the SIP. All 
awards under these three plans have been settled by treasury shares or market-purchased shares held via a trust.
Appointment and replacement of directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. Directors can be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution at a general meeting or by the Board. If a Director is appointed by the Board, such 
Director will hold office until the next annual general meeting and shall then be eligible for election at that meeting. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code each of the Directors, being eligible, will offer themselves for 
election or re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting. The Company can remove a Director from office, including 
by passing a special resolution or by notice being given by all the other Directors. The Articles themselves may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
Power of Directors
The powers of Directors are described in the Matters Reserved for the Board, copies of which are available on request 
from the Company Secretary, and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report on page 76.
Essential contracts and change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, 
principally bank loan agreements, private placement debt and employee share plans.
There are two significant agreements, in terms of the likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, containing 
such provisions:
 — the £550m syndicated revolving credit facility which, if within 10 days of a change of control notice to the Loan agent, 
can result in 30 days’ notice being given to the Company by any Lender, for all amounts outstanding to that Lender, to 
be immediately due and payable, at which time the commitment of that Lender will be cancelled. If all of the Lenders 
give this notice the whole facility would be cancelled; and 
 — the US$250m US Private Placement Note Purchase Agreement under which, in the event of a change of control, 
the Company is required to make an offer to the holders of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal 
amount of the notes together with interest accrued.
The Group has contractual arrangements with a wide range of suppliers. The Group is not unduly dependent upon 
contractual arrangements with any particular customer. Whilst the loss or disruption to certain of these arrangements 
could temporarily affect the Group’s business, none is considered to be essential.
The Company’s share plans contain provisions as a result of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control of the Company in accordance with the rules of the plans.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

109 Other Statutory Information  
continued
Allotment authority
Under the Companies Act 2006 the Directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. At the Annual 
General Meeting an ordinary resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue 
new shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £12,500,000 (up to 125,000,000 new ordinary shares of 10p each), 
being just less than one third of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 12 June 2017 
(the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting).
In accordance with the Directors’ stated intention to seek annual renewal, the authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the annual general meeting of the Company in 2018. Passing this resolution will give the Directors flexibility to act 
in the best interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, by issuing new shares.
As at 12 June 2017 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting), the Company had 
379,645,332 ordinary shares of 10p each in issue of which 462,188 were held as treasury shares, which is equal 
to approximately 0.12% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at that date.
The Companies Act 2006 also requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it 
must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. At the Annual General Meeting a 
special resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to issue a limited number of shares for 
cash and/or sell treasury shares without offering them to shareholders first. The authority is for an aggregate nominal 
amount of up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share capital of the Company as at 12 June 2017 (the 
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting) of £3,780,000. The resolution will also modify 
statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may arise on a rights issue or 
other pre-emptive offer or issue. The authority will expire at the same time as the resolution conferring authority on 
the Directors to allot shares. The Directors consider this authority necessary in order to give them flexibility to deal with 
opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the resolution. There are no present plans to issue 
shares, other than the release of treasury shares under share plans previously approved in general meeting.
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
The Company was authorised at the 2016 annual general meeting to purchase up to 37,800,000 of its own 10p ordinary 
shares in the market. This authority expires at the end of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the 
Directors’ stated intention to seek annual renewal, a special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to 
renew this authority until the end of next year’s annual general meeting, in respect of up to 37,900,000 ordinary shares, 
which is approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 12 June 2017 (the 
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting).
The Directors consider it desirable that the possibility of making such purchases, under appropriate circumstances, 
is available. The authority, if granted, will only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous to do so. The 
Directors will only make purchases under the authority where they believe that to do so would result in an increase in 
earnings per share for the remaining shareholders, or where the purchased shares are used to satisfy awards made 
under employee share plans, and such purchases are considered to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Their present intention is that the shares purchased under the authority will be held in treasury for future cancellation, 
sale for cash or transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employee share plan, although in the light of 
circumstances at the time it may be decided to cancel them immediately on repurchase. The effect of any 
cancellation would be to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most purposes, while held in treasury, shares 
are treated as if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank for dividends).
Following approval of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) at the 2005 annual general meeting, the Directors made 
routine purchases of Halma shares in the market for holding in treasury until required for vesting under the PSP. In the 
year to 1 April 2017, no shares were purchased in the market for treasury. Under the Executive Share Plan approved 
at the 2015 annual general meeting, shares vesting may be satisfied with market purchased shares held in trust or 
in treasury or with new issue shares. Otherwise, the Directors have no present intention of using this authority.
In reaching a decision to purchase shares, the Directors will take into account the Company’s cash resources, capital 
requirements and the effect of any purchase on the Company’s earnings per share. It is anticipated that renewal of 
the authority will be requested at subsequent annual general meetings.

112 Directors’ Responsibilities 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 — properly select and apply accounting policies;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 — make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 — the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 — the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks
The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
 — Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles with a focus on discount factors and growth rates utilised in 
management’s assessment of impairment of goodwill, specifically in relation to the Sensor Technologies cash 
generating unit (CGU) and significant acquired intangibles with a potential impairment trigger;
 — Acquisition accounting for material acquisitions (in the current year this is focused on the provision for deferred 
contingent consideration on the FluxData acquisition); and
 — Discount and inflation rate assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
No new key risk areas have been identified in the current year.
Materiality
The materiality that we used in the current year was £7.5 million which was determined on the basis of 5% of statutory 
profit before taxation.
Scoping
We focused our Group audit primarily on the full scope and specified procedures audits at 60 locations. These locations 
accounted for 68% of the Group’s revenue and 76% of the Group’s profit before taxation.
Significant changes in our approach
There have been no significant changes in our approach.
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis of accounting contained within the Accounting Policies note to the financial statements and the directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the governance section on page 82.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 — the directors’ confirmation on page 82 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 — the disclosures on pages 21-27 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 — the directors’ statement in the Accounting Policies note to the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
114  — the directors’ explanation on page 82 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such 
material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not  
a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we 
are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk description
How the scope of our audit  
responded to the risk Key observations
Impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
At 1 April 2017, the net book value of goodwill 
was £604m (2016: £542m) and net book 
value of acquired intangible assets was 
£200m (2016: £208m).
On an annual basis, management are 
required to perform an impairment 
assessment for goodwill, and to assess 
for indicators of impairment in respect 
of other intangible assets.
Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets is a key risk 
due to the quantum of the balance and 
the judgements involved in setting the 
key assumptions and assertions used by 
management to support their assessment 
of the carrying value. In testing the carrying 
value for impairment, management has 
made a number of key assumptions including 
short-term and long-term growth rates and 
discount rates.
Our risk in the current period has been 
focused specifically on the goodwill 
associated with the Sensor Technologies 
cash generating unit and the acquired 
intangible assets arising in CenTrak, Firetrace 
and Visiometrics due to there being slower 
than expected growth in these businesses.
The associated disclosure is included in note 
11. The Audit Committee has included their 
assessment of this risk on page 86 and it is 
included in the key accounting estimates 
and judgements on page 130.
We challenged the reasonableness of 
the short term forecast growth rates 
with reference to the budgets approved 
by the Board, evidence of secured 
contracts, historical performance 
and post period trading data.
We assessed the long term growth 
rates by reference to market specific 
GDP growth rates based on third 
party sources.
We performed a specific review and 
challenge, involving Deloitte’s valuation 
specialists, of the discount rates applied 
to the forecast cash flows. We assessed 
the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital and specific risk premiums using 
external input data and benchmarking 
the discount rates against published 
peer group rates.
We recalculated management’s 
sensitivity analysis on key assumptions 
and replaced key assumptions with 
alternative scenarios, for example 
applying further changes to discount 
rates and forecast growth rates.
We reviewed the disclosures made 
in the financial statements and 
assessed compliance with IAS 36.
From our work performed, we are 
satisfied with the carrying value 
of the goodwill attributable to 
the Sensor Technologies CGU, 
and the acquired intangible 
assets associated with CenTrak, 
Firetrace and Visiometrics. 
We are also satisfied with 
the related disclosures in 
the financial statements.

Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
115 Independent Auditor’s Report continued
Risk description
How the scope of our audit  
responded to the risk Key observations
Acquisition accounting
There was one acquisition completed 
during the period. FluxData Incorporated 
(“FluxData”) was acquired in January 2017 
for an initial consideration of £10.0m.
There is a risk that acquisitions are not 
accounted for correctly in line with IFRS 3 
‘Business combinations’ where material 
judgements exist.
We focused this risk to the judgement 
associated with the estimate of deferred 
contingent consideration, which pays up  
to a maximum of $15.5m (£12.8m). This is 
dependent on management’s estimate of  
the performance of FluxData through the 
earn-out period which runs to 30 March 2019, 
and management has recorded a provision  
of £9.4m on acquisition in respect of this.
Details of the acquisitions are disclosed in note 
24 to the accounts. The Audit Committee has 
included their assessment of this risk on page 
86 and it is included in the key accounting 
estimates and judgements on page 130.
We challenged management’s 
judgement over the fair value of the 
deferred contingent consideration by 
obtaining management’s calculation, 
understanding the forecast growth 
drivers, and assessing the assumptions 
made including sales to date for key 
customers, performance post 
acquisition, and evidence of future sales.
We further challenged management’s 
judgement through sensitivity over the 
key growth assumptions to determine 
alternative scenarios, and therefore a 
range of possible outcomes.
From our work performed, we 
deem management’s estimate 
of deferred contingent 
consideration to be at the 
optimistic end of a range of 
possible outcomes, and 
therefore the provision of £9.4m 
recorded on the balance sheet 
could be considered prudent 
but is not materially misstated.
Defined benefit pension scheme assumptions
At 1 April 2017 the net retirement benefit 
liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet related to the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes was £75m (2016: £52m).
There is a risk relating to the application by 
management of the key assumptions that 
impact the valuation of the defined benefit 
pension scheme liability, specifically the 
discount rate and inflation rate assumptions. 
These variables can have a material impact 
on calculating the quantum of the retirement 
benefit liability.
Management utilise the services of third 
party actuarial advisers to determine their 
key assumptions. 
Details of the defined benefit pension 
scheme are disclosed in note 28 to the 
accounts. The Audit Committee has 
included their assessment of this risk on page 
86 and it is included in the key accounting 
estimates and judgements on page 130. 
We used our internal actuarial experts 
to assess the assumptions applied in 
accounting for the defined benefit 
pension liability and determined 
whether the key assumptions are 
reasonable. This included reviewing 
available yield curves and inflation 
data to recalculate a reasonable 
range for the key assumptions. 
We challenged management to 
understand the sensitivity of changes 
in assumptions and quantify a range 
of reasonable rates that could be used 
in their calculation. We discussed the 
output of sensitivity analysis with 
management and their third party 
actuarial advisers. Additionally we 
benchmarked key assumptions against 
other listed companies to check for any 
outliers in the data used. 
We also considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the deficit to 
changes in these key assumptions.
From the work performed, we are 
satisfied that the significant 
assumptions applied in respect of 
the valuation of the scheme 
liabilities are appropriate and 
lie in the middle of the range 
of reasonable assumptions. 
We are also satisfied with 
the related disclosures in 
the financial statements.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
116 Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality
£7.5m (2016: £7.3m)
Basis for determining materiality
5% (2016: 5%) of statutory profit before taxation.
Rationale for the benchmark applied
Consistent with the prior period, profit before taxation was used as the benchmark for materiality, as we consider it to 
be one of the main measures used by management to monitor the performance of the business.
PBT £157.7m
Group materiality £7.5m
Maximum component materiality £1.8m
Audit Committee reporting threshold £0.375m
PBT
Group Materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
£375,000 (2016: £365,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at 60 out of 100 trading entities (2016: 53 out of 98). The increase in the total trading 
entities in the period was a result of the FluxData acquisition and the internal reorganisation at Avire. 58 (2016: 51) of these 
were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 2 (2016: 2) were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent 
of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s 
operations at those locations. The full scope and specified audit procedures entities represent the principal business units 
and account for 68% (2016: 68%) of the Group’s revenue and 76% (2016: 77%) of the Group’s profit before tax. They were 
also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work on the 58 entities was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £17,000 to £1,760,000 (2016: £15,000 to £1,972,000).
The Group audit team have established a programme of planned component visits based on their risk assessment.  
As a minimum, each year a senior member of the Group audit team will visit the significant components (defined as 
contributing greater than 10% of Group profit or revenue, of which only Apollo UK met these criteria in the period), 
in addition to visiting the US component auditor and selected US components. Furthermore all 28 UK components 
are directly overseen by the Group engagement partner or Group director. In years when we do not visit a component 
that is in scope, we will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review 
documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. These procedures also included, at a 
minimum, obtaining the bank reconciliations and statements for all entities above a £375,000 threshold. For a selection 
of relevant entities, based on a risk threshold criteria, we also performed revenue cut off, subsequent cash receipt and 
inventory provision tests necessary to conclude on these balances.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 — the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
118 Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity 
Own shares are ordinary shares in Halma plc purchased by the Company and held to fulfil the Company’s obligations 
under the Group’s share plans. At 1 April 2017 the number of treasury shares held was 462,188 (2016: 940,421) and the 
number of shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust was 512,417 (2016: 311,444). The market value of Own shares was 
£9,980,000 (2016: £11,417,000).  
The Translation reserve is used to record the difference arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of 
foreign operations. The Hedging reserve is used to record the portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash 
flow hedging instruments that are deemed to be an effective hedge. 
The Capital redemption reserve was created on repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares. The Other 
reserves represent the provision for the value of the Group’s equity-settled share plans.

Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have 
also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these accounts. 
The principal Group accounting policies are explained below and have been applied consistently throughout the years 
ended 1 April 2017 and 2 April 2016 other than those noted below. 
The Group accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as described below under the heading 
‘Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting’. 
New Standards and Interpretations not yet applied 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are 
potentially relevant to the Group, and which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but  
not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement’ – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.  
− IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018.  
− IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
− Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017. 
− Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. 
− Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
− Annual Improvements 2014-2016 Cycle – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
− IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers’, and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’,  
For the Group, transition to IFRS 9 will take effect from 1 April 2018. The half year results for FY18/19 will be IFRS 9 
compliant with the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 9 being the 31 March 2019 report.  
IFRS 9 provides a new model expected losses impairment model and includes amendments to classification and 
measurement of financial instruments.  
The Group does not expect that the adoption of IFRS 9 will have a material impact on the financial statements but it will 
impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
For the Group, transition to IFRS 15 will take effect from 1 April 2018. The half year results for FY18/19 will be IFRS 15 
compliant with the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 15 being the 31 March 2019 report. The Group plans 
to adopt a fully retrospective transition approach and so comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2018 will be restated. 
IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue from contracts with customers. The standard requires entities 
to apportion revenue earned from contracts to individual promises, or performance obligations, on a stand-alone selling 
price basis, based on a five-step model.  
The Group is still in the process of quantifying the full impact of this standard; however, having carried out an impact 
assessment, we expect the following parts of the standard could result in changes to the timing or quantum of revenue 
recognition. 
 
 
Accounting Policies
Financial Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
126  
107 
− Certain companies across the Group provide a product which involves an element of customisation and for which they 
have an enforceable right to payment for work performed to date. Currently under IAS 18 the revenue recognition for such 
product is at a point in time on transfer of the risk and reward of the transaction to the customer. IFRS 15 requires that  
for such transactions revenue is recognised over time and as such the adoption of IFRS 15 may result in the revenue for  
the contracts being brought forward to the extent that control has passed to the customer at the balance sheet date.  
− The contract duration across the Group varies between companies and the extent to which the pattern of revenue 
recognition is changed will increase with the length of the contract. The quantum of any such change will depend on  
the number of open contracts and the stage of completion at any one balance sheet date.   
− A number of companies offer extended warranties that offer service type assurance. Under IFRS 15 revenue is 
apportioned to the provision of the warranty and recognised over the period of the warranty resulting in what is  
known as a contract liability.  
− There are examples across the Group of variable contract consideration including sales returns, rebates, discounts  
and other types where the accounting treatment may differ from that under the current standard.  
− Sales commissions and other third party sales acquisition costs resulting directly from securing contracts with 
customers are currently expensed when incurred. IFRS 15 will require these costs of acquiring contracts to be  
recognised as an asset when incurred to be recognised over the associated contract period. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’  
For the Group, transition to IFRS 16 will take effect from 1 April 2019. The half year results for FY19/20 will be IFRS 16 
compliant with the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 16 being for the year ending 31 March 2020.  
IFRS 16 provides a single model for lessees which recognises a right of use asset and lease liability for all leases which are 
longer than one year or which are not classified as low value. The distinction between finance and operating leases for 
lessees is removed.  
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard. The most significant impact currently identified will be 
that the Group’s land and buildings leases will be brought on to the balance sheet. Further assessment of other leases is 
currently ongoing. The Group’s future lease commitments for land and buildings at the balance sheet date, which provides 
an indicator of the value to be brought on to the balance sheet, is £45m. 
New Standards and Interpretations applied for the first time 
The following Standards with an effective date of 1 January 2016 have been adopted without any significant impact on  
the amounts reported in these financial statements: 
− IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amended) ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’. 
− Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle, specifically amendments to IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’. 
− Amendments to IAS 1. 
− Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements’. 
− Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’. 
Use of non-GAAP measures 
In the reporting of the financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS, the 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’) under which the Group reports. The Directors believe that Return on 
Total Invested Capital (ROTIC), Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), Organic growth at constant currency, adjusted profit 
measures and earnings per share and Adjusted operating cash flow provide additional and more relevant information  
on underlying trends to shareholders. These and other non-GAAP measures are used by the Directors for internal 
performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees. The terms ROTIC, ROCE, organic growth 
at constant currency and ‘Adjusted’ are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly 
titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.  
Definitions of the Group’s non-GAAP measures along with reconciliation to their IFRS equivalent measure are included  
in note 3.  
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items, which are presented as adjusting items within their relevant 
income statement category, helps provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. The principal 
items which are included in adjusting items are set out below in the Group’s accounting policy and in note 1.  
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding adjusting items as 
defined on page 132.

Key accounting policies 
Below we set out our key accounting policies, with a list of all other accounting policies thereafter. 
Going concern 
The Directors believe, at the time of approving the financial statements, that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current committed facilities, which 
includes a £550m five-year Revolving Credit Facility completed on 4 November 2016 of which £469m remains undrawn  
at the date of this report. With this in mind, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 82. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
− the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
− the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus 
− the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
− the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as 
incurred. Any contingent consideration payable may be accounted for as either: 
a) Consideration transferred, which is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent purchase 
consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement; or 
b) Remuneration, which is expensed in the Income Statement over the associated period of service. An indicator of such 
treatment includes when payments to employees of the acquired company are contingent on a post-acquisition event, 
but may be automatically forfeited on termination of employment.  
For acquisitions between 4 April 2004 (the date from which the financial statements were reported under IFRS) and  
2 April 2010, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the  
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. 
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill therefore includes non-identified  
intangible assets including business processes, buyer-specific synergies, know-how and workforce-related industry-specific 
knowledge and technical skills. Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. On closure or disposal of an acquired business, goodwill would be taken into account in determining the 
profit or loss on closure or disposal. 
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to acquisitions prior to 4 April 2004 
in its consolidated accounts. As a result, the net book value of goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under UK GAAP 
at 3 April 2004 was brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS at 4 April 2004 subject to 
impairment testing on that date; and goodwill that was written off to reserves prior to 28 March 1998 under UK GAAP  
will not be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure of previously acquired businesses  
from 4 April 2004 onwards.

Intangible assets  
(a) Acquired intangible assets 
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from 
the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its 
fair value can be measured reliably. Acquired intangible assets, comprising trademarks, technology and know-how and 
customer relationships, are amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated economic lives of between three and fifteen years. 
(b) Product development costs 
Research expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development  
of a new or substantially improved product, is incurred after the technical feasibility and economic viability of the product 
has been proven and the decision to complete the development has been taken, and can be measured reliably. Such 
expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and is amortised through  
the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of three years. 
Pensions 
The Group makes contributions to various pension plans. 
For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is the difference between the 
fair value of the plan’s assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation  
is calculated separately for each plan on an annual basis by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are taken to other comprehensive incom e. 
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement. The net interest expense on pension plans’ liabilities and the expected return on the plans’ assets is 
recognised within finance expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement when they fall due.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of Group accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
The following four areas of key estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgement have been identified as having 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year:
Critical accounting judgements 
Goodwill impairment 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units (CGUs)  
to which goodwill has been allocated. In turn, the value in use calculation involves an estimation of the present value of 
future cash flows of CGUs. The future cash flows are based on annual budgets, as approved by the Board, to which the 
management’s expectation of market-share and long-term growth rates are applied. The present value is then calculated 
based on management’s judgement of future discount rates. The Board reviews these key assumptions (market-share, 
long-term growth rates, and discount rates) and the sensitivity analysis around these assumptions. Further details are 
provided in note 11.  
Intangible assets 
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and 
included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification and valuation of other separable intangible  
assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements.  
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ requires that development costs, arising from the application of research findings or other 
technical knowledge to a plan or design of a new or substantially improved product, are capitalised, subject to certain 
criteria being met. Determining the technical feasibility and estimating the future cash flows generated by the products  
in development requires judgements which may differ from the actual outcome. 
The estimates and judgements made in relation to both acquired intangible assets and capitalised development costs, 
cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Contingent consideration 
Determining the value of contingent consideration recognised as part of the acquisition of subsidiaries requires 
assumptions to determine the expected performance of the acquired business and the amount of contingent consideration 
that will therefore become payable. Initial estimates of expected performance are made by the Directors responsible for 
completing the acquisition and form a key component of the financial due diligence that takes place prior to completion. 
Subsequent measurement of contingent consideration is based on the Directors’ appraisal of the acquired business’ 
performance in the post-acquisition period with any required adjustments to the amount payable recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as required under IFRS 3. Further details are provided in note 24. 
Defined benefit pension plan liabilities 
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to 
calculate present values. These include future mortality, discount rate and inflation. Management makes these judgements 
in consultation with an independent actuary. Details of the judgements made in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
are disclosed in note 28.

Other accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts include the accounts of Halma plc and all of its subsidiary companies made up to 1 April 2017, adjusted 
to eliminate intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or 
discontinued are included from the month of their acquisition or to the month of their discontinuation.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint 
control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but without control or joint control  
over those policies. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost as adjusted by post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent 
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate 
at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s 
share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on 
acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the year of acquisition.  
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which 
case appropriate provision is made for impairment.  
Other intangible assets 
(a) Computer software 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an 
intangible asset, and is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over its  
estimated economic life of between three and five years. 
(b) Other intangibles 
Other intangibles are amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
economic lives of between three and five years. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may 
be impaired. Additionally, goodwill and capitalised development expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in full 
production are subject to an annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent that an asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use.  
An asset’s value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or  
from the cash generating unit to which it relates. The present value is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the 
current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset concerned. 
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount of the 
asset does not exceed its carrying amount had no impairment loss been recognised in previous periods. Impairment losses 
in respect of goodwill are not reversed.

Segmental reporting 
An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in business activities from which  
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (the Chief Executive) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
Reportable segments are operating segments that either meet the thresholds and conditions set out in IFRS 8 or are 
considered by the Board to be appropriately designated as reportable segments. Segment result represents operating 
profits and includes an allocation of Head Office expenses. Segment result excludes tax and financing items. Segment 
assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment (excluding land and buildings), 
inventories, trade and other receivables. Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables, provisions and other 
payables. Unallocated items represent land and buildings, corporate and deferred taxation balances, defined benefit plan 
liabilities, contingent purchase consideration, all components of net cash/borrowings and derivative financial instruments. 
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated either on a 
‘first in, first out’ or an average cost basis and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of production and 
other overheads considered by the Directors to be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and condition 
at the year end. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and costs 
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Revenue 
Revenue represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies to external customers excluding value added tax and other 
sales related taxes. Transactions are recorded as revenue when the delivery of products or performance of services takes 
place in accordance with the contracted terms of sale.  
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised while the contracts are in progress. Revenue is recognised proportionally  
to the stage of completion of the contract, based on the fair value of goods and services provided to date, taking into 
account the sign-off of milestone delivery by customers. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Adjusting items 
When items of income or expense are material and they are relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial 
performance, they are disclosed separately within the financial statements. Such adjusting items include material costs or 
reversals arising from acquisitions or disposals of businesses, including acquisition costs, material creation or reversals of 
provisions related to changes in estimates for contingent consideration on acquisition, amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, and other one-off items that may arise. 
Taxation 
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the  
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in Shareholders’ funds, in which case it too is recognised in Shareholders’ 
funds. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method, apart from the following differences which are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates and laws, which are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that recovery is probable.

Foreign currencies 
The Group presents its accounts in Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at  
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is 
included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Net assets of overseas subsidiary companies are expressed in Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the 
financial year, and trading results and cash flows at the average rates of exchange for the financial year. Goodwill arising  
on the acquisition of a foreign business is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and is translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the end of the financial year. Exchange gains or loss es arising on these translations are taken to the Translation 
reserve within Shareholders’ funds. 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure will be determined 
after taking into account the cumulative translation difference held within the Translation reserve attributable to that 
subsidiary. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to deem the Translation to be £nil at 4 April 2004. Accordingly, 
the profit or loss on disposal or closure of foreign subsidiaries will not include any currency translation differences which 
arose before 4 April 2004. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk using forward 
exchange contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 26. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit and loss (held for trading) unless they are in a 
designated hedge relationship. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing  
of the recognition in the Consolidated Income Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group 
designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of  
firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.  
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value  
is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within  
12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Cash flow hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.  
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and  
the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument 
has been or is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.  
Note 26 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes and the movements in 
the Hedging reserve in equity. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion as a result of being over 
hedged is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income  
Statement. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial  
asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity  
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires  
or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised, when the forecast transaction is  
ultimately recognised, in the Consolidated Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected  
to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Net investment hedge accounting 
The Group uses foreign currency denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s  
net investment in overseas companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging, the variability in the net assets  
of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates and the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in  
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the Translation reserve. The ineffective part  
of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Employee share plans 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s share incentive plan, the performance share plan and 
the executive share plan. 
(a) Share incentive plan 
Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to qualifying employees depending on salary and service  
criteria. The shares awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the plan’s trustees at the time of the award, 
and are then held in trust for a minimum of three years. The costs of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the three-year vesting period of the awards.
(b) Performance share plan 
Awards under this plan are partly equity-settled and partly cash-settled. Grants were subject to both market-based and  
non-market-based vesting criteria. No further grants will be made under this plan. 
The fair value of the equity-settled portion at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method 
to reflect the likelihood of market-based performance conditions being met. The fair value is charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made 
during this period to reflect expected and actual forfeitures arising from the non-market-based performance conditions 
only. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
(c) Executive share plan 
During the year ended 2 April 2016, Halma plc introduced the Executive Share Plan, in which executive Directors and certain 
senior employees participate. Grants under this Plan are in the form of Performance Awards or Deferred Share Awards. 
Performance Awards are subject to non-market-based vesting criteria, and Deferred Share Awards are subject only to 
continuing service of the employee. Share awards are equity-settled. The fair value of the awards at the date of grant, 
which is estimated to be equal to the market value, is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected and actual 
forfeitures. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
(d) Cash settled 
For cash-settled awards, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value 
determined at each balance sheet date. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.  
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation  
at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision  
is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of  
the cash flows.  
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party,  
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.

Deferred government grant income 
Government grant income that is linked to capital expenditure is deferred to the Consolidated Balance Sheet and  
credited to the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the related asset. In addition, the Group claims research 
and development expenditure credits arising on qualifying expenditure in its UK-based subsidiaries and shows these ‘above  
the line’ in Operating profit. Where the credits arise on expenditure that is capitalised as part of internally generated 
capitalised development costs, the income is deferred to the Consolidated Balance Sheet and credited to the Consolidated 
Income Statement over the life of the related asset in line with the policy stated above. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, profit or loss on 
disposal of operations, finance income and finance costs. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand.  
Dividends 
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the distribution is 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with  
the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on a straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated 
economic life. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: 
Leases 
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases,  
of which the Group has none. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. 
 
Freehold property 2% 
Leasehold properties:  
Long leases (more than 50 years unexpired) 2% 
Short leases (less than 50 years unexpired) Period of lease

1 Segmental analysis 
Sector analysis 
The Group has four reportable segments (Process Safety, Infrastructure Safety, Medical, and Environmental & Analysis),  
which are defined by markets rather than product type. Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and 
marketing characteristics. These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive.  
Segment revenue and results 
Inter-segmental sales are charged at prevailing market prices and have not been disclosed separately by segment as  
they are not considered material. Revenue derived from the rendering of services was £39,011,000 (2016: £25,134,000).  
All revenue was otherwise derived from the sale of products. 
* Adjustments include the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; restructuring costs; and profit or loss on disposal of operations.

1 Segmental analysis continued 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. Acquisition 
transaction costs, adjustments to contingent consideration and release of fair value adjustments to inventory (collectively 
‘acquisition items’) are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Segment profit, before these acquisition items 
and the other adjustments, is disclosed separately above as this is the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the 
purpose of allocation of resources and assessment of segment performance. These adjustments are analysed as follows:  
Included within amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets in the Medical sector is £12,429,000 
impairment to a customer relationship asset of Visiometrics S.L. (Visiometrics), acquired in the prior year. Related to this 
impairment, included within the Medical sector, there is a credit arising from a revision to the estimate of the associated 
deferred contingent consideration payable for Visiometrics of £10,087,000 (€12,002,000). The majority of this revision 
relates to deferred contingent consideration payable on sales to the related customer. See also note 12 and 19. 
The transaction costs arose mainly on the acquisition of FluxData, Inc. (FluxData) on 6 January 2017.  
The £10,701,000 credit to contingent consideration comprises mainly the revision to estimate of the payable for Visiometrics 
discussed above. The remaining credit relates to the change in estimate to the payable for Value Added Solutions LLC (VAS)  
by £356,000 from £704,000 (US$1,000,000) to £427,000 (US$535,000), and for ASL Holdings Limited (ASL) by £14,000 on 
final settlement of the payable, and a credit of £244,000 arising from exchange differences on the Visiometrics payable which is 
denominated in Euros.  
The £831,000 charge relates to the release of the fair value adjustment on revaluing the inventories of CenTrak Inc. 
(CenTrak) (£790,000) and FluxData (£41,000) on acquisition. All amounts have now been released in relation to CenTrak. 
The £1,910,000 charge relates to inventory and fixed asset write downs and severance costs arising on the restructuring  
of non-core operations in one of the Group’s subsidiaries, Pixelteq, Inc. (Pixelteq).

1 Segmental analysis continued 
The transaction costs arose mainly on the acquisitions of VAS, Firetrace USA, LLC (Firetrace), Visiometrics, and CenTrak. 
The £827,000 charge in the Infrastructure Safety sector related to a revision in the estimate of the remaining contingent 
consideration payable on Advanced Electronics Limited (Advanced). The £826,000 charge in the Medical sector related to 
exchange differences arising on the revaluation of Visiometric’s contingent consideration which is denominated in Euros. 
The remaining £111,000 credit to contingent consideration related to a revision in the estimate of the remaining payable 
on a prior year acquisition (ASL) from £197,000 to £86,000.  
The release of fair value adjustments to inventory arose from revaluing the inventories of Firetrace and CenTrak at acquisition .  
The £590,000 profit on disposal in the Medical sector relates to the disposal of 8.8% of the Group’s ownership interest in 
Optomed Oy (Optomed).

2 Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,685,730 shares in issue 
during the year (net of shares purchased by the Company and held as Own shares) (2016: 378,412,359). There are no 
dilutive or potentially dilutive ordinary shares. 
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation and impairment  
of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; restructuring costs; profit or loss on disposal of operations; and the 
associated taxation thereon. The Directors consider that adjusted earnings, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, 
represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance. A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic  
and diluted earnings per share figures is as follows:  
3 Non-GAAP measures  
The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group. These measures 
include Return on Total Invested Capital, Return on Capital Employed, Organic growth at constant currency, Adjusted 
operating profit and Adjusted operating cash flow.

Return on Capital Employed 
1
 The ROTIC and ROCE measures are expressed as a percentage of the average of the current period’s and prior year’s Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed 
respectively. Using an average as the denominator is considered to be more representative. The March 2015 Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed balances were 
£776,160,000 and £219,148,000 respectively. 
2
 Adjustments include the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; restructuring costs; and profit or loss on disposal of operations. 
3
 Includes goodwill amortised prior to 3 April 2004 and goodwill taken to reserves. 
* Comparatives have been restated as described in note 24.  
Organic growth  
Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations. This measure equalises the 
effect of acquisitions by: 
i. removing from the year of acquisition their entire revenue and profit before taxation, and 
ii. in the following year, removing the revenue and profit for the nu mber of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in 
the prior year. 
The resultant effect is that the acquisitions are removed from organic results for one full year of ownership.  
The results of disposals are removed from the prior period reported revenue and profit before taxation. The effects of 
currency changes are removed through restating the current year revenue and profit before taxation at the prior year 
exchange rates.  
Organic growth at constant currency has been calculated for the Group as follows:

9 Taxation 
 
*  Adjustments include the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items; restructuring costs; and profit or loss on disposal of operations. 
The Group’s future Effective Tax Rate (ETR) will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there  
are any changes to tax legislation in the Group’s most significant countries of operations.  Phased reductions in the UK 
corporation tax rate to 19% (from 1 April 2017) and 17% (from 1 April 2020) have been substantively enacted which we 
would expect to impact the ETR in due course.  In the US, proposed tax reform measures include a reduction in the US 
corporate income tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%.  The US rate change is a proposal only at this stage and the Group 
is actively monitoring developments to evaluate its potential impact. No reliable estimate of the impact of these tax 
reform proposals can be made at this time. The Group does not expect the future rate to be materially impacted by the 
changes to the international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures developed under the OECD Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting project and the investigations and proposals of the European Commission.

11 Goodwill  
The Group identifies cash generating units (CGUs) at the operating company level as this represents the lowest level  
at which cash inflows are largely independent of other cash inflows. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups as follows: 
* Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period 
acquisitions. See note 24. 
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the ‘value in use’ in perpetuity of the  
relevant CGU group. The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget 
approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value. 
Further details are overleaf.

Key assumptions used in ‘value in use’ calculations 
The calculation of ‘value in use’ is most sensitive to the following assumptions: 
− CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2018; 
− Discount rates; and 
− Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period. 
CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2018 and relate  
to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.  
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying 
operating companies within each CGU group. A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2018 budget to derive  
the cash flows arising in the years to March 2019 and March 2020. A long-term rate is applied to these values for the year 
to March 2021 and onwards. 
Short-term growth rates for years 2019 and 2020 for all CGU groups, with the exception of Sensor Technologies, are 
based on sector strategic plans. Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the 
markets that the Group sells into. 
Short-term growth rates for Sensor Technologies are applied out to 2022, based on CGU specific revenue growth rates 
and margins which reflect the acquisition case updated for latest expectations of performance. These CGU specific 
growth rates reflect the rapid growth potential of this early stage life-cycle, technology-based business through further 
penetration into the USA, internationally and, in the longer term, through new applications in other sectors. Long-term 
growth rates thereafter are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.  
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma 
would make, using the Group’s economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately. The Directors do not 
currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 9.04% (2016: 10.79%). The base discount rate, 
which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). 
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each 
CGU group. This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 8.75% to 12.50% (2016: 9.86% to 
14.00%) across the CGU groups. 
CGU groups to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant. The assumptions 
used to determine ‘value in use’ for these CGU groups are: 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions  
In Sensor Technologies, if future growth was not as currently forecast this could result in the value in use of goodwill  
falling below its carrying value. For this to happen, forecast revenue growth to 2022 would have to fall to 6% and to 2% 
thereafter. For all other CGU groups, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key 
assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The above is stated net of provision for slow-moving and obsolete stock, movements of which are shown below:  
* Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period 
acquisitions. See note 24. 
During the year, as described in note 29, inventory with a carrying value of £1,300,000 was written down and subsequently 
disposed of as part of the restructuring of non-core operations in Pixelteq.  
Previous write-downs against inventory have been reversed as a result of increased sales in certain markets or where 
previously written down inventories have been disposed. 
There is no material difference between the balance sheet value of inventories and their cost of replacement. None of the 
inventory has been pledged as security.

16 Trade and other receivables continued 
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 
Impairment charges are recorded against the trade receivables which the Group believes may not be recoverable. In the 
case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into 
account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of 
bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations. For trade receivables that are not past due, taking 
into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a 
specific risk of non-collection. 
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with 
these items. There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables 
where no amounts are past due. 
The ageing of trade receivables was as follows:

19 Provisions continued 
Contingent purchase consideration 
The provision at the beginning of the year comprised £84,000 falling due within one year relating to the previous 
acquisition of ASL and £16,991,000 falling due after one year, mainly relating to the acquisition of Visiometrics.  
The £9,407,000 addition arising on acquisition relates to the acquisition of FluxData Inc. during the year. See note 24.  
The amount utilised during the year relates mainly to amounts owed by the Visiometrics vendors on agreement of  
the closing net tangible asset adjustment at acquisition totalling £272,000 which was recorded against the deferred 
contingent consideration payable as the balance is to be settled net. £70,000 was also paid as final settlement of the 
payable due for ASL. 
The £10,457,000 release of provision relates to revisions to the estimates of the earn outs for Visiometrics, VAS and ASL 
by £10,087,000, £356,000 and £14,000 respectively.  
The Visiometrics earn out comprises a Royalty and Core element. The Royalty element which is payable based on gross 
margin on sales to one particular customer has been revised downwards to nil as at the year end as a result of a change  
of strategic focus by that customer. The associated customer relationship intangible was also impaired in full as discussed 
in note 12. The Core element which is payable on a multiple of EBITDA for each calendar year to December 2018 has been 
revised downwards based on current estimates of future trading. €2,700,000 of the €9,000,000 (£6,558,000) payment 
made into escrow on acquisition was released to the vendors during the year following the company successfully meeting 
the €2,000,000 EBITDA Reserve Goal at the end of December 2016. The balance is to be released to the vendors subject 
to collection of all related outstanding debtors no later than 30 June 2017.  
Of the closing total provision of £16,444,000, £427,000 payable for the acquisition of VAS was settled in April 2017; 
£287,000 (€336,000) was paid, representing the first year Royalty earn out for Visiometrics on sales made prior to the 
change in focus by the customer, offset by the £272,000 net tangible asset receivable; and £321,000 was settled in May 
2017 for the first FluxData earn out covering the three month period to March 2017. As discussed above, there is nothing 
further expected to be paid under the Royalty element of the Visiometrics earn out. The balance due after more than one 
year comprises £4,703,000 payable for the year to March 2018 for the acquisition of FluxData and £10,693,000 payable 
for the year to March 2019 for FluxData and for the core earn out element of Visiometrics.   
Dilapidations and empty property  
Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable  
costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.  
The provisions comprise the Directors’ best estimates of future payments: 
a) to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of  
 the properties; and 
b) on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.  
These commitments cover the period from 2017 to 2028 though they predominantly fall due within five years. 
Product warranty 
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of 
business and included within the Group companies’ standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments cover a  
period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period. The provision represents the Directors’ 
best estimate of the Group’s liability based on past experience.  
Legal, contractual and other 
Legal, contractual and other provisions comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes. 
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought  
by other parties. Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of 
similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors’ best 
estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity 
of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations. Contractual and other provisions represent the 
Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations. Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these 
reserves are shown as current. 
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group 
companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not  
that such proceedings may be successful.

21 Deferred tax continued 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances  
(after offset) for financial reporting purposes: 
Movement in net deferred tax liability: 
* Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period 
acquisitions. See note 24. 
Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) 
were substantively enacted in the UK Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 and UK Finance Act 2016, respectively.  
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that  
no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK. However, £35,788,000 (2016: £29,155,000) of those 
earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas 
jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed £3,595,000 (2016: 
£3,192,000) of which only £801,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.  
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future. Temporary timing differences in 
connection with the interest in associate are insignificant. 
At 1 April 2017 the Group had unused capital tax losses of £318,000 (2016: £155,000) for which no deferred tax asset has  
been recognised. 
22 Share capital 
The number of ordinary shares in issue at 1 April 2017 was 379,645,332 (2016: 379,645,332), including treasury shares of 
462,188 (2016: 940,421) and shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust of 512,417 (2016: 311,444).

23 Share-based payments 
The total cost recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of share-based payment plans (the ‘employee 
share plans’) was as follows: 
The Group has recorded liabilities of £nil (2016: £1,130,000) in respect of the cash-settled portion of the awards granted 
under the performance share plan. 
Share incentive plan 
Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plan’s trustees at the time of the award and are  
held in trust until their transfer to qualifying employees; vesting is conditional upon completion of three years’ service.  
The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period. 
Performance share plan (PSP) 
The PSP was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans. During the 
prior year the PSP was replaced with the Executive share plan. 
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Group’s relative Total Shareholder 
Return against the FTSE 250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital 
measure. Awards which do not vest, lapse on the third anniversary of their award. 
A summary of the movements in share awards granted under the PSP is as follows: 
The weighted average share price at the date of awards vesting during the year was 1061.0p (2016: 759.0p). 
The performance shares outstanding at 1 April 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5 months  
(2016: 11 months). 
Executive share plan (ESP) 
During the year ended 2 April 2016 the Group introduced the ESP, in which executive Directors and certain senior 
employees participate. 
Deferred share awards are made under this Plan as either performance awards or deferred awards. Performance awards 
vest after three years based on Earnings Per Share and Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC) targets, and after two or 
three years for deferred share awards based on continuing service of the employee only. Awards which do not vest, lapse 
on the second or third anniversary of their grant.

23 Share-based payments continued 
The performance shares outstanding at 1 April 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 23 months  
(2016: 34 months). 
The fair value of the awards was calculated using an appropriate simulation method.  
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous

Awards under the above plans are normally settled in shares but may be settled in cash at the Board’s discretion or  
where required by local regulations. Cash settled awards follow the same vesting conditions as the plans under which  
they are awarded.  
24 Acquisitions  
In accounting for acquisitions, adjustments are made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to 
reflect their fair values to the Group. Acquired inventories are valued at fair value adopting Group bases and any liabilities 
for warranties relating to past trading are recognised. Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition 
are included and accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group where appropriate. 
Below are summaries of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the purchase consideration of: 
a) the total of FluxData Inc. and adjustments to prior year acquisitions;  
b) FluxData Inc., on a stand-alone basis;  
c) the adjustments to prior year acquisitions, on a stand-alone basis; and 
d) the total of FluxData Inc. and adjustments to prior year acquisitions, allocated between restated and not restated.  
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired (shown below) approximate to the gross contractual 
amounts receivable. The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.  
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 (revised). 
The combined fair value adjustments made for the acquisition of FluxData and for prior year acquisitions within the 
goodwill measurement window under IFRS 3, excluding acquired intangible assets recognised and deferred tax thereon, 
resulted in net adjustments to goodwill of negative £541,000. 
As at the date of approval of the financial statements, the acquisition accounting for all prior year acquisitions is 
complete. The accounting for FluxData is provisional; relating to finalisation of the valuation of acquired intangibles  
and the initial consideration, which is subject to agreement of the net tangible asset adjustment.

b) FluxData Inc. 
* Estimate in respect of net tangible asset adjustment. 
The Group acquired the entire share capital of FluxData Inc. on 6 January 2017 for an initial cash consideration of 
US$12,000,000 (£9,878,000). The maximum contingent consideration payable is US$15,500,000 (£12,759,000).  
The current provision of US$11,428,000 (£9,407,000) represents the fair value of the estimated payable based on 
performance to date and the expectation of future cash flows. The earn out is payable on gross margin in excess of a  
target threshold for the period ending March 2017 and then annually until March 2019.  
FluxData designs and manufactures advanced multispectral and digital imaging systems across multiple sectors including 
industrial and medical applications. Based in New York State, USA, it has become part of the Environmental & Analysis 
sector, building on the existing multispectral imaging capabilities within those companies. Existing management will 
remain in place. 
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer 
related intangibles of £7,240,000; and technology related intangibles of £6,250,000; with residual goodwill arising of 
£4,942,000. The goodwill represents:  
a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 
b) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base; and 
c) the opportunity to leverage the technical expertise across Halma’s businesses and through new products. 
The FluxData acquisition contributed £1,017,000 of revenue and £213,000 of profit after tax for the year ended  
1 April 2017.  
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Group’s reported revenue  
and profit after tax would have been £3,518,000 and £928,000 higher respectively. 
Acquisition costs totalling £264,000 were recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
£17,798,000 of goodwill arising on the FluxData acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

c) Adjustments to prior year acquisitions 
During the year adjustments were made to the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities included in the provisional 
accounting for the prior year acquisitions of Firetrace, Visiometrics and CenTrak. 
The provisional accounting was updated for the external valuation of the acquired intangibles of CenTrak which was 
incomplete at the prior year end, for changes to certain provisions and inventory valuations across all three acquisitions, 
and for adjustments to the related deferred tax balances. The initial consideration for CenTrak was also adjusted following 
the finalisation of the working capital adjustment payable. The combined adjustments made for each acquisition resulted 
in a net adjustment to goodwill of £1,803,000.  
The net increase of £3,851,000 in intangible assets arising on the acquisition of CenTrak included a decrease in the 
technology asset by £7,198,000 and an increase in the customer relationship asset and trademark asset by £4,851,000 
and £6,198,000 respectively. 
All adjustments to the provisional accounting were made within the goodwill measurement period, relevant to each 
acquisition, as defined by IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’. As required by IFRS 3, comparatives have been 
restated to reflect the changes to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for CenTrak, which, totalling  
a net adjustment to goodwill of negative £2,134,000, are considered material, as if they’d occurred at the date of 
acquisition. The comparatives have not been restated for the non-material changes to Firetrace and Visiometrics,  
totalling a net adjustment to goodwill of £331,000. The table overleaf sets out the total assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed arising on current acquisitions and adjustments to prior year acquisitions split between those which have been 
treated as current year adjustments and those as prior year for which comparatives have been restated.

Policy 
The Group’s treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks an d to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group’s operations an d 
strategic plans. No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial 
instruments are undertaken. Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks 
arising from normal operations and its financing. Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain 
geographic locations, bank borrowings. Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financ ial 
instruments. It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks su ch as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these poli cies are summarised below. The Group’s policies have remained 
unchanged since the beginning of the financial year. 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of 
measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability  
and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.  
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable  
to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity. 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning 
subsidiaries located in foreign countries. 
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling. This gives rise to translational 
currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Group’s foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength  
of Sterling relative to their operating (or ‘functional’) currencies. The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit 
is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro. The Group also has transactional 
currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies’ 
operating (or ‘functional’) currency. Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the 
net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts. 
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, 
New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by 
movements in these countries’ exchange rates. Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets  
are hedged by currency borrowings. These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.  
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits. Where bank borrowings are used  
to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates. Longer-term funding is provided by the 
Group’s bank loan facilities which are at floating rates, or by the Group’s fixed rate United States Private Placement 
completed in November 2015. 
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss  
to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating 
the risk of financial loss from defaults. Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not 
available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major 
customers. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the 
aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled  
by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas.  
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate,  
credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.  
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of £261,486,000  
(2016 (restated)*: £223,362,000) represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other  
credit enhancements are held. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with 
high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.  
* Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS (revised) Business Combinations, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period 
acquisitions. See note 24.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group has a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility (RCF) which was refinanced on 4 November 2016  
and increased from £360,000,000 to £550,000,000. The facility, in Sterling, US Dollar, Euro, and Swiss Franc, runs  
to October 2021 with the potential for a further two years extension with the agreement of the syndicate of banks.  
In addition, in November 2015 the Group completed a United States Private Placement and issued US$250,000,000 of 
loan notes in January 2016, repayable at five, seven and ten year intervals. These facilities are the main sources of long-
term funding for the Group. 
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on  
geographic location.  
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks. For short-term working capital purposes, most operating 
companies utilise local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, 
security and flexibility. Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically ‘on demand’ and as such uncommitted. 
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.

Currency exposures 
Translational exposures 
It is estimated, by reference to the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the 
value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a £823,000 (2016: £673,000) impact on the Group’s reported 
profit before tax; and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a £286,000  
(2016: £196,000) impact on the Group’s profit before tax for the year ended 1 April 2017. 
Transactional exposures  
The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the 
functional currency of the underlying company. These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable  
and payable balances. These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and  
losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates. The exposures are 
predominantly US Dollar and Euro. Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales 
and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.  
Interest rate risk profile 
The Group’s financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents 
which totalled £2,974,000 at 1 April 2017 (2016: £3,318,000). These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of £187,000 
(2016: £115,000), and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of £2,787,000 (2016: £3,203,000) which are placed on local 
money markets and earn interest at market rates. Cash balances of £63,853,000 (2016: £50,620,000) earn interest at 
local market rates. 
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, and certain 
unsecured loans, which totalled £81,951,000 at 1 April 2017 (2016: £128,208,000). All bank loans bear interest at floating 
rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months. Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency 
in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin. Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.  
The loan notes related to the acquisition of Advanced Electronics Limited outstanding at 1 April 2017 attract interest at  
a fixed rate of 1%. The loan notes related to the United States Private Placement attract interest at a weighted average 
fixed rate of 2.5%. 
The Group’s weighted average interest cost on net debt for the year was 2.49% (2016: 1.99%). 
For the year ended 1 April 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would 
reduce the Group’s profit before tax by £1,233,000 (2016: £1,658,000).

Maturity of financial liabilities 
The gross contractual maturities of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities that are neither current nor on demand 
are as follows. 
 
The Group’s bank loans are revolving credit facilities and the amount and timing of future payments and drawdowns is 
unknown. It is therefore not possible to calculate the interest arising on these loans and we have therefore not disclosed 
the maturity of the gross cash flows (including interest) in relation to these liabilities.

Borrowing facilities 
The Group’s principal sources of long-term funding are its unsecured five-year £550,000,000 revolving credit facility. The 
revolving credit facility was refinanced in November 2016 and runs to October 2021 with the potential for a further two 
years extension with the agreement of the syndicate of banks. A United States Private Placement of US$250,000,000 
completed in November 2015. The unsecured loan notes under the United States Private Placement were drawn on 
6 January 2016 as £82,000,000, €56,000,000 and US$64,000,000 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5%. 
The loan notes mature at five, seven and ten year intervals. Interest is payable half yearly. 
The Group has additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facilities of £19,968,000, which mature in 
November 2018 and were undrawn at 1 April 2017. 
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.  
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the 
facilities expire within one year or less. 
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities available at 1 April 2017 were £469,239,000 (2016: £253,810,000) of which  
£nil (2016: £nil) matures within one year and £469,239,000 (2016: £253,810,000) between two and five years. 
UK companies have cross-guaranteed £15,305,000 (2016: £15,305,000) of overdraft facilities of which £1,190,000 
(2016: £4,412,000) was drawn. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
As at 1 April 2017, with the exception of the Group’s fixed rate loan notes, there were no significant differences between 
the book value and fair value (as determined by market value) of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. As at 2 April 
2016, there were no significant differences. 
The fair value of floating borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates 
at intervals of less than one year.  
The fair value of the Group’s fixed rate loan notes arising from the United States Private Placement completed in  
January 2016 is estimated to be £182,936,000. The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash  
flow using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily 
available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7. 
The fair value of deferred contingent consideration arising on acquisitions is estimated by discounting the possible future 
cash flows using probability adjusted forecasts for the acquired company, and represents a level 3 measurement in the  
fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7. The fair value is sensitive to the weighting assigned to the expected future cash flows.  
A change in weighting of 10 percentage points towards the higher expectations would result in an increase in the 
undiscounted estimate of future cash flows of €1,110,000 for Visiometrics S.L. Attributing more weighting to a downside 
expectation would result in a decrease in the estimate of future cash flows of US$1,628,000 for FluxData Inc. 
Hedging 
As explained previously, the Group’s policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency 
using forward currency contracts. These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically £nil, and 
subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted. 
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature 
within one year and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 
12 months:

The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a £598,000 (2016: £1,131,000) asset and £315,000  
(2016: £2,196,000) liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of the £13,413,000 (2016: £4,877,000) of open  
contracts not in a designated cash flow hedge £12,894,000 (2016: £4,357,000) relates to a Swiss Franc contract  
for expected cash flows between two subsidiaries within the Group. 
Any movements in the fair values of the contracts are recognised in equity until the hedge transaction occurs, when 
gains/losses are recycled to finance income or finance expense.  
There was no ineffectiveness arising with regards to forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge.  
With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.

Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: 
− forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from  
the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK; and 
− foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investment in foreign 
operations which have the Euro, US Dollar and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies. 
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.  
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed  
and measured.  
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA (US Dollar) and the currency of Mainland Europe (Euro).  
The carrying amount of the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows: 
If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease 
as follows: 
The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year. 10% is the sensitivity  
rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s profit sensitivity 
has increased against the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Group’s profits are earned in these currencies.

Capital commitments 
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 1 April 2017 but not recognised in these accounts amounts to £998,000  
(2016: £2,776,000). 
Commitments under operating leases 
The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment. The former expire between April 2017 
and November 2028 and the latter between April 2017 and July 2022. Only certain property agreements contain an option 
for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise. 
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: 
28 Retirement benefits 
Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The Halma Group Pension Plan and 
the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan (both UK) have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee 
administered funds. Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002/03 and closed to future benefit 
accruals for 2014/15. From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the existing defined contribution section 
within the Halma Group Pension Plan.  
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of two small defined benefit 
plans in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG, and Robutec AG. A third scheme belonging to Robutec GmbH was merged into 
that of Robutec AG during the prior year. 
Total pension costs of £9,864,000 (2016: £8,213,000) recognised in employee costs (note 7), comprise £9,463,000 (2016: 
£7,901,000) related to defined contribution plans and £401,000 (2016: £312,000) related to defined benefit plans. 
Defined contribution plans 
The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was £9,463,000 
(2016: £7,901,000) and represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the 
plans. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where 
there are employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by 
the Group may be reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions. 
Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s significant defined benefit plans are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries. Under the plans, the 
employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement 
age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees. No other post-retirement 
benefits are provided. The plans are funded plans. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation was carried out at 1 December 2014 by Mr. Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.  
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, was measured using the projected unit credit method. The projected 
unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected 
earnings. Mr. Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2015 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan 
on the same basis.

28 Retirement benefits continued 
An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of 
buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company. This amount represents the amount  
that would be required to settle the plan liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund  
the ongoing liabilities of the plan. The Group estimates that this would amount to £508,000,000 (2016: £450,000,000). 
Mortality assumptions: 
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s UK defined 
benefit plans. These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for 
future improvements in mortality rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:

The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Expenditure since the date of transition to IFRSs is £100,059,000 (2016: £69,000,000). 
The amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its UK and Swiss 
defined benefit retirement benefit plans is as follows: 
*  At 1 April 2017, the fair value of the obligations and assets of the UK plans were £334,499,000 (2016: £269,044,000) and £261,083,000 (2016: £218,410,000) respectively 
and of the Swiss plans were £5,390,000 (2016: £5,142,000) and £3,950,000 (2016: £3,453,000) respectively. 
Under the current arrangements, cash contributions in the region of £11,300,000 per year will be made for the immediate 
future with the objective of eliminating the pension deficit.

Movements in the fair value of the UK and Swiss plan assets were as follows: 
The net movement on actuarial gains and losses of the UK and Swiss plans was as follows: 
The analysis of the UK plan assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
The overall expected rate of return is a weighted average. 
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension plan. The results 
of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with 
regard to the structure of the liabilities of the plan. They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility  
in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing 
information used to determine the plan’s investment strategy.  
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and 
liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance 
sheet volatility.

The five-year history of experience adjustments was as follows: 
Based on the most recent actuarial valuation, the estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the UK and 
Swiss plans during the year ending 1 April 2018 is £11,300,000. 
The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit 
pension plans. The Group estimates the plan liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 25 years, respectively, for the 
Halma and Apollo plans. 
29 Disposal of operations and restructuring 
During the year the Group restructured non-core operations in its subsidiary, Pixelteq. The £1,910,000 loss on  
restructuring included in operating profit comprises fixed asset and inventory write downs and severance costs.  
The total profit on disposal of operations shown in the prior year of £556,000 comprises a charge of £34,000 related  
to the previous disposal of Monitor Elevator Products, Inc arising from a claim under the warranty arrangement, and 
£590,000 credit for the partial disposal of shares in the Group’s associate, Optomed. The Group disposed of 9,176 shares 
in Optomed, representing 8.8% of its ownership interest in the associate. Consideration received was €1,236,000 
(£907,000). Further details are provided on page 158 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016.

Notes to the Company Accounts 
 
C1 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ except 
for the revaluation of certain financial instruments at fair value as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. 
The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in both the current and prior year.  
Financial reporting standard 101 – reduced disclosure exemptions  
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
− the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share based-payment; 
− the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures; 
− paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1; 
− paragraph 73( e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; 
− paragraph 118( e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets; 
− the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D,111 and 134-136 of IAS 1 
Presentation of Financial Statements; 
− the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows; 
− the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; 
and  
− the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two  
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such  
a member. 
Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
In preparing the financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
The most significant area of estimate is determining whether there is impairment of the Company’s investments  
which requires estimation of the investments’ values in use. The value in use calculation requires the Company to  
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and apply suitable discount rates in order  
to calculate present values.  
Summary of significant accounting policies 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that 
date. Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the 
Profit and Loss Account. 
Financial Instruments 
The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the 
instrument. Financial instruments are de-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.  
The Company's accounting policies in respect of financial instruments transactions are explained below: 
Financial assets 
The Company recognises its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for 
which the asset was acquired. 
Other than the financial assets in a qualifying hedging relationship, the Company's accounting policy for each category  
is as follows: 
Fair value through profit or loss – This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives. These are carried in the balance 
sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Loans and receivables – Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers 
(e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at  
fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

C1 Accounting policies continued 
Financial assets continued 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the  
part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the company will be unable to collect all of the 
amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying 
amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
Financial liabilities 
The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for 
which the liability was acquired. 
Fair value through profit or loss – These comprise only out-of-the-money derivatives. They are carried in the balance sheet 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
At amortised cost – Financial liabilities at amortised cost including bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. 
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has adopted IFRS 2 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Group’s 
policy. This policy is shown on page 134. 
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Fixed assets and depreciation 
Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land 
which is not depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its 
estimated life. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: 
Leases 
The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 
Pensions 
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they 
become payable. The Company also operates a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan. For defined benefit plans, the 
asset or liability recorded in the Company Balance Sheet is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and 
the present value of the defined obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for the plan 
on an annual basis by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur, and are taken to other comprehensive income. 
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of settlements or curtailments, are charged to profit and loss.  
The unwinding of the discounting on the net liability is recognised within finance income or expense as appropriate.  
Freehold property 2% 
Plant, equipment and vehicles 8% to 33.3%

C1 Accounting policies continued 
Taxation 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively 
enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is 
considered more likely than not on the basis of all available evidence. 
The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income. 
C2 Result for the year 
As permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Profit and Loss Account of Halma plc is not presented  
as part of these accounts. The Company has reported a profit after taxation for the financial year of £89,299,000

C5 Investments 
Shares in Group companies 
The increase of £6,692,000 in the year mostly comprises additions from restructuring within the group:  
− £2,120,000 for the 100% acquisition of Rohrback Cosasco Systems UK Limited, the UK company of the Group’s RCS 
business, from Rohrback Cosasco Systems, Inc., another wholly owned subsidiary; 
− £3,894,000 for the 100% acquisition of Avire Trading Limited, a new subsidiary, following restructuring of the Group’s 
Avire business ;  
− £692,000 increase in investment in an existing subsidiary, Halma Euro Trading Limited; and 
− offsetting this is £14,000 reduction in investment in ASL, a previous acquisition, on full and final settlement of the 
related contingent consideration. 
The disposal of investment of £9,000 relates to the sale of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary Avire Limited to  
Avire Trading Limited on restructuring of the Avire business.  
The increase of £2,516,000 in the prior year comprised £991,000 for the 100% acquisition of Firetrace International 
Limited (Firetrace), £809,000 increase in investment in an existing subsidiary, Halma Euro Trading Limited, and  
an increase of £827,000 in the investment of Advanced, offset by a decrease of £111,000 in the investment of ASL.  
The latter two were due to changes in the estimate of contingent considerations payable.

C6 Debtors 
C7 Borrowings 
The Company has two sources of long-term funding, which comprise: 
− an unsecured five-year £550,000,000 revolving credit facility, which, having refinanced during the year, expires in 
October 2021 and is therefore classified as expiring within two to five years (2016: within two to five years). At 1 April 
2017 £469,239,000 (2016: £236,204,000) remained committed and undrawn, and 
− unsecured loan notes agreed on 2 November 2015 in a mix of Sterling, US Dollars and Euro with borrowing periods of 
five, seven and ten years. At 1 April 2017 the outstanding loan notes totalled £180,981,000 (2016: £171,870,000). The 
loan notes are classified as falling due after more than one year.  
Further details are included in note 26 to the Group accounts. 
Included in loan notes due after more than one year is £176,000 (2016: £242,000) of unsecured loan notes issued in 
respect of the Advanced acquisition. These attract interest at 1% and are convertible at par into cash on each anniversary 
of the acquisition date until 14 May 2019.  
The bank overdrafts, which are unsecured, at 1 April 2017 and 2 April 2016 were drawn on uncommitted facilities which  
all expire within one year, and were held pursuant to a Group pooling arrangement which offsets them against credit 
balances in subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company is part of an arrangement between UK subsidiaries whereby overdraft facilities of £15,305,000  
(2016: £15,305,000) are cross-guaranteed. Of these facilities £1,190,000 (2016: £4,412,000) was drawn.

Summary 2008 to 2017 
 
 
 
All years are presented under IFRS. 
* Comparatives have been restated, as required by IFRS3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’, for material changes arising on the provisional accounting for prior period 
acquisitions. See note 24. 
Notes: 
1. Continuing and discontinued operations. 
2. Adjusted to remove the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and acquisition transaction costs, release of fair value adjustments to inventory, 
adjustments to contingent consideration (collectively ‘acquisition items’) and restructuring costs. IFRS figures include results of operations up to the date of their sales 
or closure but exclude material discontinued and continuing profits on sales or closures of operations. In 2013/14 only, the effects of closure to future benefit accrual of  
the defined benefit pension plans have also been removed. 
3.  Return on Sales is defined as profit before taxation, the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets; acquisition items (from 2010/11); restructuring costs, 
profit or loss on disposal of operations; and the effects of closure to future benefit accrual of the defined benefit pension plans net of associated costs (2013/14 only) 
expressed as a percentage of revenue. 
4. See note 3 to the Report and Accounts for the definitions of ROCE and ROTIC. The ROCE and ROTIC measures were restated in 2014/15 and for all prior years to use an 
average Capital Employed and Total Invested Capital respectively. This measure is considered to be more representative. 
5. IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’ was adopted by the Group in 2013/14. To aid comparison, and as required by IAS 19 (revised), the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and affected notes for 2012/13 were restated as if IAS 19 (revised) had always applied during that year. Results prior to 2012/13 were not restated.

Investor information
Visit our website, www.halma.com, for investor information and Company news. In addition to accessing financial data, 
you can view and download Annual and Half Year Reports, analyst presentations, find contact details for Halma senior 
executives and subsidiary companies and access links to Halma subsidiary websites. You can also download our iPad app 
or subscribe to an e-mail news alert service to automatically receive an e-mail when significant announcements are made.
Shareholding information
Please contact our Registrar, Computershare, directly for all enquiries about your shareholding. Visit their Investor 
Centre website www.investorcentre.co.uk for online information about your shareholding (you will need your shareholder 
reference number which can be found on your share certificate or dividend confirmation), or telephone the Registrar 
direct using the dedicated telephone number for Halma shareholders: +44 (0)370 707 1046.
Dividend mandate
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account by completing a 
bank mandate form. The advantages to using this service are: the payment is more secure than sending a cheque through 
the post; it avoids the inconvenience of paying in a cheque and there is no risk of lost, stolen or out-of-date cheques. A 
mandate form can be obtained from Computershare or you will find one on the reverse of your last dividend confirmation.

206 Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) which offers shareholders the option to elect to have 
their cash dividends reinvested in Halma ordinary shares purchased in the market. You can register for the DRIP  
online by visiting Computershare’s Investor Centre website (as above) or by requesting an application form direct  
from Computershare. Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming final dividend, but have not 
already done so, should return a DRIP application form to Computershare no later than 26 July 2017.
Electronic communications
All shareholder communications, including the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, are made available to 
shareholders on the Halma website and you may opt to receive e-mail notification that documents and information are 
available to view and download rather than to receive paper copies through the post. Using electronic communications 
helps us to limit the amount of paper we use and assists us in reducing our costs. If you would like to sign up for this 
service, visit Computershare’s Investor Centre website. You may change the way you receive communications at any 
time by contacting Computershare.
