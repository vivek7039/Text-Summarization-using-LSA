Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Ov ERv IEw At a Glance
We operate our business through two divisions that reflect the principal routes 
to market for our products: Profiles and Building Plastics.
PROFILES DIVISION
The Profiles division manufactures extruded rigid PVC 
profiles and foam PVC products. We make rigid and foam 
products using virgin PVC compound, the largest 
component of which is resin. Our rigid products also 
include recycled PVC compound, produced at our market 
leading recycling facility.
Rigid PVC profiles are sold to third-party fabricators, 
who produce windows, trims, cavity closer systems, patio 
doors and conservatories for their customers.
There are broadly four types of fabricator. Trade frame 
fabricators supply finished products to tradesmen or small 
retail outlets. New build fabricators supply and install the 
products they make for house builders. Commercial 
fabricators supply and install products used in applications 
such as office space and education facilities. Finally, retail 
fabricators make products for sale via their own retail 
operation, which may be a large national business, or a 
small company servicing the local community. Most of 
Eurocell’s customers are trade frame fabricators, although 
new build is becoming increasingly important.
Fabricators have production facilities which are customised to 
the window or door system they make. As a result, fabricators 
predominately buy profiles from a single supplier, which in turn 
creates a stable and loyal customer base.
Foam PVC products are used for roofline and are 
supplied to customers through our nationwide branch 
network in the Building Plastics division (see opposite).
As such, all of our manufacturing margin is recorded within 
the Profiles division, which therefore also benefits from 
expansion of the branch network.
The Profiles division also includes S&S Plastics and Vista; 
businesses acquired in 2015 and 2016 respectively. S&S 
supplies plastic injection moulding products and services 
for use in windows and certain other markets. Vista 
manufactures composite and PVC entrance doors, which 
are sold to third parties either direct or via the Building 
Plastics division.
OUR ROUTE TO MARKET
Our sales and distribution strategy is implemented through 
our cross functional sales and business development teams, 
which target the key decision makers in the supply chain. The 
key decision makers include fabricators, installers, 
developers, architects and local authorities. By influencing 
the influencers we earn the loyalty of our customers by 
helping them grow their businesses.

BUILDING PLASTICS DIVISION
The Building Plastics division distributes a range of 
Eurocell manufactured and branded foam PVC roofline 
products and Vista doors, as well as third-party 
manufactured ancillary products. These include 
sealants, tools and rainwater products, as well as 
windows fabricated by third parties using products 
manufactured by the Profiles division.
Distribution is through our national network of 190 
branches to installers, small and independent builders, 
house builders and nationwide maintenance 
companies. The branches also sell roofline products to 
independent wholesalers.
The Building Plastics division also includes Security 
Hardware, acquired in February 2017 . Security 
Hardware is a supplier of locks and hardware, primarily 
to the Repair, Maintenance and Improvements  
(‘RMI’) market.

Financial and Operating Performance
Our sales growth was good at +10% (+8% excluding 
acquisitions), with market share gains across the business. 
Profitability was solid, having been impacted by a subdued 
RMI market, especially in the second half, and higher raw 
material cost inflation.
As a result, we reported adjusted profit before tax of 
£24.5 million, up 1% on last year. Reported profit before  
tax of £23.7 million is down 0.7% on last year.
Cash conversion remains solid, with underlying operating 
cash flow of £28.8 million (2016: £32.2 million) driving a 
reduction in net debt to £14.5 million (31 December 2016: 
£20.3 million). We have a strong balance sheet which 
provides flexibility and options for the future.
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Security 
Hardware Limited, a supplier of locks and hardware primarily 
to the RMI market, with annual sales of approximately  
£3 million. The integration is now substantially complete.
Strategy
In January 2018, building on the work done in 2017, we 
conducted a review of the Company’s strategy and the 
fundamental elements of our markets and activities. At the 
conclusion of this process, we reaffirmed that our overall 
objective remains to deliver sustainable growth in 
Shareholder value by increasing sales and profits at above 
our market level growth rates.
We have five clear strategic priorities to help us achieve our 
overall objective:
• Target growth in market share.
• Expand our branch network.
• Increase the use of recycled materials.
• Develop innovative new products.
• Explore potential bolt-on acquisitions.
We made good progress with each of these priorities 
during 2017, with the key aspects of our performance 
described in the Chief Executive’s Review and in Our 
Strategy.
Looking forward, we will continue to develop each of these 
areas. We expect the significant investments now made in 
our specifications teams and in expanding the branch 
network will deliver further gains in market share. In addition, 
in response to continued raw material cost inflation, we 
intend to place more emphasis on increasing the use of 
recycled materials in our manufacturing processes.
Governance
As a Board, we are committed to promoting the highest 
standards of corporate governance and ensuring effective 
communication with Shareholders. We continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code as outlined in  
our Corporate Governance Statement on pages 43 to 45.
Dividends
We paid an interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share.  
The Board proposes a final dividend of 6.0 pence  
per share, resulting in total dividends for the year of  
9.0 pence, representing growth of 6%.
People
The good progress and robust financial results we reported 
in 2017 are a direct result of the hard work and dedication of 
our teams in every part of our business. On your behalf  
and on behalf of the Board, I offer our sincere thanks.

Social Housing Improvement
  Decent Homes Programme and the Energy 
Company Obligation (‘ECO’) scheme both 
ended in 2017 – under these schemes the 
support typically came in the form of heating 
packages, insulation and energy efficient 
windows.
Eurocell Markets and Drivers
Despite a subdued RMI market and the prevailing economic 
uncertainty, we are confident that our strategic initiatives (described  
in Our Strategy on pages 20 and 21), including increasing market 
share, continued expansion of the branch network and further 
expanding our use of recycled material, will deliver above our  
market level growth rates for Eurocell.
Private Home Improvement (‘RMI’)
The RMI market is subdued, reflecting  
(inter alia): political uncertainty, the unknown 
impact of Brexit, the potential for further 
increases in interest rates and the relatively 
weak growth in real wages.
  Demand is influenced by the state of the 
economy – as spend is often significant, 
the state of the economy and the resulting 
impact on the housing market and consumer 
confidence influence demand.
  Housing market – if the housing market is 
weak, home owners may choose to improve 
or extend their existing property rather than 
move house, which can be positive for Eurocell.
  Retirement housing – planned improvements 
to retirement housing and increased availability 
of funds following changes to pension scheme 
rules may provide support to the RMI market 
in the future.
Private New Build Housing
New build growth has been strong in recent 
years and the large house builders continue to 
report good performance.
  Macro-economic environment – uncertainty 
suggests affordability will likely remain a key 
issue.
  Help to Buy scheme – continues to support 
demand.
  Housing shortage – on-going positive 
government intervention remains a possibility.
Public New Build Housing
This sector represents a very small proportion of 
the UK housing market, as government policies 
are targeted towards increasing private sector 
affordable housing rather than public sector 
social housing.
  Right to Buy scheme – enables council and 
housing association tenants to buy their 
homes at a discount, therefore a reduction in 
public sector housing stock is expected as 
result of the scheme.
  Rent caps – may reduce the financing 
available for new development.
  Rental property development – housing 
associations have relied on market sales to 
raise capital, weaker house price growth and 
few transactions will likely hamper this. 8 EUROCELL PLC

STRa TEg IC REPORT
Chief Executive’s Review
Market Context
I am pleased to report a strong performance for the Group. 
The Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (‘RMI') market 
has been subdued during 2017, particularly during the 
second half, reflecting low consumer confidence. We have 
experienced an almost perfect storm of macro factors, 
including increasing political and economic risk, the first 
interest rate rise in ten years, worsening house price data, 
low real wage growth and a weak pound driving material 
cost inflation.
Against this more challenging backdrop, we have made 
excellent progress with our strategic priorities, continued to 
invest significantly in the growth of our business and made 
further gains in market share.
Financial Performance
We have reported robust financial results for 2017 and 
delivered higher revenues and profits.
Overall, sales growth was good at 8% (excluding 
acquisitions). Growth was driven by our specifications 
teams, which have continued to be successful in 
generating demand for our products with architects and 
planning authorities in the private new build sector, and by 
the continued expansion of our branch network.
Profitability was solid, having been impacted by  
the weaker second-half markets and increasing  
cost inflation we have seen for resin, other 
raw materials and traded goods. We are  
implementing selling price increases to  
mitigate pricing pressure where possible,  
but the market does lag supplier price  
increases, so there is a delay in capturing  
the benefit. We continue to manage our  
underlying operating costs tightly, whilst 
progressing further our strategic priorities 
and investing in business expansion.
As a result, adjusted profit before tax was  
£24.5 million (2016: £24.3 million) and  
reported profit before tax was £23.7 million  
(2016: £23.8 million). Further information  
on financial performance is provided in 
the Divisional and Group Financial Reviews.
Operational Performance
Health and safety
The safety and well-being of our employees and 
contractors is our first operational priority. We continue  
to maintain good health and safety performance.  
We recorded one major injury in 2017 (cut to an employee’s 
hand) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (‘RIDDOR’).
We noted in our 2017 Half-Year Report that the Health and 
Safety Executive (‘HSE’) intended to take action against the 
Company, following a minor accident to an employee in 
August 2016. The matter has now been concluded, 
resulting in a fine of £68,000 under the Health and Safety 
at Work Act.
Further details of our safety performance are included in 
Corporate and Social Responsibility.
Production
We delivered another consistent production performance 
in 2017. We manufactured approximately 44.4k tonnes of 
rigid and foam PVC profiles at our primary extrusion 
facilities, up from 40.9k tonnes in 2016, an increase of 9%.
We believe that our proven 
strategy and capabilities  
will enable Eurocell to deliver  
value to our customers  
and Shareholders.”

materials used in the extrusion process (e.g. compound 
stabilisers), as well as tests of new technologies  
(e.g. tooling) to support increasing the use of recycled 
material in the extrusion process.
Recycling
In 2017 we used 8.3k tonnes of recycled compound 
alongside virgin resin in the manufacture of many of our  
rigid PVC products in our primary extrusion processes.  
This represents 17% of material consumption, up from  
14% in 2016, an increase of approximately 2k tonnes.

Our efforts to secure increased supplies of in-feed stock for 
the recycling plant are proving successful, with collections 
up 15% in 2017. Initiatives include back-hauling material from 
our fabricator, installer and branch networks.
Information on our recent investments in recycling and 
objective to increase further the use of recycled materials is 
described in Strategic Priorities below.
Warehouse logistics
We reported last year that, following a period of outsourcing, 
the operation of our main warehouse facility was brought 
back in-house with effect from February 2017.
We have worked to understand how the arrangements 
could be better structured to deliver a more efficient 
operation and improved customer service levels. We have 
made good progress, with on-time in-full deliveries 
increasing to 96%, compared to 91% in 2016. Initiatives 
include shorter production run times and revised warehouse 
shift patterns, with picking and relationship teams assigned 
to specific key accounts.
Whilst we have incurred some incremental cost as a result 
of these changes, we believe that the primary benefit of 
improved customer service has been a critical factor in 
maintaining the loyalty of our existing customer base and  
in supporting the winning of new accounts. 10 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Priorities
As described in Our Strategy on page 20, our overall objective 
is to deliver sustainable growth in Shareholder value by 
increasing sales and profits at above our market level  
growth rates.
We have five clear strategic priorities to help us achieve our 
overall objective. We are making good progress with all of 
our strategic priorities, with the key aspects detailed below.
Target growth in market share
Our aim is to increase our share of the PVC profiles market 
to utilise the spare manufacturing capacity in our extrusion 
facilities. The effect of this is such that, whilst new volume 
could be dilutive to gross margin in the short term, the net 
margin on these sales should be attractive.
In order to deliver the incremental volume, we have been 
targeting the new build, commercial and public sectors,  
as well as a number of larger trade fabricators. In doing so,  
we emphasise why Eurocell is different: we have a strong single 
brand, good customer service and a leading recycling 
capability, all of which are attractive to customers. In addition, 
expanding the branch network pulls through demand for our 
manufactured products, thereby exploiting the spare capacity.
After a slow start in the first half of 2017, we have made 
good progress winning accounts since the summer. Sales 
have started to come through from customers who have 
recently moved onto our product systems, with more new 
accounts contracted for 2018.
Expand our branch network
Expanding the branch network secures sales growth and 
delivers good returns in the medium term, as new branches 
begin to mature. It also provides an increasing opportunity 
for sales of windows and other high-value products through 
the branch network, and (as noted above) pulls through 
demand for our manufactured products.
I am very pleased to report that we opened 31 branches in 
2017, which is a record number of new sites introduced by 
Eurocell in a 12-month period (2016: 18 new branches). 
This represents a significant investment in the expansion  
of our business, taking the total estate to 190 branches at 
the year end. We also launched a new and improved 
branch format with more products on display, and added 
new product lines to the range, to help meet our objective 
of becoming a one-stop shop for customers.
The cost of investing in new branches does create 
downward pressure on profitability in the near term as the 
new sites work towards a break-even position. Historically 
it has taken more than two years for a new branch to reach 
a break-even run-rate. We have been running trials to 
reduce start-up costs and shorten the time to break-even 
for the branches opened in 2017, with initiatives based on 
more focused direct marketing campaigns and sharing 
resources with established sites in the same region. The 
trials have gone well and there have been some key 
learnings. There is more work to do in this area, particularly 
with respect to the branches opened in 2016, but we are 
confident that, in future, new branches should reach a 
break-even run-rate before their two-year anniversary.
Our intention remains to develop an estate of approximately 
250 branches in the medium term. Subject to the success of 
the current programme, consideration of the sites available, 
potential branch maturity and sales saturation rates, we 
continue to believe that an estate of around 350 sites is a 
realistic long-term aspiration for Eurocell.
However, in order to allow the team to consolidate the 
existing estate, complete the work on reducing break-even 
times and maximise the sales of high value items through 
the whole branch network, we have revised down our short 
term target for new sites and plan to open up to 15 
branches in 2018.
Increase the use of recycled materials
The work to increase the use of recycled materials in our 
primary extrusion manufacturing processes is becoming 
even more important in the face of continued raw material 
cost inflation, particularly for PVC resin.
Average resin prices increased by 13% in 2017 and by 
approximately £150 per tonne over the last two years, 
driven by a combination of currency movements (largely 
weak Sterling) and underlying commodity price changes 
(rising oil and ethylene). This has resulted in a widening gap 
between the cost of virgin PVC compound and our 
recycled compound, making the case for further 
investment in recycling more compelling.
During the course of 2016 and 2017 we invested 
approximately £1.8 million in a project to increase our 
recycling capacity, which has boosted usage in primary 
extrusion from 9% (4.1k tonnes) of material consumption  
in 2015 to 17% (8.3k tonnes) in 2017.
Looking forward, we intend to invest to expand again  
our recycling capacity. As a result, we expect usage in 
primary extrusion to increase to around 20% in 2018 
(approximately 10k tonnes), driving a substantial saving 
compared to the cost of using virgin material.
Beyond that we will continue to evaluate opportunities to 
increase further our recycling capacity in the years ahead.

Explore potential bolt-on acquisitions 
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of 
Security Hardware, a supplier of locks and hardware 
primarily to the RMI market. Annual sales at acquisition 
were approximately £3 million.
The integration of Security Hardware is now substantially 
complete. The extensive product range (over 3,000 stock 
keeping units (‘SKUs'), covering the major hardware brands 
and an own label offering, Schlosser Technik) is now 
available through our branch network, supporting our 
objective to be a one-stop shop for anything window related 
for our customers. This also allows us to better engage with 
facilities management companies and other large 
maintenance contractors.
We are developing a range of hardware to complement our 
window profile. This will enable our fabricator customers to 
offer a fully certified common specification of window 
(including hardware), giving Eurocell the opportunity to 
target a greater share of the new build market and grow 
sales of windows through branches. We expect the 
hardware range to be available later in 2018.
We will continue to assess and consider bolt-on acquisition 
opportunities in the markets in which we operate. Our 
focus is principally on businesses that add value through 
range extension, operational efficiencies or added value 
products, or to satisfy a make-or-buy decision.
Outlook
We have made excellent progress with our strategic 
priorities in 2017, continued to invest significantly in the 
growth of our business and made further gains in  
market share.
Profit was impacted by raw material cost inflation and a 
subdued RMI market, especially in the second half. 
However, the benefits of our differentiated business model 
are becoming increasingly evident. I expect the significant 
investments we are making in the Group to deliver further 
gains in market share and allow Eurocell to take more 
control of material costs in the future.
Looking ahead, our focus for 2018 will be on optimising our 
existing branch network and expanding further our 
recycling capability. Whilst our markets remain challenging 
and raw material price inflation continues, we are in a 
strong financial position and sales in the first two months 
are in line with our expectations.
In summary, we believe that our proven strategy and 
capabilities will enable Eurocell to deliver value to our 
customers and Shareholders throughout 2018 and beyond.

Manufacturer
We manufacture both rigid and foam PVC profiles at our purpose-built extrusion 
facilities in Alfreton, which comprise three separate manufacturing sites with a 
combined footprint of 140,000 square feet.
Today we operate with 49 active extrusion machines. Recent production volumes 
have averaged over 40k tonnes per annum and we believe that production of at least 
50k tonnes per annum can be achieved with limited additional capital investment or 
incremental labour costs.
Across our various sites around the Group we are working to standardise processes 
and share best practice wherever possible. This, together with judicious capital 
investment, on-going work on lean manufacturing techniques and continuous 
improvement driven by our Kaizen team, supports the delivery of on-going 
manufacturing efficiencies.
By increasing market share of PVC rigid and foam profiles we can utilise the spare 
manufacturing capacity and drive profit growth. The expansion of our branch network 
remains an ideal platform to promote our manufactured products as well as creating 
pull through demand for both rigid and foam products.

We recycle both old windows (‘post-consumer’ waste) and customer factory offcuts 
(‘post-industrial’ waste) at our 75k square foot recycling and extrusion facility in Ilkeston.
Post-consumer and post-industrial waste is collected from a variety of our customers 
and other providers. In general, around two-thirds of the input feedstock for recycling 
is post-consumer and one-third is post-industrial waste.
The Ilkeston plant produces recycled PVC compound in pellet form from this waste, 
for use in our other manufacturing processes. This provides a substantial saving in 
cost compared to virgin resin compound and therefore helps to mitigate raw material 
price increases. Using recycled material also enhances product stability and lowers 
the carbon footprint of our manufactured goods.
When we develop new products, we look to include as much recycled content as 
possible. For example, most Modus and Eurologik systems comprise on average 
45% recycled materials. In addition, the continued expansion in the use of recycled 
material remains attractive to the new build market.

In 2017 we produced approximately 13.2k tonnes of 
recycled PVC compound for use in our extrusion 
processes. Of the recycled compound produced, 
8.3k tonnes (being almost exclusively derived from 
post-consumer waste) was used alongside virgin resin 
in the manufacture of many of our rigid PVC products in 
our primary extrusion processes. This represents 17% 
of material consumption, up from 14% in 2016.
Most of the remaining 4.9k tonnes of recycled PVC 
compound produced (being almost exclusively derived 
from post-industrial waste) was used in products which 
are manufactured at the Ilkeston plant from 100% 
recycled material, including thermal inserts and cavity 
closer systems.
As described in the Chief Executive’s Review, we plan to 
invest to increase further our recycling production capability. 
These investments are comprised of new equipment at the 
Ilkeston recycling plant to remove bottlenecks and increase 
efficiencies, as well as tooling and other extrusion equipment 
required to make the rigid profile. As a result, we expect 
recycled material usage to increase to around 20% in 2018. 20 EUROCELL PLC

Revenue
Profiles third-party revenue was up 8% in 2017 to  
£94.2 million (2016: £87.4 million), which includes an 
like-for-like sales increase of 6%. The remaining growth was 
driven by the acquisition of Vista Panels in March 2016.
We have continued to gain share, despite the RMI market (the 
most significant external driver of our performance) remaining 
subdued in 2017, particularly during the second half.
We have been pleased to see continued good growth in the 
private new build sector, where sales were up more than 
15% in 2017. We believe we are now the largest supplier of 
window profile to this market. Our dedicated specifications 
teams have been successful in generating demand, well 
supported by our ability to supply a comprehensive product 
range through the new build fabricator network. As well as 
windows, this includes composite doors, PVC and 
aluminium bi-fold doors and the only sixty-minute fire rated 
cavity closure system. Further, our InSite construction hinge 
allows timber frame and modular home manufacturers to 
install fully glazed windows into wall panels in the factory for 
off-site construction.
Our new build forums have been successful, bringing 
fabricators together with Eurocell and the house builders. 
The objective is to agree consistent specifications, quality 
and prices across the fabricator network. This allows new 
build buyers to source consistent products from a wide 
supplier base, mitigating their delivery risk.
Profiles
STRa TEg IC REPORT
Divisional Reviews
The Profiles division manufactures extruded rigid and foam PVC profiles.  
We make rigid and foam products using virgin PVC compound, the largest 
component of which is resin. Our rigid products also include recycled PVC 
compound, produced at our market-leading recycling facility.
Rigid PVC profiles are sold to third-party fabricators, who produce windows, trims, cavity closer systems, patio doors 
and conservatories for installers, retail outlets and house builders. Foam products are used for roofline and are supplied 
to customers through our nationwide branch network in the Building Plastics division.
As such, all of our manufacturing margin is recorded within the Profiles division, which therefore also benefits from 
expansion of the branch network.
The Profiles division also includes Vista Panels and S&S Plastics.
Our larger trade fabricators also performed well in 2017, 
taking a greater share of the available volume mix, albeit 
with lower growth rates in the second half. Generally, the 
larger trade fabricators have been increasing their capacity, 
by extending or adding factory units and investing in new 
plant and machinery. As such, they are benefiting from 
economies of scale and automation, which is allowing 
them to grow share at the expense of smaller fabricators.
Importantly, we also continue to build our prospect pipeline. 
In the fourth quarter, sales started to come through from 
customers who have recently moved on to our product 
systems, with more new accounts contracted for 2018.
Finally, Vista Panels continues to perform very well,  
with 39% of doors sales now channelled through our 
branch network.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA was £23.1 million (2016: £22.7 million),  
an increase of 2%.
Gross margin and return on sales in the Profiles division 
are lower in 2017, largely as a result of increasing raw 
material price pressure, particularly for resin. We have 
been implementing selling price increases to mitigate this 
where possible, but the market does lag supplier price 
rises. Further information in relation to the impact of 
increasing raw material prices is included in the Group 
Financial Review. 23
CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w STRa TEg IC REPORT
In addition, margins have been impacted by a shift in sales 
mix towards larger fabricators at the expense of smaller 
customers as described above.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA is therefore primarily a 
function of sales growth.

Divisional Reviews continued
Building Plastics distributes a range of Eurocell manufactured and branded PVC 
foam roofline products and Vista doors, as well as third-party manufactured 
ancillary products. These include windows made by our fabricator customers 
using products manufactured by Profiles, sealants, tools and rainwater products.
Distribution is through our national network of 190 branches to installers, small and independent builders, house builders and 
nationwide maintenance companies. The branches also sell roofline products to independent wholesalers.
The Building Plastics division includes Security Hardware, acquired in February 2017 . Security Hardware is a supplier of 
locks and hardware, primarily to the RMI market.
Revenue
Building Plastics revenue was up 11% to £130.7m  
(2016: £117.5m), which includes an increase in like-for-like 
sales of 3%, as well as the impact of branch openings  
and the acquisition of Security Hardware.
Like-for-like sales includes growth from branches opened  
in 2015 and prior, as the more recent sites from that vintage 
begin to mature. Growth was bolstered by increased sales of 
windows, Skypod and Equinox through the branch network, 
which were £15.6 million in 2017 , compared to £13.3 million 
last year. We have implemented window configuration 
software across the network, using common pricing and 
specifications for windows supplied to all Eurocell branches. 
This is proving successful and we will develop the software 
to incorporate products such as Skypod and doors.
Like-for-like growth also includes some benefit from an 
initiative to improve our proposition as a one-stop shop for 
customers, via the roll-out of an additional 500 product lines 
in 2016. In addition, the acquisition of Vista Panels has 
supported growth in the sales of doors through the branches, 
which reached £6.6 million in 2017 (2016: £5.5 million).
In terms of new branches, we opened 31 in 2017, compared 
to 18 in 2016. We now have a total of 190 branches 
providing national coverage across the UK, which offers  
a significant competitive advantage. Branches opened in 
2016/17 added £7.0 million to sales in 2017.
Security Hardware was acquired in February 2017 for 
consideration (net of cash acquired) of £1.3 million. Sales for 
the period of £2.5 million were in line with our expectations. 
As described in the Chief Executive’s Review, the integration 
is now substantially complete and we look forward to the 
introduction of our own range of hardware later in 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was £8.6 million  
(2016: £8.8 million), a decrease of 3%.
We maintained our gross margin in 2017. Although we 
continue to experience cost inflation, a good proportion of 
this has been mitigated with selling price increases 
implemented through the year.
Higher overheads in Building Plastics includes significant 
investment to accelerate the pace of expansion of our 
branch network described above. New branches are a key 
driver of future sales and profit growth, but they do create 
downward pressure on profitability in the short term due to 
investment in central infrastructure and in our teams at 
new sites. We estimate that investment in 18 new branches 
in 2016 and 31 in 2017 has together created a drag on 
EBITDA of approximately £2 million in 2017, compared to a 
drag of approximately £1 million in 2016.
Further information in relation to the impact of cost inflation and 
new branches is included in the Group Financial Review.
The reduction in adjusted EBITDA and return on sales is 
therefore a function of the significant investments made in 
accelerating the branch roll-out in 2017.
We are making progress with initiatives to support new 
branches reaching profitability sooner, which now include a 
more comprehensive and sustained marketing campaign 
and sharing resources with established sites in the same 
region. Whilst there is more work to do in this area, we  
are confident that, in future, new branches should reach a 
break-even run-rate before their two-year anniversary and 
be mature in 4-5 years. Indicative branch economics (rounded)
25
CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w STRa TEg IC REPORT
When the 49 branches opened in 2016/17 are mature,  
we expect a substantial improvement in performance for  
the division.
As described in the Chief Executive’s Review, we expect to 
open up to 15 branches in 2018. This will allow the team to 
consolidate the existing estate, complete the work on 
reducing break-even times and ensure the sales of windows 
and other high-value products are maximised.

Group Financial Review
Revenue 
Revenue for 2017 was £224.9 million (2016: £204.8 million), 
which represents growth of 10%, or 8% excluding 
acquisitions. Like-for-like sales growth (i.e. excluding the 
impact of acquisitions and branches opened in 2016/17) 
was 4%.
As described in the Divisional Reviews, sales have been 
driven by good like-for-like growth in Profiles (£4.5 million, 
or 6% for the division), particularly in private new build, 
solid like-for-like growth in the branch network (£3.8 million, 
or 3% for the division) and the positive impact from 
branches opened in 2016/17 (£7.0 million, or 6% for the 
division). Together, the acquisitions of Vista Panels and 
Security Hardware added £4.8 million to sales in 2017.
Gross Margin
We have experienced higher price pressure for raw 
materials and traded goods. Resin was up 13% in 2017, 
representing an additional cost to the business of 
approximately £2.6 million. Inflation for other raw materials 
and traded goods increased costs by a further £1.7 million. 
In addition, margins have been impacted by the sales mix, 
with stronger growth in sales to larger fabricators relative to 
smaller customers.
As described in the Divisional Reviews, we continue to 
mitigate cost inflation via the implementation of selling price 
increases where possible. We recovered approximately 
£3.3 million of the £4.3 million cost inflation in 2017, which 
reflects the time lag in capturing the benefit.
We further offset the impact of cost inflation by increasing 
the use of recycled materials in our primary extrusion 
operations to 17% (2016: 14%). This resulted in a benefit of 
£1.1 million to gross margin.
Overall, these factors drove a reduction in gross margin 
from 52.0% in 2016 to 51.0% in 2017.
Distribution Costs and Administrative Expenses 
(Overheads)
Overheads for the year were £82.9 million (2016:  
£75.2 million), representing a similar percentage of sales for 
both periods. The increase includes £3.8 million as a result 
of new branches opened in 2016/17 and £2.3 million from 
acquisitions. The balance of £1.6 million relates to an 
increase of 2% in the like-for-like organic business, where 
sales growth was 4% as described above. We continue to 
focus on the tight control of underlying overheads, with the 
increase driven largely by the impact of the Minimum Wage 
legislation and higher volume related distribution costs.
We have made good progress 
with our strategic priorities and 
other self-help initiatives and 
delivered robust financial 
results in the process.”

Non-underlying Costs
Non-underlying costs for 2017 of £0.8 million include 
professional fees and earn-out costs related to the 
acquisition of Security Hardware, as well as the 
redundancy and settlement costs of a staff reorganisation. 
Non-underlying costs for 2016 of £0.5 million comprise 
duplicated costs relating to the handover period during 
which the Company employed two CEO’s, as well as 
professional fees related to the acquisition of Vista Panels.
Tax
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax for  
2017 of 16.7% was lower than the standard corporation tax 
rate for the year due to the benefit of Patent Box relief.  
The effective rate on adjusted profit before tax for 2016 of 
17.7% reflected the beneficial impact on deferred tax of 
reductions in the corporation tax rate enacted in the 
period, as well as adjustments to prior year taxes.
The effective tax rate on reported profit before tax was 
17.0% (2016: 17.7%).
Depreciation and Amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation for 2017 was £6.7 million 
(2016: £6.4 million), with the increase due to amortisation  
of acquired intangibles relating to the acquisitions of  
Vista Panels and Security Hardware, as well as recent 
capital investment.
Finance Costs
Finance costs for the year were £0.6 million (2016: £0.7 million), 
reflecting lower average net debt in 2017 .
Adjusted Profit Measures
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
profit before tax all exclude non-underlying costs (see 
opposite). Adjusted profit after tax and adjusted earnings per 
share exclude non-underlying costs and the related tax effect.
Adjusted profit measures are used by management to 
assess business performance and are provided here in 
addition to statutory measures to help describe the 
underlying results of the Group. 29

trade and other receivables (£3.0 million) and in trade and other 
payables (£3.2 million). This compares to a net inflow from 
working capital of £0.8 million in 2016, which included a 
reduction in inventory of £1.6 million.
The increase in stocks has been driven largely by the 31 new 
branches, as well as the introduction of new product lines to 
the branch network. We have also built a higher level of safety 
stocks to ensure consistent on-time deliveries, particularly  
for our new build customers. Stock days were 55 at  
31 December 2017 , compared to 58 at 31 December 2016.
The changes to trade receivables and payables reflect 
normal business seasonality, alongside increased activity 
and growth in 2017. Debtor days were 37 at year end, 
compared to 36 at the end of 2016.
Net cash generated from operating activities also include 
tax paid in the year of £4.6 million (2016: £3.5 million).
Other payments include acquisitions of £1.3 million  
(2016: £6.3 million) and capital investment of £7 .5 million  
(2016: £7 .2 million).
Dividends paid represent the final dividend for 2016  
of 5.7 pence per share (or £5.7 million) and the interim 
dividend for 2017 of 3.0 pence per share (or £3.0 million).
Taking all of these factors into account, net debt fell by 
£5.8 million during the year to £14.5 million at 31 December 
2017 (31 December 2016: £20.3 million).

Earnings Per Share
Taking into account all of the factors described above, 
adjusted basic earnings per share for 2017 was 20.4 pence 
per share (2016: 20.0 pence per share).
Reported basic earnings per share for 2017 was 
19.6 pence per share (2016: 19.6 pence per share).

Acquisitions
As previously described, we acquired Security Hardware  
in February 2017 for an initial consideration of £1.3 million (net of 
cash acquired). The impact of Security Hardware on Group 
earnings for 2017 was not material.
Dividends
We paid an interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share in October 
2017 . The Board proposes a final dividend of 6.0 pence per 
share, resulting in total dividends for the year of 9.0 pence 
(2016: 8.5 pence). This represents an increase of 6%.
The dividend will be paid on 23 May 2018 to Shareholders 
registered at the close of business on 27 April 2018. The 
ex-dividend date will be 26 April 2018.
Retained earnings as at 31 December 2017 were  
£46.7 million (2016: £35.8 million). The Company takes 
steps to ensure distributable reserves are maintained at  
an appropriate level through intra-group dividend flows.
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure for 2017 was £7.5 million  
(2016: £7.2 million).
Capital expenditure includes investment to increase our 
recycling capacity of £0.9 million and in new branches 
opened in 2017 of £1.9 million. Investment of £3.1 million  
in Operations includes new tooling costs and general 
maintenance capex. Other capital expenditure of £1.6 million 
includes branch refurbishments and various IT-related costs.
Cash Flow
Net cash generated from operating activities was 
£23.7 million, compared to £28.4 million in 2016.
This includes a net outflow from working capital for 2017  
of £2.6 million, comprised of an increase in stocks (£2.8 million),  30

People
Health and safety
We employ over 1,500 people. The safety and the 
well-being of these employees and our contractors  
is our first operational priority.
We continue to maintain good safety performance 
and our safety statistics continue to benchmark well 
with industry standards.

We recorded one major injury in 2017 (cut to the  
hand) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (‘RIDDOR’).
During 2017 we appointed a new Group Quality 
Manager, with specific responsibility for health and 
safety matters. The appointment has been 
instrumental in driving improvements in our health 
and safety culture, with an emphasis on ownership 
and accountability to drive a more uniform and 
consistent approach across the Group. This is 
particularly important in our expanding branch 
network, where we added 88 employees during  
the year. 
In terms of quality, the focus has been on 
implementing key principles of quality management 
and measuring systems, which have been captured 
in our new Quality Policy Statement (see page 33).
Incentives and rewards
Our remuneration policies remain competitive  
and packages include combinations of salary,  
performance related pay and a contributory pension 
scheme.
In addition, in 2017 we launched our first Save As  
You Earn share scheme since the Initial Public 
Offering (‘IPO'). This enables employees to save a 
fixed sum each month, with an option to buy Eurocell 
shares at a discounted purchase price at the end of 
a three year savings period. Approximately 40% of 
employees have decided to join the scheme, saving 
an average £150 per month. We plan a similar 
scheme for 2018. 31

Equality and diversity
Equality and diversity form part of Eurocell’s core values.
Our equal opportunities policy requires that we give full  
and fair consideration to applications for employment by 
disabled people. In the event of a colleague becoming 
disabled, every effort will be made to ensure that their 
employment with us continues and that appropriate 
support is available.
We respect individuals and their rights in the workplace and 
with this in mind specific policies are in place to prevent or, 
where issues are raised, address harassment and bullying.
Our whistleblowing policy operates to give visibility  
to issues that might not otherwise be uncovered or 
resolved through normal channels. We recently  
introduced a whistleblowing hotline, with an associated 
employee awareness campaign and e-learning modules. 
Our colleagues come from wide and diverse backgrounds, 
nationalities and ethnic and religious groups and we respect 
and embrace cultural differences wherever we operate.
We recognise the benefits of encouraging diversity across the 
business and believe that this will contribute to our continued 
success. All appointments are made based on merit and are 
measured against specific objective criteria, including the 
skills and experience needed for the position. We remain 
committed to increasing the participation of women 
throughout the Group, including at Board level, within the 
steering group and senior management.

Training and development
We continue to invest in the training and development of our 
staff, and support them in the delivery of our Group-wide and 
individual objectives. We provide a number of training 
programmes for our teams, using a combination of internal 
and external service providers. In addition, we provide financial 
and study leave support for our trainees who are in the 
process of obtaining a professional qualification.
We operate a management development programme, which has 
three levels reflecting the relative seniority of participants. During 
2017 , 24 delegates attended level 1 and level 2 of the programme.
Within the Group we also offer e-learning training programmes 
to our employees. During 2017, staff from across the business 
have completed and passed over 2,000 e-learning courses.
We have an apprenticeship programme and during 2017,  
13 new apprentices have joined the Group.
Looking forward, we intend to invest more in the training and 
development of our employees.
Overall, we work hard to ensure we remain a local employer of 
choice, to help us attract and retain talented people. 32 EUROCELL PLC

Reduce waste sent to landfill
Our recycling facility in Ilkeston collects old windows 
(‘post-consumer’ waste) and customer factory offcuts 
(‘post-industrial’ waste) and processes them into a recycled 
PVC compound, which is then used in our other 
manufacturing processes. By recycling these products we 
reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. In 2017 we 
increased the amount of waste that we recycled by 2.9k 
tonnes.
Suppliers
Ethical and sustainable sourcing
We ensure that suppliers understand and work with us to 
meet our aspirations.
Over 70% of our suppliers have been supplying Eurocell for 
more than three years. All supply and tender agreements 
include the following statement:
“The supplier advocates the principles of Corporate Social 
Responsibility and requires a serious approach to social-
economic issues from its supply chain.”
All of our suppliers are required to confirm their 
commitment to the following principles:
• The obligation to the global and local environment;
• Respect for fundamental human entitlements;
• In purchasing activities, a commitment to improving the 
organisation’s performance in relation to fairness to all;
• A system of internal and external reporting which 
matches espoused values;
• A proactive promotion of sustainable practices and products;
• Recognition that there is responsibility to add value to 
communities and societies upon which the organisation 
has influence; and
• An ethical approach to purchasing activities.
Environment
We are committed to protect and minimise our impact on the 
environment. We will operate in compliance with our relevant 
environmental legislation and we will strive to use pollution 
prevention and environmental best practice in all that we do. 
We recognise that our operations result in emissions and waste 
and we are committed to control, recover and re-use PVC 
waste wherever possible. We promote the efficient use of 
materials and resources throughout our facilities particularly 
non-renewable resources and continue our development of 
sustainably sourced products using recycled materials.
Environmental concerns and impacts are a consideration in  
all of our decision making and activities and we promote 
environmental awareness amongst our employees and 
encourage them to work in an environmentally responsible 
manner. This is achieved through training, education and 
informing our employees about environmental issues that may 
affect their work.
Emergency response procedures are maintained where 
required by legislation or where significant health, safety  
or environmental hazards exist.
Our environmental objectives are set out in alignment with 
legislation and continually reviewed to ensure they are being 
met. Our environmental policies apply to all our operations and 
sufficient resources will be made available to ensure that this 
policy is implemented. We will strive to continually improve our 
environmental performance and review this policy in light of any 
planned future activities.
Our policies are also communicated amongst all employees 
and interested parties. 
Greenhouse gas data
We are reporting our greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions as

Risk Management Process
Risk management is the responsibility of the Board and is a key factor in delivering  
the Group’s strategic objectives.
The Board is responsible for setting the risk appetite, establishing 
a culture of effective risk management and for ensuring that 
effective systems and controls are in place and maintained.
Senior managers take ownership of specific risks and implement 
policies and procedures to mitigate exposure to those risks.
Risk Management Process
The risk management process sits alongside our strong 
governance culture and effective internal controls to provide 
assurance to the Board that risks are being appropriately 
identified and managed.
How we manage risk
Risk is managed across the Group in the following ways:
• The Board meets annually to review strategy and set the  
risk appetite.
• Risks faced by the Group are identified during the formulation 
of the annual business plan and budget process, which sets 
objectives and agrees initiatives to achieve the Group’s goals, 
taking account of the risk appetite set by the Board.
• Senior management and risk owners consider the root cause 
of each risk and assess the impact and likelihood of it 
materialising. The analysis is documented in a risk register, 
which identifies the level of severity and probability, 
ownership and mitigation measures, as well as any proposed 
further actions (and timescale for completion) for each 
significant risk.
• At the beginning of the year the Group established an 
executive Risk Management Committee, chaired by the  
Chief Financial Officer. This Committee meets on a regular 
basis (generally monthly). The status of the most significant 
risks and mitigations are reviewed at each meeting, with 
other risks reviewed on a cyclical basis.
• The Executive Directors also meet with senior managers on  
a regular basis throughout the year. This allows the Executive 
Directors to ensure that they maintain visibility over the 
material aspects of strategic, financial and other risks.
• The Group’s Executive Directors also compile their own risk 
assessment, ensuring that a top-down, bottom-up approach 
is undertaken when considering the Group-wide 
environment.
• The Group’s Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board  
in assessing and monitoring risk management across the 
Group. The role of the Committee includes ensuring the 
timely identification and robust management of inherent and 
emerging risks, by reviewing the suitability and effectiveness 
of risk management processes and controls. The Committee 
also reviews the risk register to ensure net risk and proposed 
further actions are together consistent with the risk appetite 
set by the Board.

Internal control
The Group has a well-defined system of internal controls.
The Group has a robust process of financial planning and 
monitoring, which incorporates Board approval of operating  
and capital expenditure budgets. Performance against the 
budget is subsequently monitored and reported to the Board  
on a monthly basis. The Board also monitors overall 
performance against operating, safety and other targets set  
at the start of the year. Performance is reported formally to 
Shareholders through the publication of its results both annually 
and half-yearly. Operational management regularly reports  
on performance to the Executive Directors.
The Group also has processes in place for ensuring business 
continuity and emergency planning.
Day-to-day operations are supported by a clear schedule of 
authority limits that define processes and procedures for 
approving material decisions. This ensures that projects  
and transactions are approved at the appropriate level of 
management, with the largest and most complex projects being 
approved by the Board. The schedule of authority limits was 
updated in December 2016, to reflect the development of the 
business since its IPO, and approved by the Board.
In order to further enhance the internal control and risk 
management processes, the Group appointed KPMG as  
internal auditor in March 2017. KPMG work closely with the  
Risk Management Committee in delivering the Groups internal 
audit programme.
With the assistance of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 
has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control. 
Following its review, the Board determined that it was not aware 
of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system 
of internal control. 36 EUROCELL PLC

MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
The Group’s products are used in the residential and 
commercial building and construction markets, both 
within the RMI sector, for new residential housing 
developments and for new construction projects.
The Group’s private RMI business is strongly correlated 
to the level of household disposable incomes. The 
Group’s new build business is particularly influenced by 
the level of activity in the house building industry.
As such, the Group’s business and ability to fund 
ongoing operations is dependent on the level of activity 
and market demand in these sectors, itself often a 
function of general economic conditions (including 
interest rates and inflation) in the UK.
• Notwithstanding macro conditions, 
we expect our strategic priorities and 
self-help initiatives to support sales 
and market share growth.
• Initiatives include: growing market share 
to exploit spare manufacturing capacity, 
investment in our specifications team 
(targeting new build, commercial and 
public sector work) and expanding the 
branch network.
• We currently operate comfortably 
within the terms of our existing bank 
facility and related financial covenants.
• Perception of increased 
political and economic 
uncertainty following UK 
2017 General Election.
• The general RMI market is 
currently subdued.
• Specific markets for our 
products are broadly flat at 
present.
• The UK base rate was 
increased in November 
2017, the first increase in 
ten years, partly as a result 
of increasing inflationary 
pressures.
• Reducing the pace of 
branch network expansion 
can improve short-term 
profit and cash flows.
EU REFERENDUM
There remains significant uncertainty over how 
the economic landscape will be affected by the 
Referendum result.
This in turn could impact on our ability to grow the 
business (e.g. due to economic uncertainty) and/or the 
cost of our raw materials (see Raw Material Prices).
• Strategic priorities and self-help 
initiatives noted above.
• Flexible plans with the ability to adapt 
if circumstances change (e.g. curtail 
investment in the short term to protect 
the business).
• Brexit negotiations on-going, 
but perception of increasing 
uncertainty as to the terms 
under which the UK will 
leave the EU.
RAW MATERIAL PRICES
The Group’s manufacturing operations depend on the 
supply of PVC resin, a material derivative of ethylene 
which in turn is a derivative of crude oil.
The price of PVC resin can therefore be subject to 
fluctuations based on the markets for crude oil and 
ethylene, as well as the market for resin itself. In 
addition, although we pay for resin in sterling, crude 
oil and ethylene are priced in US Dollars and Euros 
respectively. As such, the price of resin in sterling is also 
impacted by international currency markets.
Our ability to pass on resin and other raw material or 
traded goods price increases to our customers will 
depend on market conditions at the time.
• Where possible we pass through resin 
price increases to our customers.
• Increased use of recycled material in 
our manufacturing.
• Use of more than one supplier to 
provide competitive pricing.
• Resin supply contracts contain 
mechanisms to help mitigate some 
variations in price.
• Resin and other raw material 
prices increased significantly 
in 2017, primarily due to the 
weakness in Sterling.
• Partially mitigated with selling 
price uplifts, increased use 
of recycled material and 
manufacturing efficiencies.
• There may be further raw 
material pricing pressure in 
2018.
RAW MATERIAL SUPPLY
There are only a limited number of PVC resin and 
certain other raw material suppliers and we operate with 
limited material storage capacity.
Failure to receive raw materials on a timely basis could 
impact on our ability to manufacture products and meet 
customer demand.
• Raw material tests to identify potential 
alternative suppliers are on-going.
• Spot market for resin available to 
access.
• Contractual arrangements for certain 
key suppliers include liquidated 
damages for failure to supply.
• Regular reviews to test financial stability 
of key suppliers.
• Lower global production and 
supply into Europe of PVC resin 
contributed to increasing prices 
in 2017.
• New US capacity expected 
to come on line in 2018 and 
beyond, potentially increasing 
supplies into Europe.
• Competitive resin sourcing 
introduced for 2017.
UNPLANNED PLANT DOWNTIME
The business is dependent on the continued and 
uninterrupted performance of its production facilities.
Each of the facilities is subject to operating risks, such 
as industrial accidents (including fire); extended power 
outages; withdrawal of permits and licences (particularly 
in the context of the regulated operation of the recycling 
facility); breakdowns in machinery; equipment or 
information systems; prolonged maintenance activity; 
strikes; natural disasters and other unforeseen events.
• We have meaningful spare 
manufacturing capacity.
• Regular planned maintenance to 
reduce the risk of plant failure.
• Maintenance capital investment of 
approximately £5 million per annum 
across the Group.
• Extrusion facilities spread over  
3 manufacturing sites.
• Group-wide disaster recovery 
plans reviewed and updated 
in 2017.
• Capital investment in the 
recycling plant of £1.8 million 
in 2016/17 to increase 
capacity and eliminate 
bottlenecks.
• Successful project in 2017 
to increase raw material 
feedstock for the recycling 
plant.

CORPORATE AND REGULATORY RISKS
We may be adversely affected by unexpected corporate 
or regulatory risks. This could include health and safety, 
reputational and environmental events, or other legal 
and compliance matters.
Enacted or soon to be enacted increases in the penalty 
regime have increased the potential financial impact of 
breaches or incidents in many cases.
These areas are receiving additional management 
focus, but the impact of the underlying risk has been 
increasing of late.
• We have procedures and policies in 
place to support compliance with 
regulations.
• Regular communication and training  
on policy compliance.
• Monitoring procedures in place, 
including near miss and potential hazard 
reporting for health and safety matters. 
• Internal and third-party site audits to 
test compliance with our policies.
• Health and safety continues 
to be high-profile risk area.
• New position of Group 
Quality Manager in post 
mid-2017, with specific focus 
on driving improvements in 
health and safety behaviours.
• General Data Protection 
Regulations (‘GDPR’) come 
into force in May 2018, 
with increased compliance 
requirements and higher 
penalties for breaches.
UNSUCCESSFUL BRANCH OPENINGS
The Group has invested in expanding the branch 
network over the last two years.
Good new sites may become more difficult to find.
New branches may fail to reach the required scale 
and therefore deliver the required sales and profitability 
within an acceptable timeframe.
• Large portfolio of potential new sites, 
prioritised based on detailed research 
into areas most likely to be successful.
• Trials of reduced start-up costs in new 
branches in progress.
• Significant acceleration of 
the network expansion, with 
18 new sites in 2016 and 31 
opened in 2017.
• More to do on consolidating 
the existing estate, completing 
the work to reduce break-even 
times and maximise sales of 
high-value products.
CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK
We do not insure our receivables, so there is an inherent 
risk that default by a large customer could result in a 
material bad debt.
• In-depth credit review for new and 
ongoing customer accounts.
• Experienced Credit Manager (over 
15 years with the Group) and strong 
credit control team.
• Increased economic 
uncertainty and falling 
consumer confidence may 
lead to more business failures.
• No material bad debts in 2017, 
but inherent risk remains.
COMPETITOR ACTIVITY
The Group has a number of existing competitors who 
compete on range, price, quality and service. Increased 
competition could reduce volumes and margins on 
manufactured and traded products.
• Strong market and customer 
awareness, with good intelligence 
around competitor activity.
• Focus on customer proposition and 
points of differentiation in product and 
service offering.
• The Group has continued 
to gain market share in both 
divisions.
• The more uncertain market 
environment has potentially 
weakened some of our key 
competitors.
FAILURE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS
Failure to innovate could reduce our growth potential, 
render existing products obsolete and cause a 
reduction in market share.
The launch of new products and new variants of existing 
products is an inherently uncertain process. We cannot 
guarantee that we will continuously develop successful new 
products or new variants of existing products. 
Nor can we predict how customers and end-users will react 
to such new products or how successful our competitors 
will be in developing products which are more attractive 
than ours.
•  We invest continuously in research and 
development through our in-house 
team.
• The team is highly focused on new 
ways to develop existing products and 
to be innovative with new ones.
• Recent successes include 
new products to support 
off-site home construction, an 
improved PVC bi-fold door 
alongside the introduction of an 
aluminum bi-fold door offering, 
a new sheet-tile roof system 
and improvements to the 
Modus and Skypod ranges.
• We also have a strong product 
pipeline with more than 25 
projects in development.
ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY 
PERSONNEL AND HIGHL Y SKILLED INDIVIDUALS
The Group’ s success depends inter alia, on the efforts and 
abilities of certain key personnel and its ability to attract and 
retain such personnel.
The Executive Directors and senior managers have 
significant experience in the relevant sectors and 
capital markets and are expected to make an important 
contribution to the Group’s growth and success.
• Market rate compensation for all 
personnel, including leadership team.
• Clear strategic direction provides 
attractive backdrop to working at 
Eurocell.
• Recent introduction for senior 
team of long-term incentive 
plans and adjustments to 
fixed/variable compensation 
to support high retention rate. 38 EUROCELL PLC

Reporting Period Movement
SHORTAGES OR INCREASED COSTS OF 
APPROPRIATELY SKILLED LABOUR
The Group is subject to supply risks related to the 
availability and cost of labour, particularly in our 
branch business. We may also experience labour cost 
increases (including those related to the Minimum 
Wage) or disruptions in circumstances where we have 
to compete for employees with the necessary skills and 
experience in tight labour markets.
• Market level or better salaries and good 
benefits package.
• Induction and training programme.
• New Group HR Director 
(appointed in 2017) 
designing strategy to improve 
retention and recruitment, 
leadership and development, 
employee engagement and 
communication.
• Reducing churn rate in our 
branch business is a primary 
objective of the new strategy.
• SAYE scheme launched for all 
personnel in 2017.
CYBER SECURITY
A breach of IT security (externally or internally) could result 
in an inability to operate systems effectively (e.g. viruses) or 
the release of inappropriate information (e.g. hackers).
This remains a high profile area and is receiving 
considerable management focus.
• Physical security of servers at  
third-party off-site data centre with  
full disaster recovery capability.
• Password and safe use policies  
in place.
• Internet usage monitored.
• Anti-malware regularly used.
• Network defences enhanced 
and Wi-Fi access controls 
improved in 2017.
• Cyber awareness campaign 
and promotion of IT security 
policies introduced for all 
employees early in 2018.
FAILURE TO IDENTIFY , COMPLETE AND 
INTEGRATE BOLT -ON ACQUISITIONS
Exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions is one of our 
strategic priorities.
We may not be able to identify appropriate bolt-on 
acquisitions.
Any future acquisition we do make poses integration 
and other risks which may significantly affect our results 
or operations.
The acquisition and integration of companies is a 
complex, costly and time-consuming process involving 
a number of possible risks. These include diversion 
of management attention, failure to retain personnel, 
failure to maintain customer service levels, disruption to 
relationships with various third parties and unanticipated 
liabilities.
• Public communication of bolt-on 
acquisitions being a strategic priority. 
• Good knowledge of companies 
operating in our sector and related 
sectors.
• We have a tried and tested procedure 
for the integration of new acquisitions 
and a good track record of recent 
success.
• Acquisition and integration 
of Security Hardware now 
substantially complete.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued 39
CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w STRa TEg IC REPORT
As required by provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors have taken into 
account forecasts to assess the future funding requirements of the Group,  
and compared them with the level of committed available borrowing facilities.
A period of three years has been adopted as 
this is the timeframe used by the Board in 
forming the Group’s strategy, in appraising 
material investments and in accessing 
financial viability. The assessment of viability 
has been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and future 
prospects, its strategy, its management of 
risk, and also the Board’s assessment of  
the outlook in the marketplace.
The Board considers its strategy and risks 
on strategy away days, and revisits these 
annually when considering the next year’s 
budget. The three-year plan considers 
revenue and earnings growth and how 
this impacts on cash flows and key ratios. 
Operational plans and financing options 
are considered as part of this process.
In preparing the plan, the Group adopts  
a prudent forecast in respect of like-for-like 
sales growth, but assumes other initiatives, 
such as expansion of the branch network, 
in line with the published strategy. The  
plan is stress tested by applying the 
following scenarios:
Scenario 1
Macro-economic conditions lead 
to a decline in sales
Decreases in revenues have been 
applied over the 3-year plan period.
Scenario 2
Commodity prices and/or 
exchange rates or raw material 
shortages lead to a sustained 
increase in resin prices
Increases in resin costs have been 
applied over the 3-year plan period.
Scenario 3
Scenario 1 and 2 combined 
There is a possibility that both of the 
above scenarios could materialise at 
the same time, therefore we have 
assessed the combined impact 
through the 3-year plan period.
The Board considers these tests to  
be sufficient to test the viability of the 
Group given the size of the Group  
and the markets it operates within.  
As described in Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties above, we have 
measures in place to help mitigate  
the impact of these events should  
they occur.
The Directors confirm that we have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group will continue in operation 
and meet their liabilities as they fall due  
in the next three years.
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the 
Company’s and the Group’s forecast  
and projections, which demonstrate that 
the Company and the Group will have 
sufficient headroom on their bank facilities 
for the foreseeable future and that the 
likelihood of breaching the related 
covenants in this period is remote.
Accordingly the Directors continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual Financial 
Statements.

Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report that, in our third year as a listed business, 
Eurocell has delivered more progress and continued to develop 
and improve its systems of governance and internal control.
This Corporate Governance Statement, together with the 
Reports of the Nomination, Audit and Risk and Remuneration 
Committees on pages 46 to 64, explain how our governance 
framework operates and how we apply the principles of 
business integrity, high ethical values and professionalism in all 
our activities. I hope that it provides you with a meaningful 
insight into how we operate and the matters on which we have 
focused during the year.
As a Board, we recognise that we are accountable to 
Shareholders for good corporate governance. We seek to 
promote consistently high standards of governance throughout the 
Group, which are recognised and understood by all.
Good governance involves good and effective leadership, robust 
systems and processes that are regularly tested, and a good 
understanding of risk appetite. The Board seeks to add value 
through guiding the strategy of the Group, constructive 
challenge and dialogue and through engagement with 
Shareholders and other stakeholders. Each Director continues 
to make a very valuable contribution to the Board.
This Corporate Governance Statement, which is part of the 
Directors’ Report, has been prepared in accordance with the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 
April 2016 (the ‘Code’), which the Board fully supports. The Code 
is published by the Financial Reporting Council and is available on 
its website at www.frc.org.uk.
I am committed to ensuring that the Company manages its 
affairs in compliance with the principles and provisions of the 
Code. I am pleased to report that the Board considers the 
Company to have complied with the relevant provisions of the 
Code throughout the year in all material respects. I can also 
confirm that, in the opinion of the Directors, this Annual Report 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Group’s position and prospects and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, 
business model and performance.
The Group’s strategy is outlined on pages 20 and 21 of the 
Strategic Report.
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the auditors 
in connection with the Financial Statements are explained in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 68 and 
Auditors’ Report pages 69 to 75.
I would like to thank my Board and management colleagues for 
their contributions to the governance of the Company. I look 
forward to working with them in 2018 to continue to build on the 
foundations and system of governance that we have established 
in support of our long-term objectives.
Bob Lawson

Corporate Governance Statement
Role of the Board
The Board comprises a Non-executive Chairman, three 
Non-executive Directors and two Executive Directors, who are 
equally and collectively responsible for the proper stewardship 
and leadership of the Company. Their biographical details are 
set out on pages 40 and 41.
The Code recommends that for companies beneath the  
FTSE 350, the Board should comprise at least two  
Non-executive Directors, who are determined by the Board  
to be independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could 
appear to affect, this judgement. The Company regards  
Martyn Coffey and Frank Nelson as ‘independent  
Non-executive Directors’ within the meaning of the Code.
The formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
consideration includes the following:
• Approval of the Group’s strategy, long-term objectives, 
annual operating budgets and capital expenditure plans.
• Approving transactions of significant value or major strategic 
importance, including acquisitions.
• Approving significant changes to the Group’s capital, 
corporate or management structure.
• Monitoring and assessing the overall effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management processes and internal control 
systems, including those related to health and safety, 
financial controls and anti-bribery policies and procedures.
• Approving the Annual and Half-Year Reports, including 
Financial Statements.
• Approving other corporate communications related to 
matters decided by the Board.
• Board appointments and succession planning and setting 
terms of reference for Board Committees. 
• Remuneration matters, including the general framework for 
remuneration and share and incentive schemes.
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the 
Nomination, Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees.
The Nomination Committee Report on page 46 explains  
how the Board and senior management appointments, 
succession planning and development are being addressed.
The Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 47 to 49 
provides details of how the Board applies the Code in relation to 
financial reporting, risk management and internal controls.
The Remuneration Committee Report on pages 50 to 64 gives 
details of Directors’ remuneration and policy.
Day-to-day management and the implementation of strategies 
agreed by the Board are delegated to the Executive Directors. 
The Board meets regularly to discuss key operational issues and 
prescribe actions as appropriate. The Group’s reporting 
structure below Board level is designed so that all decisions are 
made by those most qualified to do so in a timely manner.
Key to the structure is the Executive Committee (the ‘Steering 
Group’), comprising nine senior managers, including the two 
Executive Directors. Management teams report to members of 
the Steering Group, which meets each month.  
The Board receives regular updates from the Steering Group in 
relation to business issues and developments.
This structure enables the Board to make informed decisions on 
a range of key issues including strategy and risk management.
Role of the Chairman
The Board has concluded that the Chairman has met the 
independence criteria of the Code since appointment.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board 
functions effectively. He sets the agenda for Board meetings 
and ensures that adequate time is devoted to discussion of all 
agenda items, particularly strategic issues, facilitating the 
effective contribution of all Directors and ensuring that the Board 
as a whole is involved in the decision-making process.
Role of the Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer has principal responsibility for all 
operational activities and the day-to-day management of the 
business, in accordance with the strategies and policies approved 
by the Board. The Chief Executive also has responsibility for 
communicating to the Group’s employees the expectations of the 
Board in relation to culture, values and behaviours.
Role of the Senior Independent Director and  
Non-executive Directors
The Senior Independent Director has an important role on the 
Board, providing a sounding board for the Chairman, leading on 
corporate governance issues and serving as an intermediary for 
the other Non-executive Directors. He is available to 
Shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or 
other Executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which such 
contact is not appropriate.
All Non-executive Directors are required to allocate sufficient  
time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
The Non-executive Directors act in a way they consider will 
promote the long-term success of the Group for the benefit of, 
and with regard to the interests of its Shareholders.
Board composition, commitment and  
election of Directors
The Nomination Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments and makes recommendations to the Board.
On appointment, Board members, in particular the Chairman and 
the Non-executive Directors, disclose their other commitments 
and agree to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge 
their duties effectively and ensure that these other commitments 
do not affect their contribution.
The current Board commitments of all Directors are shown on 
pages 40 and 41. Their terms of appointment are reported on 
page 57. Directors’ length of service on the Board is set out in the 
table below. 44 EUROCELL PLC

The Company’s Articles of Association contain powers of 
removal, appointment, election and re-election of Directors  
and provide that all of the Directors must retire and may offer 
themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’).
At the upcoming AGM, all the Directors intend to offer 
themselves for re-election. We consider all the Directors to be 
effective, committed to their roles and to have sufficient time 
available to perform their duties.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
It is the Group’s intention that a performance evaluation of the 
Board and its Committees is undertaken on a periodic basis. 
Such a review considers the following:
• Effectiveness of the Board’s decision-making.
• Strategy development process.
• Board composition.
• Succession planning. 
• Risk and risk management systems.
• Culture.
The evaluation process is designed to stimulate thought and 
discussion, and includes consideration over the effectiveness of 
Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors and the Chairman. 
The Senior Independent Director separately reviews the Chairman’s 
performance with the other Non-executive Directors. The results of 
the evaluation are considered by the Chairman and discussed by 
the Board.
The Board believes that the evaluation process described above 
is thorough, robust and works well. All Directors are expected to 
engage fully, with a genuine desire to enhance overall Board 
performance. The process includes sufficient objectivity and 
confidentiality to ensure that challenge is acknowledged and 
acted upon.
The first internal evaluation was undertaken in 2015 as part of 
the Group’s IPO process. In the light of changes to the Board 
post IPO, with a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer joining the Group in 2016, no review was carried out in 
2017. However, in accordance with the Code, an external 
evaluation of the Board will be carried out every three years by 
an independent third-party facilitator. Such an external 
evaluation is currently in progress and the results will be 
included in next year’s Annual Report.
Taking all of the above into account, the Board is satisfied that 
the composition of the Board and its Committees provides an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge to allow the Board and its Committees to discharge 
their duties and responsibilities effectively and in line with the 
Code.
Board meetings and attendance
There were six regular Board meetings scheduled during 2017,  
four meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, two meetings  
of the Remuneration Committee and two meetings of the 
Nomination Committee. Non-executive Directors also attended 
site visits.
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are usually 
invited to attend Audit and Risk Committee meetings, although 
the Audit and Risk Committee also meets with the external 
auditor without any Executive Director being present. The Chief 
Executive is invited to attend Remuneration Committee 
meetings when appropriate. The Company Secretary is also 
Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and the Audit and 
Risk Committee, and attends meetings for this purpose.

The Company Secretary
All the Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary has responsibility  
for ensuring that all Board procedures are followed and for advising 
the Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters.  
The Company Secretary provides updates to the Board on 
regulatory and corporate governance issues, new legislation, and 
Directors’ duties and obligations. The appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved for the Board.
Whenever necessary, Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. Board 
Committees are provided with sufficient resources to undertake 
their duties, including the option to appoint external advisers 
when they deem it appropriate.
Board induction, development and support
New Directors receive a formal induction on joining the Board, 
which covers Group policies and other key information. Tailored 
training may be arranged to meet individual needs, for example 
to refresh knowledge of the Listing Rules and regulatory 
compliance. Typically, a new Director will meet the Chairman 
and other Non-executive Directors in one-on-one sessions; he 
or she will have meetings with key management, briefings with 
external advisers and Shareholders, and a programme of site 
visits will be arranged at which the Director meets site-based 
staff to gain a full understanding of the business.

Looking forward, it is the Company’s expectation that training 
will be built in to the annual Board programme, designed to 
incorporate a range of in-depth topics of particular relevance to 
the business. Training needs will be identified through the Board 
evaluation process and through individual reviews between the 
Directors and the Chairman. Directors are expected to attend 
external courses and seminars as appropriate to maintain and 
develop their Board competencies.
During 2017, there were Board briefings relating to changes to 
financial reporting and corporate governance (including health 
and safety regulations and business continuity planning). There 
were also individual meetings between Non-executive Directors 
and senior managers relating to areas of particular interest.
Engagement with Shareholders
The Board considers that communications with Shareholders are 
extremely important. Now in our third year as a listed business,  
we have developed open and frequent dialogue with investors. 
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with 
major Shareholders and potential investors to discuss the Group’s 
performance, strategic issues and Shareholder investment 
objectives. We also periodically arrange site visits for investors.
Alongside the Annual and Half-Year Results, the Group follows a 
regular reporting and announcement schedule to ensure that 
matters of importance affecting the Group are communicated to 
investors. In addition, in 2017 the Group launched a much improved 
investor website: investors.eurocell.co.uk
During 2017 , a total of approximately 87 investor meetings were 
held, at which at least 57 institutions were represented. Feedback 
from these meetings and other Shareholder communications are 
provided to the Board. The Board also receives copies of analysts’ 
and brokers’ briefings.
The Chairman is available to meet with institutional Shareholders 
to discuss governance and strategy and gain an understanding of 
Shareholder views and concerns. The Chairman ensures that the 
views of Shareholders are communicated to the Board as a 
whole. The Senior Independent Director and other Non-executive 
Directors are also available to meet Shareholders separately if 
requested.
Risk management and internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives, and for the Group’s system of 
internal control.
The Board has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls, for the 
period covered by this Annual Report.
The Strategic Report comments in detail (pages 34 to 38) on the 
nature of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group; 
in particular those that would threaten our business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity and the measures in 
place to mitigate them. In conducting its review, the Board has 
included a robust assessment of these risks, and the 
effectiveness of mitigating controls.
The Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 47 to 49 
describes the internal control system and how it is managed 
and monitored.
The Board confirms that no significant failings or weaknesses were 
identified in relation to the review. The Board also acknowledges 
that such systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Statement of compliance with the Code
This Corporate Governance Statement, together with the 
Nominations Committee Report, the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report and the Remuneration Committee Report, provide a 
description of how the main principles of the Code have been 
applied within Eurocell during 2017.
It is the Board’s view that Eurocell was in compliance with the 
relevant provisions set out in the Code in all material respects.
This statement complies with sub sections 2.1, 2.2(1), 2.3(1), 2.5, 
2.7 and 2.10 of Rule 7 of the Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The information 
required to be disclosed by sub-section 2.60 of Rule 7 is shown 
on pages 65 to 67.
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM will be held at Fairbrook House on 18 May 2018.
The notice of our AGM, together with the Directors’ voting 
recommendations on the resolutions to be proposed, is included 
on a separate circular to Shareholders and will be dispatched at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. The notice will be 
available to view at investors.eurocell.co.uk.
All Directors attend the AGM, including the Chairs of the Audit and 
Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, who are available 
to answer questions. The Board welcomes questions from 
Shareholders who have an opportunity to raise issues informally or 
formally before or during the meeting.
For each proposed resolution, the proxy appointment forms 
provide Shareholders with the option to direct their proxy vote 
either for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote.  
The proxy form and any announcement of the results of a vote 
make it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will 
not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes 
for and against the resolution.
All valid proxy appointments are properly recorded and counted 
by Equiniti, the Company Registrars. Information on the number 
of shares represented by proxy, the proxy votes for and against 
each resolution, and the number of shares in respect of which 
the vote was withheld for each resolution, together with the 
proxy voting result, are given at the AGM. The total votes cast, 
including those at the AGM are published on our website 
(investors.eurocell.co.uk) immediately after the meeting. 46 EUROCELL PLC

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of activities
The areas of particular focus for the Committee in 2017, and up 
to the date of this Annual Report, were as follows:
• Reviewed the 2016 and 2017 Annual Reports, as well as the 
2017 Half-Year Report.
• Considered information presented by management on 
significant accounting estimates and judgements adopted in 
respect of the Group’s 2016 and 2017 Financial Statements 
and the 2017 Half-Year Report.
• Reviewed reports from the external auditors’ setting out their 
findings as a result of their audits for the years ended 31 
December 2016 and 2017, as well as their review of the 2017 
Half-Year Report.
• Reviewed the external auditors’ plan for their audit for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
• Reviewed documentation prepared to support the viability 
statement and going concern assumption set out on page 39.
• Considered the impact of new accounting standards and 
financial reporting requirements, including guidance issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). 
• Considered reports by management related to the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk management 
and internal control.
• Reviewed the Group’s risk register.
• Considered reports prepared by the Group’s outsourced 
internal audit function.
• Reviewed and updated the Group’s Whistleblowing and 
Anti-bribery policies.
The Committee is kept up to date with changes to accounting 
standards and developments in financial reporting, company 
law and other regulatory matters through presentations from the 
external auditors’, Chief Financial Officer and the Company’s 
Finance function.
Key accounting estimates and judgements
As described above, the Committee reviewed the key estimates 
and judgements used in the preparation of the Group’s 2017 
Financial Statements. These were as follows:
Inventory valuation
The Committee critically reviewed the carrying value of the 
Group’s inventory, particularly with regard to management’s 
assessment of the appropriate level of provisioning against 
obsolescence as at 31 December 2017. This review was 
undertaken in the context of current trading and the forecast  
for the next financial year. The Committee concurred with 
management’s assessment of the carrying value of Group 
inventory. The Committee noted that there continues to be 
considerable management focus on both the optimisation of 
finished goods inventory levels and, looking forward, on the 
operational controls over the management of inventory.
Accounts receivable recoverability
The Committee considered and critically evaluated the Group’s 
methodology with respect to setting provisions for potential bad 
and doubtful debts, as well as the absolute level of provisions 
held as at 31 December 2017. The review took into account the 
specific nature and characteristics of customers in the Group’s 
two major divisions. The Committee is satisfied that the current 
level of provisions is appropriate.
Provisions for dilapidations on leased properties
The Group currently operates with 190 branches, each of which 
is situated in a leased property. Leases are typically for five years, 
with a three-year break clause. The Committee undertook a 
review of the methodology used to estimate the liability for 
remedial works that may arise with respect to the Group’s 
leasehold properties, as well as the absolute level of provision 
held and amounts utilised. The Committee is satisfied that the 
current level of provision is reasonable.
Carrying value of intangible assets
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are assessed 
at least annually, or when an indication of impairment arises. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to 
sell), the asset is written down. The Committee is satisfied that 
the key estimates applied to assess the recoverable amounts are 
reasonable. Further details on impairment along with the key 
estimates are provided in Note 16.
Risk management
The Group’s risk management processes are set out in detail on 
pages 34 to 35.
The Group maintains a written risk register that identifies key 
risks, the probability of those risks occurring and the impact 
they would have on the Group if unmitigated. Against each 
gross risk, the controls that exist to manage and, where 
possible, minimise or eliminate those risks are also listed, and  
an assessment of net risk is provided. The risk register also 
identifies any further actions required such that net residual risk 
is consistent with the risk appetite set by the Board. The register 
is regularly updated to reflect changes in circumstances.
The Group, established a Risk Management Committee early  
in 2017, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. This Committee 
reviews the most significant risks and the status of related 
mitigating actions each month, with other risks reviewed on a 
cyclical basis.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews the risk register twice 
per year to ensure the timely identification and robust 
management of inherent and emerging risks taking place.  
To the extent that any failings or weaknesses are identified 
during the review process, appropriate measures are taken  
to remedy these.

FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w OvER vIE w CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE STRa TEg IC REPORT
Information relating to the management of risks and any 
changes to the assessment of key risks is reported by the  
Audit and Risk Committee to the Board.
Internal controls
The Group has an established internal control framework, the 
key features of which include clearly defined reporting lines and 
authorisation limits and a comprehensive budget and monthly 
reporting system. The schedule of authorisation limits was 
updated in December 2016, to reflect the development of the 
business since its IPO, and approved by the Board.
The internal control framework governs the internal financial 
reporting process of the business, with checks and balances 
built into the system that are designed to reduce the likelihood 
of material error or fraud.
The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of 
internal controls on an ongoing basis, primarily by reviewing 
reports from senior management.
Internal audit
In order to further enhance the internal control and risk 
management processes, the Group implemented an outsourced 
internal audit function in March 2017. Following a formal tender 
process the Company appointed KPMG to fulfil this role.  
The Committee worked with KPMG to set the programme for 
internal audit in 2017, which included reviews over the Group’s 
risk management systems, payroll, cyber security, GDPR 
readiness and management’s branch audit process.
External audit and auditors’ independence
The Audit and Risk Committee has primary responsibility for 
making a recommendation to the Board on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external auditors’. It keeps 
under review the scope and results of the audit, its cost 
effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the 
auditors’. There are no contractual obligations restricting our 
choice of external auditors.
The Group’s current auditors’ PwC were appointed at the Audit and 
Risk Committee meeting on 29 April 2015, following the Company’s 
IPO. PwC has processes in place designed to maintain 
independence, including regular rotation of the audit partner. 
The Committee has also adopted policies to safeguard the 
independence of its external auditors’. Any work awarded to the 
external auditors’ with a value of more than £5,000 in aggregate  
in any financial year, other than an audit, requires the specific 
approval of the Committee. Where the Committee perceives 
that the independence of the auditors’ could be compromised, 
the work will not be awarded to it. Details of amounts paid  
to PwC for audit and audit related assurance services in 2017 
are set out on page 88.
An annual review of external audit effectiveness is undertaken 
by the Committee.
Whistleblowing and bribery
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors any reported incidents 
under our whistleblowing policy, which is available to all 
employees. This policy sets out the procedure for employees to 
raise legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing without fear of 
criticism, discrimination or reprisal. No matters were raised 
under the policy during 2017.
The Audit and Risk Committee also takes responsibility for 
reviewing the policies and procedures adopted by the Group to 
prevent bribery. The Group is committed to a zero-tolerance 
position with regard to bribery. The Committee is satisfied  
that the Group’s procedures with respect to these matters  
are adequate.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
2017. The report is split into two parts:
• Part A: The Directors’ Remuneration Policy – which provides 
a summary of the remuneration policy for which Shareholder 
approval was obtained at the 2016 AGM and which will 
continue to apply without amendment for the forthcoming 
year; and
• Part B: The Annual Report on Remuneration – which sets out 
payments and awards made to the Directors and details the 
link between Company performance and remuneration for 
2017 and how the policy will be operated for 2018.
As no changes are proposed to the existing policy, only one 
remuneration resolution will be tabled at the 2018 AGM i.e. the 
advisory Shareholder vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Work of the committee during the year
The Committee met two times during 2017. The main 
Committee activities during the year (full details of which are set 
out in the relevant sections of this report) included:
• Agreeing the performance against the targets and payout for 
the 2016 annual bonus awards.
• Agreeing Executive Director base salary increases from 
1 April 2017.
• Setting the performance targets for the 2017 annual bonus.
• Agreeing the award levels and earnings per share and 
operating cash flow targets for the 2017 PSP awards.
• Approving awards under the Eurocell Save As You Earn 
Scheme (including awards to the two Executive Directors).
• Approving the vesting of Mark Kelly’s buyout share award at 
the 12-month anniversary of grant.
Pay for Performance
As described in earlier sections of this Annual Report, our senior 
management team delivered very good progress against our 
strategic priorities in 2017. Further, against a more challenging 
economic backdrop, the business reported robust financial 
results and another consistent operational performance.
Sales growth was good at 8% (excluding acquisitions), with 
market share gains across the Group. Profitability was solid, 
having been impacted by a subdued Repair, Maintenance and 
Improvements (‘RMI’) market and especially by higher raw 
material cost inflation. Where possible, the team mitigated 
pricing pressure with selling price increases, but the market 
does lag supplier rises so there is a delay in capturing the 
benefit. However, management also delivered on initiatives 
which increased significantly the use of recycled material in  
our manufacturing operations, in order to further alleviate  
cost inflation. 
In addition, the business made significant investments in 2017, 
including opening 31 new branches and progressing capital 
expenditure to expand our recycling capability. Management

Role and Responsibilities:
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• Recommend to the Board the remuneration strategy and 
framework for the Chairman, Executive Directors and 
senior managers. 
• Determine, within that framework, the individual 
remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors 
and senior managers. 
• Oversee any major changes in employee benefit 
structures throughout the Group. 51
FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w OvER vIE w CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE STRa TEg IC REPORT
believes these investments leave the Group well placed to 
deliver further gains in market share and more control of  
material costs in the future.
This performance has been reflected in the payments made  
to the Executive Directors under the Annual Bonus Plan, 
amounting to 40% of salary. Performance against the adjusted 
profit before tax element of the bonus resulted in a bonus of 
42% of that element (i.e. approx. 30% of salary) while 
performance against the cash flow element of the bonus 
resulted in a bonus of 33% of that element (i.e. approx. 10%  
of salary). In addition, the health and safety underpin was 
considered satisfied.
Further details of these bonus pay-outs (including information 
regarding performance against the relevant targets and the 
operation of the deferred share element of the plan) can be 
found on page 60 and 61 of this report.
No Performance Share Plan (‘PSP') awards vested during the 
year (the first vestings for the current Executive Directors are 
due to take place in 2019 based on EPS and operating cash 
flow performance over the three years to 31 December 2018).
Summary of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy
At the AGM on 19 May 2016, we put our Remuneration Policy  
to Shareholders for a binding vote. We were very pleased to receive 
unanimous approval for the policy. We do not propose making any 
changes to the policy this year. Therefore, the main elements of  
the Executive Directors’ packages will remain as follows:
• Base salaries
 Salary levels (as well as overall remuneration opportunity)  
will be positioned to reflect experience and responsibility. 
Mark Kelly’s and Michael Scott’s current salaries are 
£367,200 and £234,600 respectively. In line with other 
Eurocell employees, with effect from 1 April 2018, these 
salaries will be increased by 2%.
• Pensions/benefits 
 A defined contribution/salary supplement of 15% of salary 
will continue to be offered, together with a standard suite of  
other benefits.
• Annual bonus 
 The maximum annual bonus remains at 100% of salary.  
For 2018, reflecting Eurocell’s underlying strategy, 70% of the 
bonus will be based on adjusted profit before tax and 30% 
will be based on cash flow targets. The targets will be subject 
to a health and safety underpin. Up to 50% of any bonus 
earned is normally deferred into shares for three years.
• Long-term incentives
 PSP awards are expected to be made in April 2018.  
Award levels will be set at 100% of salary for Mark Kelly and 
Michael Scott. Performance targets will be based on three 
year earnings per share growth (two-thirds of the award)  
and cash flow (one-third) targets.
The Committee believes that the above approach takes due 
account of market and best practice and, importantly, also 
reflects and supports Eurocell’s strategy and promotes the 
Company’s long-term success.
Format of this Report and matters to be approved  
at our AGM
Notwithstanding the fact that: (i) we will not be seeking 
Shareholder approval for any changes to our Remuneration 
Policy at the 2018 AGM; and (ii) the relevant Regulations do not 
require us to reproduce our Remuneration Policy in this report; 
for ease of reference we have decided to include a summary of 
our policy in addition to the Annual Report on Remuneration 
section of the report (in respect of which we will be holding an 
advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM). The full Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy was disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report.
I hope that you will continue to show support for our approach 
to remuneration at Eurocell. Should you have any queries  
or comments, please feel free to contact me at

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Explanatory foreword
This report contains the material required to be set out as the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the purposes of Part 4 of  
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2016 AGM. We are not proposing to make any changes to this policy, which will continue 
to apply for the forthcoming year. For ease of reference, we have set out in Part A below the key features of our policy. The full, 
formal policy is as disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report, which is available on the Company’s website.
Part B constitutes the Annual Report on Remuneration. The auditors have reported on certain parts of the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and stated whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. Those parts which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated.
PART A: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The following table summarises the key aspects of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy:
Executive Directors
Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Base salary
This is the core element of 
pay and reflects the 
individual’s role and 
position within the Group 
with some adjustment to 
reflect their capability and 
contribution.
Base salaries will be reviewed each year 
by the Committee.
The Committee does not strictly follow 
data, but uses the median position (as 
against appropriate size and/or sector 
peers) as a reference point in considering, 
in its judgement, the appropriate level of 
salary having regard to other relevant 
factors including corporate and individual 
performance and any changes in an 
individual’s role and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
It is anticipated that salary 
increases will generally be in 
line with those awarded to 
salaried employees. However, 
in certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, 
changes in role and 
responsibilities, market levels, 
individual and Company 
performance), the Committee 
may make larger salary 
increases to ensure they are 
market competitive. The 
rationale for any such increase 
will be disclosed in the 
relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
n/a
Benefits
To provide benefits valued 
by recipients.
The Executive Directors can receive a car 
allowance or company car, private family 
medical cover, permanent health 
insurance and life assurance.
The Committee reserves discretion to 
introduce new benefits where it concludes 
that it is appropriate to do so, having 
regard to the particular circumstances and 
to market practice.
Where appropriate, the Company will 
meet certain costs relating to Executive 
Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe 
the likely change in the cost of 
insured benefits or the cost of 
some of the other reported 
benefits year-to-year, but the 
provision of benefits will 
operate within an annual limit 
of £100,000 (plus a further 
100% of base salary in the 
case of relocations).
The Committee will monitor 
the costs of benefits in 
practice and will ensure that 
the overall costs do not 
increase by more than the 
Committee considers 
appropriate in all the 
circumstances.

Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Pension
To provide retirement 
benefits.
Executive Directors can receive pension 
contributions to personal pension 
arrangements or, if a Director is impacted 
by annual or lifetime limits on contribution 
levels to qualifying pension plans, the 
balance can be paid as a cash 
supplement.
The maximum employer’s 
contribution is limited to up to 
15% of base salary.
n/a
Annual Bonus Plan
To motivate executives and 
incentivise delivery of 
performance over a 
one-year operating cycle, 
focusing on the short-to-
medium-term elements of 
our strategic aims.
Annual Bonus Plan levels and the 
appropriateness of measures are reviewed 
annually at the commencement of each 
financial year to ensure they continue to 
support our strategy.
Once set, performance measures and 
targets will generally remain unchanged 
for the year, except to reflect events such 
as corporate acquisitions or other 
significant events where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary in its opinion 
to make appropriate adjustments.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes can be paid 
in a mix of cash and deferred shares 
granted under the Company’s Deferred 
Share Plan (‘DSP’), following the 
determination of achievement against 
performance measures and targets.
Awards under the DSP are deferred for 
such periods as the Committee selects at 
grant, which will not normally be less than 
(but may be longer than) three years and 
are subject to continued employment.
Where an element of bonus is payable as 
deferred shares under the DSP, individuals 
may be able to receive a dividend 
equivalent in cash or shares equal to the 
value of dividends which would have been 
paid during the vesting period.
Clawback and malus provisions apply to 
the Annual Bonus Plan and DSP, as 
explained in more detail in the notes to the 
policy table, as disclosed in the 2015 
Annual Report.
The maximum level of  
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes 
is 100% of base salary per 
annum for the duration of  
this policy.
The performance 
measures applied may be 
financial or non-financial 
and corporate, divisional 
or individual and in such 
proportions as the 
Committee considers 
appropriate.
Attaining the threshold 
level of performance for 
any measure will not 
produce a pay-out of 
more than 20% of the 
maximum portion of 
overall annual bonus 
attributable to that 
measure, with a sliding 
scale to full pay-out for 
maximum performance.
However, the Annual 
Bonus Plan remains a 
discretionary arrangement 
and the Committee retains 
a standard power to apply 
its judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the Annual 
Bonus Plan for any 
performance measure 
(from zero to any cap) 
should it consider that to 
be appropriate. 54 EUROCELL PLC

Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures
Long-term incentives
To motivate and incentivise 
delivery of sustained 
performance over the long 
term, and to promote 
alignment with 
Shareholders’ interests, the 
Company operates the 
Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’).
Awards under the PSP take the form of 
nil-cost options which vest to the extent 
performance conditions are satisfied over 
a period of at least three years.
Under the PSP plan rules, vested awards 
may also be settled in cash.
The PSP rules allow that the number of 
shares subject to vested PSP awards may 
be increased to reflect the value of 
dividends that would have been paid in 
respect of any ex-dividend dates falling 
between the grant of awards and the 
expiry of any vesting period.
Malus and clawback provisions apply to 
PSP awards and are explained in more 
detail in the notes to the policy table, as 
disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report.
The PSP allows for awards 
over shares with a maximum 
value of 150% of base salary 
per financial year.
The Committee expressly 
reserves discretion to make 
such awards as it considers 
appropriate within these limits.
The Committee may set 
such performance 
conditions on PSP awards 
as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or 
non-financial and whether 
corporate, divisional or 
individual).
Performance periods may 
be over such periods as 
the Committee selects at 
grant, which will not 
normally be less than (but 
may be longer than) three 
years.
No more than 25% of 
awards vest for attaining 
the threshold level of 
performance conditions.
Share ownership 
guidelines
To further align the 
interests of Executive 
Directors with those of 
Shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to build 
up a prescribed level of shareholding 
within five years of commencement of 
employment (or such longer period as the 
Committee may determine). 
100% of base salary for all 
Executive Directors.
The Committee reserves the 
power to amend (but not 
reduce) these levels in future 
years. 
n/a
All-employee  
share plans
To encourage share 
ownership by employees, 
thereby allowing them to 
share in the long-term 
success of the Group and 
align their interests with 
those of the Shareholders. 
These are all-employee share plans 
established under HMRC tax-advantaged 
regimes and follow the usual form for  
such plans.
Executive Directors will be able to 
participate in all-employee share plans  
on the same terms as other Group 
employees. 
The maximum participation 
levels for all-employee share 
plans will be the limits for such 
plans set by HMRC from time 
to time.
Consistent with normal 
practice, such awards will 
not be subject to 
performance conditions.

Chairman/Non-
executive Director fees
To enable the Company to 
recruit and retain Chairmen 
and Non-executive 
Directors of the highest 
calibre, at the appropriate 
cost.
The fees paid to the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors aim to be 
competitive with other fully listed 
companies of equivalent size and 
complexity. 
The fees payable to the Non-executive 
Directors are determined by the Board, 
with the Chairman’s fees determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. Fees are 
paid monthly in cash.
The Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors will not participate in any new 
cash or share incentive arrangements 
from admission. 
The Company reserves the right to provide 
benefits (including travel and office 
support) to the Chairman and Non-
executive Directors.
Any increases actually made 
will be appropriately 
disclosed.
The aggregate fees (and any 
benefits) of the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors will 
not exceed the limit from time 
to time prescribed within the 
Company’s Articles of 
Association for such fees 
(currently £325,000 per 
annum in aggregate).
If the Chairman and/or 
Non-executive Directors 
devote special attention to the 
business of the Company, or 
otherwise perform services 
which in the opinion of the 
Directors are outside the 
scope of the ordinary duties of 
a Director, they may be paid 
such additional remuneration 
as the Directors or any 
Committee authorised by the 
Directors may determine.

Other elements of our policy include:
Recruitment Remuneration Policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and 
promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package  
for a new Executive Director, the starting point for 
the Committee will be to apply the general policy 
for Executive Directors as set out above and 
structure a package in accordance with that 
policy. Any caps contained within the policy for 
fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although 
the Committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan, DSP and PSP will 
operate (including the maximum award levels) as 
detailed in the general policy in relation to any 
newly appointed Executive Director. For an 
internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to 
reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the 
Committee may agree that the Company will 
meet certain relocation expenses as it considers 
appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in 
connection with the recruitment to buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on 
leaving a previous employer.
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal cap.  
Any recruitment-related awards which are not buy-outs will be subject to the 
limits for Annual Bonus Plan and PSP as stated in the general policy. Details of 
any recruitment-related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in the view of the 
Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver 
any such awards under the terms of the existing Annual Bonus Plan, DSP or 
PSP. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on 
terms that are more bespoke than the existing Annual Bonus Plan, DSP or PSP.
All buy-outs, whether under the Annual Bonus Plan, DSP, PSP or otherwise, will 
take due account of the service obligations and performance requirements for 
any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous 
employer. The Committee will seek (where it is practicable to do so) to make 
buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect 
of service and performance. However, the Committee may choose to relax this 
requirement in certain cases (such as where the service and/or performance 
requirements are materially completed, or where such factors are, in the view of 
the Committee, reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to 
the face value of the awards forfeited) and where the Committee considers it to 
be in the interests of Shareholders.
A new Chairman/Non-executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for such Directors.
Service contracts
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is that each Executive Director’s service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination 
upon no more than 12 months’ notice by either party. The service agreements of both Executive Directors comply with that policy. 
Contracts contain provisions allowing the Company to make payments in lieu of notice (albeit not including bonus or benefits) but 
do not contain change of control provisions.
The Committee reserves flexibility to alter these principles if necessary to secure the recruitment of an appropriate candidate and,  
if appropriate, introduce a longer initial notice period (of up to two years) reducing over time.
The date of each Executive Director’s contract is:

Chairman/Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and each Non-executive Director is engaged for an initial period of three years. These appointments can be renewed 
following the initial three-year term. These engagements can be terminated by either party on twelve months’ notice.
Neither the Chairman nor any Non-executive Directors can participate in the Company’s incentive plans, are not entitled to any 
pension benefits and are not entitled to any payment in compensation for early termination of their appointment beyond the twelve 
months’ notice referred to above.

The Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment are available for Shareholders to view from the Company Secretary 
on request.
Termination/change of control policy summary
It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatments on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and 
circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any 
treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan, 
DSP and PSP. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised in the table below:
Incentives
If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’; for example, leaving 
through injury, ill-health, disability, retirement, redundancy, sale of 
business or otherwise at the discretion of the Committee If a leaver is not a ‘good leaver’ Change in control
Annual Bonus  
Plan
Committee has discretion to determine an annual 
bonus which may be limited to the period actually 
worked.
Annual bonus generally 
paid.
Committee has discretion to 
determine annual bonus.
Deferred Share  
Plan
Awards normally vest either on cessation or the 
normal vesting date. The Committee can pro-rate 
awards if considered appropriate.
All awards will normally 
lapse.
Awards vest on a pro rata 
basis, unless the Committee 
determines not to pro-rate.
Performance  
Share Plan
Will receive a pro-rated award subject to the 
application of the performance conditions at the 
end of the normal performance period.
Committee retains standard discretions to either 
vary/disapply time pro-rating or to accelerate 
vesting to the earlier date of cessation (determining 
the performance conditions at that time).
All awards will normally 
lapse.
Will receive a pro-rated 
award subject to the 
application of the 
performance conditions at 
the date of the event, unless 
the Committee determines 
not to pro-rate.
On death, Annual Bonus Plan, DSP and PSP awards typically vest in full (with pro-rating also potentially applying).
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal 
claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, the Company may 
make a contribution towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement.  
Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not 
include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments. 58 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other policy matters
The 2015 Annual Report also set out formal details of our approach to:
• Travel and hospitality;
• Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration for other employees;
• Committee discretions;
• External appointments;
• Considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group;
• The operation of malus and clawback in relation to the PSP and annual bonus; and
• How the views of Shareholders are taken into account. 
The Committee is mindful of ongoing debate regarding the publication of ratios comparing CEO to employee pay. The Committee 
does not at present consider it appropriate to publish such data in this report as it is concerned that no common methodology has 
yet been established amongst UK companies and their investors for these comparisons. The Company’s expectation is that it will 
publish ratios showing comparisons in future years when, as can be expected, UK regulations or guidance develop a common 
methodology.

PART B: THE ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
 
The Committee (unaudited information)
The members of the Remuneration Committee are:
Martyn Coffey (Chairman)
Bob Lawson
Frank Nelson
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• Recommend to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior managers. 
• Determine, within that framework, the individual remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and senior managers. 
• Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group. 
The Chief Executive Officer is invited to attend meetings of the Committee, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, 
and the Chief Financial Officer and other Executive and Non-executive Directors attend meetings as required. Bob Lawson takes 
no part in any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee met two times during the year, with all members of the Committee present at these meetings.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which can be viewed on the Company’s website (investors.eurocell.co.uk).
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (‘FIT’), signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, are appointed 
by the Committee and provide advice to the Committee on all matters relating to remuneration, including best practice. FIT 
provided no other services to the Group and, accordingly, the Committee was satisfied that the advice provided by FIT was 
objective and independent. FIT’s fees in respect of 2017 were £8,824 (excluding VAT). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of the 
firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided. 60 EUROCELL PLC

Notes:
(1) Taxable benefits comprise car allowance, private family medical cover, permanent health insurance and life assurance. 
(2) Mark Kelly was appointed to the Board with effect from 29 March 2016 and was appointed Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 May 2016. Other in 2017 relates to the value 
of the recruitment award over 123,864 Eurocell plc shares granted on 28 June 2016 in connection with an amount forfeited on cessation of employment with his previous 
employer. The award vested after the expiry of a 12-month deferral period and was subject to continued employment but no other performance conditions. The value of the shares 
is based on the closing Eurocell share price on the date of vesting. While the buyout award also included the potential payment of £200,000 in cash, this amount was ultimately 
forfeited by Mr. Kelly and therefore no compensation was payable by Eurocell for this cash part of the buyout.
(3) Michael Scott was appointed Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 September 2016.
(4) Patrick Bateman resigned with effect from 30 June 2016. 
(5) Matthew Edwards left the Company with effect from 30 June 2016. Other in 2016 relates to payments for legal fees and other expenses made to Mr Edwards in connection with 
his settlement agreement. 
The aggregate emoluments (being salary/fees, bonuses, benefits and pension allowances) of all Directors for 2017 was £1,544,000 
(2016: £1,434,000).
Further information on the 2017 annual bonus (audited)
In 2017, the annual bonus metrics were a blend of targets relating to adjusted profit before tax (70% of the bonus opportunity)  
and cash flow (30% of the bonus opportunity). In addition, a health and safety adjustment underpin applied which, if not achieved,  
could reduce the bonus pay-out.
CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 61
FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS OvER vIE w OvER vIE w CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE STRa TEg IC REPORT
More particularly, the adjusted profit before tax and cash flow bonus targets were as follows:
£m Threshold Target Maximum Actual
Pay-out
(% of max)
Adjusted Profit before Tax 23.6 24.8 26.7 24.5 42
Cash flow 28.1 29.6 31.8 28.8 33
Performance against the adjusted profit before tax element of the bonus resulted in a bonus of 42% of that element (i.e. approx. 
30% of salary).
Performance against the cash flow element of the bonus resulted in a bonus of 33% of that element (i.e. approx. 10% of salary).
The health and safety underpin was also considered satisfied.
In total, this results in a total bonus pay-out of 40% of salary. 
50% of the annual bonus paid to Mark Kelly and Michael Scott will be deferred into shares under the DSP.

Performance graph and CEO remuneration table (unaudited)
The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance of an investment of £100 in Eurocell plc’s shares  
from its listing in March 2015 to the end of the period, compared with a £100 investment in the FTSE SmallCap Index over the  
same period. The FTSE SmallCap Index was chosen as a comparator because it represents a broad equity market index of similar  
sized companies.
TSR Index
The table below details certain elements of the CEO’s remuneration over the same period as presented in the TSR Index graph:

and operating cash flow (30% of the bonus opportunity) targets.

of pay-out. In addition, a health and safety adjustment underpin will apply which, if not achieved, could reduce the bonus pay-out.
• Up to 50% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years. 
• Given the competitive nature of the Company’s sector, the specific performance targets for 2018 are considered to be

cash flow (one-third) targets. 
• Full details of these targets will be disclosed in next year’s report, with these targets no less challenging in relative terms than the 
targets applied to the 2017 PSP awards.

certain information required to be included in the Directors’ 
Report has been included in the Strategic Report, which is set

the Group’s strategy, business model, likely future developments 
and risk management.
UK Corporate Governance Code
Matters related to corporate governance and our compliance 
with the Code are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 43 to 45, which is incorporated herein  
by reference.
Results
Our Financial Statements for year ended 31 December 2017 are 
set out on pages 69 to 109. The Financial Statements should be 
read in conjunction with the Chief Executive’s Review, Divisional 
Reviews and the Group Financial Review.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.0 pence  
(2016: 5.7 pence) per share which, together with the interim 
dividend of 3.0 pence (2016: 2.8 pence) per share, makes a 
combined dividend of 9.0 pence (2016: 8.5 pence) per share.
Payment of the final dividend, if approved at the Annual General 
Meeting, will be made on 23 May 2018 to Shareholders 
registered at the close of business on 27 April 2018.  
The ex-dividend date will be 26 April 2018.

of the 2016 final dividend of 5.7 pence per share and the 2017 
interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share, which were paid in May 
and October 2017 respectively.
Tax governance
Our tax policy is set out below. It is determined by the Board 
and overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee. The Board 
reviews the policy, and our compliance with it, on an annual 
basis. Operational responsibility for the execution of the Group’s 
tax policy rests with the Chief Financial Officer, who reports the 
Group’s tax position to the Audit and Risk Committee on a 
regular basis.
Tax Policy
We are committed to compliance with tax law and practice in 
the UK. Compliance for us means paying the amount of tax  
we are legally obliged to pay and doing so at the right time.  
It involves disclosing all relevant facts and circumstances to  
the UK tax authorities and claiming appropriate reliefs and 
incentives where available.
Risk management
The level of risk that we accept in relation to UK tax is consistent 
with our overall objective of achieving certainty in the Group’s tax 
affairs. At all times, we seek to comply fully with our regulatory 
and other obligations, and to act in a way that upholds our core 
values and reputation as a responsible corporate citizen. We see 
compliance with tax legislation as key to managing tax risk, and 
understand the importance of tax in the wider context of business 
decisions.
Processes have been put in place to ensure tax is considered as 
part of our overall decision-making processes, with tax risks 
managed by local finance teams and escalated through to 
appropriate levels of management and, ultimately, to the Board 
when necessary.
Tax planning
In structuring our commercial activities, we will always consider, 
among other factors, the relevant tax laws. We believe that it is 
fair to mitigate tax using generally available reliefs in the spirit in 
which they are intended. However, any tax planning that we 
undertake will have commercial and economic substance and 
we will not use aggressive tax planning or enter into complicated 
tax avoidance schemes.
Engaging with HMRC
We aim to have a good working relationship with HMRC. We will 
engage with honesty and integrity, and in a spirit of cooperative 
compliance. We will make all returns and pay tax on a timely 
basis, across all types of tax.
Share Capital
Details of our issued share capital, including movements during the 
year, are shown in Note 23 to the Financial Statements. We have one 
class of ordinary shares, which carries no fixed income. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at our general meetings. The ordinary 
shares are listed on the Official List and traded on the London  
Stock Exchange.
As at 31 December 2017, we had 100,137,186  
(2016: 100,000,000) ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each  
in nominal value in issue (the ‘issued share capital’).

attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, to 
appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights.
Whilst the Board has the power under the Articles of Association 
to refuse to register a transfer of shares, there are no such 
restrictions on the transfer of shares in place.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the Directors have 
power to suspend voting rights and the right to receive 
dividends in respect of shares in circumstances where the 
holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice issued under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company is not 
aware of any agreements between Shareholders that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Share schemes
The Company operates a number of share schemes.
Long-Term Incentive Plans payable to executives and senior 
managers are operated under our Performance Share Plan

their annual bonus deferred for three years under our Deferred 
Share Plan (‘DSP’). During 2017 the Company successfully 
launched a Save As You Earn (or sharesave scheme) which was 
available to all employees.
All shares issued under these plans carry the same rights as 
those already in issue.
Related party transactions
Other than in respect of arrangements set out in Note 28 to the 
Financial Statements and in relation to the employment of 
Directors, details of which are provided in the Remuneration

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect 
of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs') as 
adopted by the European Union and Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and Company for that period. In preparing the Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently.
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group Financial Statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101, have been followed for the Company Financial 
Statements, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Financial Statements.
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess 
the Group and Company’s performance, business model  
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the corporate governance section on pages 40 and 41 confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Company Financial Statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law), give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the 
Company.
• the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group.
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
it faces.
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ 
Report is approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group and 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors’ Responsibility Statement was approved by the 
Board on 8 March 2018.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Eurocell plc’s Group Financial Statements and Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial position as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes  
in Equity for the year then ended; and the Notes to the Financial Statements, which include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial 
Statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the 
Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

Materiality
 
• Overall Group materiality: £1.3m (2016: £1.2m), based on 5% of underlying profit before tax.
• Overall Company materiality: £0.7m (2016: £0.7m), based on 1% of total assets.
• Financially significant components were determined to be those that represented 15% or more 
of the consolidated underlying profits before tax.
• The financial information of Eurocell Building Plastics Limited and Eurocell Profiles Limited was 
therefore included as a full scope audit.
• Together these represent 89% of the consolidated revenues and underlying profits before tax.
• For the remaining entities, we also scoped in any individual balances that were above £1.3m 
and represented 15% or more of the consolidated balance. This resulted in Property, Plant and 
Equipment for Eurocell Group Limited and Cash and Cash Equivalents for Vista Panels Limited 
and S&S Plastics Limited being included in our audit scope.
• Analytical review procedures were performed over all other remaining balances within the 
out-of-scope subsidiary Companies.
• Assessment of the valuation of inventory (Group).
• Trade receivables provisions (Group).
• Dilapidations provisions (Group).
• Recoverability of investments and amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings (Company). 70 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the Financial 
Statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group, which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations 
that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Company Financial Statements, including, but not limited to, the 
Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the Financial 
Statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with regulators, enquiries of 
management and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the Financial Statements. There are inherent limitations 
in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and 
transactions reflected in the Financial Statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Assessment of the valuation of inventory
Refer to pages 34 to 38 (Risk management / Principal risks and 
uncertainties), pages 47 to 49 (Audit & Risk Committee report), 
Note 1 (Accounting policies) and Note 17 (Inventories).
Inventory totalled £21.1m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: 
£17.4m) after provisions of £1.8 million (31 December 2016:  
£1.8 million).
We focused on this area because the Directors’ assessment of 
the absorption of labour and overhead costs into inventory and 
the assessment of the recoverability of inventory involved 
complex and subjective judgements.
Specifically the determination of inventory provisions for slow 
moving, obsolete and discontinued line items, reflecting the level 
of inventory held across the 190 branches and manufactured 
goods at the year end, requires the exercise of judgement.
In addition, we also focused on this area because the incentive 
schemes of the Directors and senior management are based 
upon financial measures, including profit, which we concluded 
gave a greater risk of manipulation of judgements, including 
inventory costing and provisioning, to ensure that bonus targets 
are achieved.
Group
We understood the nature of the costs absorbed into inventory 
and determined their appropriateness, considering the 
requirements of IAS 2 Inventories (‘IAS 2').
We tested, on a sample basis, the valuation and calculation  
of costs absorbed into inventory. We also assessed the 
reasonableness of the Directors’ estimates in this area for bias.
We found no material exceptions from the procedures  
noted above.
We understood the Directors’ methodology for calculating 
inventory provisions and evaluated the Directors’ assumptions 
over future forecast usage and validated historic usage to 
underlying revenue records. We found no material exceptions 
from these procedures.
We tested, on a sample basis, inventory held as at 31 December 
2017 to verify that sale prices in 2018 were above cost.
Based on the results of our audit work, we found that the 
inventory recognised by the Directors was at an appropriate 
value and was consistent with the requirements of IAS 2.

KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Trade receivables provisions
Refer to pages 34 to 38 (Risk management/ Principal risks and 
uncertainties), pages 47 to 49 (Audit & Risk Committee report), 
Note 1 (Accounting policies) and Note 18 (Trade and other 
receivables).
The Group had gross trade receivables of £28.8m as at 
31 December 2017 (2016: £26.5m) against which provisions of 
£0.9 million (2015: £0.7 million) were held.
We focused on this area because the Directors’ assessment of 
the provisions required in respect of trade receivables involved 
subjective judgements.
In addition, we also focused on these areas because the 
incentive schemes of the Directors and senior management  
are based upon financial measures including profit, which we 
concluded gave a greater risk of manipulation of judgements, 
including those around trade receivables provisions, to ensure 
that bonus targets are achieved.
Group
We understood the Directors’ methodology for calculating  
trade receivables provisions across the Group and considered 
whether these complied with relevant IFRSs.
We tested the ageing of amounts due at the balance sheet  
date to understand and quantify the potential risk in overdue 
balances. We then challenged management in respect of those 
customers with whom amounts were past due but not impaired 
to assess for bias. We also assessed the Directors’ history of 
accuracy over this key estimate.
We tested, on a sample basis, cash received from customers 
following the year-end to validate the appropriateness of the 
Directors’ estimates.
We found no material exceptions from the procedures noted above.
Based on the results of our audit work, we found that the 
provisions recorded by the Directors were materially accurate 
and were consistent with the requirements of the relevant IFRSs.
Dilapidations provisions
Refer to pages 34 to 38 (Risk management/ Principal risks and 
uncertainties), pages 47 to 49 (Audit & Risk Committee report), 
Note 1 (Accounting policies) and Note 21 (Provisions).
The Group held provisions in respect of dilapidations of 
£1.1 million (2016: £1.5 million).
We focused on this area because the Directors’ assessment of 
the provisions required in respect of dilapidations involved 
subjective judgements.
In addition, we also focused on this area because the incentive 
schemes of the Directors and senior management are based 
upon financial measures including profit, which we concluded 
gave a greater risk of manipulation of judgements, including 
those around dilapidations provisions, to ensure that bonus 
targets are achieved.
Group
We understood the Directors’ methodology for calculating 
dilapidations provisions across the Group and considered 
whether these complied with relevant IFRSs.
In respect of dilapidation provisions for Eurocell Profiles, we 
tested management’s assessment to the most recent third party 
estimate of the expected costs less amounts spent during 2017.
For Eurocell Building Plastics, we tested management’s estimated 
average branch dilapidations cost to actual costs incurred in 
respect of leases exited during the current and prior year.
We found no material exceptions from the procedures noted above.
Based on the results of our audit work, we found that the 
provisions recorded by the Directors were materially accurate 
and were consistent with the requirements of the relevant IFRSs.
Recoverability of investments and amounts owed by 
subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary companies are £17.8m as at 
31 December 2017 (2016: £17.8m) and amounts owed by  
subsidiary undertakings total £53.1m (2016: £48.0m).
The recovery of the assets requires the use of judgement by  
the Directors. There is a risk that impairments to these assets 
may not be booked by the Directors as it could hinder the ability 
of the Company to pay dividends.
Company
We have reviewed the impairment assessment performed by  
the Directors.
This has included comparing the carrying value of the investments 
to their net assets values and assessing the estimated profits and 
cash flows of the subsidiaries for reasonableness.
We found no material exceptions from the procedures noted above. 72 EUROCELL PLC

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial 
Statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
Eurocell operates in the market of the extrusion of UPVC (unplasticised polyvinyl chloride) window and building products to the new 
and replacement window market and the sale of building plastics materials. The Group has sites throughout the UK with its 
headquarters in Alfreton. The business is managed as two primary divisions:
 – Eurocell Building Plastics, focusing on sales and distribution across around 190 branches within the UK to smaller scale customers. 
This segment includes the trading subsidiary companies Eurocell Building Plastics Limited and Security Hardware Limited; and
 – Eurocell Profiles, focusing on manufacture and distribution to large-scale customers. This division includes the trading 
subsidiaries Eurocell Profiles Limited, Vista Panels Limited and S&S Plastics Limited.
Each legal entity has its own local finance team and management team who report directly into the head office finance and 
management teams.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
All audit work, including work on components, was completed by the Group team.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual Financial Statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the Financial Statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Group Financial Statements Company Financial Statements
Overall Group materiality £1.3m (2016: £1.2m) £0.7m (2016: £0.7m).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before tax. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
We believe that underlying profit before tax is 
the key measure used by the Shareholders in 
assessing the performance of the Group.  
This benchmark, which excludes the non-
underlying items described in Note 7 to the 
Financial Statements, provides consistent  
year on year basis for determining materiality  
by eliminating the non-underlying and/or 
disproportionate impact of these items.
We believe that total assets is the primary 
measure used by the Shareholders in assessing 
the financial position of the entity, and is a 
generally accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between £1.2m and £0.8m. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £65,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £60,980) and £35,000 (Company audit) (2016: £35,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 73

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK), we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the Directors’ Statement in the Financial 
Statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties 
to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
Financial Statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention 
to. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ Statement relating to Going 
Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R (3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the Financial Statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the Financial Statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these 
responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06) 74 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 45 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 39 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 42, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company 
obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 47 to 49 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the Financial Statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Financial Statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial 
Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (GROUP)
Corporate information
Eurocell plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) is a publicly listed company incorporated and domiciled in 
England and Wales. The registered office is Fairbrook House, Clover Nook Road, Alfreton, Derbyshire, DE55 4RF.
The Group is principally engaged in the extrusion of UPVC window and building products to the new and replacement window 
market and the sale of building materials across the UK.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, as a result of this, the going 
concern basis has been adopted in preparing the Financial Statements.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Financial 
Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by fair values.
The preparation of the Group Financial Statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements are disclosed in Note 2.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2017 
and present the results as if they formed a single entity. Where the Company has power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date when such control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances, unrealised gains and losses 
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the 
balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures applicable to the Company and the Group.
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the year ended 31 December 2017 have had a 
material impact on the Company or Group. However, a number of major new standards will soon become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2018) addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and liabilities and replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
The main impact of adopting this standard is likely to arise from the adoption of the expected loss model of assessing the 
impairment of trade receivables. Management has modelled the impact of adopting the expected loss model and estimates that 
retained earnings would be decreased by less than £50,000 as at 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018) replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts. The standard addresses revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of 
Financial Statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts 
with its customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of goods or services, giving them the ability to direct the use and obtain 
the benefits of those goods and services. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that the 
cumulative revenue will not be reversed when any outstanding uncertainty is resolved.  81
OvER vIE w STRa TEg IC REPORT FINaNCI aL STa TEm ENTS CORPORa TE gO v ERNaNCE
Management has completed an assessment of its existing contractual relationships with customers, and has determined that there 
will be no material impact of implementing IFRS 15 on its revenue streams.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective from 1 January 2019) fundamentally changes the way in which certain leases are recognised in the 
Financial Statements, with most operating leases brought on to the balance sheet. The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and 
related interpretations, and addresses the definitions of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles 
for reporting useful information to the users of Financial Statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors.
Management is in the process of reviewing its lease contracts, determining the appropriate discount rates and establishing value in 
use for its various leased assets. An initial assessment of the impact of adopting IFRS 16 has been conducted, based upon the 
Group’s lease commitments as at 31 December 2017. This assessment indicates that the Group would recognise additional 
non-current assets and lease liabilities of approximately £32.9 million on adoption of the standard, with additional depreciation of 
£9.9 million and finance costs of £1.9 million being incurred in the first year of adoption, offset by a corresponding reduction in 
administrative costs of £9.6 million. In making this assessment, management has assumed that the Group would apply the 
Modified Retrospective transition approach.
In addition to the standards noted above, the following standards, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
future Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (effective from 1 January 2018); 
• IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (effective from 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective from 1 January 2021);
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective from 1 January 2018 and 2019);
• IAS 40 Investment Property (effective from 1 January 2018);
• IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration (effective from 1 January 2018); and
• IFRIC 23 Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatment (effective from 1 January 2019).
The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or amendment before the required implementation date. 
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received 
or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Group assesses its 
revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as a principal or agent. The Group has concluded 
that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer (when the 
goods are delivered). The amounts are recognised net of any discounts or rebates payable, which are accrued at the point at which 
the goods are delivered.
Administrative expenses – non-underlying
The Group presents some material items of income and expense as non-underlying costs. This is done when, in the opinion of the 
Directors, the nature and expected infrequency of the circumstances merit separate presentation in the Financial Statements. This 
treatment allows users of the Financial Statements to better understand the elements of financial performance in the year; it 
facilitates comparison with prior periods; and it helps in understanding trends in financial performance.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the 
acquirer, in exchange for control of the acquire. Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the acquisition date. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any 
impairment in carrying value being charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where the fair value of 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the acquisition date. 82 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (GROUP) CONTINUED
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see 
Note 2 relating to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of 
intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life Valuation method
Software Five to ten years Cost to acquire
Technology based Ten to seventeen years Cost to acquire
Marketing related Ten to fifteen years Cost to acquire
Customer related Four to twelve years Cost to acquire
The amortisation charge for the year is included within administration costs within the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Impairment of tangible assets, intangible assets and investments
Impairment tests on non-current assets are undertaken annually at the financial year end or at any other time when an indication of 
impairment arises. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest 
group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows – its cash-generating unit (‘CGU’). 
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent they reverse gains 
previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly 
attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The 
corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, 
plant and equipment so as to write-off their cost less residual value over their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the 
following rates:
Asset class Depreciation policy
Freehold property 2.5% per annum straight-line
Leasehold improvements Equal instalments over the period of the lease
Plant and machinery
Mixing plant Between 20% and 25% per annum on cost
Extruders 13 years based on production usage
Stillages and tooling 5 to 10 years based on production usage
Other Between 10% and 25% per annum on cost
Motor vehicles Between 20% and 25% per annum on cost
Office equipment and fixtures Between 20% and 25% per annum on cost
Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs 
of purchase and conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In 
determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the weighted average purchase price is used. 
For work in progress and finished goods, cost is taken as production cost, which includes a proportion of attributable overheads.

Financial assets
The Group classifies all of its financial assets as loans and receivables and has not classified any of its financial assets as held to 
maturity. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
balance sheet.
Loans and receivable assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers, but also incorporate other types of 
contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for 
impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of 
the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net of provisions, 
such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross 
carrying value of the asset is written-off against the associated provision.
From time to time, the Group elects to renegotiate the terms of trade receivables due from customers with which it has previously 
had a good trading history. Such renegotiations will lead to changes in the timing of payments rather than changes to the amounts 
owed and, in consequence, the new expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate and any resulting 
difference to the carrying value is recognised in administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less from inception, and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows – bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities as other financial liabilities which include the following items:
• Bank borrowings which are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability 
carried in the balance sheet. 
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Taxation
Tax on the profit for both the current and prior periods comprises both current and deferred tax and is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates that have been enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.
The Group recognises a current tax asset in respect of relief claimed under the Patent Box when the inflow of economic benefits 
arising from that asset is virtually certain, deemed to be the submission of a claim to HM Revenue and Customs.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from 
its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against 
which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 84 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (GROUP) CONTINUED
Taxation continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable group company; or 
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be settled or recovered.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
The Group has recognised provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount in respect of leasehold dilapidations. The provision 
is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax 
rate as described above.
Share capital
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity Shareholders, this is when 
declared by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Retirement benefits: defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group 
in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income represents 
the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. The Group has no obligation to pay future 
pension benefits.
Operating leases
Operating leases are contractual arrangements conferring the right of use of an asset but where substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group, the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease 
incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Foreign currency
The Group’s Financial Statements are presented in British Pounds Sterling. For each entity, the Group determines the functional 
currency, and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
they operate (their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the prevailing rate when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of 
unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is determined at the grant date 
using the Black-Scholes valuation model and equity-settled share-based payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based upon the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured based on the value of options over shares on the date of grant and the likelihood of all or part of the 
option vesting.

2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events, that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates and assumptions
a) Carrying value of inventories
Management review the market value of, and demand for, its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure inventory is recorded in the 
Financial Statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Any provision for impairment is recorded against the carrying 
value of inventories. The key judgement is the extent to which items of inventory remain saleable as they age. Management use 
their knowledge of market conditions to assess future demand for the Group’s products and achievable selling prices.
Further disclosures relating to inventories are provided in Note 17.
b) Recoverability of trade receivables
Management makes allowance for doubtful debts based on an assessment of the recoverability of trade receivables. Allowances 
are applied to trade receivables where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. Management specifically analyse historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and 
changes in customer payment terms when making a judgement to evaluate the adequacy of the provision for doubtful debts. 
Where the expectation is different from the original estimate, such difference will impact on the carrying value of trade receivables 
and the amount credited or charged in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Further disclosures relating to trade 
receivables are provided in Note 18.
c) Dilapidation provisions
The Group recognises dilapidation provisions on the leasehold properties it occupies. The key estimate is the level of provision 
required for each property, which management assesses based on past experience within the property portfolio. If the actual cost 
of dilapidations in respect of the Group’s branch network was on average 10% greater or less than expected, the provision would 
change by less than £50,000. These provisions are reviewed semi-annually to ensure that they reflect the current best estimate of 
the provision required. Further disclosures relating to dilapidation provisions are provided in Note 21.
d) Carrying value of intangible assets
Management assesses the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, or when an indication of impairment 
arises. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs 
to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. Recoverable amounts are determined from ‘value-in-use’ calculations applied to 
each Cash Generating Unit, which have been predicated on discounted cash flow projections from formally approved budgets 
covering a three year period. The key estimates as highlighted in Note 16 are the discount rate and the level of profit growth 
assumed in perpetuity. If the discount rate increased by 100 basis points, or if the level of profit growth in perpetuity was zero, none 
of the Group’s Cash Generating Units would be at risk of impairment.
3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
• credit risk 
• market risk 
• foreign exchange risk 
• liquidity risk 
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note 
describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. 
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these Financial Statements. There have been no 
substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing 
those risks, or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• trade and other receivables
• cash and cash equivalents
• trade and other payables
• bank overdrafts
• floating-rate bank loans 86 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Impairment of financial assets
Impairments of trade receivables are outlined in Note 18. No further impairments to financial assets are considered necessary. 
Factors which are considered when assessing the need for impairment include the liquidity of the asset, its maturity profile and 
other commercial considerations.
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst 
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function.
The Board receives monthly reports from the Chief Financial Officer through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put 
in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. These are then discussed at regular Board meetings.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk through its trade receivables arising from its normal commercial activities. It 
is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
Existing credit risks associated with trade receivables are managed in line with Group policies as discussed in the financial assets 
section of accounting policies.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. This risk is mitigated by 
ensuring that deposits are only made with banks and financial institutions with a good rating issued by an industry-recognised 
independent third party e.g. Standard and Poor’s.
Further disclosures regarding financial assets are provided in Note 18.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk from bank borrowings which incur variable interest rate charges linked to base rate plus a 
margin. The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants 
and forecasts.
During 2017 and 2016 the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in Sterling.
Further disclosures relating to bank borrowings are provided in Note 19.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument or future cash flow will fluctuate because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions 
denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. The Group manages its exposure to fluctuations in currency rates 
by wherever possible negotiating both purchases and sales to be denominated in Sterling. The profit or loss arising from likely 
changes in foreign exchange is not significant.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.  
To achieve this aim, cash flow forecasts are prepared and updated on a regular basis to ensure that the Group has adequate 
headroom in its facilities.
The Board receives monthly updates on the Group’s liquidity position and any issues are reported by exception.
At the end of the financial year, the most recent cash flow projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid 
resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.

Capital disclosures
The Group’s objective when managing capital, which is deemed to be total equity plus total debt and which totalled £75,225,000 
(2016: £63,953,000) at the balance sheet date, is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, through the 
optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain good headroom on its debt facilities and financial covenants. The Group 
manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in the light of current economic conditions and its strategic objectives.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and sustain the 
future development of the business.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash.
A key objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain comfortable headroom over the covenants set out in its existing 
facility agreements and to maintain a comfortable headroom over and above these requirements.
The financial covenants which are in place are as follows:
• Leverage: the ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA of any relevant period of not more than 3:1.
• Interest cover: the ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable in respect of any relevant period of not less than 4:1.
Covenants are measured semi-annually on a rolling twelve-month basis. As at 31 December 2017 they were 0.5:1 and 57:1 
respectively (2016: 0.6:1 and 46:1). 88 EUROCELL PLC

Acquisition related costs 414 112
Redundancy and settlement costs 361 –
HSE penalty 68 –
Duplicated costs related to CEO handover period – 343
843 455
Any expenses arising from the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings are classified as non-underlying due to the fact that they 
relate solely to the transfer of ownership rather than ongoing operations. Of the £414,000 (2016: £112,000) acquisition costs, 
£322,000 (2016: £nil) relates to contingent consideration which is dependent upon continued employment and £92,000  
(2016: £112,000) relates to professional fees and transaction costs incurred in respect of completed acquisitions.
The redundancy and settlement costs of £361,000 (2016: £nil) relate to a reorganisation of the production function in the Profiles 
division and have been classified as non-underlying because they relate to termination costs for positions that no longer exist.
The penalty of £68,000 (2016: £nil) relates to a fine imposed by the Health and Safety Executive (‘HSE') following their prosecution 
of the Company in respect of an accident incurred in August 2016. The penalty has been classified as non-underlying because 
such costs are not in the normal course of business and are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
In the prior year, the Group recognised the duplicated salary costs relating to the handover period between its current and previous 
Chief Executive Officer as non-underlying.

on pages 30 and 31.
9 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group organises itself into a number of operating segments that offer different products and services. They are managed 
separately because each business requires different technology and marketing strategies. 
Internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, which has been identified as the executive management team 
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, reflects this structure.
The Group has aggregated its operations into two reported segments, as these business units have similar products, production 
processes, types of customer, methods of distribution, regulatory environments and economic characteristics:
• Profiles – extrusion and sale of UPVC window and building products to the new and replacement window market across the UK. 
• Building Plastics – sale of building plastic materials across the UK.
The Corporate segment includes amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets.

2017
£000
2016
£000

Expected tax charge based on the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.25% (2016: 20%) 4,555 4,764
Taxation effect of:
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 439 87

Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years (272) 253
Tax on share-based payments recognised in equity 50 (50)
Adjustment in respect of change in rates (15) (385)
Total tax expense 4,019 4,218
Changes in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge
The mainstream rate of UK corporation tax changed in April 2017 from 20% to 19%. This gives rise to an effective rate of 19.25% 
(2016: 20%) for the year. A further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been substantively enacted. Deferred taxes at the year 
end date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in the Financial Statements.
There are no material uncertain tax provisions.
Tax on non-underlying items
The tax credit arising on non-underlying items within the Comprehensive Income Statement is £70,000 (2016: £81,000).
Tax included in Other Comprehensive Income
The tax credit arising on share-based payments within Other Comprehensive Income is £50,000 (2016: charge of £50,000).
Based on the current investment plans of the Group, and assuming the rates of capital allowances on capital expenditure continue 
into the future, there is little prospect of any significant part of the deferred tax liability becoming payable over the next three years.

12 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the 
earnings and number of shares for the effects of dilutive options. Adjusted earnings per share excludes the impact of non-
underlying costs.

Vista Panels Limited 2,243 2,243
S & S Plastics Limited 151 151
Security Hardware Limited 222 –
8,550 8,328
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined from ‘value-in-use’ calculations which have been predicated on 
discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on a three year business plan approved by the Board. These projections are based 
on all available information and growth rates do not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods.
The key assumptions in preparing these forecasts are in line with our published strategy of continuing to open further branches, 
developing new products, increasing our use of recycled materials and adding bolt-on acquisitions when they arise.
2017 2016
Period on which management approved forecasts are based (years) 3 3
Discount rate (pre-tax) 10% 11%
Profit growth rate in perpetuity 2% 2%
The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life. The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and an 
estimated industry average weighted average cost of capital.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill, as assessed by the Directors using the above assumptions, is greater than the 
carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been recorded. The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible 
for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the headroom.

Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.

Borrowings
The Company has a £45,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving unsecured credit facility with Barclays Bank plc and 
Santander UK plc which expires in 2020.
Borrowings of £26,000,000 were drawn down at 31 December 2017 (2016: £26,000,000) less unamortised issue costs of £149,000 
(2015: £215,000).
Interest is charged at an excess over base rate of between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum and is dependent upon the ratio of total 
net debt to consolidated EBITDA.
Based upon current economic and market trends, management consider that the Sterling LIBOR rate will remain relatively stable 
during the next reporting period to 31 December 2018, and any changes, when applied to the Group’s current bank borrowings of 
£25,851,000 would not lead to a significant change in finance expense.
All of the Group’s borrowings are denominated in Sterling.

Under property operating lease agreements, Eurocell Building Plastics Limited and Eurocell Profiles Limited, being Group 
subsidiaries, have obligations to maintain all properties to the standard that prevailed at the inception of the respective leases. 
The provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the costs associated with this obligation.
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is variable dependent on the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary 
between 1 and 10 years.

29 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
On 24 February 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Security Hardware Limited, a supplier of locks  
and hardware primarily to the RMI market, with annual sales of approximately £3 million. Initial consideration paid was £1.5 million  
(or £1.3 million net of cash acquired).
Goodwill represents potential synergies arising from the enlarged group. The amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes is 
£nil. Goodwill has been calculated as follows:
Book values on
acquisition
£000
Fair value
adjustments
£000
Recognised
values on

£000
Intangible assets 20 466 486

Cash consideration paid 1,486
Goodwill on acquisition 222
Cash flows arising on the acquisition were £1,260,000 comprising the consideration paid less cash acquired.
Fair value adjustments
• The adjustment to intangible assets is to recognise intangible assets in respect of customer relationships, and has been valued 
using discounted cash flows.
• The adjustment to inventories is to reflect the fair value of finished goods acquired.
• Trade receivables include a bad debt provision of £nil which has not been adjusted in the fair value exercise.
• The adjustment to trade and other payables is to recognise a dilapidation provision in respect of the leased premises occupied 
by Security Hardware.
• The adjustment to deferred taxation is to recognise the associated deferred tax liability arising on the intangible assets.

Subsequent payments
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the former Shareholders of Security Hardware are entitled to further cash consideration 
based on financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2017 (the ‘earn out’), provided they remain employed by the Group.  
The Directors estimate the total earn out payable will be £322,000, which has been recognised as a non-underlying expense in the 2017 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The earn out is payable in equal instalments over a three-year period.
Acquisition-related costs
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £92,000 in relation to professional fees and transaction costs arising upon acquisition. 
These costs have been expensed to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, also as a non-underlying item. The total 
charge for acquisition related costs in the year is £414,000 (2016: £112,000).
Included within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is revenue of £2,500,000 and profit before tax of £130,000 relating to 
Security Hardware Limited. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2017 , revenue of £3,200,000 and profit before tax of £180,000 would 
have been recognised by the Group.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
33 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (COMPANY)
Corporate information
Eurocell plc (the ‘Company’) is a publicly listed company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The registered office is 
Fairbrook House, Clover Nook Road, Alfreton, Derbyshire, DE55 4RF.
The Company is principally engaged as a holding company for its subsidiaries which are engaged in the extrusion of UPVC window 
and building products to the new and replacement window market and the sale of building materials across the UK.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, as a result of this, the 
going concern basis has been adopted in preparing the Financial Statements.
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). These Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in 
accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act 2006.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures applicable to the Company
There were no standards or interpretations which took effect in the year which materially affect the Financial Statements.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Financial assets
The Company classifies all of its financial assets as loans and receivables and has not classified any of its financial assets as held 
to maturity.
Loans and receivable assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of 
the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of 
the asset is written-off against the associated provision.
From time to time, the Company elects to renegotiate the terms of trade receivables due from customers with which it has 
previously had a good trading history. Such renegotiations will lead to changes in the timing of payments rather than changes to 
the amounts owed and, in consequence, the new expected cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate and any 
resulting difference to the carrying value is recognised in administrative expenses.
The Company’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less from inception, and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows – bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Financial liabilities
The Company classifies its financial liabilities as other financial liabilities which include the following items:
• bank borrowings which are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability 
carried in the balance sheet. Further information is provided in Note 3.
• trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. 106 EUROCELL PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
33 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (COMPANY) CONTINUED
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from 
its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable group company; or 
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be settled or recovered. 
Share capital
The Company’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity Shareholders, this is when 
declared by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Further information regarding dividends is provided in Note 13.
FRS 101 exemptions

in accordance with FRS 101:
Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, Share-Based Payments (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of

Borrowings
The Company has a £45,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving unsecured credit facility with Barclays Bank plc and 
Santander UK plc which expires in 2020.
Borrowings of £26,000,000 were drawn down at 31 December 2017 (2016: £26,000,000) less unamortised issue costs of £149,000 
(2016: £215,000).
Interest is charged at an excess over base rate of between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum and is dependent upon the ratio of total 
net debt to consolidated EBITDA.
Based upon current economic and market trends, management consider that the Sterling LIBOR rate will remain relatively stable 
during the next reporting period to 31 December 2018, and any changes, when applied to the Company’s current bank borrowings 
of £25,851,000 would not lead to a significant change in finance expense. 110 EUROCELL PLC
