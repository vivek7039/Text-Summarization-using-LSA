 Pivoting to 
renewable fuels
Annual report and accounts 2017 Velocys is part of a growing movement to 
produce increased volumes of renewable 
fuels, in our case primarily from forestry 
residues. Our process is one of the few cost 
effective ways to meet the economy’s need 
for large quantities of sustainable fuels. 
Our technology and operational expertise 
were pivotal in delivering the world’s first 
commercial scale smaller scale gas-to-
liquids plant. Now we are using our unique 
capabilities to drive the development of 
what will be a series of biorefineries, with 
our partners, from concept to full operations.  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 iii

Our business at a glance
Velocys has a strong, multi-disciplinary team operating 
from its US project development and commercial centre in 
Houston, Texas, its UK project development and corporate 
office near Oxford, UK, and its technology and supply 
chain facility near Columbus, Ohio. We have experienced 
Fischer-Tropsch, process engineering, project development 
and plant commissioning and start-up teams unique to 
the industry. 
Business influences
Velocys is managed as a single entity and referred to as “the Company”. 
Throughout the Strategic report we highlight content relating to four 
areas that will be critical to our future success.
1
Technical 
expertise
We are recognised as leaders in 
smaller scale Fischer-Tropsch 
technology. We have expertise 
throughout the design, 
commissioning and operation 
of plants.
2
ENVIA –
our commercial 
springboard
The first commercial scale 
plant using Velocys’ technology 
is in operation in Oklahoma 
City . Our technology deployed 
at the ENVIA plant will be a 
springboard for commercial 
growth. 
3
Development 
of biorefineries
In partnership, we are 
aiming to develop a series 
of biorefineries in the US, 
to become a producer of 
significant volumes of 
cellulosic renewable fuels.
4
Focus 
market
Our primary focus market is 
the large, high growth market 
for renewable fuels in the US. 
“Velocys is well positioned, and we believe that our newly 
focused business model will drive commercialisation in 
the renewable fuels market, enabling our technology to 
be incorporated in multiple biorefineries that will help to

1. Business model
We initiate and drive the development of 
biorefineries from concept to full operations. 
By taking the lead in projects, we reduce 
delivery risk and accelerate growth. We plan 
to convert some or all of our equity stakes 
in the development (or project) company 
into equity in the operating plants. We will 
derive a stream of dividends from those 
equity stakes in the operating biorefineries. 
We also expect ongoing revenues from 
technology supply , service contracts and 
the licensing of our technology .
2. Leverage capabilities
We work seamlessly with our partners 
to deliver modular, fully integrated, 
financeable, cost-effective and 
operations-ready biorefineries. 
Using Velocys’ unique engineering 
and operational expertise as well 
as our proprietary technology, 
we continuously improve our 
integrated biorefinery offering.
3. Strategic partnerships
Our alliances, including manufacturing, 
gasification, product offtake and 
feedstock supply, are with strategic 
partners that have the resources, 
scale and capabilities to access large, 
high value markets at pace.

Our focus markets
Following the Company’ s 201 6 strategy review V elocys 
identified the market for renewable fuels in the United States 
as being particularly attractive for the commercialisation of its 
technology . This large and rapidly growing market is V elocys’ 
immediate focus. Our strategy has the objective of creating 
sustainable growth. 
Market of primary focus
More renewable fuels are urgently 
needed in the global fuel market. 
Many governments have mandated driving 
down greenhouse gas emissions by using 
cleaner, renewable fuels – a move widely 
supported by environmental agencies 
and non-governmental organisations. 
More are expected to follow suit. Industry 
and consumers also want to drive 
down their carbon footprint and reduce 
emissions cost-effectively, and swiftly.
US renewable fuels
The US jet fuel market is around 
20bn gallons/year, and the US Energy 
Information Administration (EIA) expects 
an increase in global air travel by 
over 3% per year in the coming years. 
The airline industry (ICAO) has committed 
to carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and 
a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. 
Incremental operational efficiencies will 
go a small way towards meeting these 
targets but nothing less than a huge 
increase in the supply of renewable 
jet fuel will be needed if they are to 
be met. By 2022 there is expected to 
be a worldwide demand of more than 
two billion gallons/yr of renewable jet 
fuel based on carbon neutral growth, 
of which more than 700m gallons per 
year will be required in North America. 
In the US, diesel consumption is around 
40bn gallons/year with 25% growth 
predicted by the EIA to 2040. There is an 
urgent and increasing demand for 
drop-in renewable fuels in this market 
that are fully compatible with existing 
infrastructure and engines. In California 
alone, the consumption of renewable 
diesel in 2016 was an estimated 300m 
gallons, but by 2030 the State will need 
some 1bn gallons of renewable diesel 
to meet its own obligations.
Using Velocys’ technology, renewable 
fuels can be made cost-effectively 
from abundant reserves of biomass 
feedstock – meaning that scale of 
uptake is not restricted by feedstock 
availability. There is a plentiful supply 
of woody biomass in the US from entirely 
sustainable sources that do not compete 
with food crops for land. The forestry 
industry in the Southeastern United 
States has been in decline from falling 
demand for newsprint and paper; 
the infrastructure servicing the industry 
has spare capacity in many locations. 
As evidenced by, for example, the US 
Department of Energy’s 2016 Billion Ton 
report, by 2030 it is estimated that there 
will be available over 200m dry tonnes/
year of economically-accessible, non-
federal timberland forestry biomass 
in the US – enough to support several 
dozen Velocys plants. 
UK waste-to-sustainable jet fuel
The changes to the Renewable Transport 
Fuel Obligation (RTFO) that passed 
through Parliament in March 2018  
(post-period end) are encouraging the UK 
to become a world leader in sustainable 
jet fuel. Millions of tonnes of waste are 
exported from the UK every year. The RTFO 
development fuel target for 2022 is 100m 
gallons/year. No qualifying development 
fuels are currently produced in the UK 
and a Velocys waste-to-jet fuel project 
would produce between 10 and 20% of 
the target. A Velocys waste-to-jet fuel 
plant could sell Renewable Transport 
Fuel Certificates worth up to £1.6/litre 
for a portion of the fuel. Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 5
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
www.velocys.com
Legislative support in the US
In the US, the Renewable Fuel Standard 
(RFS) was enacted by Congress in 
2005 under the Energy Policy Act 
(and  enhanced in 2007 under the Energy 
Independence and Security Act) to 
move the United States towards greater 
energy independence and to increase 
the production of clean renewable fuels. 
Under the status quo of this long-standing 
legislation, the programme continues 
indefinitely, with no legislative sunset, 
providing a long-term market and an 
incentive for renewable fuel production. In 
2016 over 18bn gallons of renewable fuels 
were produced or imported into the USA 
that qualified under the RFS. 
Under the RFS, Renewable Identification 
Numbers (RINs) are credits used to 
track compliance for obligated parties 
(oil companies who produce or import 
gasoline and/or diesel fuel), and are the 
“currency” of the programme. Yearly 
volume requirements (Renewable Volume 
Obligations, RVOs) are set for the obligated 
parties. Renewable fuel producers 
generate RINs, market participants trade 
the RINs and obligated parties either 
produce their own RINs or purchase 
RINs and then ultimately retire RINs for 
compliance, supplying the renewable fuel 
into the wider fuel market for on-highway 
use. RINs therefore carry a monetary value 
and act as a market-based incentive.
California
In California in 2006, the Legislature 
passed the California Global Warming 
Solutions Act, which created a 
comprehensive, multi-year programme to 
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Renewable diesel sold in California 
also qualifies for State Low Carbon 
Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, traded in 
terms of carbon emissions prevented, 
and are currently worth around $0.8 
- $1.2 per gallon for fuels that have a 
60% GHG reduction. In 2016, legislation 
was passed that codifies a 2030 GHG 
emissions reduction target of 40% below 
1990 levels. Requirements similar to 
those in California are in place in Oregon, 
Washington State and several Canadian 
provinces. States in the North Eastern 
US, such as Massachusetts, are also 
considering an LCFS-type regulation.

The fuels produced at Velocys’ 
biorefineries using woody biomass as 
feedstock are expected to qualify as 
Cellulosic Biofuel under the RFS, for 
which the highest level of greenhouse 
gas reductions must be demonstrated. 
An indicative value of these D7 RINs is 
currently around $4½ – $5 per gallon. 
The 2018 RVO for Cellulosic Biofuel is 
288m gallons, yet the supply of D7 RINs 
is currently limited. A total of only 400,000 
D7 RINs have ever been generated within 
the US. ENVIA is expected to generate 
around 100,000 D7 RINs per month and 
Velocys’ Mississippi biorefinery is being 
designed to generate over 30m D3/  D7 
RINs per year. Delivering an ongoing 
domestic source of Cellulosic Biofuel 
will be a significant milestone for the US 
renewable fuels industry.

Chairman’s statement
“V elocys is pursuing its new strategy and has completed 
its shift to becoming a renewable fuels business. It did so 
in mid- 201 7 after taking decisive action to capitalise on its 
achievements at ENVIA. The Company has strengthened 
its Executive Committee and adapted its organisational 
structure as it continues to build a strong team that has 
the long-term aim of delivering repeatable biorefineries. ” 
Dr. Pierre Jungels, CBE
Chairman
Introduction
2017 has been a year of considerable 
change for Velocys as it has pivoted from 
being purely a technology licensor to 
setting the foundations for future profit 
delivery as a renewable fuels company. 
After many years of concerted effort, 
encompassing R&D, engineering, project 
management and relationship building, 
the first commercial scale plant using 
Velocys’ technology is in operation in 
Oklahoma City. Velocys has also advanced 
its new strategy for commercialising its 
technology; in 2017 the Company made 
considerable progress driving forward 
the development of its first biorefinery 
using woody biomass as feedstock. 
Notwithstanding the progress made 
throughout 2017 , given the particular 
circumstances of the business’ financial 
position at year end the Company decided 
to make a significant impairment against 
a range of, primarily, intangible assets. 
Strategy and market
The creation of a world-leading technology 
that is operating at commercial scale has 
been a significant achievement. But now, 
as well as seeking opportunities to 
license its technology, Velocys is focused 
on its commercialisation through the 
delivery, with its partners, of repeatable 
biorefineries to become a producer 
of significant volumes of cellulosic 
renewable fuels. We will remember 
2017 as the year Velocys transitioned from 
technology development to its commercial 
roll-out, which has meant the winding 
down of R&D programmes both in the UK 
and the US. The Company has maintained 
its corporate and commercial office in 
the UK. 
After conducting its detailed strategic 
review, Velocys has taken the decision 
to focus its resources on the renewable 
fuels market. Our analysis shows that 
the Velocys route to the production of 
renewable fuels can be cost-effective 
using the reserves of sustainable biomass 
feedstock that are abundant in the US. 
Unlike other routes to renewable fuel 
production these biorefineries will not be 
constrained by the amount of feedstock 
available, and will therefore be well 
positioned to deliver significant quantities 
of renewable fuel to a large and growing 
market at a competitive price.
In a move that is consistent with our 
renewable fuels strategy of delivering 
integrated plants in collaboration with 
partners, we are also in the early stages of 
developing a UK waste-to-jet fuel project 
with world-class partners, which include 
British Airways. 
Other market opportunities, such as 
stranded gas conversion to liquids 
or waxes, are still available and their 
attractiveness to Velocys will continue to 
be reviewed if market conditions change 
in the future. These opportunities give the 
Company future optionality.
Management and Board
In 2017 and early 2018 there were a 
number of changes to the Board. Andrew 
Morris was nominated as a Non-Executive 
Director and Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee at the start of June 2017 , 
in place of Non-Executive Director 
Mark Chatterji who left the Board in 
April 2017 . Ross Allonby and Julian West 
left the Board in June 2017 and February 
2018 (post-period end) respectively. 
On behalf of the Board I thank Mark, 
Ross and Julian for their contributions 
to the Company. I would like to welcome 
Andrew, who brings a wealth of financial 
and business experience from companies 
similar to Velocys in terms of size, sector 
and complexity. 
The appointment of Andrew Morris has 
helped to align Board competencies to 
those needed to guide the delivery of the 
Company’s strategy. Board costs have 
been reduced through the reduction in the 
number of Non-Executive Directors, and 
by reducing the fees paid to existing  
Non-Executive Directors by 10%. 
Susan Robertson stepped down as 
Chief Financial Officer in August 2017 , 
a role she held for nine years. I would 
like to thank Susan for her contribution 
to Velocys during that time. In the 
summer we welcomed John Tunison 
as Interim CFO.  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 7

Introduction to our corporate governance 
Velocys has the ambition to grow 
significantly, and to develop into a 
multinational business. The Company 
is in the process of implementing the 
required business level governance that 
is both scalable and has the flexibility 
to meet the requirements of delivering 
the new strategy. This governance covers 
the processes required to manage 
the route into the renewable fuels 
market, with defined critical activities 
and key milestones that will drive risk 
management and decision making at 
both the executive and Board levels. 
The composition of the Board has 
reflected the development of the 
Company, with a shift in emphasis 
towards expertise in business, 
legal and finance.

Fundraising
Velocys completed a fundraise of over 
£10m (before expenses) in May 2017 
primarily through the support of existing 
shareholders, who we thank for their 
continued support. The proceeds 
raised were used primarily to fund 
the pre-FEED (FEL-2) engineering 
study for the Mississippi biorefinery 
project, to undertake a joint technology 
demonstration with our partner TRI, 
and to extend Velocys’ loan arrangement 
with ENVIA to support the plant in 
achieving steady state operations. 
In January 2018 (post-period end) £18.4m 
(before expenses) was raised through 
a further fundraise, principally to help 
fund the development of our Mississippi 
biorefinery project, and to secure strategic 
investment into it. We included an open 
offer element in this fundraising round 
to enable all eligible shareholders an 
opportunity to participate. Our existing 
major shareholders again demonstrated 
their considerable support, but at the 
same time we were pleased by our ability 
to extend our shareholder base. The Board 
recognises that additional funding is 
still required to reach final investment 
decision (FID) on the Mississippi 
biorefinery project; further details are 
given in the Financial review and note 2. 
Outlook
Velocys is pursuing its new strategy and 
has completed its shift to becoming 
a renewable fuels business. It did so 
mid-2017 after taking decisive action 
to capitalise on its achievements at 
ENVIA. The Company has strengthened 
its Executive Committee and adapted its 
organisational structure as it continues 
to build a strong team that has the 
long-term aim of delivering repeatable 
biorefineries. Velocys has transformed in a 
short time and its primary focus is to drive 
the delivery of the FID for the Mississippi 
biorefinery project, which the Company 
is targeting in the second half of 2019. 
A key step in this process will be to bring 
on board one or more strategic investors 
into the Mississippi project consortium 
to meet the remaining development 
capital requirement.

Introduction
2017 was a challenging year for Velocys, 
but despite this, the Company has made 
significant progress towards developing 
what we expect will be the first of a 
number of repeatable biorefineries. Our 
strategy is for Velocys to be at the heart 
of building plants that convert forestry 
residues into renewable fuels for the US 
market. Considerable headway has been 
made on the interrelated work streams 
required to progress the US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) loan guarantee 
programme, including the delivery of the 
FEL -2 engineering study , and securing 
a 100-acre site in Natchez, Mississippi. 
The performance milestones the Velocys 
Fischer- Tropsch (FT) system reached at 
a commercial scale at ENVIA during 2017 
and the first part of 2018 were crucial 
milestones on the way to delivering our 
future biorefineries.
None of this would be possible without the 
efforts of our talented, energetic team that 
has stepped up to the challenges we have 
faced with great determination, skill and 
prior experience. I particularly thank them 
for their professionalism during the internal 
restructuring process undertaken in the 
summer of 2017 .
Strategy implementation
With the ENVIA biorefinery in operation, 
the Company has the required commercial 
and technology springboard from which 
it aims to deliver its bold, long-term 
vision to place Velocys at the forefront of 
production of cellulosic renewable fuels. 
With a reorganisation of the senior team 
and the appointment of John Tunison as 
Interim CFO we now have a strong Executive 
Committee to bring decisive leadership 
to deliver this goal. 
The three pillars of the strategy we have 
adopted are outlined on page 3. We are all 
focused on the delivery of the next phase on 
this journey . We are building a consortium 
of strategic and financial partners to deliver 
investment, scale and pace to market 
and are leveraging the Company’s project 
management, commercial, engineering, 
operational and technology expertise to 
optimise future plant costs and timelines. 
In the summer of 2017 , after it had 
been demonstrated that the Velocys 
technology installed at ENVIA ’s Oklahoma 
City plant was performing as expected 
at a commercial scale, we concluded 
that the primary phase of our technology 
development programme had been 
successfully completed. In July 2017 we 
ceased certain R&D activities and total 
headcount was reduced from 76 at the 
end of 2016 to 42 at the end of 2017 . 
The changes made allowed us to direct 
our resources towards those business-
critical areas in which milestone-delivery 
is all important in the short and medium 
term. They will also reduce the ongoing 
operational costs of the business by nearly 
£2m per year .
The Company has maintained a corporate 
and commercial office in the UK, from 
where it will direct the implementation 
of its strategy and commercialisation 
of its considerable intellectual property 
portfolio. These UK-based capabilities 
are now located at the Harwell Science 
and Innovation Campus, and include the 
project management team supporting the 
UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel project. 
We will continue to expand and develop our 
capability to develop our US biorefineries 
from our operational base in Houston. In 
addition, we will further scale up resources 
to support the clients licensing our 
technology as well as to ensure protection 
of our intellectual property .
Our two fundraises in the last 12 months 
have provided us with a runway to 
implement our strategy , most notably to 
support the plan to achieve final investment 
decision (FID) for the Mississippi biorefinery 
project. As outlined in the Financial review 
(see page 17) further funding is required to 
reach this milestone. The Financial review 
(and note 17) also outlines the reasons 
behind a significant write down in value  
of certain assets, mostly Goodwill and  
In-process technology made in these  
report and accounts.
Our biorefineries
ENVIA
In 2Q 2018 we announced the disappointing 
news that a leak has been detected at the 
Oklahoma City plant that is believed to 
have originated inside one of the plant’s 
two FT reactors. Based on a preliminary 
investigation the Company believes the 
root cause of the issue originated with the 
design of an ancillary system and is not 
a result of a flaw in the core Velocys FT 
technology . The Company is working with 
ENVIA and third party consultants to verify 
the root cause of the leak. Velocys remains 
committed to the ENVIA plant and will work 
with ENVIA to assess the likely repair cost 
and consequent funding requirements. 
Successive milestones were met at ENVIA 
over the course of 2017 , as outlined on 
page 10. Most recently (post-period end), 
we were pleased to report that the RINs 
produced at ENVIA were verified under the 
Quality Assurance Program approved by 
the US Environmental Protection Agency . 
ENVIA has achieved significant milestones 
in the last 12 months, notwithstanding 
a number of other challenges. For example, 
in Q2 2017 , the Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (EPC) contractor entered 
bankruptcy proceedings; the plant was 
down or in reduced operation for several  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 9

weeks in early 2018 (post-period end) 
while repairs were carried out after 
extreme cold weather; and, as part of 
normal plant commissioning, a series of 
improvements have been made to control 
systems and other equipment to minimise 
plant downtime and improve reliability . 
More details are given on page 10. 
After the experiences of the last 12 months, 
I have enormous confidence in Velocys’ 
highly-skilled technical team that are called 
on by ENVIA to support the Oklahoma plant. 
While ENVIA remedies the present issue, 
ENVIA ’s aim will be to operate the plant 
using one reactor . ENVIA is working with 
Velocys, the licensor , to develop a solution 
that will return the plant to full operation 
with minimal loss of revenue, whilst always 
assuring safety and minimising the risk 
of adverse impact to the environment. 
Working through these obstacles at 
the Oklahoma plant has afforded a 
number of learning opportunities that 
Velocys will apply to future biorefineries, 
reducing technology risk and further 
optimising operations.
An impairment was made against Velocys’ 
investment in ENVIA, predominantly driven 
by a less ambitious revenue forecast based 
on a revision of operational availability and 
product and RIN pricing. 
Mississippi biorefinery
Throughout 2017 we made encouraging 
progress towards the development of our 
first biorefinery in the US using woody 
biomass as feedstock (see pages 12 and 
13 for more details). We welcome the 
significant support for the plant at county 
and state levels. The local community 
has responded positively to the prospect 
of the quality jobs that the construction 
and operation of the plant would bring 
to the area.
Velocys and its partners are making 
progress towards completing all the 
required work packages to deliver 
a successful USDA loan guarantee 
application, secure project investment 
and deliver the FID. Velocys selected an 
engineering partner to carry out a scoping 
and optimisation study . Velocys and its 
engineering partner are working through 
the complex process of cost and value 
engineering, to optimise plant capital 
cost, operating cost, carbon intensity and 
the financial returns from the project. 
Reaching FID will be subject to securing 
further funding (see further details in the 
Financial review on pages 16 and 17). Other 
significant risks identified and associated 
mitigation actions with the project 
development programme are outlined on 
pages 20 to 22.
Our target is to secure a conditional 
commitment from the USDA in Q3 2018, 
and to reach FID in 2H 2019. These, and 
other intermediate milestones, are outlined 
in the timeline on page 12. 
Although our focus is the delivery of 
the Mississippi biorefinery project, 
we are looking beyond this plant, as our 
strategic plan is to put in place strategic 
partnerships that will deliver multiple 
biorefineries. The site selection process 
for the Mississippi biorefinery produced 
a list of other highly suitable sites in 
a number of other states.
UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel
Consistent with our core strategy of 
delivering biorefineries producing 
renewable fuels, in Q3 2017 we entered 
into an industry partnership to develop 
a waste-to-jet fuel plant in the UK. 
Our approach to this opportunity 
leverages further our technology, 
integrated plant design and skills base. 
Velocys intends to license its technology 
to the plant and provide project 
management, engineering, operations 
and technical service support to the 
project. The other project partners include 
British Airways, that intends to offtake 
the jet fuel produced. Velocys has led 
the initial feasibility stage of the project, 
for which all members of the partnership 
provided  funding. 
Velocys believes that there is an 
opportunity to develop a series of waste-
to-jet fuel plants in the UK and recognises 
that there is a larger non-UK market to be 
exploited. The changes to the Renewable 
Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO), 
recently passed through Parliament, have 
provided the commercial platform for 
this opportunity; for the first time, jet fuel 
is to qualify for credits under the RTFO. 
These changes to the RTFO are designed 
to promote sustainable aviation and 
heavy goods transport and are expected 
to provide long-term policy support for 
this market. 
Biorefinery being developed  
by Red Rock Biofuels
In May 2018 (post-period end) Velocys’ 
customer, Red Rock Biofuels (RRB), 
started constructing the biorefinery it 
is developing in Oregon, USA, which will 
incorporate Velocys’ technology. The third 
party developer has issued a notice to 
proceed for the manufacture of Velocys’ 
FT reactors and catalyst. RRB’s Lakeview 
project is expected to deliver around $15m 
revenues to Velocys during construction 
and early operations of the plant, and 
an additional $30m or more over the life 
of the biorefinery. Over $6m has already 
been invoiced and received from RRB.
The licensing of our technology to Red Rock 
Biofuels biorefinery is complementary 
to our strategy to develop our own 
biorefineries. 
Outlook
I believe we will look back at 2017 as the 
year Velocys transformed into a renewable 
fuels company. Although some of these 
changes were difficult they have set up 
the Company for the future delivery of 
multiple biorefineries and long-term 
sustainable growth. The ENVIA plant has 
validated our FT technology at commercial 
scale and from this platform we plan to 
grow and be at the forefront of supplying 
significant quantities of cellulosic 
renewable fuels. We have a demanding 
plan to deliver in 2018, but we are well 
placed to meet these challenges.

Project overview – ENVIA
ENVIA Energy, LLC (ENVIA) is a joint venture, of which 
Velocys is an equity partner, formed to produce renewable 
diesel, naphtha and wax from landfill gas and natural gas. 
The Velocys reactors and catalyst that are at the heart 
of the plant are performing at commercial scale in line 
with performance requirements. The same core Velocys 
technology will be deployed in future biorefineries that we 
and our partners are developing. 
Operational milestones achieved 
ENVIA, with significant financial, 
operational and commercial support 
from Velocys, achieved a number of key 
milestones at the Oklahoma City site 
over the course of 2017 . In February 2017 
the first Fischer-Tropsch (FT) products 
were successfully produced. The first 
finished, saleable products (waxes, 
diesel and naphtha in the approximate 
proportion 45%:45%:10%) were produced 
in June 2017 , and from September, ENVIA 
commenced delivery of product to its 
offtakers. In October, the key capacity 
milestone of 200 barrels per day (bpd) was 
successfully reached. This enabled the 
impairment on the loan note recorded in 
the 2017 interim statement to be reversed 
(see note 20 for more details).
A large proportion of the products made 
at the plant is manufactured using landfill 
gas – a renewable resource. At the end 
of December 2017 , the fuel produced 
at the Oklahoma City plant met the 
necessary requirements to be submitted 
for qualification under the Renewable 
Fuel Standard (RFS), and as a result 
ENVIA submitted a number of Renewable 
Identification Number (RIN) credits to the 
registration system. 
In March 2018 (post-period end), the RINs 
produced at ENVIA were verified under 
the Quality Assurance Program approved 
by the US Environmental Protection 
Agency. In the same month, ENVIA signed 
a RIN purchase and sale agreement with 
TransMontaigne Product Services, LLC, 
which will purchase, at a fixed price, all 
of the available RINs generated for a six-
month term beginning in April 2018. This 
was an important milestone for ENVIA as 
a significant proportion of the revenues 
of the plant could be derived from the 
ongoing sale of RINs. Financial modelling 
shows that RIN revenues are required for 
the plant to be cash flow positive.
The RINs produced at ENVIA are the first 
RINs generated by Velocys technology 
and the first generated anywhere in 
the US associated with a FT process 
on landfill gas. This landmark in itself 
represents a further validation step for 
Velocys’ strategy to build biorefineries that 
convert forestry residues to renewable 
fuels. It also demonstrates that Velocys 
has acquired the knowledge of the RIN 
qualification system to enable it to secure 
income from this revenue stream from its 
future biorefineries.
The ENVIA plant management team has 
implemented a strong Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) culture that has 
delivered over 600 days without lost time 
injuries on site as of the end of March 
2018 (post-period end). 
Operational involvement for Velocys
Under a secondment agreement with 
ENVIA, from July 2016 the Velocys 
operations team brought essential 
support to ENVIA during commissioning, 
start-up and the early stage operational 
optimisation. As planned, the majority of 
the Velocys operational and engineering 
team was demobilised in Q1 2017 as the 
permanent ENVIA operations team was 
phased in and fully trained. However, a 
small number of key Velocys operational 
management staff were seconded to 
ENVIA under contract over a longer 
transition period. The Velocys team 
continues to support ENVIA operations. 
Challenges and learnings
In 2017 the commissioning and operation 
of the ENVIA plant by the ENVIA team 
brought many challenges and additional 
learning points that Velocys, as licensor, 
will be able to use in future projects. These 
operational challenges required additional 
funding of ENVIA from Velocys, and that 
is discussed in the Financial review on 
pages 16 to 17 . 
The EPC for the ENVIA project, Ventech 
Engineers International, LLC, entered 
bankruptcy proceedings in April 2017 , 
during the commissioning of the plant. 
(VPI LF-GTL, who is a part owner of 
ENVIA Energy LLC, was not subject to 
the bankruptcy proceedings). During 
this period, Velocys was called upon to 
leverage its experienced team of technical 
advisors to support the ENVIA team on 
site, which allowed work to proceed close 
to the original plan, as well as supporting 
the delivery of the subsequent operational 
milestones. 
As part of the commissioning process, 
throughout 2017 the ENVIA team, 
supported by Velocys’ technical advisors, 
implemented improvements to the 
plant’s control system. This has removed 
a number of single point failures of the 
plant and has significantly decreased the 
number of spurious trips associated with 
the non-FT units, leading to improved 
operational reliability.
Next operational steps 
In the first few months of 2018 the 
ENVIA team has continued to deliver 
the plant improvements needed to 
optimise production and increase plant 
productivity. Until the leak reported 
earlier this month has been remedied, 
ENVIA’s aim will be to operate the plant 
using one FT reactor. ENVIA’s priority is 
to develop a solution that will return the 
plant to full operation with minimal loss 
of revenue, whilst always assuring safety 
and minimising the risk of impact to 
the environment. 
ENVIA and Velocys are continuing to 
accumulate performance data from the 
ENVIA plant which will be shared with 
potential industry and financial partners 
for the Mississippi biorefinery. 
Capital expenditure and financing
The ENVIA plant reached mechanical 
completion in September 2016. The plant 
capex to that date was around $80m. 
The capacity of the ENVIA plant was 
designed to be 250 bpd, to match the 
amount of landfill gas available from the 
neighbouring landfill site. 
At year end the Company’s investment 
in ENVIA was impaired by £2.7m 
predominantly to reflect a revision of the 
expected income from RINs. ENVIA plant 
finances and the increased equity stake 
for Velocys are discussed in the Financial 
review (pages 16 to 17). Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 11

Introduction
The first Velocys biorefinery using 
forestry residues as feedstock will be 
sited in Natchez, Mississippi. It is being 
designed to produce approximately 
20m gallons/yr of renewable fuels and 
30m D3/D7 RINs/yr (from 2023) from 
approximately 900 tonnes/day of dry 
woody biomass residues. 
Loan guarantee
A key milestone was reached in June 2017 
when the US Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) invited Velocys to submit a Phase 
II Application to obtain a loan guarantee 
for the biorefinery. The loan guarantee 
could apply to up to $200m of debt as part 
of the total installed cost of the project. 
This would be one of the components 
of the overall financing package for 
the project and, if successful, would 
financially de-risk the project. Velocys 
has engaged the leading global project 
finance bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking 
Corporation (SMBC) as the lender of 
record. SMBC is also Velocys’ financial 
advisor for the project.

Technology partners and suppliers
The Company began the process of 
selecting technology partners for its 
biorefinery in early 2017 and continues to 
assess and refine its choice of partners. 
ThermoChem Recovery International 
(TRI) is the Company’s partner for the 
gasification of woody biomass. TRI is 
an innovative leader in its field and has 
committed significant resources to a joint 
work programme. The Company is also 
engaging with other technology licensors 
in key areas of the process design, 
integrating with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch 
(FT) technology. The Company has signed 
a supply contract for the fabrication of 
its reactor cores with Alabama Specialty 
Products, which has previously worked 
with Velocys in the development of its 
reactor cores and built the cores for its 
demonstration reactors.

Integrated technology demonstration 
Early in 2017 the skid-mounted FT 
section of the Velocys pilot plant was 
relocated from Ohio to TRI’s facility 
in Durham, North Carolina, where it 
was combined with TRI’s gasification 
technology to form an integrated 
gasification/FT technology demonstration. 
An initial run has been completed at 
this integrated demonstration unit. 
Site selection
In October 2017 Velocys signed a site 
option agreement with Adams County 
in the State of Mississippi to locate 
a biorefinery in Natchez, Mississippi. 
Velocys has been offered economic 
development incentives from Adams 
County estimated to be worth the 
equivalent of $42m. The project expects 
to qualify for additional incentives worth 
up to $15m, provided via Mississippi’s 
Advantage Jobs Act and other statutory 
tax incentives. These incentive 
packages would reduce the Company’s 
future tax liabilities and are subject 
to Velocys meeting certain minimum 
requirements for capital investment 
and local employment opportunities.
Velocys has also received commitments 
from Adams County worth approximately 
$4m, relating to the land and upgrades 
to the site, and a further $1m site 
upgrade commitments from local 
utility suppliers.
The site and local area have many 
advantages:
 
Excellent transportation 
infrastructure options including 
barge, rail and road.
 
Accessible utilities.
 
The availability of an abundant local 
supply of low cost RFS-qualifying 
forestry residues.
 
A local workforce skilled in servicing 
the forestry industry.
 
Land that meets all the required 
criteria including space and terrain to 
support an industrial development.
 
A local community with facilities 
and amenities that will attract 
additional skilled personnel 
during construction and ongoing 
plant  operations.
 
An attractive regulatory and 
tax regime.
The 100-acre Natchez site was 
confirmed after the Company analysed 
a broad set of operational and tax 
considerations at twelve possible sites 
in four states in the Southeastern 
United States. Due diligence was 
completed at each of these sites and 
incentive offers were received from 
each state in question. This process 
has laid the foundation for the potential 
locations of future biorefineries.
Site permitting and environmental 
review activities are ongoing and will 
continue through to FID and beyond. 
In the short term, review activities are 
focused on finalising the Environmental 
Assessment. Velocys has the aim of 
being a responsible member of the 
local community in Mississippi and 
is engaging with the community and 
local authorities to ensure that key 
stakeholders are on board to create 
a platform of success for the project.
Engineering
The pre-FEED engineering study was 
successfully completed in Q4 2017 by 
IHI E&C. In Q1 2018, after a competitive 
process, Velocys selected an engineering 
partner to carry out a scoping and 
optimisation study . Velocys and its 
engineering partner are continuing to work 
through the process of cost and value 
engineering to optimise plant capital cost, 
operating costs, carbon intensity and the 
total returns from the project. The phasing 
of the FEED work is expected to allow FID 
to be reached in 2H 2019.
Feedstock and offtake
The Company has agreed term sheets 
with several potential offtakers for the 
renewable fuels and the RINs and Low 
Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits to be 
produced by the Mississippi biorefinery . 
Draft product offtake agreements are being 
negotiated, and as such Velocys is well 
placed to sign final offtake agreements 
shortly prior to FID. After discussions 
with a number of potential suppliers of 
feedstocks to the biorefinery , the Company 
has confidence that it can source sufficient 
local RFS-qualifying feedstock that meets 
the Company’s target overall feedstock 
price. Feedstock agreements have been 
prepared, and supply logistics are being 
tested as part of the IDU process in order 
to reduce operational risk. Velocys is a 
member of the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Biomaterials to ensure that it has all the 
appropriate sustainability policies in place 
supporting feedstock supply .
The programme delivering FID
The project continues to move forward 
as planned but there remain a number of 
risks that require mitigation as the project 
advances (see pages 20 to 22). For example, 
it is uncertain whether all the permits 
will be secured to build and operate a 
biorefinery on the site selected. There 
remain a number of key milestones still 
to be delivered, and in particular , project 
equity funding has not yet been secured. 
The immediate focus is to complete all the 
work packages required by the USDA loan 
guarantee programme. The Company is 
in detailed discussions with a number of 
potential strategic partners and is planning 
to secure the investment to fund the 
remaining project development activities in 
the second half of 2018. The aim is to reach 
FID during 2H 2019.

A partnership, including British Airways, Suez and V elocys, 
has been formed to prepare the business case for the UK’ s first 
commercial scale waste-to-renewable fuels plant. This plant 
would take hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year of post-
recycled waste, destined for landfill or incineration, and convert 
it into clean-burning, sustainable fuels. 
Project overview – UK waste-to-jet fuel 
The market and project
The changes to the Renewable Transport 
Fuels Obligation (RTFO), recently passed 
through Parliament, provide the required 
commercial platform for this project; 
for the first time, jet fuel is to qualify for 
credits under the RTFO. These changes 
to the RTFO are designed to promote 
sustainable aviation and heavy goods 
transport; once implemented, they are 
expected to provide long-term policy 
support for this market.
All members of the partnership are 
providing funding for the initial feasibility 
stage of the project that began in 
September 2017 . The plant is being 
designed to have a capacity of around 
30,000 tonnes of fuel/year (10m gal/  yr). 
The project is at an early stage and 
therefore there remains uncertainty with 
regards to: project economics, whether 
the partners will be willing to fund the 
project through successive development 
phases to FID, and whether the 
combination of risk and return will make 
the project attractive to other investors 
and lenders. However, the Company is 
optimistic that the project will progress 
to the next development stage and the 
overall plan is that FID will be delivered 
in 1H 2020.
Velocys intends to supply its technology 
to the plant and provide project 
management, engineering, operations 
and technical service support to the 
project going forward. Velocys is leading 
the initial feasibility stage of the project. 
Project benefits
CO
2
The jet fuel produced is expected 
to deliver over 70% greenhouse 
gas reduction and 90% reduction 
in particulate matter emissions 
compared with conventional jet fuel, 
thereby contributing to both carbon 
emissions reductions and local air 
quality improvements around  
major airports. 
Each 10,000 tonnes of renewable road 
fuels produced would result in a net 
reduction of CO
2
 equivalent to taking 
7 ,600 cars off the road. 
The planned plant would produce 
enough fuel to power all BA’s flights 
on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner from 
London to San Jose, California and 
New Orleans, Louisiana.
Operation of the plant would lead to 
significant reduction of the amount 
of waste going to landfill. 
The process is fundamentally different 
to incineration. There are no toxic 
emissions, no fly ash or bottom ash 
and a greater proportion of the energy 
content in the waste is reused. 
The partners
Members of the partnership include:
British Airways, the UK’s largest 
international airline, which intends to fly 
with the renewable jet fuel produced by 
the plant.
Suez, a world leading expert in recycling 
and waste management, which intends 
to provide technical and operational 
expertise and manage the supply of 
feedstock to the project.

steps: production of syngas; the Fischer-
Tropsch (FT) conversion process; and 
upgrading to produce finished products. 
The biorefinery can be “tuned” to produce 
either high quality, clean jet fuel or diesel 
with a small volume of naphtha as a co-
product. With a variation to the upgrading 
unit operations, other products can 
be generated, such as waxes. The 
Company’s Mississippi biorefinery will 
use forestry residues as feedstock, but 
it is possible to use other feedstocks in 
plants deploying Velocys’ technology. For 
example, landfill gas and natural gas are 
used as feedstock at ENVIA.
Fuels produced
With the demand for diesel and jet fuel 
increasing, plants using FT technology 
and biomass as feedstock could provide 
a significant supply of renewable fuels 
that the US market demands. There is 
considerable legislative support for 
these renewable fuels at both the US 
federal and state level. FT fuels are fully 
compatible with existing infrastructure 
and engines, which is not the case 
for other methods of producing fuels 
from biomass (such as ethanol or fatty 
acid esters). 
Renewable fuels produced by the 
FT process are highly paraffinic and 
do not contain aromatics or sulphur. 
These fuels burn cleaner than 
petroleum-derived fuels, resulting 
in lower emissions of NOx, SOx and 
particulates. Therefore they contribute 
to local air quality improvements as well 
as reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
FT fuels are often blended to improve 
the performance characteristics of 
lower quality petroleum-derived fuels 
(e.g. to increase Cetane number).
Syngas generation
The production of synthesis gas (syngas), 
an optimised mixture of carbon monoxide 
and hydrogen, by reforming natural gas or 
landfill gas, or by gasification of biomass 
or waste.
The Fischer- Tropsch process
The FT process converts the syngas into 
paraffinic hydrocarbons. 
Upgrading
Upgrading to produce finished products 
such as high quality diesel, jet fuel, 
waxes, as well as naphtha.

Revenues
Revenue in 2017 was £0.8m (2016: £1.4m), 
which was made up of lease of catalyst 
to ENVIA, engineering support for ENVIA 
and revenues from feasibility studies, 
predominantly for the UK waste-to-jet 
fuel project. Gross profit was £0.4m 
(2016: £0.4m).
There was one key contract, with ENVIA. 
Revenue from the lease of catalyst to 
ENVIA was recognised in the financial 
results throughout 2017 on a monthly 
basis, in line with the lease terms. 
Revenue for reactor sales to ENVIA 
was recognised in 2015.
Expenses and income
Total administrative expenses increased 
to £21.9m before exceptional items 
and £53.4m after exceptional items 
(2016: £17 .4m before/£20.2m after 
exceptional items). £1.6m of this increase 
before exceptional items was due to 
a change in methodology used in the 
amortisation of intangible assets from 
the units-of-production to the straight-
line method (see note 17) and does not 
represent an increase in the cost base 
of the Company. The remaining increase 
before exceptionals reflected increased 
spending on project development, 
predominantly for the Mississippi project, 
including the pre-FEED engineering study 
and the joint technology demonstration 
with TRI. 
The savings that arose during 2017 from 
the reduction in the number of employees 
and the closing of the Company’s UK R&D 
facility in the summer of 2017 offset the 
costs of closure during the year. Full year 
savings will be realised in 2018 and are 
likely to be just less than £2m. 
Financial review
“The fundraises in Q2 201 7 and Q1 201 8 (post-period 
end) provide V elocys with the funds to help take 
forward the development of the Mississippi biorefinery 
whilst we engage with potential strategic project 
development capital investors. ”
Andrew Morris
Non-Executive Director & Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee 
The increase in administrative expenses 
after exceptional items is discussed in 
the section Impairment on assets and 
investments below. 
Other income of £0.2m/£1.9m before/
after exceptional items (2016: 
£0.3m/£2.8m before/after exceptional 
items) was from the sale of assets, mostly 
associated with the closure of the UK 
R&D facility (see note 9). In September 
2017 Velocys increased its equity share 
and voting rights in ENVIA following 
the exit of NRG from the joint venture 
for no consideration. The Company has 
recorded an exceptional item being a 
gain on bargain purchase of £1,750,000 
in respect of this step acquisition (see 
note 4 and note 19 for more information). 
The disposal of assets from the facility is 
discussed in the Corporate governance 
report on page 29. 
Assets and cash
Net assets of the Company were £14.7m, 
down from £63.7m in 2016. £34.6m of 
this decrease is due to the impairment 
of assets (see below) and £16.6m is due 
to the reduction in cash balance. Velocys 
retained a cash balance (cash and 
cash equivalents) at year end totalling 
£2. 1m (excluding restricted cash) (2016: 
£18.7m), which has been subsequently 
increased with the addition of £17 .0m 
from the fundraise in January 2018 
(after expenses).
Cash outflow in 2017 was £16.6m (2016: 
£19.4m) comprising £16.3m consumed 
by operations, less an R&D tax credit 
received of £1.0m, and a £9.8m increase in 
the loan to ENVIA, offset by cash received 
through the May 2017 fundraise of £9.7m 
(after expenses). The net cash used in 
operating activities was reduced from 
£19.3m to £15.3m. The profile of the cash 
spend changed significantly in 2017 as 
the Company reduced its traditional R&D 
overheads and increased initial spending 
on project development activities that 
supported the new strategy. 
Compared to 2016, movement in foreign 
exchange had relatively little impact.
Impairment on assets and investments
For the impairment assessment the 
recoverable amount has been determined 
based on its fair value less costs of 
disposal (‘fair value’), by reference to 
the total value of the parent company’s 
equity, using the discounted share issue 
price at the January 2018 fundraise of 
10p per share. As a result an impairment 
of £31.5m was recorded against a range 
of assets, including Goodwill and mainly 
In-process technology, as described in 
note 17 . As described below there were 
additional impairments to ENVIA (£2.7m) 
and other minor asset impairments 
(£0.4m). There has been no change in 
the Board’s assessment of the long-
term potential of these assets. This 
impairment (excluding that in respect 
of Goodwill) could be reversed in the 
future should there be a change in the 
estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount.
ENVIA finances and increased equity 
stake for Velocys 
From the proceeds of Velocys’ May 2017 
fundraise (see below), $3.4m (£2.7m) was 
allocated to increase the loan facility 
the Company made available to ENVIA in 
January 2016 in order to bridge ENVIA to 
becoming cash flow positive. In October 
2017 in order to meet the key operational 
milestone of achieving 200 bpd and to  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 17
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
www.velocys.com
support continued operations, Velocys 
increased the loan arrangement by 
a further $0.7m to $13.4m (£0.6m to 
£10.6m). This was necessitated after 
a lower revenue forecast, based on a 
revision of product and RIN pricing, was 
produced. The loan facility was increased 
by $0.4m (£0.3m) in December 2017 and 
$2. 1m (£1.7m) in Q1 2018 (post-period 
end) – the additional support being 
required to enable ENVIA to progress its 
operational ramp-up and RIN qualification 
programmes. At each date, all other terms 
of the loan, which has a 10% coupon, 
remained unchanged. As of 31 December 
2017 , $13.0m (£9.6m) of the loan note had 
been drawn down. 
At the end of September 2017 , the 
Company increased its voting rights in 
ENVIA after one of the members of the 
joint venture, NRG Energy, exited the joint 
venture (JV). NRG Energy transferred 
its ownership units and all associated 
economic rights associated with them to 
the other JV partners. The voting rights 
for the three remaining JV members, 
including Velocys, were accordingly 
increased to 33% each. There was no 
consideration paid in respect of this 
transaction, nor will there be in the future. 
This was reflected as a gain on bargain 
purchase as an exceptional item in the 
income statement, see notes 4 and 19. 
This change in voting rights has not 
impacted operations at the Oklahoma 
City plant. 
At year end the Company’s investment 
in ENVIA was impaired by £2.7m to 
predominantly reflect a revision of the 
expected income from RINs. Because 
the key capacity milestone of 200 bpd 
was successfully achieved at the plant 
in October 2017 , the impairment to 
the ENVIA loan note made in the 2017 
interims statement was reversed 
(see note 20). There are no remaining 
contractual milestones within the ENVIA 
joint venture agreement of the nature that 
gave rise to the impairment of the ENVIA 
loan note facility at 2017 interims. 
Fundraises
In May 2017 Velocys secured additional 
funding of over £10m (before expenses). 
This included convertible loan notes as 
well as a placing of new ordinary shares. 
Proceeds from this fundraise were used 
to fund working capital during the first 
phase of the renewable fuels strategy 
implementation, as well as the following 
activities supporting the development of 
the Mississippi biorefinery project:
 
Pre-FEED engineering study.
 
The Integrated Demonstration Unit 
programme.
 
Site selection and permitting.
 
Consultants and financing.
As noted above, the proceeds of the 
May 2017 fundraise were also used to 
extend the loan note facility the Company 
made available to ENVIA to support the 
pre-cash generative phase of operation.
In January 2018 (post-period end) 
Velocys raised a total of £18.4m (before 
expenses) via a firm placing and open 
offer. Both funding elements were strongly 
supported by existing major shareholders. 
Over half of the firm placing shares were 
placed with the Company's existing 
shareholders and the rest with a number 
of significant new shareholders.
Net proceeds of the capital raising will 
be used predominantly: 
 
To fund development costs for the 
Mississippi biorefinery project to 
bridge to the on-boarding of one or 
more strategic investors.
 
To progress the Company's UK waste-
to-renewable jet fuel project.
 
To fund the Company's working capital 
and central operating costs.
 
To provide working capital to ENVIA in 
order to bridge the asset to sustainable 
cash generation.
Future funding 
The financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, 
which assumes the Company will 
have sufficient funds available to 
enable it to continue to trade for the 
foreseeable future. The cash forecast 
includes the following assumptions: 
(i) securing strategic development 
capital investment into the Mississippi 
biorefinery project during the second 
half of 2018; and (ii) subject to (i), the 
Company assessing its cash requirements 
and determining whether it needs to 
raise additional funding during 2018 or 
2019. These assumptions are discussed 
further in note 2. 
In January 2018 the Company estimated 
that its total remaining operating 
costs and the Mississippi biorefinery 
project costs, as of year-end 2017 , to 
get to FID (assumed at the time to be 
mid-  year 2019), would be £40-50m. The 
Company’s plan is to secure investment 
by one or more strategic partners in to 
the Mississippi biorefinery project in 2H 
2018. Should the Company not secure 
strategic investment, it will need to 
seek further funding in order to cover 
development costs and working capital 
requirements. This funding may be 
achieved from one or a combination of, 
a capital raising (including the possibility 
of a placement of ordinary shares within 
the next 12 months) or the realisation 
of certain assets for example: selling its 
stake or security in the ENVIA project; 
selling additional technology licences 
(such as the licence recently sold to Red 
Rock Biofuels); and selling non-core 
intellectual property.
Following FID in 2019 the Company’s 
funding requirements will depend on 
the final structure of the Mississippi 
biorefinery project consortium and on the 
Company’s strategy to develop and fund 
other projects. Risks and uncertainties 
regarding the Mississippi project are 
detailed on pages 20 to 22.

Corporate social responsibility and KPIs
Key performance indicators (KPIs)  
and milestones
As a result of the strategy review carried 
out in 2016, the Company’s KPIs and 
milestones have changed significantly over 
the last two years. A new set of KPIs are 
in the process of being developed. In 2017 
the key milestones for the Company were 
as follows:
1. Capitalise the business to progress 
the strategy throughout the year.
2. Complete construction, 
commissioning, start-up and RIN 
qualification at ENVIA.
3. Execute the Company-wide 
restructuring programme.
4. Secure entry to Phase II of the USDA 
Loan Guarantee Program.
5. Secure early stage consortium funding 
for the UK waste-to-jet-project 
feasibility study.
Financial results were reviewed on 
a regular basis by directors. As the 
Company’s remaining cash was reduced 
at the end of the year, a careful monitoring 
of the cash and cash commitments was 
undertaken to ensure that all the fiduciary 
responsibilities and commitments of the 
directors were met.
The performance of the Company against 
these milestones is expanded upon in the 
CEO’s report on pages 8 to 9. The financial 
results are outlined on pages 16 to 17 .
Environment
Velocys recognises that as a renewable 
fuels company it has a duty to limit 
the environmental impact of its own 
operations. As such, the Company is 
careful to monitor the environmental 
impact of its operations. Air travel and 
buildings operation have been identified as 
two of the major factors in the Company’s 
CO
2
 emissions. 
In 2017 air travel on the Company’s 
behalf contributed 464t of CO
2
 (2016: 
467t). This equates to 7 .7t per employee 
(2016: 5.2t). The proportion of air travel 
that was between the Company’s offices 
in Oxfordshire, Ohio and Texas was 38% 
(2016: 54%); 16% of the emissions arose 
from travel to the site of ENVIA ’s plant 
in Oklahoma and 14% of the emissions 
arose from travel to the site of the 
Integrated Technology Demonstration in 
North Carolina.
Emissions attributable to operation 
of its three sites included 430t from 
consumption of electricity (2016: 769t). 
Emissions attributable to the consumption 
of gas were 143t (2016: 436t). These 
reductions were due to the ceasing of 
certain R&D operations in July 2017 
including the closing down of the UK 
R&D facility.
Employees
Velocys is committed to being a good 
employer and endeavours to train staff 
well, to pay them fair market value and 
to maintain a safe environment in which 
they can work. Velocys is committed to 
equal opportunities for all its employees. 
Of the 42 people working for Velocys at 
31 December 2017 , 33% were female 
(2016: 33%). At the end of 2017 , one 
of the six members of the Board was 
female (2016: two of eight members). 
The percentage of female employees 
broken down by areas of the business 
was as shown to the right. 
The restructuring of the Company in 
mid-2017 reduced the seven senior 
managers of the Senior Management 
Team to four members of the Executive 
Committee. This partially accounted for 
the difference in the percentage of female 
senior managers between 2016 and 2017 
(2017: 0%, 2016: 29%).
Velocys takes the safety and well-being 
of its employees very seriously . As an 
example, in October 2016 the Columbus, 
Ohio site successfully renewed for an 
additional three years its Safety and Health 
Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) 
certification with the US Department of 
Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration. SHARP certification 
recognises Velocys’ exemplary injury and 
illness prevention programme. Velocys 
has created a culture of safety , health, 
and environmental responsibility and 
continuous improvement that extends from 
the CEO to all employees. Each employee 
is encouraged to actively participate in, 
and take responsibility for , their own safety 
and health through various opportunities, 
such as by providing suggestions for 
improvement, participating in safety and 
environmental training and site meetings. 
Holding leadership positions on the 
site’s Safety Committee, or serving on 
an investigation team that performs root 
cause analysis of potential hazards or near 
misses at the site is actively encouraged. 
Velocys maintains detailed records that 
are required for regulatory compliance, 
and also ensures safety policy , programme, 
and hazard communication documents 
are available to all staff. As a result of the 
proactive culture adopted throughout 
Velocys, during 2017 , there were no  
Lost-Time Accidents (L TA) across the 
Company’s sites. This takes the total 
number of operating labour hours without 
an L TA to over 2.5m in the United States 
and over 350,000 in the United Kingdom.

Risks and mitigation
The principal risks and uncertainties that are considered to have a potentially 
material impact on the Company’s long-term performance and delivery of its 
strategy are set out in the following table. 
Risk description and impact
Business 
influences Risk management strategy
Risks specific to ENVIA
As one of three members of the ENVIA joint venture 
(JV), the Company relies on the continued support of 
the other members to keep the plant in operation. If 
the plant ceases to operate due to withdrawal of one 
or more JV members, this would reduce the amount of 
operating data available to Velocys, which might affect 
the design of the Mississippi biorefinery. Cessation of 
plant operations could also jeopardise ENVIA’s ability 
to pay back amounts loaned to ENVIA by Velocys.
The on-site team has been building a comprehensive 
data set of operational performance. Prior to the leak 
at ENVIA in May 2018 economic projections showed 
positive cash flow for the ENVIA plant during 2Q 2018, 
which will now be delayed. A solution is being developed 
to return the plant to full operation with minimal loss of 
revenue. 
No ENVIA EPC recourse
Due to the bankruptcy filing of Ventech Engineers 
International, LLC, there may be no financial recourse 
to the EPC of the ENVIA plant for problems that would 
normally be the responsibility of the EPC. The inability to 
recover damages against the EPC could result in ENVIA ’s 
having to shoulder liabilities that should otherwise be 
allocated to the EPC, resulting in additional expense for 
Velocys and other JV members. 
ENVIA, with support from Velocys, is continuing to identify 
and mitigate ongoing EPC legacy issues at the plant in 
a timely and cost-effective way . The impact of this risk 
is significantly reduced as the operational life of ENVIA 
increases.
Product offtake and acceptance
There can be no guarantee that contracts with offtakers 
of product – wax, diesel and naphtha – will be adhered to, 
or renewed, or that product specifications will reliably be 
met. Failure to have reliable, long-term offtakers or active 
spot sales of products could affect revenue forecasts and 
ongoing operations. 
ENVIA is in frequent dialogue with multiple product 
offtakers (current and potential) to ensure that the 
revenues from sales of products will continue with 
new offtakers should current offtakers default on their 
obligations. Products are being accepted and sold in the 
market.
Revenues from sale of RINs
RINs generated by ENVIA have been verified and now have 
Q-RIN status, but there are no guarantees that the plant 
will run within the required operational parameters that 
allow RINs to be generated and maximise revenues. This 
may hinder ENVIA in its efforts to become sustainably 
net cash generative and this would adversely affect the 
members of the JV , including Velocys.
The on-site ENVIA team will continue to deliver the 
plant improvements needed to optimise operations to 
maximise production of on-specification products and 
Q-RINs. 
Risks specific to Mississippi biorefinery project 
Any risk or combination of risks listed here has the potential of preventing the project from reaching FID, which would prevent 
Velocys from extracting value from its development activities.
USDA loan guarantee 
The Company is applying for a USDA loan guarantee of up 
to $200m as part of the total installed cost of the project. 
If other companies exhaust the capacity of the programme 
or if Velocys does not complete the necessary work 
programmes to achieve conditional commitment before 
the end of September 2018 and if the programme is 
no longer authorised in the 2019 Congressional Fiscal 
Year then Velocys will need to seek alternative forms of 
financing and/or underwriting, and it is not guaranteed 
that it could do so. 
Velocys has engaged advisers in Washington DC to 
ensure it understands the requirements of the USDA 
loan guarantee programme. Velocys and its advisors 
continuously monitor the USDA programme and any 
potential changes. The Company is prioritising the delivery 
of the work packages required by the USDA programme to 
maximise the probability of securing the loan guarantee 
for the full $200m. 
Velocys is actively engaging with strategic investors 
and financial advisers to support the financing plans 
and manage the associated financing risks for the 
Mississippi project. 
Project finance
Velocys will need to secure strategic project investment 
for development capital costs to progress the Mississippi 
biorefinery project to FID. If this is not secured or is 
delayed this would adversely affect the project timeline 
and may impact the financial status of the Company . 
The Company has commenced a process to select 
and on-board one or more strategic and/or financial 
investors to support financing the remaining project 
development capital requirements for the Mississippi 
project. A financial advisor, appointed by Velocys, will 
manage the process of due diligence, deal construction 
and closure. Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 21

Risks specific to Mississippi biorefinery project (continued)
Independent Engineer’s report
Successful completion of the USDA loan guarantee 
application requires a review by an Independent 
Engineer . The IE’s report will require successful and 
timely extended runs at both ENVIA and the Integrated 
Technology Demonstration. 
Velocys has engaged the Independent Engineer early in 
the process to ensure it understands their requirements 
and provides the information needed by them at the time 
required. The performance at ENVIA and the Integrated 
Technology Demonstration is monitored closely . See 
page 23 for a discussion of technology integration risks. 
SMBC underwriting of the USDA loan guarantee
The global leading project finance bank, Sumitomo Mitsui 
Banking Corporation (SMBC), is Velocys’ lender of record 
for the USDA loan guarantee programme. In this role 
SMBC will be required to hold 15% of the project debt for 
the USDA loan guarantee. Failure to pass SMBC credit 
committee preliminary and final approval in the currently 
anticipated timeframe could materially impact the 
financing options for the project.
Velocys and SMBC are working closely together to ensure 
the requirements of the SMBC credit committee are 
clearly understood. Both SMBC and Velocys are working 
closely with the USDA to ensure the USDA-required 
deliverables are being used to drive the combined 
Velocys and SMBC activities.
Capital expenditure and operational  
expenditure required
There remains uncertainty regarding the expenditure 
required to build and operate the biorefinery as well as 
the scope and strength of the EPC wrap and the credit 
worthiness of the EPC. Capex or opex could be higher than 
desired, which could negatively impact plant economics 
and financing.
Velocys has chosen an engineering partner for FEED. 
Completion of the FEED package will reduce the 
uncertainty surrounding plant capital expenditure. The 
project will optimise plant capital cost, operating costs, 
carbon intensity and the total returns from the project. 
Velocys has engaged an estimating advisor to validate 
the FEED package provided by the EPC. These risks are 
normal for this stage of the project. Going forward, risks 
will be mitigated and reduced as the project continues. 
Performance of and integration with other licensors’ 
technology
Syngas production, syngas clean-up or product upgrading 
technology , supplied by other licensors, may not function 
as hoped or may not integrate as envisaged with Velocys 
technology , which could cause the plant to operate  
sub-optimally .
Velocys works with technology companies that have 
proven track records of commercial operation. Velocys 
and its technology partner TRI are collaborating on a 
joint technology demonstration, which is currently in 
operation. Although the demonstration is not complete, 
initial performance indicates good performance of the 
FT system operating on biomass-generated syngas. 
A successful outcome will significantly reduce but not 
eliminate the technology integration risks associated 
with the development of the biorefinery.
Carbon intensity threshold
Due to process constraints Velocys may not be able 
to meet cost-effectively the required carbon intensity 
threshold needed to maximise the LCFS credits it could 
obtain in California. Failure to do so would limit revenues 
from plant operations.
Velocys is actively factoring into the engineering design 
the carbon intensity impacts to provide the maximum 
product revenue that is economically viable.

Risks specific to Mississippi biorefinery project (continued)
Site considerations
The site is adjacent to the Mississippi River and a 
catastrophic flooding event could impact the site and 
plant itself. If the levee constructions were not completed 
by the local economic development agency , project delays 
and additional costs could arise.
During construction, start-up/commissioning and 
operations of the biorefinery , hurricanes, tornadoes 
and forest fires could also adversely affect timelines, 
operability or costs.
The Company must issue a comprehensive Environmental 
Assessment, which needs to be endorsed by the relevant 
state and federal authorities. If the Company does not 
receive a Finding of No Significant Issues (FONSI) it could 
lead to delays, additional costs or the requirement to find 
an alternative site. 
Changes to the local demand for woody biomass or ability 
of the existing forestry industry infrastructure to transport 
RFS qualifying feedstock to the plant could increase the 
cost of supply or increase complexity by increasing the 
distance over which feedstock has to be sourced. 
The biorefinery will be protected by a levee, currently 
under construction, which puts the site outside the 
100-year flood plain. Construction of the level and 
biorefinery will run concurrently. Velocys will monitor 
the levee construction progress and take appropriate 
action for mitigation if required. During the build of 
the biorefinery Velocys intends to ensure it has the 
necessary flood insurance in place.
The design of the facility is incorporating the relevant 
codes for the potential weather conditions for the safe 
start-up and shutdown in adverse weather situations. 
The team will also put in place an emergency response 
plan prior to start of construction and start-up that will 
align with local and state emergency plans for emergency 
situations that includes adverse weather conditions.
The Company performed thorough due diligence of the 
Natchez site prior to confirming it as the biorefinery’s 
location. This included site visits and analysis of a 
broad set of operational considerations, including 
environmental considerations. Velocys is working with 
a local environmental consultant to work through 
the Environmental Assessment, ensuring the early 
identification of any potential issues. The assessment 
is integrated in the overall project planning process and 
is monitored closely. 
Velocys has engaged a consultant with experience 
of the forestry industry around Natchez and has 
had preliminary discussions with multiple potential 
suppliers. The Company is currently confident that it 
can cost-effectively source RFS-qualifying feedstock. 
Risks specific to UK waste-to-jet fuel project
UK policy
There could continue to be a lack of clarity on future waste 
policy , including maintaining the UK landfill tax and/or 
policy uncertainty around waste for large scale capital 
intensive schemes. 
The project partners are engaging with the UK 
government to provide input to policy decisions related 
to the project. 
Project partnership and economics
There are no guarantees that the project will proceed 
through successive development phases. Existing 
project partners may not be willing to fund the project 
to FID. Capex, opex and revenue estimates derived 
during engineering studies, combined with views on risk, 
may make the project unattractive to other investors 
and lenders. 
The experienced Velocys project team is managing 
the completion of the engineering feasibility study, 
reducing uncertainty on project economics, and is 
validating all the key economic assumptions. Regular 
meetings with the partners have driven alignment 
on project requirements and timeline to making 
investment decisions.

Other operational risks
Performance of Velocys’ technology
Velocys’ core technology may not produce the quantity 
and/or quality of product expected.
Supporting technologies at a biorefinery may not operate 
according to specification, preventing the Fischer- Tropsch 
(FT) section of a plant from functioning optimally . This 
could introduce costs and delays to the project inducing 
delays or reductions in the revenues possible from sales of 
product or RINs.
Inexpert operation of the plant may produce poorer than 
predicted performance.
The Company has rigorously tested its technology in 
the lab, at pilot plant scale, and at commercial scale at 
the ENVIA plant. It has modelled steady state and upset 
operations under conditions that will be experienced at 
future commercial plants. 
At ENVIA Velocys’ core technology has performed 
during start up and steady state operations in line with 
requirements at a commercial scale and meets the 
performance expectations according to models based 
on lab and pilot studies. Indications are that Velocys’ 
technology will be able to meet both quantity and quality 
expectations for finished products.
Velocys works closely with other technology licensors 
and EPC companies on plant integration requirements, 
including the protection of Velocys’ FT technology from 
potential malfunctions in process units other than the 
central FT units. Velocys’ strategy is to de-risk its future 
projects by selecting commercially-proven technologies 
and piloting significant components of the flowsheet. 
Velocys’ team includes qualified employees and 
management with significant expertise in the operation of 
petrochemical and gas-to-liquids plants. For its projects, 
Velocys is focused on engaging operators who are fully 
qualified and well-trained in the operation of such plants. 
Velocys’ predictions of performance are conservatively 
based on the personnel and management resources that 
it has on hand and plans to obtain as its projects proceed 
to implementation. 
Health, safety and/or environmental issues at a plant
An accident or other incident might occur at a plant 
incorporating Velocys’ technology , resulting in injury to 
personnel or their exposure to hazardous conditions. 
An environmental incident might occur at a plant; 
emissions could exceed the permitted level.
The Company has an excellent in-house safety 
record. All employees are trained according to OSHA 
requirements for handling hazardous substances 
and the Company’s HSE procedures and practices 
are outlined on page 19. Velocys intends to provide 
significant input into training materials and operating 
manuals for its future plants. Velocys will provide 
operational management services to support future 
biorefineries that the Company, as well as third party 
developers, develop.
Plants such as ENVIA and the plants Velocys intends 
to develop are carefully designed from inception to 
account for expected upset conditions and to continue 
to operate within the environmental and regulatory 
framework even if problems arise. Plant personnel 
are trained in procedures that identify issues that 
could lead to adverse environmental effects and to act 
accordingly. 
Loss of intellectual property (IP) protection
Velocys’ IP could be stolen, copied or infringed.
Velocys actively manages and invests in its intellectual 
property and currently holds several hundred 
patents in around 30 countries. It has a track record 
of successfully defending its IP portfolio through 
the courts.

Supply chain 
The supply chain may not be able to deliver reactors 
and catalyst on a timescale to meet required plant 
build timescales.
A robust quality assurance programme is followed 
for the supply of commercial catalyst and reactors. 
The manufacturing methodologies are part of Velocys’ IP 
and therefore transferable. 
Employee retention and recruitment
Velocys may not be able to scale the organisation to deliver 
its biorefinery projects. 
Velocys provides competitive compensation to attract 
and retain staff.
The Company has been restructured over the last 12 
months to focus its activities on project development, 
engineering and commercial management. The 
Company is putting in place the required governance 
and processes within key functions that will be 
operational when the Company needs to scale up its 
activities. In addition, Velocys has co-located its project 
management, engineering and commercial teams in 
Houston, which has a readily-available talent pool. 
Market risks
Low oil prices
Oil prices could track the US Energy Information 
Administration’s (EIA ’s) Annual Energy Outlook 2018 low oil 
price case (that assumes a price of Brent crude in 2017 of 
$52 per barrel by 2050).
Velocys’ target market is renewable fuels in the US. 
This market involves using low cost feedstocks and 
producing premium products eligible for valuable RIN 
and LCFS credits. These credits provide a significant 
financial hedge to the impact of a low oil price on the 
price of diesel and jet fuel. 
Future of renewable fuels credits
Renewable fuels credits (such as RINs under the 
Renewable Fuel Standard, RFS) could be withdrawn 
(or their value reduced) at a Federal level in the US. 
Further details on the RFS are given on page 4. 
Renewable fuels credits (such as those issued under 
the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California) could 
be withdrawn.
The economics of Velocys’ biorefineries are dependent 
on the receipt of these RFS and LCFS credits to maintain 
revenues above operational costs.
The RFS is important to many states with large 
agricultural economies, to energy security, and to jobs. 
Velocys engages actively with law makers in Washington 
and works with industry bodies to ensure its voice is 
heard. The RFS continues to see strong support from 
a wide range of stakeholders.
California is proposing to expand the LCFS programme 
to include jet fuel. Carbon pricing is stable in California 
and the state is considering extension of the mandate 
for carbon reductions. Velocys engages actively with 
California regulators, through industry groups, to 
ensure its voice is heard. Similar LCFS requirements 
are in place in Oregon, Washington State and several 
Canadian provinces.
Competing technology
Existing technologies that are economically-competitive 
with Velocys technology in specific niche applications 
could be fully commercialised. Competing technologies 
are indeed approaching commercialisation. However , 
the Company believes that the market is large enough to 
support multiple suppliers.
Velocys and its partners continue to invest in plant 
integration optimisation and modularisation, with the 
aim of significant reductions in cost on a per barrel 
basis. Such advances take time to develop and provide 
Velocys with a significant competitive advantage 
beyond its core Fischer-Tropsch technology capability.
Brexit
There is uncertainty around the impact of the UK leaving 
the European Union.
Velocys does not expect to have significant exposure to 
the European market in the short and medium terms.

Financial risks 
The potentially material financial risks associated with a multinational business, including foreign exchange are presented below. 
All other financial risks assessed by the Company are included in note 25.
Company financing
The Company’s cash usage is significant versus 
prospective future cash flows (particularly in the short 
term) and Velocys is reliant on the support of a small  
group of major shareholders. 
The Board recognises that further funding will be 
needed to reach FID for the Mississippi biorefinery 
project. Note 2 to the financial statements discusses 
uncertainties surrounding the extent and composition 
of future funding. The Company believes that equity 
remains the preferred structure to support the 
business as a going concern in the near term, but 
will keep this under review. Velocys continues to take 
measures to preserve cash in order to protect against 
unforeseen events. 
Exchange rates
As the Company operates in US dollars and pounds 
sterling it may be impacted by fluctuations in 
exchange rates.
Based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts the 
required currency mix is identified and foreign exchange 
contracts taken out accordingly. A number of brokers 
are used to give a balanced market view. Financial risks 
are expanded upon in note 25.

Introduction
Companies whose securities are traded 
on the AIM market of the London Stock 
Exchange are not required to comply with 
the principles and provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 (“Code”). 
For example, the Company does not 
comply with:
 
FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6R (which includes 
the ‘comply or explain’ requirement);
 
FCA Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules (DTR) Section 
7 .2 (which set out certain mandatory 
disclosures);
 
Competition and Markets Authority’s 
Final Order 1 (for UK incorporated 
FTSE 350 companies only).
However, the Board has determined that 
Velocys should maintain high standards 
of corporate governance and, whilst not 
complying fully with the Code including 
the full disclosure requirements, has 
taken steps to adopt the underlying 
principles of the Code in so far as the 
Board considers these to be appropriate 
given the size of the Company and the 
nature of its current operations. The 
information required under Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rule 7 .2.6 
is included in this report.
Board of directors
Independence
In accordance with the Code provision 
A.3. 1, at the time of Pierre Jungels’ 
appointment as Chairman, he met the 
independence criteria set out in this 
provision. While thereafter the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation 
to the chairman, the Board considers 
that he makes a significant contribution 
to the Company and that he has retained 
his independence of character and 
judgement notwithstanding his long-term 
relationship with the Company.
Pierre Jungels has served more than 
three consecutive three year terms of 
office. The Board regards each of the 
other Non-Executive Directors as being 
fully independent. In accordance with 
Code Provision B.7 . 1, resolutions will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting for the re-appointment 
of all directors.
The Board is in the process of reviewing its 
succession plan for all Board members. 
Avoidance of conflicts of interest
The Company has a procedure for the 
disclosure, review, authorisation and 
management of directors’ conflicts 
of interest and potential conflicts 
of interest in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
In deciding whether to authorise a 
conflict or potential conflict, the directors 
must have regard to their general 
duties under the Companies Act 2006. 
The authorisation of any conflict matter, 
and the terms of authorisation are 
subject to determination by the Board 
and regularly reviewed.
Division of responsibility
The roles of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive are separated, with clear 
written guidance to support the division 
of responsibilities. The Chairman is 
principally responsible for leadership 
and effectiveness of the Board, setting 
the Board agenda, ensuring adequacy 
of information flow to the Board, that due 
consideration is given to strategic issues, 
and promotion of a culture of openness 
of debate at Board level, and between 
directors and the executive committee. 
The Chief Executive is primarily 
responsible for the management of 
the business and implementation of 
the Company’s strategy and policies, 
maintaining a close working relationship 
with the Chairman, and leading the 
executive committee. From January 
2015 to February 2018, Julian West 
acted as Senior Independent Director.
The Board and its committees
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for setting the Company’s strategy and 
overseeing its execution, and for the overall 
management, control and performance of 
the Velocys business. It delegates certain 
responsibilities to designated committees, 
as set out above. The committees’ terms of 
reference are reviewed annually against 
regulatory requirements and current 
best practice. Information on the work 
of the three Board committees is set out 
on page 27 .
“Velocys has the long-term ambition to grow 
significantly and to develop into an established 
multinational business. The Company needs to 
have the right governance, processes and culture 
to support and nurture this growth. It also needs 
to have the ability to attract and retain members of 
the team with the capability to deliver its strategy.”

Remuneration and Nominations Committee 
are circulated to the Board. The committee 
chairs also report to the Board on the 
outcome of committee meetings at the 
subsequent Board meeting.
Performance evaluation
This year’s evaluation of the Board and 
its committees has been carried out by 
the Company Secretary , taking the form 
of comprehensive questionnaires, which 
provided all directors with an opportunity 
to comment on Board and committee 
procedures. A performance evaluation 
of the Chairman was carried out, led by 
the Non-Executive Directors, and taking 
into account the views of all directors. 
As in the previous year , the results of the 
evaluation have been considered by the 
Board and each committee in open session 
and, where appropriate, actions arising 
from such reviews will be implemented 
and monitored.
Re-election
The Company’s Articles of Association 
provide that directors are subject to 
election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment, and 
that one third of directors are subject to 
retirement by rotation at each Annual 
General Meeting. At the 2018 meeting, 
all directors will once again stand for  
re-election, continuing the practice 
introduced in 2016.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary , through the 
Chairman, is responsible for advising 
the Board on governance matters, and 
for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules 
and regulations are complied with. 
All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary . 
An agreed procedure exists for directors 
in the furtherance of their duties to take 
independent professional advice. During 
2017 , no director sought independent legal 
advice pursuant to the policy .
Relations with shareholders
The Board considers effective 
communication with shareholders to be 
very important, and encourages regular 
dialogue with investors. Directors regularly 
attend meetings with shareholders and 
analysts throughout the year , and the Board 
responds promptly to questions received. 
Shareholders will be given at least 21 days’ 
notice of the Annual General Meeting,

contains full details of the Company’s 
business activities, as well as press 
releases and other details. It links to the 
London Stock Exchange website for share 
price details, share trading activities and 
graphs, as well as Regulatory News Service 
(RNS) announcements.
Maintenance of a system of  
internal controls
The directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the Company maintains 
a system of internal control to provide them 
with reasonable assurance that the assets 
of the Company are safeguarded and that 
shareholders’ investments are protected. 
The system includes internal controls 
appropriate for a company of the size of 
Velocys, and covers financial, operational, 
compliance (including health and safety) 
and risk management. Such systems are 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives; any system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The process in place for reviewing Velocys’ 
systems of internal control includes 
procedures designed to identify and 
evaluate failings and weaknesses, and, in 
the case of any categorised as significant, 
procedures exist to ensure that necessary 
action is taken to remedy the failings.
The Board has considered its policies with 
regard to internal controls as set out in 
the Code and undertakes assessments 
of the major areas of the business and 
methods used to monitor and control them. 
In addition to financial risk, the review 
covers operational, commercial, regulatory 
and health and safety risks. The risk review 
is an ongoing process with reviews being 
undertaken on a regular basis.
The key procedures designed to provide an 
effective system of internal controls that 
are operating up to the date of sign-off of 
this report are set out below.
Control environment
There is an organisational structure with 
clearly defined lines of responsibility and 
delegation of accountability and authority .
Disposal of assets
As part of the closure of the Milton Park 
site, a large number of assets were taken 
out of the business. A comprehensive 
survey was undertaken of all fixed assets, 
lower value assets, spares and inventory 
parts at the site. Management signed off 
on the process for disposal of these assets, 
and the process was carefully documented. 
Assets that could be sold were targeted 
at potential end users, dealers, clearance 
agents and scrap merchants. A price 
covering the carrying net book value of each 
asset was targeted. All sales were invoiced.
Risk management
The Company employs directors and senior 
personnel with the appropriate knowledge 
and experience for a business active in 
its field of operations, and undertakes 
regular risk assessments and reviews of 
its activities. During 2017 the members 
of the Audit & Risk Committee were 
Andrew Morris (appointed as Chairman 
on 1 June 2017), Mark Chatterji (resigned 
as Chairman on 25 April 2017) and Ross 
Allonby (resigned 15 June 2017), all of 
whom had recent and relevant financial 
experience. Julian West was also a member 
throughout 2017 and Sandy Shaw was 
appointed to the committee in February 
2018. The committee keeps under annual 
review whether an internal audit function 
should be established. Although this is not 
considered necessary at the present time 
given the size of the Company , this decision 
will be reviewed as the operations of the 
Company develop.
In its approach to risk management, the 
committee considers the complexity of 
the process of developing and building 
biorefineries, which involves a large 
number of stakeholders – asset holder , 
project developer , EPC, financing party(ies), 
technology licensors, offtake partners and 
investors. The risks associated with each 
of these parties, and the relationship that 
Velocys has with each one, are individually 
analysed to identify areas of potential risk. 
Additionally , the committee considers risks 
that are beyond the Company’s control 
but against which it can take mitigating 
action. These include market risk and risk 
from competitors.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews all of 
the Company’s principal risk management 
policies and the ongoing development of 
a Company risk register .
Details of risks to the business that the 
Board considers to be potentially material 
are set out in the Strategic report on 
pages 20 to 25 and note 25. The risks posed 
by the UK’s vote to leave the European 
Union have been considered in the risk 
assessment process. 
The risks presented are the principal risks 
that the Company believes it currently 
faces. However , additional risks, of 
which the Company is aware, or risks 
the Company currently considers to be 
less significant, could have a material 
adverse impact. The risks included are 
not presented in order of priority .
Financial information
The Company prepares detailed budget 
and working capital projections, which 
are approved annually by the Board and 
are maintained and updated regularly 
throughout the year . Detailed management 
accounts and working capital cash flows 
are prepared on a monthly basis and 
compared to budgets and projections 
to identify any significant variances.
The Audit & Risk Committee has 
considered the integrity of the Company’s 
2017 financial statements and reviewed 
the appropriateness of its critical 
accounting policies and the judgements 
made in applying them. The year-end 
financial statements were reviewed 
and discussed with PwC. In addition, 
the interim financial statements were 
reviewed by the committee. The committee 
considered, among others, the following 
specific matters:
 
Going concern.
 
Intangible assets – impairment 
assessment.
 
Gain on bargain purchase arising from 
step acquisition of associate.

Audit review
The Audit & Risk Committee has discussed 
PwC’s audit process, and has reviewed the 
findings from the audit of the 2017 financial 
year as well as the effectiveness of the 
external audit process. The committee 
reviewed the quality and cost effectiveness 
of the external audit, and the independence 
and objectivity of the auditors. It obtained 
confirmation from PwC that their 
independence and ethics policies complied 
with FRC requirements, and that they 
remain independent and maintain internal 
safeguards to ensure their objectivity . No 
contractual obligations exist that restrict 
the Company’s choice of external auditor 
and the committee is satisfied that the 
external auditor remains independent. 
The committee has established policies 
determining the non-audit services that 
the external auditors can provide and 
the procedures required for approval of 
any such engagement. Further details of 
fees paid to PwC for both audit and non-
audit work can be found in note 11 to the 
financial statements.
Management of liquid resources
The Board is risk averse when investing the 
Company’s surplus cash. The Company’s 
treasury management policy is reviewed 
periodically , and sets out strict procedures 
and limits on how surplus funds 
are invested.
Review of corporate governance

Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company and Velocys plc will have 
sufficient funds available to enable them to continue to trade for the foreseeable future. 
The Company expects to develop its projects, in particular, providing additional financial support to ENVIA until it reaches cash flow 
breakeven forecast later in 2018 and progressing the Mississippi biorefinery and UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel projects, which will 
require significant development and capital expenditure. 
The nature of the Company’s nascent strategy means that the timing of milestones and funds generated from developments are 
difficult to predict at this stage. The directors have prepared financial forecasts to estimate the likely cash requirements of the 
Company and Velocys plc over the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The forecasts show that the Company and Velocys plc require additional external funding within the 12-month forecast period to be 
able to continue as a going concern. The directors anticipate that this will come from one, or a combination of, the following three 
sources, with agreements being actively sought from third parties:
 
Strategic investment of development capital into the Mississippi biorefinery project, which is expected during 2H 2018.
 
Placement of Company ordinary shares, which may occur within the next twelve (1 2) months.
 
Additional third party licence sales, such as the recently announced Red Rock Biofuels project.
The directors are confident that the funding required for the Company and Velocys plc to continue as a going concern will be secured 
within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, and have therefore prepared the financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
However, as at the date of approval of the financial statements no additional funding is committed beyond the £18.4m fundraise 
announced in January 2018 (as explained in the Financial review on pages 16 to 17). Should additional funding not be secured within 
the 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, the Company and Velocys plc would not be a going concern. 
As such, these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company and 
Velocys plc’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would arise if the Company and Velocys plc were unable to continue 
as a going concern.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions are included in the Strategic report on page 19.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the offices of Mayer Brown International LLP , 201 Bishopsgate, London, 
EC2M 3AF on Friday 29 June 2018.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
 
So far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
 
The director has taken all the steps that he / she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself / herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee is resolute in maintaining high standards of corporate governance and has taken steps to comply  
with the principles of best practice in so far as it can be applied practically given the size of the Company. The Company is listed on 
AIM and is therefore not required to comply with the following regulations: disclosure requirements of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2013; the UKLA Listing Rules; the disclosure provisions under schedule 8 to SI 2008/410 of the Large and  
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. Consequently, certain disclosures contained  
in these regulations are not included below.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The following served as members of the Committee throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 (unless otherwise specified):
 
Sandy Shaw (Chair)
 
Julian West – resigned 6 February 2018
 
Ross Allonby – resigned 15 June 2017
 
Andrew Morris – appointed 1 June 2017
The Committee’s constitution and operation is compliant with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. In determining 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into consideration both the Code and the guidelines published  
by The Investment Association (formerly the Association of British Insurers).
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The remuneration policy has been designed to ensure that Executive Directors receive incentives and rewards appropriate to their 
performance, responsibility and experience. In making its assessment, the Remuneration Committee seeks to align the policy with 
the interests of the shareholders.
Key features of the policy are:
 
Setting salaries to be competitive relative to the experience of the individual and the nature, complexity and responsibilities of their 
work in order to attract and retain management of the required quality.
 
Linking individual remuneration packages to the Company’s performance through bonus schemes and long-term share-based plans.
 
Providing employment and post-retirement benefits in accordance with standard policies of the Company.
The following chart illustrates the proportion of fixed and variable elements in the remuneration package, assuming target and 
stretch performance is achieved.

Remuneration of Executive Directors
Executive Directors’ remuneration is considered annually. In addition, the Remuneration Committee undertakes periodically 
a comprehensive review using external advisors. No such advice was taken in 2017 . Current remuneration is based on the 
following principles. 
Base salary
The base salary is reviewed annually at the beginning of each year. The review process undertaken by the Remuneration Committee 
considers the ongoing development of the Company, the contribution of the individual, the need to retain and motivate employees, 
and benchmark remuneration information from comparable organisations. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 33 www.velocys.com
Annual performance incentive
All Executive Directors are eligible, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, for an annual bonus. The target bonus award 
for each individual is based on a percentage of base salary, which, for the year commencing 1 January 2017 , was 75%. The maximum 
award for stretch target performance is twice the target amount. The Remuneration Committee sets performance targets for bonus 
awards at the beginning of each year. Awards are determined by both the performance of the individual and the Company as a 
whole at the end of each year. The performance targets for the Company comprise measures of financial, technical and business 
development goals. For 2017 performance, paid in 2018 (post-period end), the Remuneration Committee decided that bonus 
payments to the Executive Directors would be awarded at the target level of 75%, of which half has been paid in cash (and half will 
be settled by the award, in due course, of market value share options that will be subject to a specific performance condition).
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The committee believes that the LTIP scheme should provide to Executive Directors and other senior managers the appropriate 
incentivisation, focus and reward for achievement, that is aligned with shareholder interests. The last LTIP scheme that the Company 
put in place was in 2014 and, due to other changes in the business during 2017 , the committee decided not to make an award under 
this scheme during the year. Instead, the committee intends to make a new equity-based incentive award in 2018. It will, in the 
allocation of such awards, take into consideration the fact that no 2016 or 2017 awards were made.
Pensions and other benefits
The Company contributes to individuals’ defined contribution pension plans in line with the Company-wide schemes in place.  
For UK-based employees, the Company contributions are 7% of base salary. For US-based employees, the contributions are 3%  
of pensionable pay (which includes bonus) up to the maximum allowable under US pensions law.
Other benefits provided are life insurance, private medical insurance and relocation allowances where applicable, in line with the 
Company’s standard policies. 
Directors’ service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a service contract with a notice period of six months. 
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the executive members of the Board in consultation with the 
Chairman, based on a benchmark review of current practices in similar companies. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a fixed fee 
and do not receive any pension payments, bonus or other benefits. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year term and are typically expected to serve for two three-year terms. 
Either the Non-Executive Director or the Company can terminate the contract with three months’ written notice; the Chairman’s notice 
period is also three months. The Company may invite a Non-Executive Director to serve for further periods after the expiry of two 
three-year terms subject to a particularly rigorous review of performance, and taking into account the need for progressive refreshing 
of the Board. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, all directors are required to stand for re-election by shareholders on 
appointment and thereafter at least once every three years. However, in line with best practice, the Company decided in 2016 to put 
all Non-Executive Directors up for re-election at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) and intends to do the same at the 2018 AGM.
Fees paid to Non-Executive Directors
During the three financial years ended 31 December 2016, fees were paid to the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors in 
excess of the aggregate limit of £250,000 specified in Article 92 of the Articles adopted on 22 June 2011. This amount was set at the 
formation of the Company in 2006 and although the Articles allow this amount to be amended by ordinary resolution, and despite the 
growth of the Company since this point, no subsequent amendment has been made. 
In 2016, in light of the breach of Article 92, the Non-Executive Directors voluntarily agreed that they would each accept a cut in fees  
to reduce the annual cost of fees to within the limit of £250,000. The aggregate amount of these fees, as set out in the Company’s 
Annual report and accounts for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 is as follows.

Shareholding requirements
The Company has not previously had in place guidelines covering shareholdings of Executive Directors. It is intended that the new 
equity-based incentive award, to be made in 2018, will include such guidelines designed to ensure that Executive Directors retain 
an interest in the Company.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and parent company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company and parent company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:
 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Company financial statements and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the parent company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company and 
parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and parent 
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Company 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and parent company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the parent company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Corporate governance report confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
 
the parent company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the company;
 
the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company; and
 
the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company’s consolidated financial statements and Velocys plc’s financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s and of Velocys plc’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Company’s loss 
and the Company’s and Velocys plc’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards Velocys plc’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual report and accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Velocys plc statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated income 
statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Velocys plc statements of cash flows, and 
the Consolidated and Velocys plc statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Material uncertainty relating to going concern – Company and Velocys plc
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made 
in note 2 to the financial statements concerning the Company’s and Velocys plc’s ability to continue as a going concern. In order to 
continue as a going concern the Company and Velocys plc need to secure additional external funding within 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements. At the time of the approval of the financial statements no such funding is committed. 
These conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material 
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Company’s and Velocys plc’s ability to continue as a going concern. The 
financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company and Velocys plc were unable to continue as a 
going concern.
Explanation of material uncertainty
The Directors' report included in the Annual Report and note 2 to the financial statements details the directors’ disclosures of the 
material uncertainties relating to going concern. 
The directors have prepared financial forecasts to estimate the likely cash requirements of the Company and Velocys plc over a period 
of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. The forecasts show that the Company and Velocys plc require 
additional external funding within the 12 month forecast period to be able to continue as a going concern. The directors anticipate 
that this will come from one or more of three potential sources, as set out in note 2 to the financial statements. Given the risks 
associated with raising additional funding, the directors have drawn attention to this in disclosing a material uncertainty relating to 
going concern in the basis of preparation to the financial statements.
What audit procedures we performed
In concluding there is a material uncertainty, we examined the Company’s and Velocys plc’s cash flow forecast for the 12 month 
period to 30 April 2019 and agreed that these are based on Board approved budgets. We also requested the directors to extend their 
forecast to June 2019. The forecast included certain assumptions as set out in note 2 to the financial statements. We tested these 
assumptions by performing the following audit procedures:
 
We tested the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow forecast and we did not identify any material exceptions in these tests.
 
We compared the planned cash outflow to historical actual results and considered management’s assumptions to be supportable.
 
We examined documentation supporting the mitigating actions identified by management to extend the Company’s and Velocys 
plc’s cash position, should additional funding not be achieved in line with forecast. We considered management’s assumptions to be 
reasonable.
 
We held discussions with management to understand the nature of downside risks, to obtain an update on the current status of the 
sources of funding options being sought, as set out in note 2 to the financial statements, including the plan to bring them to fruition, 
and we considered whether there were additional risks that needed to be reflected in the forecasts. We used our understanding of 
the Company and industry to assess the possibility of such risks arising and their potential impact. We considered management’s 
assumptions to be reasonable, however, at the time of the approval of the financial statements, we determined that there are no 
agreements for additional funding in place.
Additionally we considered the adequacy of the disclosure in note 2 to the financial statements and found it to be sufficient to inform 
members about the directors’ conclusions on the appropriateness of using the going concern basis being adopted.

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
 
Overall Company materiality: £1.0 million (2016: £1. 1 million), equivalent to 4.4% of loss 
before income tax, before exceptional items.
 
Overall Velocys plc materiality: £150,000 (2016: £1,000,000), based on 1% of 
total assets.
Audit scope
 
We identified two financially significant components which were subject to full 
scope audits.
 
We performed a full scope audit of Velocys plc.
 
We performed specified audit procedures at two further components to address 
specific risk characteristics or to provide sufficient overall coverage of particular 
financial statement line items. 
 
All audit work was performed by the Company engagement team.
 
Components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 93% of Company 
loss before tax and 98% of Company total assets. 
Key audit matters
 
Valuation of Intangible assets (Company) and Investments in subsidiaries (Velocys plc).
 
Valuation of Investment in associate (Company).
 
Classification and measurement of convertible loan note instrument 
(Company and Velocys plc).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of 
our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Key audit matter
Valuation of Intangible assets (Company) and Investments 
in subsidiaries (Velocys plc).
Refer also to note 17 of the consolidated financial statements 
(pages 62 to 64) and note 7 of the Velocys plc financial 
statements (pages 82 to 83).
The carrying value of the Company’s intangible assets is 
£0.8m, following an impairment loss of £28.8m recorded in 
the current year.
The carrying value of Velocys plc’s investments in subsidiaries is 
£14.4m following an impairment loss of £57 .3m recorded in the 
current year.
The Company’s intangible assets and Velocys plc’s 
investments in subsidiaries are subject to impairment testing 
at least annually or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. In assessing whether there was any indication of 
impairment, management identified that the carrying amount 
of the Company’s and Velocys plc’s net assets was more than 
Velocys plc’s market capitalisation.
For the assessment of the recoverable amount of the Company’s 
intangible assets and Velocys plc’s investments in subsidiaries, 
the recoverable amount was determined for the cash-
generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the these assets belong. The 
Company has one CGU, being synthetic fuels production.
The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined based on 
its fair value less costs of disposal (‘fair value’), using Velocys 
plc’s market capitalisation, by applying the share price of 10 
pence from the equity issued on 15 January 2018 to the number 
of shares in issue at 31 December 2017 . This provided a fair 
value of £14.7m, resulting in an impairment loss: 
 
£31.5m has been recorded against the Company’s assets, of 
which £28.8m related to intangible assets; and 
 
£57 .3m has been recorded against Velocys plc’s investments 
in subsidiaries. 
Our audit focused on the risk that the carrying value of the 
Company’s intangible assets and Velocys plc’s investments in 
subsidiaries could be overstated and further impairments could 
be necessary. We also considered whether the amount and 
allocation of the impairment loss recorded was appropriate.
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We assessed the level at which impairment testing was 
performed. Based on our knowledge of the business, including 
the use of assets and internal reporting, we agreed with 
management’s judgement that, for the assessment of the 
recoverable amount of the Company’s intangible assets and 
Velocys plc’s investments in subsidiaries, the Company has 
one CGU.
We evaluated management’s approach to calculate the CGU’s 
recoverable amount, based on its fair value, using Velocys plc’s 
market capitalisation. Management’s assessment applied the 
share price of 10 pence from the equity issued on 15 January 
2018 to the enlarged share capital, resulting in a fair value 
of £33. 1m. We concluded that the application of this market 
approach was appropriate and that this represents an orderly 
transaction between market participants under current 
market conditions and was based on the same information 
as that which existed at 31 December 2017 . However, we did 
not consider that including the increase in the value of the 
business resulting from the injection of additional capital was 
appropriate. On this basis management recalculated the fair 
value as £14.7m by applying the share price of 10 pence from 
the equity issued on 15 January 2018 to the number of shares 
in issue at 31 December 2017 . We recalculated the fair value 
derived from applying this methodology and we did not identify 
a material exception. 
We tested the accuracy of the impairment loss calculated and 
the allocation of the impairment loss assets within the CGU, by 
comparing the carrying value of assets with their recoverable 
amount. We did not identify any material exceptions in 
these tests.
We also assessed the Company’s and Velocys plc’s disclosures 
regarding the significant accounting judgements in calculating 
the impairment recorded. We consider that these disclosures 
appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of 
judgement that support management’s conclusion. 40 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
Key audit matter
Valuation of Investment in associate (Company).
Refer also to note 19 of the consolidated financial statements 
(pages 66 to 68).
The Company holds an investment in its associate, ENVIA 
Energy, LLC (‘ENVIA’). The investment is subject to impairment 
testing at least annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. The carrying value of this investment is 
£2.6m, following an impairment loss of £2.7m recorded in the 
current year. 
The recoverable amount of the Company’s investment in ENVIA 
was determined based on ENVIA’s value in use multiplied by 
the Company’s interest in the investment, based on a value 
distribution model as defined by the joint venture agreement. 
ENVIA’s value in use was calculated by the estimated future 
cash flows for the period from 2018 to 2019 and subsequently 
extrapolating these cash flows to 2037 , to reflect the expected 
economic life of the asset, by applying an estimated long-term 
growth rate. Management assessed a number of potential 
outcomes and assigned a probability of the likelihood of each of 
these outcomes occurring. The estimated future cash flows were 
discounted to their present value. 
Certain assumptions used in calculating ENVIA’s value in use are 
subjective and require estimates to be made. The key estimates 
and assumptions assessed were:
 
The future cash flow growth assumptions used in the 
discounted cash flow model. In particular: 
 
The operational capacity and production yield of the plant;
 
The sales price for the product (waxes, diesel and 
naphtha) produced; and
 
The sales price for the Renewable Identification Numbers 
(‘RIN’) produced. 
 
The growth rate used beyond the period covered by the 
forecast; and 
 
The discount rate applied to future cash flows.
Our audit focused on the risk that the carrying value of this 
asset could be overstated. We also considered whether the 
amount of the impairment recorded was appropriate. 
Classification and measurement of convertible loan note 
instrument (Company and Velocys plc).
Refer also to note 26 of the consolidated financial statements 
(pages 75 to 76).
On 15 May 2017 Velocys plc issued £9.0m of unsecured 
convertible loan note instruments to existing shareholders.
The final maturity date of the loan notes is 18 months from 
the date of issue, after which Velocys has the right but not the 
obligation to convert the outstanding principal and interest into 
a fixed number of ordinary shares, at a conversion price of £0.50 
per share. The fixed annual interest rate is 8.0%, with accrued 
interest also being convertible into additional ordinary shares.
Our audit focussed on assessing whether the financial 
instrument met the relevant criteria to be classified as an 
equity instrument. 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We tested the integrity of the underlying discounted cash flow 
model. We did not identify any material exceptions.
We obtained corroborating evidence to support growth 
assumptions. We found that the assumptions used by the 
directors were supported by the evidence that we obtained.
We evaluated the long-term growth rate by comparing it to the 
Gross Domestic Product growth rate in the United States, the 
country in which ENVIA operates. We observed it to be within our 
expected range.
We evaluated the discount rate, by comparing key inputs, 
where relevant, to externally derived data for comparable listed 
organisations. We engaged our internal specialists in assessing 
the overall discount rate used, and observed it to be within our 
expected range.
We performed sensitivity analysis in respect of the key 
assumptions. We determined that a reasonably possible 
change in a number of the key assumptions, either individually 
or collectively, would result in the carrying amount of the 
Company’s investment in ENVIA exceeding its recoverable 
amount. We consider that management have taken reasonable 
steps to address this by assessing a number of potential 
outcomes and assigning a probability of the likelihood of each 
of these outcomes occurring.
We obtained the joint venture agreement and recalculated the 
Company’s interest in the investment, based on the defined 
value distribution model. We observed it to have been accurately 
calculated and applied to ENVIA’s value in use. 
We also assessed the Company’s disclosures regarding the 
significant accounting estimates in calculating recoverable 
amount of the Company’s investment in ENVIA. We determined 
that the disclosures appropriately draw attention to the 
significant areas of estimation uncertainty. 
We obtained and read the convertible loan note instrument 
contract and management’s accounting assessment, which was 
prepared in conjunction with their advisors, to assess whether 
the financial instrument met the relevant criteria to be classified 
as an equity instrument. In particular we:
 
Agreed the inputs included in management’s assessment to 
the contractual terms; and 
 
Evaluated whether all of the relevant terms and conditions 
of the contract had been considered in management’s 
assessment. 
Our procedures confirmed that the convertible loan notes are 
appropriately classified as an equity instrument. In particular 
our assessment confirmed that Velocys plc does not have a 
contractual obligation to deliver cash to the loan note holders, 
and the loan notes convert into a fixed number of shares at a 
fixed price. 
We also assessed the Company’s disclosures regarding this 
significant accounting judgement and consider that these 
disclosures appropriately draw attention to the significant areas 
of judgement that support management’s conclusion.

Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 41 www.velocys.com
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the Company and Velocys plc, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
The Company’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of the Company's operating territories in the 
United Kingdom (‘UK’) and United States (‘US’). These functions maintain their own accounting records and controls. In establishing the 
overall Company audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the legal entities ('entities') in 
the Company .
For each entity we determined whether we required an audit of their complete reported financial information (“full scope”) or whether 
specified procedures addressing specific risk characteristics or particular financial statement line items would be sufficient. Velocys, Inc. 
and Velocys Technologies Limited were determined as individually financially significant because they contributed more than 15% of the 
Company’s loss before income tax, before exceptional items. In addition we performed a statutory audit for Velocys plc. We also performed 
specified procedures on VMH Assets LLC and Velocys (USA Holdings) LLC to address specific risk characteristics or to provide sufficient 
overall coverage. Velocys (USA Holdings) LLC holds the Company’s investment in its associate, ENVIA. The Company engagement team 
conducted all necessary audit procedures. 
In aggregate, the components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 93% of Company loss before tax and 98% of Company 
total assets. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality . We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality . These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Risk description and impact
Company consolidated financial 
statements Velocys plc financial statements
Overall materiality £1.0 million (2016: £1. 1 million). £150,000 (2016: £1.0 million).
How we determined it 4.4% of loss before income tax before 
exceptional items.
1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the 
Annual Report, we believe that loss 
before income tax before exceptional 
items is the primary measure used by 
the members in assessing the financial 
performance of the Company. We 
consider it appropriate to eliminate 
exceptional items, which are considered 
non-recurring, to preserve the link 
between materiality and the underlying 
performance of the Company.
We believe that total assets is the 
primary measure used by the members 
in assessing the performance and 
position of the entity and reflects 
Velocys plc’s principal activity as a 
holding company.
For each component in the scope of our Company audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Company materiality . The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between £390,000 and £900,000. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Company materiality .
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £50,000 (Company 
audit) (2016: £60,000) and £7 ,500 (Velocys plc audit) (2016: £51,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion or , except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required 
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 42 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
Reporting on other information (continued)
With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and Velocys plc and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors’ report. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 36, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s and Velocys plc’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Company or Velocys plc or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for Velocys plc’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

adequate accounting records have not been kept by Velocys plc, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 
Velocys plc’s financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility . 
Other voluntary reporting
Directors’ remuneration
Velocys plc voluntarily prepares a Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The 
directors requested that we audit the part of the Directors’ remuneration report specified by the Companies Act 2006 to be audited as if 
Velocys plc were a quoted company .
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.

1. General information
Velocys plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in England. It operates through a number of subsidiaries 
in the UK and the US, and collectively they are referred to in the financial statements as the “Company” or “Velocys” , with Velocys 
plc as “Velocys plc” or the “parent company” . The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 1 to 25. The parent company financial statements are included on pages 77 to 85. The parent company’s 
securities are traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of The London Stock Exchange under the symbol “VLS” .
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are summarised below.  
The policies have been consistently applied to each year presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU, hereafter referred to as “IFRS”), IFRS Interpretations Committee  
(IFRS IC) Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value, where relevant.
The preparation of financial statements to conform to IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and the exercise 
of management’s judgement in the application of the Company’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, and areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are referenced in note 3.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company and Velocys plc will have 
sufficient funds available to enable them to continue to trade for the foreseeable future. 
The Company expects to develop its projects, in particular, providing additional financial support to ENVIA until it reaches cash flow 
breakeven forecast later in 2018 and progressing the Mississippi biorefinery and UK waste-to-renewable jet fuel projects, which will 
require significant development and capital expenditure. 
The nature of the Company’s nascent strategy means that the timing of milestones and funds generated from developments are 
difficult to predict at this stage. The directors have prepared financial forecasts to estimate the likely cash requirements of the 
Company and Velocys plc over the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The forecasts show that the Company and Velocys plc require additional external funding within the 12-month forecast period to be 
able to continue as a going concern. The directors anticipate that this will come from one, or a combination of, the following three 
sources, with agreements being actively sought from third parties:
 
Strategic investment of development capital into the Mississippi biorefinery project, which is expected during 2H 2018.
 
Placement of Company ordinary shares, which may occur within the next twelve (1 2) months.
 
Additional third party licence sales, such as the recently announced Red Rock Biofuels project.
The directors are confident that the funding required for the Company and Velocys plc to continue as a going concern will be secured 
within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, and have therefore prepared the financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
However, as at the date of approval of the financial statements no additional funding is committed beyond the £18.4m fundraise 
announced in January 2018 (as explained in the Financial review on pages 16 to 17). Should additional funding not be secured within 
the 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, the Company and Velocys plc would not be a going concern. 
As such, these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company and 
Velocys plc’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would arise if the Company and Velocys plc were unable to continue as 
a going concern.
Accounting developments
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 
2017 have had a material impact on the Company.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2018. The Company has not chosen to early adopt these standards, but they are considered relevant for future 
accounting periods.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 49 www.velocys.com
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
The Company is continuing to assess the full impact of IFRS 9, which becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. The main changes are expected to relate to: 
 
The standard removes the category of assets, loan and receivables, which in 2017 included cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables and the loan to the Company’s associate investment, ENVIA. These will be reclassified under the new standard as 
financial assets held at amortised cost, on the basis that the business model under which they are held is to collect repayment of the 
asset or loan and interest accrued thereon, with a fixed date for repayment. 
 
The standard requires any amortisation of these assets to be calculated on an expected future credit losses basis, rather than on 
incurred losses. 
The Company regularly uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk although at the end of 2017 
it had none outstanding. Under IFRS 9 these will continue to be classified as derivative financial instruments and measured at fair 
value through profit and loss.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Company has reviewed the requirements of the standard and has identified the revenue streams expected to be impacted and 
the performance obligations due under their respective contracts. It does not believe that allocating the contract prices across these 
performance obligations will have any impact on the opening 2018 balance sheet. Revenue in 2017 was derived from engineering 
services and the lease of catalyst. Service revenue is recognised, and in most cases invoiced, on a monthly basis in line with service 
performance. Catalyst lease revenue is recognised monthly over the life of the catalyst; revenue in 2017 was immaterial.
Receipt of Red Rock Biofuels revenue is material, and the impacts of adoption of the new standard are currently being assessed.
The following new standard is mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2019. The Company has not 
chosen to early adopt this standard in 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases
This standard will replace IAS 17 Leases and sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure 
of leases. Lessees will be required to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for lease 
contracts. The IASB has included an optional exemption that can be applied by lessees for certain short-term leases and leases  
of low-value assets. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on the balance sheet  
for lessees. 
As outlined in note 27 , at 31 December 2017 the Company had £1,662,000 of operating lease commitments and on transition the 
Company will recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in respect of these commitments. Thereafter the nature of the lease 
expense will change from rent to depreciation and interest charges. The Company’s operating lease expense in 2017 was £879,000, 
although this included £375,000 in respect of the vacated Milton Park premises. It is not expected that the change in the profile  
of the remaining expense will have a material impact on the Company’s loss before tax.
Financial risk management policies
Financial risk management policies are set out in the Strategic report on page 25, and in note 25.
Capital management policies
Capital management policies are set out in note 25.
Significant accounting policies
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented  
in sterling (£).
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at  
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income 
statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the  
Income statement within Finance income or Finance costs. 
The net investment that the Company has in its subsidiary undertakings is its interest in the net assets of that subsidiary.  
The inclusion of long-term loans and receivables (“Loans to subsidiaries”) as part of the net investment in the subsidiary undertaking 
is determined where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. All loans to subsidiaries by the parent 
company meet these criteria.  50 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Transactions and balances (continued)
On this basis the loans to subsidiaries, being monetary items that are receivable from a foreign subsidiary undertaking, are  
regarded as an extension of the Company’s net investment in that foreign subsidiary undertaking. Exchange differences, arising  
on a monetary item that forms part of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation that is a subsidiary or associate, are 
recorded in the consolidated financial statements, with exchange differences being recognised initially in a separate component  
of Other comprehensive income and, on disposal of the net investment, in profit or loss.
Entities within Velocys 
The results and financial position of all Velocys entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency  
(none of which is of a hyper-inflationary economy) are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
1. assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
2. income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
3. all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a movement within other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken  
to shareholders’ equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the  
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Other significant accounting policies are incorporated in the note to which they apply.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. Although these 
estimates and judgements are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount and/or timing, actual results ultimately may 
differ. These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary. The areas that involve a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements 
are listed below and described in the relevant note.

4. Exceptional items
Items that are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which are considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Company are classified  
as exceptional operating items. Exceptional operating items are included within the appropriate Consolidated income statement 
category but are highlighted separately in the notes to the financial statements.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Administrative expenses
At varying points during 2017 , the carrying value of the Company’s net assets exceeded the market capitalisation indicating a 
potential impairment at year end. This conclusion was supported by the fundraise in January 2018, which was discounted to 10p per 
share, and which prompted the share price to drop to 10p immediately afterwards. As a result, an impairment of £31.5m was recorded 
against a range of assets, as described in note 17 . The assets impacted by the impairment were Intangible assets, Inventories and 
Property, plant and equipment. Critical estimates and judgements are included in note 17 .
In 2016 the Company sought to acquire certain assets of a US-based GTL company that had gone into administration but did not 
complete the acquisition. The Company received a partial reimbursement by the acquirer of the plant. This transaction was judged to 
be exceptional by its nature as a potential business combination. Costs of the unsuccessful acquisition, recorded as an exceptional 
item of £2,809,000, represent amounts spent net of the related reimbursement.
Share of loss of investments
The Company is required to assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. During 2017 the first saleable products 
using Velocys’ reactors and catalyst (waxes, diesel and naphtha) have been produced to customer specification and the offtakers have 
begun taking delivery. Despite these milestones, ENVIA’s recoverable amount, based on its value in use, calculated using a discounted 
cash flow model, has decreased significantly, to reflect a revision of the expected income from RINs and a small risk associated with 
the expiry of a clause in the JV agreement preventing a majority vote requiring unanimous consent to halt operations at the plant. The 
Company has recorded an impairment of its investment in ENVIA of £2,736,000 (2016: £nil).
Other income
In 2016 the Company recognised £2,496,000 as Other income. This relates to non-refundable amounts from Ventech previously 
recorded in deferred income in respect of the cancellation of a contract with Ventech for reactors. The judgment to recognise this 
income is based on an assessment of the contractual position, taking into account both the terms of the original contract and 
subsequent amendments. The Company believes that all obligations under this contract have been fulfilled and therefore that it is 
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction have flowed to the Company and that recognition of the related 
income is appropriate. This is a binary judgement, and, therefore, the Company has recognised revenue at the point at which the 
probability criterion was met.
In September 2017 Velocys increased its equity share and voting rights at ENVIA following the exit of NRG from the joint venture, for 
no consideration. The voting rights for the three remaining joint venture members, including Velocys, were accordingly increased to 
33% each. The increased interest in the associate has been acquired through an increase in an existing stake. Velocys applied the 
‘cost approach’ , whereby there is a requirement to assess the fair value of both the consideration and the net assets being acquired. 
The fair value of the net assets being acquired was determined by its value in use, assessed by the estimated future cash flows 
discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate model. The Company has recorded a gain on bargain 
purchase of £1,750,000 in respect of this step acquisition. See note 19 for more information.
5. Segmental information
The Company’s chief operating decision-making unit is the Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo reviews the Company’s 
internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and has determined the operating segments based 
on these reports.
The ExCo considers that the business comprises a single activity, which is the design, development, marketing and sale of technology 
for the production of synthetic fuels. This includes facilitating project development by putting together partnerships with technology 
licensors, engineers, feedstock suppliers, offtakers and financing entities. The ExCo reviews the Company’s profit or loss and its 
cash flows, assets and liabilities on a Company-wide basis. In carrying out these reviews, the ExCo considers all material items of 
income and expenditure that are directly attributable to individual commercial projects and development programmes. The internal 
management reports do not allocate assets and liabilities or shared overheads to individual products or projects.
The business has one segment on the basis that the key end use market is that of synthetic fuels production. At this stage, 
the synthetic fuels segment represents 100% of the business and therefore represents the only material segment. Based on 
management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. 
Internal and external reporting is on a consolidated basis, with purchases and sales between subsidiaries eliminated on 
consolidation. Therefore, the segmental and financial information is the same as that set out in the financial statements.
The ExCo assesses the performance of the operating segment based on a measure of operating loss.
The Company’s operating segment operates in three main geographical areas. Revenue is allocated based on the country in which 
the customer is located.

6. Revenue 
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course  
of business, net of trade discounts, value added tax and other sales-related taxes after eliminating sales within the Company . Revenue 
is recognised only when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the 
Company . When uncertainty subsequently arises, any resulting provision is recognised as an expense and not a reduction in revenue.
Revenue related to Fischer- T ropsch (FT) reactors, catalyst and licence
The purchase of an FT reactor is part of an integrated package consisting of the three revenue streams for the Company; the sale of the 
FT reactor , the use of the FT catalyst for a certain term and revenue from the licence fee that grants rights to use the related intellectual 
property (IP) for the length of the licence term. The IP is not transferred at the end of the licence term. 
In order to recognise revenue, each component of the FT process is identified, which includes the sale of the reactor , an initial licence fee, 
the sale of catalyst and ongoing engineering services. Values are based on the terms of the sales contracts. Once the fair value of the 
components has been determined, revenue is recognised in line with the underlying nature of the contract.
In 2017 there was no reactor or licence fee revenue. Catalyst sales income is recognised monthly over the term of the arrangement.
Revenue related to engineering services
Revenue from engineering services is earned on a time and materials basis, and is recognised as the work is performed. 
The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from a small number of significant commercial customers and development partners.

Pensions
The Company operates various defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. The Company has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefit derived from the 
current and prior periods.
The amount charged to the Income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions 
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are accrued. The Company has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 55 www.velocys.com

During the year a number of employees were made redundant due to the scaling down of R&D activities. Redundancy payments, 
including payments in lieu of notice and holiday totalled £242,000. 
13. Income tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided for at the amount expected to be paid (or recovered) based on 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
   2017 2016
   £’000 £’000
Current tax:
R&D tax credit relating to prior years  (193) (550)
R&D tax credit relating to current year  (546) (854)
Current tax total  (739) (1,404)
Income tax total  (739) (1,404)
Due to the availability of losses incurred in the year, there is no charge to corporation tax. The Company recognised £739,000 for  
R&D tax credits (2016: £1,404,000). The credit relating to the current year is on an accruals basis, which is an estimate of the amount 
to be claimed from HMRC based on the activity level and significant R&D costs of the current year compared to previous years.  
The credit relating to prior years is the difference between the brought forward accrual and the settlement from HMRC.
The accrual for the current year, which is the majority of the credit, is based on an assessment of the Company’s projects,  
to determine which ones qualify under HMRC’s rules, and to estimate the level of allowable cost within each, based on the  
nature of costs.
The actual tax credit for the current and previous year is lower (2016: lower) than the theoretical amount that would arise using the 
weighted average tax rate applicable to the results of the consolidated entities, for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation.

13. Income tax (continued)
In the table Impairment loss not deductible for tax purposes removes the tax impact of the In-process technology and Goodwill 
impairments (see note 17). Goodwill created from a stock purchase such as that of Velocys Inc.is not deductible for US tax purposes. 
Goodwill created from purchasing the assets of the company (such as Velocys Projects Solutions LLC) is tax deductible.
The weighted average applicable tax rate was 32.5% (2016: 29.5%).
The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 . The applicable 
tax rate for 2017 is therefore 19.25%. Legislation to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 was enacted on 15 September 2016. 
Unrecognised UK deferred tax balances have been measured at 17% (recognised: £nil).
US corporate income tax has been based on a graduated scale ranging from 15% to 35% tax rate depending on the level of taxable 
income. Most US companies with taxable income under $10,000,000 had an effective rate of 34%. In December 2017 the US Congress 
voted to reduce the tax rate to 21%. Unrecognised US deferred tax balances have been measured at 21% (recognised: £nil).
14. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and  
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from  
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affected neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Tax amounts are determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised 
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the parent company and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There was no movement in recognised deferred tax in the year or the comparative period.

Deferred tax assets

Total  (24,774) (27,561)
At 31 December 2017 the Company had a net unrecognised deferred tax asset of £24,720,000 (2016: £27 ,366,000) arising from 
trading losses since incorporation. No recognition (2016: £nil) of the net deferred tax asset has been made at 31 December 2017 on 
the grounds of uncertainty over its recoverability in light of the Company’s nascent revenue streams and commitment to continued 
investment in the development of its biorefineries, and therefore there is no impact on the current or prior year income statement.
Of this unrecognised deferred tax asset £12,035,000 (2016: £11,775,000) is anticipated to remain available indefinitely to offset 
against future taxable trading profits of the entities in which the losses arose. The remainder has expiry dates between 2023 and 
2037 (2016: 2023 and 2036).
15. Share-based payments
Velocys plc issues share options to employees of its subsidiaries that are accounted for as equity settled. There are a number  
of schemes covering employees, executives and external consultants; most are based on a service period but some include 
performance conditions, both market based and non-market based.
Options are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant.  
For executive options with market performance conditions attached the Monte Carlo pricing model is used, all other options  
apply the Black-Scholes model.
The basic assumptions that feed into both models are volatility of the share price, annual risk free rate and dividend yield. Volatility 
is estimated using the average daily share price from the previous five years, the risk free rate is based on the Bank of England’s yield 
curve tables, and it is assumed no dividend will be paid over the life of the option. Additionally, for the Monte Carlo model, expected 
life is assumed to be the earliest point at which the shares may vest. This has been adjusted, using management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, based  
on historical satisfaction of non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates 
in the Income statement, recorded in Administrative expenses, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When options are exercised the Company issues new shares; proceeds received, net of attributable transaction costs, are credited  
to share capital and premium. The Company does not hold any treasury shares. Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 57 www.velocys.com

This scheme covers all employees of the Company, and was previously referred to as the EMI scheme; however, the Company ceased 
to qualify for EMI status due to the value of its gross assets. 
Options are granted to employees when they join the Company, which vest three, four or five years from the date of joining, subject 
to the employee completing a corresponding service period, and expire after ten years. The exercise price is the mid-market value 
of Velocys plc’s ordinary shares on the day prior to grant. Options are fair valued at grant date using the Black-Scholes model, and 
expensed over the vesting period.
Non-market performance options that were granted to certain employees in 2015 did not meet the target conditions and did not  
vest in 2017 .

Total expense recognised in the income statement for share options granted to directors and employees was £105,000 (2016: £275,000).
Executive options
Executive options (also referred to as “ELTIP” in the Directors’ remuneration report, and “ELTIP” and “NELTIP” in the 2015 Annual report 
and accounts) are awarded to Executive Directors and senior managers of the Company.
The fair value of options is recognised from the start of the relevant service period to the end of the vesting period.
Executive options granted up to and including 2014, are exercisable at a price of 1p or at a price equal to the mid-market value of the 
parent company’s ordinary shares on the day prior to the grant. Options vest immediately or after a period of one, two or three years 
from grant, they expire after ten years and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the options vest.
Options, including Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), awarded after 2014 were divided into those with a service period and those with 
market performance conditions. Except for the former CEO, service period options represented 23% of the award; they vest two 
years after the conclusion of the period over which performance is measured; the market performance conditions on which the rest 
of the award was based pertain to the compound annual growth rate of the Company’s market capitalisation excluding fund raising 
subsequent to 1 January 2015; market performance options are measurable after three years from the start of the service period, 
with possible re-measurements one, and two years later; options are subject to the discretion of the Board if the employee leaves the 
Company before the options vest.
For the former CEO, a five-year award was made in 2015, for which service period options represented 30% of the RSUs. Market 
performance options were measurable after five years from the start of the service period, with a possible re-measurement one 
year later. Under the terms of the 2015 Settlement Agreement between the Company and the former CEO, 2,216,666 RSUs from this 
award were deemed to have vested; the remainder was forfeited. In 2016 it was agreed that only 1,330,000 of these RSUs would be 
transferred to the former CEO, and in respect of the balance, the Company would settle the expected associated tax liability.
The only options granted in 2017 were to Susan Robertson, who was leaving the Company (2016: no options granted). However, the 
Remuneration Committee intends to introduce a new equity-based incentive scheme for executives in 2018, and, in the allocation  
of such awards, may take into consideration the fact that no 2016 or 2017 awards were made.

Total expense recognised in the income statement for executive options granted to directors and employees was £91,000 in 2017 
(2016: £496,000). No further expense was accrued within the share-based payments charge (2016: £nil).
At the time of exercising share options, executives of the Company may apply to an employee benefit trust managed by Oxford 
Catalysts Trustees Limited for a distribution in respect of the exercise value of their options. The trustees then request a contribution 
from the Company in respect of the grant made. The total value of funds distributed to executives by Oxford Catalysts Trustees 
Limited during the year in respect of executive options was £nil (2016: £13,300).
Velocys, Inc. scheme 
The Velocys, Inc. Stock Compensation Plan (“Pre-Acquisition Scheme”) was acquired as part of the acquisition of Velocys, Inc. by 
Velocys plc, formerly Oxford Catalysts Group PLC, on 20 November 2008. The scheme was started in 2001 and covers all US-based 
employees. Prior to the acquisition, Velocys, Inc. ’s Board of directors granted non-qualified share options to employees with expiry  
ten years from grant date. The options’ exercise price was equal to the stock’s fair market value at the date of grant. Options are 
forfeited if an employee leaves the Company. Generally, options vest as follows.
After one year of service from vest start date: 25% of grant
Each month subsequent to one year of service: 1/48
th
 of grant
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the acquisition of Velocys, Inc., each vested and unvested Pre-Acquisition Scheme option 
existing on the acquisition date was converted into 0.3659 of a Velocys plc, formerly Oxford Catalyst Group PLC, option (the ratio  
of the value of one share of Velocys, Inc. stock to one share of Velocys plc, formerly Oxford Catalyst Group PLC stock) with a 
corresponding increase to the exercise price. Share options are exercisable in US dollars.
During 2011 the Company reviewed employee incentives and concluded that the Pre-Acquisition Scheme options did not provide 
the intended incentive or retention value for its employees due to significant shifts in the market price since the original grants. 
Consequently, holders of these options were offered the opportunity to forfeit their options and have new options issued. All such  
new issues vest in three years and expire ten years from date of grant. 60 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com

Bonus shares
The Company previously maintained two bonus share schemes for certain executives: one in respect of employees of Velocys 
Technologies Limited and one in respect of employees of Velocys, Inc. Under both schemes, the value of the bonus was based upon 
the executive’s salary as well as the Company and the executive achieving certain targets throughout the year. No awards were, or will 
be, made under these schemes during, or in respect of, 2017 .
The Velocys Technologies Limited bonus share scheme awarded nominal value share options (1p) that were issued subsequent to 
the end of previous financial years. The awards vested on the date of grant and expire 10 years thereafter. Details of the bonus shares 
outstanding under the Velocys Technologies Limited bonus share scheme are as follows.

Other share options
The Board has approved the granting of share options to a small number of consultants (non-employees) who provide a strategic 
service to the business.
Options are granted either in respect of a completed service period, in which case they vest immediately, or in respect of a future 
service period, in which case they vest over periods of up to three years. They expire after ten years. Exercise prices range from  
£nil to the mid-market value of Velocys plc’s ordinary shares on the day prior to grant. Options are fair valued at grant date using 
the Black-Scholes model (which is not the fair value of goods and services received). For a completed service period, fair value is 
expensed over the service period plus the vesting period, for a future service period, fair value is expensed over the vesting period.

16. Loss per share
The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to owners of the parent company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
   2017 2016
Loss attributable to owners of Velocys plc (£’000s)  (54,603) (1 2,669)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue  145,729,727 143,282,963
Basic and diluted loss per share (pence)  (37 .47) (8.84)
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue to assume conversion of all 
potential dilutive shares. Share options have not been included in the number of shares used for the purpose of calculating diluted 
loss per share since these would be anti-dilutive for the period presented. At the end of 2017 there were no other potentially dilutive 
instruments (see note 26). Details of share options are given in note 15.
17 . Intangible assets 
Significant accounting policies
Cost or valuation and amortisation
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised. In the opening 
balance sheet, £5,445,000 of the Goodwill balance related to the acquisition of Velocys, Inc. in 2008 and £2,668,000 to the acquisition 
of Velocys Project Solutions, LLC (VPS) in 2014. In 2017 the Goodwill balance was written down to nil (see Impairment below).
In-process technology 
In-process technology consists of purchased intangibles and capitalised development costs and arose from the acquisition  
of Velocys, Inc. and Velocys Project Solutions, LLC (VPS).
In respect of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, the Company recognises these as distinct from Goodwill 
provided they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible 
assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is regarded as their cost. They are subsequently held at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
Prior to 2017 , amortisation was charged using the units-of-production method based on useful economic lives of the assets projected 
over future sales of 1,400 four-core reactors. Amortisation began in 2015 based on the manufacture of the first commercial reactors. 
From 1 January 2017 , following an update to the Company’s business model, whereby it is concentrating on the development of 
biorefineries rather than the licensing of technology to third parties, the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic 
benefits has been revised. The Company estimates that the total useful economic life of the asset is 20 years, from the completion of 
the first two reactors in August 2015. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful economic 
life of the asset, being 18.7 years from 1 January 2017 resulting in an increase of the amortisation charge for the year of £1,577 ,000. 
Subsequently, it was decided to impair the In-process technology asset (see below).
Research costs are recognised as an expense in the Income statement as they are incurred. 
Development costs, where the related expenditure is separately identifiable and measurable, and management are satisfied  
as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project and that the asset will generate future economic benefit based 
on all relevant available information, are recognised as an intangible asset. Capitalised development costs are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged over periods expected to benefit, typically up to 20 years, 
commencing with launch of the product. Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
Patents, licences and trademarks
Patents and trademarks are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on 
a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years, which is their estimated useful economic life. Residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. The Company decided to abandon certain non-core patents in 2017 and 2016.  
This resulted in a loss on disposal of patents of £152,000 (2016: loss of £213,000).
Licences are recorded at the present value of minimum licence payments. Amortisation is charged when related revenue starts  
to be earned and will be charged on a straight-line basis over the life of the licences. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
annually and adjusted if appropriate. Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 63 www.velocys.com
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Customer contracts
Customer contracts are carried at cost less impairment losses. The customer contract value that had been fully impaired in 2015 
related to an expected project development fee negotiated during the acquisition of VPS in 2014. Its value was contingent on 
achieving a final investment decision on the Ashtabula project in 2015, which did not happen. 
Software
Purchased software is recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged  
on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years. 
Impairment 
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying 
value may not be recoverable. To the extent carrying value exceeds recoverable amount, the difference is recognised as an expense 
in the income statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs 
of disposal. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are generally tested individually or at a CGU level which represents the 
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets 
or groups of assets. The Company has one CGU on the basis that the key end use market is that of synthetic fuels production. At this 
stage, the synthetic fuels segment represents 100% of the business and therefore represents the only material segment. Based on 
management’s judgement, all products and services offered within the operating segment have similar economic characteristics. 
An impairment loss in respect of Goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss in respect of intangible assets (excluding Goodwill) 
is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the loss was 
recognised, or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. A loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Were the fair value of the business to change in the coming 12 months, due to an increase or further decrease in the market 
capitalisation of Velocys plc, the impairment disclosed in this note would be reversed or the Company’s assets would be further 
impaired accordingly.
Critical estimates and judgements
In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an entity shall consider, as a minimum, a number of 
indicators of potential impairment. The Company identified that:
 
At varying points during 2017 , the carrying amount of the Company’s net assets exceeded Velocys plc’s market capitalisation;
 
The fundraise, completed in January 2018, was discounted to 10p per share, and which prompted the share price to drop to 10p 
immediately afterwards, further reducing the Velocys plc’s market capitalisation.
To assess the recoverability of the intangible assets, the recoverable amount is calculated at a CGU level, which represents the lowest 
level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups 
of assets. As detailed in the accounting policy set out above, the Company is considered to operate as a single CGU. Due to the early 
stage of the Company's strategy, its biorefinery development plans are still at too early a stage to provide reliable revenue forecasts 
for long-term discounted cash flow analysis. Consequently, the CGU's recoverable amount has been determined based on its fair 
value less costs of disposal (fair value), by reference to the total value of the parent company’s equity based on the AIM-listed shares 
of the parent company, consistent with the impairment assessment performed in the prior year. 
The fair value should reflect the assets and liabilities of the existing business at 31 December 2017 . The Company considers that using 
a fair value less cost of disposal value of £33. 1m, based on the share price of 10 pence from the equity raised on 15 January 2018 to the 
enlarged share capital, for the 31 December 2017 impairment assessment would imply that the combined business would be in excess 
of this at the date of the fundraise in January 2018, following the cash injection. The assessment has taken account of the decrease in 
the share price resulting from the January 2018 fundraise, and applied a per share value of 10p to the number of shares in issue at 31 
December 2017 . This gave a valuation of £14.7m and, unlike the December 2016 assessment, a control premium was not applied, as most 
of the Company’s significant investors were participating in the January 2018 fundraise at the discounted price. As a result of this fair value 
assessment, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of £31.5m (2016: £nil).
The method of allocation of the impairment was as follows:
 
Write down Goodwill to nil, resulting in an impairment of £7 ,398,000.
 
The other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis, based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. However, within this 
allocation framework, each asset is reduced only to the highest of: 
 (i)  Its fair value less costs of disposal, if measurable.
 (ii)  Its value in use, if this can be determined.
 (iii)  Nil.
This resulted in the following impairment allocation: 
 
In-process technology £20,610,000.
 
Patents, licence and trademarks £752,000.
 
Property, plant and equipment £2, 185,000.

Inventories £54 1,000. 64 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com

18. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value,  
of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which for plant and machinery is three to ten years. No depreciation 
is provided on land or assets under construction. 
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually. Values are estimated using benchmark prices at the balance sheet date; 
useful lives are estimated based on management expectations of future project requirements and operational assessment of the 
state of assets.
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value 
may not be recoverable. To the extent the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the difference is recorded as an expense in 
the Income statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs 
of disposal. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are generally tested individually or at a CGU level, which represents the 
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows, which are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets 
or groups of assets. Property, plant and equipment were included in the list of items to which an impairment was applied subsequent 
to the impairment review (see note 17). The value of the impairment was £2, 185,000 (2016: £nil).
Expenditure funded by research partners is only capitalised where there are no significant rights acquired by the third party over  
the asset and the asset has a clear enduring use beyond the specific funding project, these are regularly reviewed.

19. Investment in associate
This investment relates solely to Velocys’ holding in ENVIA Energy, LLC (ENVIA), located at 1021 Main Street, Suite 1000 Houston,  
TX 77002. ENVIA is a US company and is the holding company for the project located in Oklahoma (the ENVIA project). The Company 
first invested in ENVIA in 2014 as entry into a joint venture to develop GTL plants in the US using a combination of renewable biogas 
(including landfill gas) and natural gas. The first of these plants, ENVIA Oklahoma City produced its first product in 2017 . An update  
on the ENVIA project is available in the Strategic report on pages 10 to 11.
Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. In January 2016, Velocys entered into a financing arrangement with ENVIA under  
which it contributed additional equity finance of $2.6m and committed to provide loan finance of up to $9.3m. As a result of  
the new funding arrangement, Velocys increased its ownership share and was awarded additional voting rights, taking its share  
of voting rights from 9% to 28%. The investment has since been recognised as an Investment in associate, reflecting the significant 
influence that Velocys holds in ENVIA, including voting rights exceeding 20% and a seat on ENVIA’s board. The Company recorded  
the transaction as a step acquisition under the equity method in 2016. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting from the date on which it becomes an associate. 
Under the equity method, a cost approach is followed whereby the cost of all purchases are accumulated, including transaction costs, 
to determine the amount of the investment. The notional purchase price allocation, including Goodwill arising on the purchase of the 
additional stake, is calculated using fair value information at the date when the additional interest is acquired. Goodwill is calculated 
as the excess of the cost of the investment over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and 
liabilities and included in the carrying amount of the investment. During 2017 Velocys committed to a series of extensions to the loan, 
which increased the facility to $13.8m (£10.3m) (see note 20), however these extensions did not result in a change in the Company’s 
ownership interest or voting rights. In September 2017 , one of the joint venture partners, NRG, withdrew its interest and assigned its 
ownership and voting units to the remaining partners such that each was left with voting rights of 33%. No consideration was given in 
respect of this transfer. The Company recorded the transaction as a step acquisition under the equity method in 2017 . 
The Company’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income statement based on its economic interest.  
There are no post-acquisition movements in Other comprehensive income in the Company’s investments in associates. Distributions 
received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to 
recognise the investor’s share of the change in net assets of the investee after the date of acquisition. 
Gains and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Company and its associate are recognised in 
the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company. There have been no dilution gains and losses 
arising in investments in associates.
The Company determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 
impaired. If this is the case, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit/(loss) of associates in the income statement.  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 67 www.velocys.com

Critical estimates and judgements
Change in ownership rights – fair value assessment of ENVIA’s net assets
In September 2017 Velocys increased its equity share and voting rights at ENVIA following the exit of NRG from the joint venture, for 
no consideration. The voting rights for the three remaining joint venture members, including Velocys, were accordingly increased to 
33% each. The increased interest in the associate has been acquired through an increase in an existing stake. There is an accounting 
policy choice available for the acquisition of an associate in stages (step acquisition). Velocys applied the ‘cost approach’ , whereby 
there is a requirement to assess the fair value of both the consideration and the net assets being acquired. The fair value of the net 
assets being acquired was determined by its value in use, assessed by the estimated future cash flows discounted to their present 
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate model, which requires the use of a number of key assumptions. 
The calculations use projections derived from cash flow forecasts developed by Velocys, covering the two-year period from 2018 to 
2019, and subsequently extrapolated to 2037 , which is considered to be the economic life of the asset, using the estimated long-term 
growth rate. The cash flow forecast relies on the intimate working knowledge of the plant that Velocys has gained since the beginning 
of the start-up process. Ongoing uncertainties, for example, with the availability and price of RINs, are taken into account by using a 
number of different scenarios in the model. IAS 36 requires that when performing an impairment review that risk is incorporated into 
the impairment model. This can be done either in the cash flows or through the discount rate. The Company has incorporated risk 
through the cash flow forecasts by assessing a number of potential outcomes and assigning a probability of the likelihood of each 
of these outcomes occurring. The range of the value in use based on these potential outcomes is significant, which reflects the early 
stage nature of the venture. The Company has recorded a gain on bargain purchase of £1,750,000 in respect of this step acquisition. 
The key assumptions included in calculating the recoverable amount are set out below.
(i) Sales volume
The plant capacity is 250 bpd production and the model assumes 200 bpd average actual production at the plant due to varied 
reduction in availability due to time out for catalyst regeneration, catalyst change out or other maintenance. It assumes that a large 
majority of the product will qualify for RINs. There are offtake agreements in place for all products that exceed five years for 100% of 
products produced and there is a six-month contract in place for all of the available RIN credits generated; therefore the sales volume 
risk is solely based on operational availability. As indicated above, sensitivity analysis reveals that a decrease to 186 bpd from the 
200 bpd modelled availability (which is over 25 bpd below operating plan) would be required in order to generate a material change in 
the cash flows. The impact of aggressive sensitivity modelling of RIN availability does not have a material impact on cash flows.
(ii) Sales price/RIN credits
The model is based on an oil price (WTI) of $57 .50 per barrel and a RIN price of $2.40 per gallon until October 2018 and then $3.05 per 
gallon, with scenarios looking at an increase or reduction in these prices of 10%. The prices of diesel, naphtha and wax are all indexed 
to the oil price and/or rack pricing that is highly correlated to the price of oil. Although volatility of oil price could significantly vary 
revenues, the price has been relatively stable for the past 12 months and, based on current WTI futures, is projected to trade in this 
range for the remainder of 2018. There is a possibility within the range of modelled scenarios for RIN pricing to result in a material 
impact on cash flows, but not on a risk-adjusted basis, as the current forward outlook shows price recovery. 
(iii) Long-term growth rates
A long-term growth rate of 2% was used to extrapolate the cash flows for the period from 2020 to 2037 . This is based on the US long-
term GDP growth rates, the principal country in which ENVIA operates, and in preference to an industry average rate, given the early 
stage of development in the industry and resulting uncertainty. A reduction in the growth rate to 0% would not result in a material 
reduction in the gain on bargain recorded, or to the impairment recognised.
(iv) Discount rate
The discount rate is based on an estimate of ENVIA's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) being the average rate of return ENVIA 
expects to compensate all its investors. ENVIA has both equity and debt capital in the form of the loan from Velocys. At September 
2017 (step acquisition) and December 2017 (impairment assessment) a post-tax discount rate ('discount rate') of 10.95% (2016: 
8.45%) was applied to the model. It is a reasonable assumption that the discount rate might vary in a range up to 12.7%; this would 
not result in a material change to the value of ENVIA’s net assets.
Impairment assessment as at 31 December 2017
The Company is required to assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. During 2017 the first saleable products 
using Velocys’ reactors and catalyst have been produced to customer specification and the offtakers have begun taking delivery of 
the waxes, diesel and naphtha. Despite these milestones, ENVIA’s recoverable amount, based on its value in use, calculated using 
a discounted cash flow model, has decreased significantly, predominantly driven by a lower revenue forecast based on a revision of 
product and RIN pricing produced by the Company. The recoverable amount of the investment was determined by its value in use, 
assessed by the estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate model, 
which requires the use of a number of key assumptions. These are included in the 'Change in ownership rights - fair value assessment 
of ENVIA’s net assets’ section above. The Company has recorded an impairment of £2,736,000 (2016: £nil). 68 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com

Critical judgements
Share of ENVIA’s identifiable assets and liabilities and its share of profit and loss 
Under the equity method the profit or loss of the investor includes its share of the profit or loss of the investee. The Company bases 
the calculation of its share of ENVIA’s identifiable assets and liabilities and its net losses on a value distribution model developed by 
ENVIA that uses the LLC agreement agreed with each of the other parties that hold ownership units. The resulting percentage share 
differs to both the Company’s proportion of ownership units held in ENVIA and its proportion of voting units. This value distribution is 
considered a more appropriate measure of the Company’s economic interest in ENVIA.

20. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor 
will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through an allowance account, 
and the amount of the loss is recognised in Finance costs in the Income statement. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against Finance costs.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the applicable interest rate.

At the end of 2017 Velocys had committed to provide up to $13.8m (£10.3m) to ENVIA through a senior loan note due on 31 December 
2019 and bearing a 10% interest rate, with an optional extension to 31 December 2020 subject to prior notice. As at 31 December 
2017 , draw downs on this facility had been made by ENVIA in the amount of $13.0m (£9.6m) (2016: $0.4m (£0.3m)).
In the interim accounts for 30 June 2017 , the Company recorded an impairment of £701,000 to the loan to ENVIA, reflecting the risk 
to the operation of the plant of not meeting an operational milestone. The milestone was achieved after the interim accounts were 
published and the impairment has been reversed.
21. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value less provision for impairment. Cost is determined on a first-in, 
first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure 
including production overheads. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories. Items 
purchased for use in externally funded research and development projects are expensed to that contract immediately. Items held 
for the Company’s own development are also expensed when acquired. Items purchased for ongoing commercial sale are held in 
inventory and expensed when used or sold.

a buyer for this reactor due to subsequent advances in the reactor design.
As part of the impairment allocation described in note 17 the Company has impaired £541,000 of inventories in 2017 . 70 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com

25. Financial instruments
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified upon initial recognition and the classification depends on the nature of the asset and the purpose for 
which the assets were acquired. At 31 December 2017 the Company only holds financial assets classified as loans and receivables. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
The Company’s principal financial asset is Cash and cash equivalents. From time to time it also holds short-term investments, which 
are cash deposits on fixed terms of interest for more than three months. It last held short-term investments in 2015.
Loans and receivables also includes Trade receivables and Other receivables (see note 20), which are classified as current assets, and 
the loan to ENVIA (see notes 19 and 20), which is classified as non-current as its maturity is more than 12 months from the balance 
sheet date. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Assets at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in 
the Consolidated income statement. Assets in the comparative year were forward foreign exchange contracts that matured in 2017 . 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements. 
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities at amortised cost includes Trade payables, all of which are current liabilities (see note 23), Borrowings and 
Finance leases. Trade payables are stated at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Under Borrowings, interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the fair value of proceeds received net of direct 
issue costs, and thereafter at amortised cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct 
issue costs, are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
All of the above financial assets and liabilities are level 2 fair value measurements.
Financial risks
The activities of Velocys expose it to a number of financial risks, which are dealt with specifically below.
Financing
The Company’s cash usage is significant versus prospective future cash inflows (particularly in the short term) and Velocys is reliant 
on the support of a small group of major shareholders. The timing of cash flows is difficult to predict given the long development 
time and reliance on external parties. The Board recognises that further funding will be needed. Note 2 discusses uncertainties 
surrounding the extent and composition of future funding. The Company is targeting strategic project investment during the middle 
of 2018, at which point financing optionality is created. 
The fundraise in May 2017 included the issue of loan notes that are convertible into equity. In management’s view, they have 
the key characteristics of equity (see note 26). Velocys continues to take measures to preserve cash in order to protect against 
unforeseen events.
Equity forms the basis of the Company’s capital. Its objectives when managing this capital are: 
 
To secure its ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
To keep its cost of capital low through an optimised capital structure.
 
To preserve sufficient funds to protect it against unforeseen events and risks.
 
To be in a position to take advantage of opportunities that can deliver a return to shareholders.
The Company’s revenue stream relies on projects incorporating its technology securing project finance. The Company’s strategy is to 
take a pro-active role in this process. It is actively engaging with banks and financial advisors with high levels of expertise in project 
financing to support the financing plans for the types of projects it is developing.  72 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
25. Financial instruments (continued)
Exchange rates
A significant proportion of commercial activity and development costs are US-dollar denominated. Where possible, revenue is 
receipted in US dollars to act as a natural hedge against this exposure. Additionally, a proportion of liquid assets is held in US dollars. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by Company policies, which are approved by the Board of directors, and which provide  
a set of written principles for the management of these risks.
The table below illustrates the Company’s sensitivity to changes in the US dollar exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The analysis 
covers only financial assets and liabilities.

   £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
GBP:USD exchange rate +/- 10%  98 1, 162 1,421 1,421
Liquidity
The Company maintains sufficient cash balances to meet anticipated requirements. Cash flow forecasts are regularly reviewed,  
cash balances are held immediately available as necessary, and surplus funds are placed on time deposits of varying duration. 
Credit
The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables, which are concentrated in a small number of high value 
customer accounts. This risk is managed by carrying out relevant financial checks on customers, and where necessary, requiring 
letters of credit or advance payments.
The credit risk of liquid funds is limited through a Company treasury policy, maintained to ensure that liquid assets are only placed 
with highly-rated institutions, and that the spread of such assets restricts exposure to any one counterparty. Risk is assessed using 
an external credit rating agency’s long-term ratings.
Interest rates
Variations in interest rates affect only Velocys’ cash holdings, as its borrowing is payable at a fixed rate. As far as the cash flow 
forecast allows for certainty, funds are placed on fixed rate deposits. The effect of interest rates on exchange rates is not anticipated.

Velocys is a secured creditor of ENVIA.
 
ENVIA’s net asset position significantly exceeds the receivable value.
 
ENVIA forecasts it will have net cash inflow in Q2 2018, and being a JV partner, have access to information that supports this forecast.
 
Velocys is an equity investor; therefore has significant influence over the activities of the investments.

26. Called up share capital and reserves
Share capital and share premium include ordinary shares in Velocys plc issued to shareholders and options that have been exercised 
by employees and associated consultants. 
Convertible loan note instruments (‘loan notes’) issued by the Company allow the issuer the right to exchange all outstanding loan 
notes and all accrued interest thereon for equity in the parent company. The Company assesses whether the loan notes and the 
conversion feature should be classified as a financial liability or equity instrument. In making this assessment the Company assesses 
whether there is an obligation for the Company to:
a) deliver cash to another entity; or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Company (as the issuer); and
b) if the instrument will or may be settled in the issuer's own equity instruments it is:
 (i)  a non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the Company to deliver a variable number of its own equity 
instruments; or
 (ii)  a derivative that will be settled only by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed 
number of its own equity instruments. 
If these criteria are met, the loan notes will be recorded as an equity instrument. 
Judgement
In May 2017 18,000,000 loan notes were issued to the Company’s two largest shareholders at a price of £0.50 per share. The final 
maturity date of the loan notes is 18 months from the date of issue, after which the Company has the right but not the obligation to 
convert the outstanding principal and interest into a fixed number of ordinary shares, at a conversion price of £0.50 per share. The 
fixed annual interest rate is 8.0%, with accrued interest also being convertible into additional ordinary shares. 
Based on the contractual terms it was determined that the Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash to the 
loan note holders, and the loan notes convert into a fixed number of shares at a fixed price. Based on these criteria being met the loan 
notes were recorded as an equity instrument. The interest accrued on the loan notes is recorded as a distribution to holders of the 
loan notes within equity.

On 25 June 2014 the Company acquired Velocys Project Solutions, LLC. A number of holdback shares was designated to cover 
adjustments in the period after acquisition. The remaining balance of 41,644 shares was issued in 2016. 
In May 2017 18,000,000 convertible loan notes were issued to the Company’s two largest shareholders.
On 15 January 2018 Velocys announced that it had secured around £18.4m of additional funding (before expenses), having issued 
183,662,946 ordinary shares (see Financial review on pages 16 to 17). 76 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
26. Called up share capital and reserves (continued)
Reserves
Foreign exchange reserve relates to the exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the results and opening net assets of 
foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the reserve are included in other comprehensive income. The Company’s foreign exchange reserve 
was a credit balance of £2,654,000 (2016: a credit balance of £7 ,051,000). 
The share-based payment reserve records the IFRS 2 charge for equity settled share-based payment awards. At 31 December 2017 
the Company’s share-based payment reserve was £16,085,000 (2016: £15,843,000). 
27. Commitments
The Company leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives 
received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases under 
which the Company incurs substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases, however are not 
material to the Company.
Operating lease commitments
The Company leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms are between two and five 
years and the majority of lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate.

At 31 December 2017 the Company had committed to make available additional loan funding to ENVIA of £593,000 ($800,000), which 
is repayable by 31 December 2019.
28. Post-financial position events
The following events occurred after 31 December 2017 .
On 15 January 2018 Velocys announced that it had secured around £18.4m of additional funding (before expenses).
On 16 January 2018 the Company announced that ENVIA believed that fuel produced at its Oklahoma City plant met the necessary 
requirements to be submitted for qualification under the Renewable Fuel Standard and that the facility had submitted a certain 
number of RINs to the registration system. Confirmation that the RINs produced at ENVIA had been verified was announced on 
15 March 2018.
The resignation of Non-Executive Director Julian West from the Board was announced on 7 February 2018. 
On 4 May 2018 the Company announced that the third party project developer Red Rock Biofuels had commenced construction of its 
Oregon plant and had issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to Velocys.
On 15 May 2018 the Company announced that ENVIA had detected a leak that is believed to have originated inside one of the plant’s 
two Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors. The Company is confident that the issue is not a result of a flaw in the core Velocys FT technology. 
The carrying value of the investment has not been adjusted to reflect the impacts of this event.
29. Related parties

Velocys plc statement of cash flows 
for the year ended 31 December 201 7 80 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
1. General information
Velocys plc is a non-trading holding company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in England. It operates through a 
number of subsidiaries in the UK and the US, and collectively they are referred to in the financial statements as the “Company” or 
“Velocys” , with Velocys plc as “Velocys plc” or the “parent company” .
Velocys plc is a public limited company listed on AIM.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these parent company financial statements are the same as those 
of the Company unless otherwise specified. The additional accounting policy for the parent company relates to the Investments in 
subsidiaries (see note 7). The policies have been consistently applied to each year presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The basis of preparation is the same as the Company, as set out on page 48 of the consolidated financial statements. The parent 
company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to 
publish a separate income statement and related notes and not to publish a separate statement of other comprehensive income. 
The comprehensive loss for the parent company for the year was £62,700,000 (2016: loss £59,919,000), which included a £57 ,256,000 
impairment of investment in subsidiary in 2017 (2016: £65,716,000) see note 7 .
Going concern
The going concern of Velocys plc is intrinsically linked to that of its subsidiaries, through which it trades in the UK and the 
US. The going concern basis of preparation is consistent with that set out for the Company. See page 48 of the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Accounting developments
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after  
1 January 2017 have had a material impact on Velocys plc. The following standards with significant changes to the accounting 
framework will be relevant to future periods.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15) and IFRS 9 Financial instruments (IFRS 9) are mandatory for the first 
time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 is not expected to be relevant to Velocys plc as it does not generate 
revenue. The parent company’s financial assets comprise its loans to subsidiaries, which upon adoption of IFRS 9 will be reclassified 
from Loans and receivables to Financial assets held at amortised cost, as they are held only for repayment of principal and interest. 
The standard requires any amortisation of these assets to be calculated on an expected future credit losses basis, rather than 
on incurred losses. An impairment was recorded in 2017 spread across the subsidiary loans; details of how this was calculated 
are included in note 7 . The Company does not consider that the impairment provision recorded would be materially different in 
accordance with IFRS 9.
IFRS 16 Leases is mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2019. This standard is subject to 
endorsement by the European Union. This standard is not expected to be relevant to Velocys plc as it has not entered into any 
lease arrangement.
Financial risk management policies
Financial risk management policies are set out in the Strategic report on page 25, and in note 25 of the consolidated  
financial statements.
Capital management policies
Capital management policies are set out in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the parent company’s accounting policies set out in note 2, the parent company is required to make certain estimates 
and judgements concerning the future. Although these estimates and judgements are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount and or timing, actual results ultimately may differ. These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised 
as necessary. The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these financial 
statements are listed below and described in the relevant note.

4. Exceptional items
Items that are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which are considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board Executive Committee to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
parent company are classified as exceptional items. They include, for instance, impairments to the parent company’s investments. 
Exceptional items are included within the appropriate parent company income statement category but are highlighted separately in 
the notes to the financial statements.
The following exceptional items have been included in the income statement.
   2017 2016
   £’000 £’000
Impairment of investment in subsidiaries  (57 ,256) (65,716)
Total  (57,256) (65,716)
At the end of both 2016 and 2017 the parent company reviewed for impairment its investments in subsidiaries in light of the 
respective closing market capitalisation, and in both years concluded that an impairment was required. Details including critical 
estimates are included in note 7 .
 
5. Income tax
   2017 2016
   £’000 £’000
Current tax:
R&D tax credit relating to prior years  (179) (470)
R&D tax credit relating to current year  (438) (650)
Current tax total  (617) (1, 1 20)
Income tax total  (617) (1, 1 20)
Due to the availability of losses incurred in the year, there is no charge to corporation tax. The parent company recognised £617 ,000 
for R&D tax credits (2016: £1, 120,000). 
The actual tax credit for the current and previous year is lower (2016: higher) than the theoretical amount that would arise using  
the weighted average tax rate for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation.
   2017 2016
   £’000 £’000
Loss before income tax  (57 ,456) (69,21 1)
Tax calculated at domestic tax rates applicable to losses in the respective countries  (1 1,060) (13,842)
Tax effects of:
 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes  4 37
 Impairment loss not deductible for tax purposes  1 1,022 13, 143
 Unutilised tax losses  34 662
 R&D tax credit  (617) (1, 1 20)
Income tax total  (617) (1, 1 20)
The impairment loss not deductible for tax purposes represents the impairment of investment in subsidiaries as described in note 7 . 
The weighted average applicable tax rate was 19.25% (2016: 20%).
The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 . Accordingly, 
profits in the United Kingdom for 2017 were taxed at 19.25%. Legislation to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 was enacted 
on 15 September 2016. The parent company has not recognised a deferred tax asset or liability in 2017 (2016 £nil). Unrecognised UK 
deferred tax balances have been measured at 17% (recognised: £nil). 82 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 www.velocys.com
6. Deferred tax
The parent company has not recognised a deferred tax asset or liability in 2017 (2016 £nil).
   2017 2016
   £’000 £’000
Unrecognised
Deferred tax assets
 Trading losses  (8,4 1 1) (8,381)
Total  (8,411) (8,381)
At 31 December 2017 the Company had a net unrecognised deferred tax asset of £8,411,000 (2016: £8,381,000) arising from trading 
losses since incorporation. No recognition (2016: £nil) of the net deferred tax asset has been made at 31 December 2017 on the 
grounds of uncertainty over its recoverability in light of the Company’s nascent revenue streams and commitment to continued 
investment in the development of its biorefineries, and therefore there is no impact on the current or prior year’s income statement.
All of the unrecognised deferred tax asset (2016: all) is anticipated to remain available indefinitely to offset against future taxable 
trading profits.
7 . Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held by Velocys plc at historical cost less impairment. The net investment that the parent company 
has in its subsidiary undertakings is its interest in the net assets of that subsidiary. The inclusion of long-term loans and receivables 
(Loans to subsidiaries) as part of the net investment in the subsidiary undertaking (Investment in subsidiaries) is determined by the 
fact that settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. All loans to subsidiaries by the parent company 
meet this criterion. 
The carrying amounts of the parent company’s Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed at each balance sheet date, or when  
events or changes in circumstance indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable, to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds 
the recoverable amount, the difference is recorded as an expense in the Income statement. The recoverable amount used for 
impairment testing is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the purpose of impairment testing,  
assets are generally assessed individually or at a CGU level, which represents the lowest level for which there are separately 
identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
An impairment loss in respect of Investments in subsidiaries is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be 
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used 
to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed that which would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Critical estimates and judgements
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value  
may not be recoverable. In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an entity shall consider, as  
a minimum, a number of indicators of potential impairment. The parent company identified that:
 
At varying points during 2017 , the carrying amount of the parent company’s net assets exceeded the Velocys plc’s 
market capitalisation;
 
The fundraise, completed in January 2018, was discounted to 10p per share, and which prompted the share price to drop to 10p 
immediately afterwards, further reducing the Velocys plc’s market capitalisation.
As set out in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, an impairment assessment was carried out on the Company’s 
intangible assets and an impairment was indicated. Velocys plc used the same basis for calculating the recoverable amount to 
determine the total value of the three subsidiaries held by the parent company, based on the judgement that there is limited value 
attributable to the parent company, as a non-trading holding company. The parent company has both equity and debt investments 
in its subsidiaries, which are compared to the recoverable amount. On this basis, the impairment assessment indicated that the 
carrying value of the investments in subsidiaries was higher than the recoverable amount, determined by fair value less costs of 
disposal. As a result, an impairment of £57 ,256,000 (2016: £65,716,000) was recognised. This impairment eliminated on consolidation.
