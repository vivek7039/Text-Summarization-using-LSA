About us
Time Out Group (“Time Out”, the “Company” or the “Group”) 
 is the leading global media and entertainment business that 
inspires and enables people to make the most of the city.
It all began in London in 1968 when Time Out helped people explore the exciting new urban cultures that 
started up all over the capital. Since then, it has consistently maintained its status as the go-to source of 
inspiration for both locals and visitors alike. Today, Time Out is bringing its hunger for discovery and 
honest voice to 108 cities in 39 countries and has a global average monthly audience reach of 217 million.
Everything Time Out does helps people discover, book and share what the world’s cities have to offer. 
Millions of travel and leisure purchasing decisions are being influenced by Time Out’s unique and 
trusted high-quality content - curated by professional journalists - about food, drink, entertainment, 
film, music, attractions, art, culture, shopping, night-life, hotels and travel.
With its two divisions Time Out Digital and Time Out Market, the Group aims to connect consumers 
and businesses in the leisure, travel and local entertainment sector through B2C and B2B offerings.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Monetising the audience
Time Out’s unique curated content about 
the best things to do in cities has a huge 
influence on travel and leisure purchase 
decisions of hundreds of millions of 
people around the world. In fact, 95% do 
something as a result of engaging with 
Time Out – selling to this experience-
hungry, young audience is a growth 
opportunity for the Group’s e-commerce 
business.
In 2017, e-commerce growth of 57% year-on-year was driven 
by a particularly good performance from affiliate sales, with a 
focus on travel, and by tickets sold for Live Events arranged 
by the Group. Key events throughout the year were Battle of 
the Burger (Chicago, New York and Los Angeles), Passport to 
Portugal in New York (sponsored by TAP Air Portugal), Silent 
Discos in the Paris Zoo and The Shard in London, Outdoor 
Movie Pop Ups in Lisbon and Movies on the River in London, 
the first floating cinema on the River Thames. At the heart 
of these events was bringing to life unforgettable curated 
moments representing the best of the city for Time Out’s 
millennial audience. To further grow transactions of tickets 
and bookings, Time Out enhanced its e-commerce platform 
and expanded its e-commerce products, making more of its 
content bookable. The broad range of categories spans hotels 
and restaurant bookings, theatre and attraction tickets, offers 
and exclusive products only Time Out can deliver, based on 
editorial curation. In November 2017, a gift box including 
cards to enjoy 50% off food in twelve restaurants from Time 
Out’s annual list of the best 100 London restaurants, sold out 
quickly.

OUR
KEY
STRENGTHS
Established international brand  
with an extensive audience reach: 
Time Out is one of the leading brands to inspire and 
enable people through curated content about how 
to enjoy food, drink, culture, art, travel and entertainment in 
cities around the world. The Directors believe that the Group’s 
established brand – which launched in 1968 – and high brand 
awareness are key drivers of Time Out’s significant average global 
monthly audience reach of 217 million, and that this will help 
drive consumer traffic to the Group’s trusted digital platform and 
give users the confidence to execute e-commerce transactions.
1
Attractive unit economics driven by significant 
consumer demand for the Group’s independent, 
inspirational and curated content: 
The Directors believe that the Group’s average global 
monthly audience reach of approximately 217 million lowers 
the marketing cost of acquiring users and makes it easier to 
transition users from content consumption to e-commerce. In the 
context of its increasing audience reach, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well-placed to continue to benefit from attractive 
unit economics, the reach it can obtain on social media platforms 
and the growth of its digital presence.
4
Strong relationships with brand and local 
advertising partners and sophisticated model 
for generating advertising revenue:
The Group has established long-term, direct 
relationships with global brands and local businesses and uses 
a number of solution-based advertising platforms, programmatic 
platforms and other creative channels, including native 
advertising, experiential advertising and multi-channel campaigns 
to generate advertising revenue.
2
Worldwide roll-out of Time Out Market:
The first Time Out Market in Lisbon received 
approximately 1.9 million visitors in 2015, 3.1 million 
in 2016 and 3.6 million in 2017. It achieved positive 
EBITDA within 18 months of opening. The Directors believe 
that the Lisbon market format presents a scalable opportunity 
that can be replicated in other cities, expanding the Group’s 
international presence and raising the profile of the Time Out 
brand.
5
Diverse content distribution network including 
technology with multi-channel scalability potential: 
The Directors believe that the scalable and flexible 
architecture of the Group’s digital platform will allow it 
to develop ongoing improvements in functionality and expand to 
address new business opportunities.
3
Experienced management team: 
The Group has an experienced management team with 
a strong background in digital media, e-commerce and 
technology businesses as well as retail and hospitality.
6
Detailed and growing user data: 
The Group’s digital platforms, Flypay technology and 
free Wi-Fi in the Time Out Market in Lisbon will provide 
the Group with a source of valuable, high-quality user 
data and information which the Group can leverage in order to 
increase its revenue from e-commerce.

HIGHLIGHTS
PROGRESS IN 2017
Financial Highlights

CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
Results
Following a strong 2016, its first year as a 
listed company, Time Out Group continued 
to make substantial progress as it evolves 
into a transactional business. Group revenue 
increased by 19% year-on-year, driven by a 
combination of underlying growth (12%) and 
the contribution of the acquisitions of Time 
Out Australia and Time Out Spain. We saw 
revenue growth increasing in the second 
half of the year, demonstrating that the 
business strategy is on track. Both business 
divisions delivered good growth; in Time 
Out Digital, e-commerce revenue increased 
by 57% offsetting the anticipated weaker 
print revenue. Time Out Market performed 
particularly well with revenue growth of 62% 
and 3.6 million visitors in 2017 compared to 
3.1 million in the prior year.
Key Achievements
I am very pleased that Time Out Group 
continued to consistently deliver against its 
core areas. A large, growing global audience 
and that audience’s desire to make the 
most of the city has been key to Time Out’s 
progress and evolving this unique brand as a 
digital, transactional business.
In 2017, Time Out’s average global monthly 
audience reach further grew by 39% year-
on-year to 217 million across all platforms; 
geographic growth was driven by the Group’s 
continued global expansion of owned and 
operated businesses with the acquisition 
of franchises in Australia and Spain, and 
the addition, at no cost, of Hong Kong and 
Singapore.
This increased reach combined with Time Out 
Digital’s ongoing investment – in particular in 
its e-commerce platform – grew transactions 
across more and new verticals. Improvements 
included expanding e-commerce to new 
cities, new affiliate agreements especially for 
travel offerings, content and commerce being 
increasingly connected with more booking 
options. We expanded our digital advertising 
presence through the integration of Time Out 
franchises in Australia, Spain and Asia. Around 
the globe, we see major advertising partners 
increasingly looking for the unique, bespoke 
multi-channel solutions we can offer within the 
positive brand-safe environment Time Out’s 
content provides.
Time Out Market Lisbon continues to be an 
incredible success story. In 2017, it delivered 
an excellent performance with continued 
revenue momentum and record visitor 
numbers, proving the strength of the format. 
We look forward to bringing Time Out Market 
to exciting cities, with near term plans on track 
to open sites in New York, Miami, Boston and 
Chicago.
People
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
on behalf of our Board and our Shareholders 
everyone at Time Out Group, including our 
licensing partners, for the great progress we 
made in 2017. In 2018, we will celebrate this 
iconic brand’s 50th birthday – it was launched 
in London in 1968 to help people explore the 
exciting new urban cultures that started up all 
over the city. Today, this DNA is still completely 
intact thanks to our fantastic team around the 
world that has always been passionate about 
delivering insight and value to our consumers 
and partners. Together with my Board 
colleagues, I am looking forward to driving the 
continued success and growth of Time Out as 
we inspire and enable more and more people 
to make the most of cities around the world.

Q&A
WITH THE CEO
What is the most important milestone Time 
Out Group reached this year?
2017 was our first full financial year as a 
listed company and achieving 59% growth 
in transaction levels driven by e-commerce 
and Time Out Market was one of our most 
important targets. By achieving substantial 
progress across our two business divisions 
we have met the high standards we set for 
ourselves, demonstrating the successful 
diversification of Time Out on our way 
to profitability. Time Out Digital has 
continued to deliver good progress and 
revenue growth across e-commerce and 
Premium Profiles; Time Out Market 
continued to go from strength to strength 
and within this context we will further 
expand the format to cities worldwide.
What were the key drivers of 2017  
revenue growth?
Increasingly selling to our global audience 
is the key driver behind our revenue growth 
which we saw increasing in the second 
half of the year, demonstrating that we are 
doing the right things. Looking at Time Out 
Digital, we are pleased that e-commerce 
substantially grew by 57% year-on-year 
as we launched new products, expanded 
into new markets and entered new affiliate 
agreements across more verticals, in 
particular in travel with its higher margins. 
The acquisitions of Time Out Australia 
and Time Out Spain further contributed 
to our revenue growth. Time Out Market, 
our other business division, had 3.6 million 
visitors in our Lisbon location in 2017 and 
62% revenue growth year-on-year (2016: 
115%) – the success of the concept as we 
roll it out globally offers a fantastic growth 
opportunity going forward.
How does Time Out intend to grow sales so 
rapidly in the highly competitive travel and 
leisure e-commerce market?
We know that 95% of our audience do 
something as a result of engaging with Time 
Out and that over 60% are from outside of 
the city – this audience is looking to spend 
and that is a huge potential for e-commerce. 
As we are already inspiring millions of 
travel and leisure decisions every year we 
no longer just write about the best things to 
do in the city; we increasingly make them 
bookable. In 2017, our customers bought 
837,000 items from us, up from 618,000 
in the previous year. We aim to further 
grow bookings by rolling out e-commerce 
functionalities to more cities, by launching 
multi-language options to attract visits and 
bookings from new audiences, by further 
enhancing the product categories, by 
making more content bookable and with 
a website redesign focusing on a closer 
connection of content and e-commerce. To 
complement our broad affiliates offering 
and further monetise traffic, we have also 
launched exclusive products like our very 
successful recent restaurant gift box which 
sold out quickly – this is a unique product 
only Time Out can deliver as it is inspired 
by editorial curation of the best of the city.
Your audience keeps on growing - what are 
the key drivers?
First, our audience values and trusts our 
content which is curated by professional 
journalists – it is this quality that attracts 
both locals and visitors, always looking 
for something new and exciting to do in 
cities around the world. Secondly, in 2017 
we have again grown our average global 
monthly audience reach by 39% and it now 
stands at 217 million. This was driven by an 
increasing social media reach which helps 
us build our brand and drive traffic to our 
“In 2017, we continued 
to drive growth for 
Time Out as we made 
substantial progress 
across our core areas. 
Increasing revenue 
growth in the second 
half demonstrates 
the successful 
implementation of our 
plan to transform this 
business.
“50 years after launching, 
Time Out is the only true 
global marketplace for 
city life. We are in the 
happiness business and 
that’s why we no longer 
just write about the best 
city experiences but also 
create and deliver them; 
every year, millions of 
customers book theatre 
tickets and hotels with 
us, buy exclusive offers or 
visit Time Out Market to 
enjoy the best of the city.”

sites. Our audience has further grown as 
a result of our global expansion, namely 
the launch of new cities in the US and in 
Germany and new print magazines as 
well as the integration of former Time Out 
franchises in Australia, Spain, Hong Kong 
and Singapore into our owned and operated 
network. 
Time Out is very well known for its 
magazines, but is Time Out now a  
digital business?
Whilst digital revenues now account for 
a majority of the Group’s revenue and we 
are excited about the consistent growth 
of e-commerce and Premium Profiles, 
the physical nature of print and Time Out 
Market have a significant role to play in the 
future of Time Out as our global community 
chooses to use multiple channels to interact 
with us. Our content is platform agnostic 
and we deliver it to wherever our audience 
wants it - through our website, mobile, 
social, print, Live Events or Time Out 
Market. It is this unique ‘clicks and mortar’ 
approach that helps us raise the profile of 
our brand and expand our global presence.
Since the opening of Lisbon, six Time Out 
Market locations have been announced - 
when will the next open and can we expect 
more announcements?
Time Out Market Lisbon continues to be an 
incredible success story; it is now Portugal’s 
most visited attraction and recognised to be 
at the forefront of the emerging global food 
hall trend. This is a trend which has been 
growing significantly around the world 
and consumers love this democratisation 
of fine food and the communal feel. We are 
proud to lead the charge in this sector and 
truly differentiate as we not only offer the 
best food of the city but also its culture. 
This makes Time Out Market so much more 
than just a food hall. The fact that Time 
Out Market Lisbon saw 3.6 million visitors 
in 2017 shows how successful and popular 
this format is. As we are expanding Time 
Out Market globally, we are set to open 
Time Out Market New York and Miami 
in 2018, followed by Chicago and Boston 
in 2019. To capitalise on the exceptional 
growth opportunity Time Out Market offers 
we secured a loan of €9 million in 2017, a 
further £20 million in March 2018 and we 
continue to explore funding options.
What are the key challenges of the  
year ahead?
The industry we are operating in is 
challenged by the so-called ‘duopoly’, 
Facebook and Google, which is now also 
joined by Amazon. The duopoly’s share of 
global advertising spend has more than 
doubled over the past four years and now 
stands at over 20%. However, what makes 
Time Out stand out in this competitive and 
fast-changing environment is its hugely 
trusted brand, real authenticity, quality 
content, a loyal and engaged audience, 
unique products and experiences we offer 
and differentiated, bespoke multi-channel 
solutions within a brand-safe environment 
for advertisers. This combination of assets 
is difficult to replicate for these tech giants 
but something advertising clients and 
consumers increasingly seek. We need to 
strengthen these assets further to continue 
to evolve as a digital, transactional business 
and to get to profitability. As for our second 
business division, Time Out Market, a key 
challenge will be the openings coming up 
of new sites in 2018 in New York and Miami, 
and in 2019 in Chicago and Boston. I am 
pleased to have a fantastic team in place 
who are highly experienced with managing 
a number of high-profile openings within a 
short period of time.
Time Out is 50 years old in 2018. A lot has 
changed but what still remains?
It all began in London in 1968 when Time 
Out helped people explore the exciting 
things that happened all over the city. 
50 years on, this is still at the heart of 
everything we do, we continue to inspire 
and enable people to make the most of the 
city. But today we are present in 108 cities 
in 39 countries around the world. Through 
all those years, this iconic brand has 
maintained its status as the go-to source 
of inspiration for both locals and visitors 
alike, making Time Out the only true 
global marketplace for city life. Our unique, 
curated content written by professional 
journalists remains as relevant now as when 
it first started – it is this authentic high-
quality content people value in times of 
fake news more than ever before and that is 
why we are able to inspire millions of people 
to have a great time in cities around the 
world.

  O&O is the Time Out ‘owned and operated’ business operations; global 
audience reach includes market visitors, website traffic, social media reach 
and magazine readership for both ‘owned and operated’ as well as international 
licensing networks. ‘Monthly average’ calculated as a rolling twelve month 
average.
Audience development
During the year, the Group’s average global monthly audience reach 
grew by 39% to 217 million with O&O (owned and operated business 
operations) growing by 66%. Excluding acquisition countries, like-for-
like growth in O&O was 65%. This growth was driven by an increasing 
Facebook reach, which in the UK rose 109% from an average reach of 
38.0m per month in 2016 to 79.4m. Followers on Facebook grew by 30% 
YoY, with average website visits for the period increasing by one to two 
percent. The proportion of visits through mobile and tablet devices now 
exceeds 65%.
In 2017, Time Out further expanded its global presence through the 
launch of new cities within the US, new websites and magazines and 
the opportunities afforded from the acquisition of franchises. City 
websites were launched in Porto, Frankfurt, Munich, Dusseldorf and 
Hamburg, and magazines were launched in the cities of Austin, San 
Francisco and Philadelphia to complement the Group’s digital, mobile 
and social presence as it grows its national footprint and audience in 
North America. Hong Kong relaunched its magazine while two kids’ 
magazines were also launched in London enabling Time Out to expand 
its engagement with customers. Launching free magazines across key 
cities is part of Time Out’s continuing approach to print distribution and 
creates a halo effect on digital metrics, audience engagement and brand 
awareness.
Expanding the range of channels provides increasing value to 
advertisers. It allows them to reach Time Out’s audience through new 
creative opportunities across the brand’s global print, digital, mobile, 
social and event platforms. In the year, Time Out has successfully 
launched its content on the voice activated platforms of Alexa and the 
Google Assistant, offering advertisers another channel to connect with 
Time Out’s audience.

BUSINESS
REVIEW CONTINUED
Time Out Digital
Digital and print advertising 
Digital advertising revenue grew 19% YoY, excluding the contribution 
from businesses acquired during the year revenue was flat. In the 
UK, the benefits of the organisational changes made during that 
period and a number of key advertising deals with partners such as 
Google and Marriott resulted in good growth in the second half. Digital 
advertising revenue in the US declined by 1%. In both the UK and US, 
advertising continues to move from premium digital to programmatic 
with programmatic revenue across the Group growing by 35%. Through 
investment in technology, good progress has been made in improving 
viewability and the user experience of the web and mobile sites so as 
to enhance digital revenue. Good growth has been seen in France and 
Portugal. The Time Out franchisee in Australia was acquired in June 
2017 with offices in Melbourne and Sydney. It has a strong presence in 
digital advertising with total revenue growing 19% YoY. The franchisee 
in Spain was acquired in September 2017; it operates English, Spanish 
and Catalan language websites and magazines in Barcelona. Revenue 
in sterling has grown 28% (in euro 20%) compared to 2016. An office 
has been opened in Madrid with a website launched in Madrid in Q1 
2018 and plans for a new magazine in April 2018.
Overall, print advertising increased 2% YoY. Excluding acquisitions, 
there was a decline of 4% YoY, however trends improved in the second 
half with a slow-down in the rate of decline. In the UK, revenue grew 
approximately 2% in a declining market aided by increased premium 
advertising and sponsored supplements and the organisational 
changes made in the first half. Overall revenue per page increased 
11%. The US had a challenging year in a declining market with print 
revenue falling 13% due to a significant decline in page yields. 
Portugal’s revenue increased by 9% through increased advertising and 
subscriptions revenue. 
Time Out’s positive, trusted content - curated by professional 
journalists - is of great value to advertising partners seeking brand 
safe environments and unique campaign approaches. The Group has 
seen good growth in revenue from this multi-media advertising solution 
strategy, with the team increasingly working globally to share ideas and 
drive efficiencies. Highly visible and engaging branded moments were 
created in 2017, spanning multiple touchpoints across digital, mobile, 
social, print and Live Events. The list of high-profile clients included 
Lexus, AMEX, TAP Air Portugal, Seamless, Budweiser and Google. 
Examples of campaigns were the UK’s first freesheet video-in-print 
magazine cover ad for Three, a holiday giveaway experiential with British 
Airways and a unique, multi territory partnership with Marriott that 
saw the partner sponsor the launch of four new German city websites 
for Time Out as well as Time Out London’s first standalone travel 
magazine. In addition to campaigns delivered for clients in new verticals 
such as tech and auto, Time Out has also secured a roster of returning 
clients.
Local businesses: Premium Profiles
Revenue from Premium Profiles grew by 43% and the number of active 
listers increased by 60% to 1,230 as of December 2017. New York 
grew revenue by 176% YoY and the more established offering in London 
continues to perform well, increasing revenue by 27%. During the 
year, enhancements such as video were introduced to drive sales and 
partners’ visibility.
E-commerce 
E-commerce revenue, including transactions to sell the Group’s own 
events and third-party tickets, grew 57% YoY, with underlying growth 
of 53% and revenue growth increasing in the second half. Growth was 
driven by a 66% increase in revenue from affiliate sales, 21% from 
offers and 83% from Live Events. The overall number of transactions 
grew 33% and revenue per transaction increased to £18.11 (2016: 
£15.39).
With experienced senior management joining the team in the year 
and continued development of the e-commerce offering, affiliate 
revenue grew in both London and New York, with particularly strong 
growth in New York, where 172% growth was achieved. During 2017, 
significant investment was made in cost-per-click acquisition marketing, 
particularly in the first half to develop the Group’s presence in a range 
of categories, especially in the hotels and travel vertical. The strength 
of results delivered from organic traffic compared to those from paid 
search led to the decision to focus efforts on organic and natural traffic 
with a subsequent reduction in acquisition spend in the fourth quarter.
The Group is continuing to grow its e-commerce segment, closely 
managing the return from traffic acquisition spend and the impact of 
website and partner technical developments. Progress achieved within 
the period: 
 • Expansion: 74 cities now have e-commerce functionality on the 
websites, and 15 cities have multi language options to attract visits 
and bookings from new audiences via Time Out’s unique content.
 • Optimisation: Further enhancement of the product categories 
with higher average booking value and higher margins through 
partnerships with Booking.com, HotelsCombined, Airbnb, Viator,  
La Fourchette, Clicktripz and Encore.
 • Bookability: Optimised bookability with 24% of page views going 
to pages with bookable content and a book button in December 
2017, compared to 16% at the start of the year; a new homepage 
design launched at the beginning of 2018 further driving a closer 
connection of content and e-commerce.
 • Integration of the checkout functionality from YPlan, acquired in 
October 2016, has progressed: allowing an improved customer 
checkout experience and reductions in processing costs. 
Plans to focus product development on improving the visibility and 
distribution of offers have reaped rewards in 2017 with revenue 
increasing by 21%. The performance has been enhanced by the 
progress made in the more effective execution of the CRM strategy 
of the Group with the emails of Yplan customers being successfully 
integrated with those of Time Out and the quality and usability of data 
being further enhanced by a strengthened CRM team.
To further monetise customer traffic, exclusive products have been 
developed and launched. In November, the Group launched a limited 
edition, 1,000 run ‘restaurant gift box’ in London which sold out quickly. 
Called ‘Table for Two’, the curated luxury gift box was filled with cards 
giving diners 50% off food at twelve of Time Out’s 100 best restaurants 
in London throughout 2018. Plans are in place to expand this into other 
cities in 2018 and explore other exclusive products with another box 
having been launched in London in February 2018. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4

www.timeout.com STRATEGIC REPORT
E-commerce revenue growth was also driven by a particularly good 
performance from Live Events arranged and sold by the Group; an 
area which continues to expand across both US and European cities. 
Time Out continues to enhance its experiential offering throughout its 
global footprint with sponsored events having taken place in London, 
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris and Lisbon. The Group arranged 
791 Live Events for 155k attendees in 2017, up from 250 and 80k 
attendees in 2016. In pursuing new revenue opportunities, the Group 
accepted lower margins on certain events during the second half of 
2017, impacting the gross margin of the Group by over 150 basis 
points. Having established events in 2017, the Group is working 
closely with suppliers and sponsors to ensure that events in 2018 are 
undertaken at an improved margin.
International 
IIn addition to its owned and operated business operations in 76 cities 
across 20 countries, the Group has a presence in a further 32 cities 
across 20 countries through its international licensing arrangements. 
Rights are granted to third parties to publish print magazines and 
produce digital content under the Time Out brand, generating revenue 
through the payment of fees and royalties by third party licensees.
For the full year, revenue from licensees which are billed principally in 
dollars, decreased by 25%, mainly due to the acquisition of Australia 
and Spain and the addition, at no cost, of Hong Kong and Singapore 
and difficult trading conditions experienced by some of the incumbent 
franchisees.
Strengthening & aligning the Digital team
During the period, the Time Out Digital division reorganised its staff, 
resources and skill sets against the objectives of its evolving business 
and global strategy. Senior internal and external appointments were 
made to the Time Out Digital CEO (Christine Petersen) and other key 
roles including MD E-commerce and Chief Technology Officer. The 
reporting lines are now organised functionally and globally which has 
allowed a higher level of coordination, the sharing of best practice, 
content collaboration, the closer alignment of product development 
across the offices and has reduced the cost base. Excluding Time Out 
Market costs and the operating costs of the acquisitions, operating 
expenditure in H2 was £14.8 million (2016: £15.9 million) compared to 
£16.9 million (2016: £13.1 million) in the first half.
Time Out Market
Time Out Market in Lisbon has had another outstanding year, with a 
record 3.6 million visitors in the full year. Total tenant turnover has 
increased by 41% contributing to a 52% increase in local currency 
revenues YoY. This strong revenue growth has delivered an EBITDA of 
£2.3m from the Lisbon market.
The Group is on track to roll out Time Out Market to other cities 
globally:
 • New York – A lease agreement for a new Time Out Market in New 
York was signed in February 2018, which is conditional on obtaining 
a license approval and building permits. With the location in a venue 
near other already operating restaurants, it is expected that the 
market will open in Q4 2018.
 • Boston and Chicago – Conditional lease agreements have been 
signed for new locations in Chicago and Boston. With the benefits 
of planning for the sites already secured, openings are expected in 
2019.
 • Miami – Time Out Market Miami is expected to open in Q4 2018; the 
first line-up of high-profile chefs has been announced and was very 
positively received in the city.
 • Porto – Local authority support and now waiting for final approval.
 • London – With the support of the landlord, the Group appealed the 
declined planning permission in respect of the site in Spitalfields; if 
planning for the site is granted and runs to timetable it is expected 
that the site would open in late 2019 or early 2020; meanwhile the 
Group continues to explore other possible sites in London.
 • The Group continues to consider proposals for new locations 
in other cities around the world, including a strong interest in 
management contracts.
In February 2018, a 5-year sponsorship agreement with a supplier of 
beer and soft drinks was signed in Lisbon.
Centrally the division has incurred costs of £2.0m (2016: £1.6m) as 
part of this rollout including start-up costs of £0.2m in respect of new 
markets.
Board Change
The Group is pleased to report that Adam Silver will be appointed Chief 
Financial Officer and to the Board of Directors from 29 March 2018. 
He joins from Just Eat where he was UK CFO, having joined prior to its 
listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Prior to Just 
Eat, he was Group CFO and co-founder of The Karma Communications 
Group. Previously, Adam was an Investment Director at Ingenious Media 
and Hamilton Bradshaw, where he led growth capital investments 
in the media sector. Adam qualified as a Chartered Accountant at 
KPMG where he also spent a number of years within the Strategic & 
Commercial Intelligence practice in London and New York. Adam has a 
degree in Accounting and Finance from the University of Leeds. Richard 
Boult will step down at the same time to pursue new opportunities and 
the Group thanks him for his contribution.
Outlook
Clear progress has been made in 2017 evidenced by the revenue 
growth reported, particularly in e-commerce and Time Out Market, 
as the Group continues to evolve into a transactional business. The 
Group continues to execute on its stated growth strategy, with further 
progress anticipated throughout 2018 in both Time Out Digital and in 
Time Out Market.
The Group continued to make focused, strategic investment into the 
Time Out Digital business throughout 2017 to drive future growth and 
operating efficiencies, and has also developed an exciting pipeline of 
new sites for additional Time Out Markets in 2018 and thereafter.
Management remains confident that the Group will deliver against full 
year expectations.  25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code: TMO
BUSINESS
REVIEW CONTINUED
Financial performance
Revenue
Reported Group revenue for the year has increased by 24% from 
£35.7m to £44.4m primarily through organic growth and the acquisition 
of Time Out franchise partners in Australia and Spain. Growth excluding 
acquisitions and the effect of currency was £3.6m. Time Out Market 
Limited was acquired by the Group on 14 June 2016 and therefore it 
has only been included in the accounts after that date. Accounting 
on a proforma basis for a full year of Time Out Market in 2016, Group 
revenue grew by 19%.
Gross margin
The overall gross margin (revenue less cost of sales) of the Group 
declined by three percentage points YoY to 56% (2016: 59%). This 
was predominantly driven by the traffic acquisition strategy in the 
e-commerce business for the hotel vertical and the expansion at a low 
margin of Live Events. The declines were offset in part by the higher 
gross margin of the businesses acquired in Spain and Australia.  
The margin in Time Out Market declined by 4.4 percentage points 
principally due to the opening of the Time Out Bar in Lisbon. The bar, 
operated directly by Time Out, started in December 2016, and its first 
year of operation has contributed £0.8m of revenue.
Operating expenditure
Group operating expenditure before exceptional costs, share based 
payments, depreciation and amortisation, was £38.9m (2016: 
£32.9m). Excluding the effect of currency translation, total costs grew 
by £5.1m of which £2.5m relates to businesses acquired. Without 
the acquired businesses and at constant currency, H1 operating 
expenditure grew by 26% year on year and declined by 1% in H2 year 
on year as a result of the reorganisation undertaken in June 2017. Of 
the remainder, Time Out Market increased by £1.0m due to associated 
costs of expanding globally, the growth in the operations in Lisbon and 
the start-up costs for new markets. 
Close attention continues to be paid to costs to ensure that both cost 
of sales and operating expenditure and skills of teams are aligned with 
the potential revenue and activities of the company.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA represents the profit or loss before interest, 
taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments, share of 
associate’s loss and one-off exceptional items. 
Reported Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year was £14.2m (2016: 
£10.2m loss), a decline of £4.0m, due to cost of sales, the traffic 
acquisition strategy, the expansion of Time Out Digital activities and a 
full year of costs associated with being a listed company. 
Exceptional costs
One-off exceptional costs include £1.8m (2016: £1.3m) of costs 
relating to redundancy and other payments to reorganise the Group, 
£0.2m of office relocation costs in London, £0.6m of non-cash charges 
for the revaluation of options to acquire the minority interest in Time 
Out Market Lisbon and £0.5m of costs related to the acquisition of new 
countries.  
Share based payments
The value of these options at issuance has been amortised over the 
time to vesting of the option. As at 31 December 2017, 10.9m options 
were outstanding. 
Operating loss
The operating loss for the year was £24.6m (2016: £17.9m) including 
depreciation of £1.1m (2016: £0.7m) and amortisation of intangible 
assets of £4.4m (2016: £3.1m).
The amortisation of intangible assets included £2.3m (2016: 
£1.0m) relating to acquired intangible assets. Other intangible asset 
amortisation, primarily amortisation of software both acquired and 
internally developed, was £2.1m (2016: £2.2m).
Net finance costs
Net finance costs in 2017 of £0.8m (2016: £1.1m) mainly comprise 
interest on third party loans and the foreign exchange loss on financial 
assets. The decrease in finance costs on loans is a result of the 
repayment of senior and mezzanine debt in 2016. 
Foreign exchange
The revenues and costs of Group entities reporting in dollars have been 
consolidated in these financial statements at an average exchange rate 
of $1.29 (2016: $1.36). The operations reporting in euros have been 
consolidated at a rate of €1.14 (2016: €1.22). 
Currency effects for the year as a whole were not significant but 
there was a substantial change between each half. The impact on the 
revenues of the Group and its underlying revenue performance is as 
follows.

Associates
Time Out currently holds a 37.8% shareholding in Flypay. Flypay is 
a mobile technology platform providing solutions for ordering and 
payment within the hospitality sector. The investment is accounted 
for as an associate and the Group’s share of Flypay’s loss for 2017 
of £1.0m is included as ‘Share of associate’s loss’ on the income 
statement. The investment in Flypay is recorded at £6.2m at 31 
December 2017. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4

Operating cash flow
The cash used in operations before exceptional costs was £17.9m 
(2016: £12.7m) including a net working capital outflow of £3.5m (2016: 
£2.1m). Working capital balances have been impacted by the payment 
of a lease deposit on the new head office building, the deposit on 
the previous office being repaid in January 2018. This and other one 
off flows in 2017 were £2m including the seasonal growth in working 
capital of the business acquired in Australia. A strong last quarter 
for sales in the year led to a higher level of receivables than in prior 
periods and is the prime cause of the increase in the underlying cash 
out flow.
Capital expenditure of £4.4m (2016: £3.5m) includes £2.4m (2016: 
£1.8m) of capitalised software development costs relating to the teams 
working on the website and digital platforms, the cost of leasehold 
improvements and other equipment. Of the leasehold improvements, 
£1.5m was in respect of the development of new Time Out Market 
locations across the US, in London and Porto. 
 
Acquisitions
The Group undertook two business combinations in the period. It 
acquired the ordinary share capital of Print & Digital Publishing Pty 
Limited (“TO Australia”) for shares. The acquisition was completed on 2 
June 2017.  
On 14 August 2017, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital 
of 80 Mes Publicacions, S.L., a Spanish company which previously 
was a franchisee of the Group, in exchange for purchase consideration 
of cash of £905k and deferred consideration of £909k in the form of 
shares or cash at the discretion of Group management, with payment 
on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. 
On 28 March and 16 June 2017 the Group took over the existing 
franchisee operations in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. No 
consideration was paid.
New borrowings
In November 2017 Time Out Market received a loan from Incus Capital 
Advisors, S.L. of €9.0m denominated in Euros and repayable in 
instalments over 5 years. The loan has an interest rate of 11% over 
EURIBOR. It is subject to a financial covenant in respect of the EBITDA 
of Time Out Market Lisbon. 
On 27 March 2018 the Company entered into a £20m term loan facility 
agreement with Oakley Capital Investments Limited (“OCI”). The facility 
is for a period of 19 months and has an interest rate of between 10% to 
15% depending on amounts drawn. The proceeds of the new facilities 
are intended to be used by the Group to fund future Time Out Market 
developments.
OCI is a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined by the 
AIM Rules and as such entering into the facility constitutes a related 
party transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13. With the exception of Peter 
Dubens, who is a director of OCI, the Directors of the Group consider 
that, having consulted with Liberum, the terms of the transaction are 
fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders are concerned.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board sets out below the principal risks and uncertainties that the Directors consider could impact the business. The Board continually 
reviews the potential risks facing the Group and the controls in place to mitigate any potential adverse impacts. The Board also recognises that 
the nature and scope of risks can change and that there may be other risks to which the Group is exposed. The list is therefore not intended to be 
exhaustive. 
There is currently not a Risk Committee in place, so the Audit Committee reviews the risk register regularly as part of its annual agenda and, 
through discussions with management, identifies new potential risks as well as suggests implementation or improvement of existing controls. 
Risk Mitigation Action/Control
Competition The Group operates in a highly competitive industry and the advent of new technologies and industry practices may 
adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Group is subject to a number of 
factors relating to product demand, prices, recognition of the “Time Out” brand and the ability to attract and retain new 
customers.
To minimise these risks, the Group continues to invest significantly in the development of its digital offering to ensure 
that it remains innovative, competitive and attractive in the markets in which it operates. The focus on the quality of 
offerings means that the Group is able to respond to changes in the competitive landscape and respond to the needs of 
its readership audience and commercial partners.
Technological 
Risk
IT Systems
The Group is particularly dependent on its IT infrastructure, and any system performance issues or shortcomings 
(for example, system, software or infrastructure failure, damage or denial of access) could cause serious business 
interruption. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of the systems, technology and networks on which the Group 
relies and its ability to provide consumers with reliable, real-time access to its products and services is fundamental to 
the success of the Group’s business. Back-up facilities are in place to ensure business interruptions are minimised and 
internal and customer data is protected from corruption or unauthorised use. Business recovery plans are also in place to 
minimise the effects of damage or denial of access to infrastructure or systems. The Group uses third party resources to 
assist with these areas where necessary.
Technological 
Risk
Technological 
Advancements
Time Out continues to grow at a fast pace and such growth requires ever more complex and sizeable technological 
systems. At the same time, technology itself continues to develop. Any failure to ensure that IT capacity and capability 
keep pace with the business could impair the Group’s ability to grow. To mitigate this risk, the Group makes ongoing 
investments in IT systems, security and people to ensure that they are sufficient for the needs of the business and do not 
become obsolete or compromised.
Privacy 
and Data 
Protection 
Risk
As the Group’s digital revenue offerings grow, the Group increasingly needs to gather and use customers’ personal data in 
order to transact with both businesses and customers. Unauthorised access to customer data could lead to reputational 
damage, compliance issues and a loss of customer confidence. The Group relies on third party contractors and its 
own employees to collect personal data and to maintain its databases and therefore the Group is exposed to the risk 
that such data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, damaged or processed in breach of data protection 
regulations. To mitigate this risk, the Group intends to implement a policy which adopts ISO 270001 principles including, 
the development and implementation of information security policies and procedures (for example, password policies and 
remote access policies), security monitoring software, access policies, password policies, physical access limitations and 
detection and monitoring of fraud from internal staff. Access to the network is protected by a firewall system supplied by 
Cisco. The Group also operates fraud detection systems which use various industry standard anti-fraud rules to prevent 
fraudulent transactions in real time. The Group encrypts sensitive data such as passwords and other certain information 
to ensure there is an additional layer of security.
The Group will operate under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) when the regulations 
become enforceable in May 2018. Significant progress has been made in respect of GDPR readiness and the Group 
anticipates no material issues with compliance on adoption. Compliance with these new regulations will be included on 
the Group risk register going forward and risk commentary updated at year end 2018.  25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4

www.timeout.com STRATEGIC REPORT
Risk Mitigation Action/Control
Economic 
Environment
The Group’s results of operations are affected by overall economic conditions in its key geographic markets via the 
demand for the content of the Group’s publications and websites in those markets as well as the prices which the Group 
can offer to potential advertisers and customers. If the local economy in a key market experiences a downturn, the 
Group’s publications, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Further, the UK’s exit from the European 
Union could lead to global political uncertainty and macro-economic uncertainty in the UK economy, as well as an impact 
on the availability of markets and market access across Europe. The geographic diversity of the business and the 
developing breadth in the business provides some mitigation from a downturn in a specific geographical location or part of 
the economy.
Foreign 
Exchange 
Risk
A substantial portion of the Group’s consolidated revenue is denominated in euros and US dollars. Since the Group 
reports its financial results in sterling, fluctuations in rates of exchange between sterling and the other currencies, 
particularly euros and US dollars, may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. If sterling 
weakens as the UK exits the European Union, it may limit the Group’s ability to seek new opportunities and/or operate in 
other currencies.
Key 
Management
The Group’s success depends on its key personnel, particularly its senior management team, and its ability to retain 
them and hire other qualified employees. The loss of a significant number of key personnel may have a negative effect 
on the Group’s ability to deliver its products in a timely manner and would, amongst other things, require the remaining 
key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. In order to mitigate this risk, 
the HR department monitors employee satisfaction through employee surveys and forums, and uses the information 
to develop staff retention programmes. The Remuneration Committee also seeks to ensure that rewards correspond 
with performance and retention. Finally, the IPO has enabled the business to launch share-based incentives to assist in 
retaining key personnel.
Brand 
Protection
The Group depends on its brand name and any damage to its brand or reputation could impact the ability to attract and 
retain customers with a resultant impact on traffic and revenues, as well as impair the ability of the Group to attract 
employees. The Group has brand guidelines in place which are regularly communicated to all employees and key third 
parties to ensure consistency of voice and approach throughout all marketing activities. There is also a robust strategy 
in place for actively pursuing and defending the Time Out brand name and all supporting trademarks, domain names and 
other intellectual property in all key markets in all relevant classes. Furthermore, the Group employs internal and external 
legal personnel who are experts in intellectual property to manage the trademark and domain name portfolios and there 
are an ever-increasing number of trademarks and domain names applied for and registered across the world.
Other factors Other economic factors which may affect spending habits of consumers include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism 
which could affect the willingness of consumers to continue existing spending habits and use of free time.
Operational 
risk
Time Out Market
The Group intends to replicate the market concept in other cities across the world. The roll-out of new markets and the 
ongoing success of the Time Out Market in Lisbon could be negatively affected by a number of factors including:
• Terrorist or other visitor incidents, including fire, crowd control, or any other disaster or failure to comply with health 
and safety (including issues relating to food poisoning or other problems with food and/or beverages consumed at 
the Time Out market), security and environmental requirements. These incidents could affect the reputation and 
revenues of Time Out Market and of the Group, and may result in legal proceedings against the Company, TOM or 
another member of the Group.
• The roll-out of new markets may take longer than planned or ultimately not succeed, due to delays in or difficulties 
in agreeing commercial terms with landlords, problems in obtaining necessary planning permissions,  delays in 
construction or significant inflation in costs; and difficulties in attracting premium restaurateurs on adequate 
financial terms. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Monetising businesses 
Time Out is connecting global and local 
brands and businesses with its engaged, 
valuable audience through a variety 
of solutions spanning advertising and 
sponsorship as well as Premium Profiles 
which allow venues such as restaurants, 
bars and hotels to improve their exposure 
on the platform.
It is Time Out’s positive, trusted content that is of great 
value for an audience craving authentic inspiration and for 
advertising partners craving brand safe environments. In 
2017, Time Out delivered a number of high-impact campaigns 
across multiple touchpoints such as digital, mobile, social, 
print and Live Events. Clients included TAP Air Portugal, British 
Airways, Budweiser, Marriott, Lexus and many more. Bringing 
digital and print together, Time Out’s Creative Solutions team 
delivered the UK’s first freesheet video-in-print ad as part of 
a six-week multi-platform campaign for Three. The campaign 
spanned all of Time Out’s advertising channels leveraging the 
full strengths of its high-traffic channels with bespoke content 
and advertorials across print, digital and social media. It also 
included experiential elements, taking over ‘Movies on the 
River’ – a boat which sailed down the River Thames screening 
films as part of Time Out’s Live Events programme.

Tony Elliott, 
Non-Executive 
Director
Mr Elliott founded Time 
Out in 1968 with £70 
during a summer break 
from Keele University. 
The Time Out magazine 
was initially a folded-down 
poster equivalent to eight 
pages of today’s printed 
format that Mr Elliott 
handed out himself. The range of curated content sought to reflect the 
best of what was happening in London together with a focus on the issues 
of the day and laid the foundations for the Time Out brand’s coverage and 
culture today. Over the years, Mr Elliott transformed Time Out into a global 
media brand and, in November 2010, sold a controlling share of Time 
Out to Oakley Capital to provide operational support and investment to 
bring the brand back under common ownership and to develop the digital 
platform. Mr Elliott has been a Non-Executive Director of the Company 
since November 2010, having previously served as Executive Chairman 
of Time Out since its founding in 1968. Mr Elliott is currently a director 
and/or trustee of a number of cultural institutions including Human Rights 
Watch (UK charity), Granta Publications and Create London. At the end 
of 2017, he stepped down as director and/or trustee of The Roundhouse 
(where he also served as Vice Chair), Somerset House Trust and Somerset 
House Enterprises Ltd. In addition, Mr Elliott has previously acted as 
a director and/or trustee of Human Rights Watch’s London Committee 
(founding Chair), HRW International Board, Film London, Soho Theatre

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT 
Introduction
This section of the report sets out the Group’s approach to governance 
and provides further information on how the Board and its committees 
operate. 
The Directors acknowledge the importance of high standards of 
corporate governance. The Company is not required to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) however it intends 
to continue to adopt the principal provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) as appropriate for the size and nature of 
the Company and given the composition of the board. The Company is 
also mindful of the recommendations of the QCA Corporate Governance 
Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (“QCA guidelines”). 
Composition of the Board
The Board is the link between the Shareholders and Executive 
management and is responsible for the successful stewardship of the 
Group. As such the Board plays a key role in the corporate governance 
process.
During the period 23 January to 31 December 2017, the Board 
comprised of eight Directors, three of whom were Executive Directors 
and five of whom were Non-Executive Directors, reflecting a blend 
of different experiences and backgrounds. Biographical details of 
current Board members are shown on page 24. The Board believes 
that the composition of the Board brings a desirable range of skills 
and experience in light of the Company’s challenges and opportunities, 
while at the same time ensuring that no individual (or small group of 
individuals) can dominate the Board’s decision making. Notwithstanding 
Lord Rose’s entitlements under the Time Out Market Equity Incentive 
Plan the Company regarded Lord Rose and Matthew Riley as 
“independent Non-Executive Directors” within the meaning of the 
QCA Code and free from any business or other relationship that could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement.
From 1 January 2017 to 23 January 2017, when Mr Riley joined 
the Board and Ms Petersen became Executive Director, the Board 
comprised seven Directors, two of whom were Executive Directors and 
five of whom were Non-Executive Directors.
As of January 2017, Ms Petersen stepped in as the interim Chief 
Executive Officer of Time Out Digital before being appointed to 
the permanent role as of 12 April 2017. On interim appointment, 
she stepped down as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
Remuneration Committee and could no longer be considered an 
independent Non-Executive Director. She continues to serve on the 
Board as an Executive Director. Matthew Riley, who joined the Company 
as a Non-Executive Director in January 2017, replaced Ms Petersen in 
these Chairman roles.
The Board’s composition and skill set is considered appropriate 
for the Group’s current stage of development. The experience 
and knowledge of each of the Directors gives them the ability to 
constructively challenge strategy and to scrutinise performance. As the 
Board is small, there is not a separate Nominations Committee and 
recommendations for appointments to the Board will be considered by 
the Board as a whole after due evaluation. 
Board Role and Meetings
The Board is responsible for the Group’s strategy and for its overall 
management, as well as setting the Group’s values and standards. The 
operation of the Board is documented in a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval which is reviewed annually. These matters 
relate to:
 • All of the Group’s strategic aims and objectives;
 • The structure and capital of the Group;
 • Financial reporting, controls and policies including those around 
cyber protection; 
 • Setting budgets and forecasts; 
 • Internal controls; 
 • Approval of any significant contracts, expenditure, partnerships and/
or ventures; 
 • Effective communication with shareholders; 
 • Any changes to the Board membership or structure, including 
delegation of authority; 
 • Approval for remuneration for Executive Directors; and
 • Approval of appointment of Key Management Personnel  
and Directors
Non-Executive Directors communicate directly with Executive Directors 
and senior management between formal Board meetings. 
The Board met eight times during 2017. Directors are expected to 
attend all meetings of the Board and committees on which they sit, and 
to devote sufficient time to their duties to the Group. In the event that 
Directors are unable to attend a meeting, their comments on papers 
to be considered at the meeting will be discussed in advance with the 
Chairmen so that their contribution can be included in the wider Board 
discussion. 
The following table shows Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board 
and Committee meetings for the year to 31 December 2017:

Board Committees
The board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee, details of which are set 
out below. Each committee has written terms of reference setting out 
its duties, authorities and reporting responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for monitoring the 
quality of internal controls to ensure that the financial performance of 
the Group is properly measured and reported. It receives and reviews 
reports from the Group’s management relating to the interim and 
annual accounts and the accounting and internal control systems in 
use throughout the Group. It meets with external Auditors throughout 
the year to discuss their findings in relation to the annual accounts. 
The Audit Committee aims to meet not less than three times in each 
financial year, and it has unrestricted access to the Group’s External 
Auditors.
Membership of the Audit Committee includes only independent Non-
Executive Directors. Following the change in Ms Petersen’s role in 
January 2017, she resigned from this Committee. From the 23 January 
2017, the Audit Committee comprised of Lord Rose and Matthew Riley 
and was chaired by Mr Riley.
More information about this Board committee can be found in the Audit 
Committee report on page 33. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the Executive 
Directors and makes recommendations to the Board on matters 
relating to their remuneration and terms of service. The Remuneration 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on proposals 
for the granting of share options and other equity incentives pursuant 
to any employee share option scheme or equity incentive plans in 
operation from time to time.
The Remuneration Committee meets as and when necessary, but 
aims to meet at least twice each year. As part of the responsibility of 
the committee, the members have regard to the recommendations 
put forward in the QCA Code and, where appropriate, the QCA 
Remuneration Committee Guide and associated guidance. 
Membership of the Remuneration Committee includes only independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Following the change in Ms Petersen’s role in 
January 2017, she resigned from this Committee. From the 23 January 
2017, the Remuneration Committee comprised of Lord Rose and 
Matthew Riley and was chaired by Mr Riley.
More information about this Board Committee can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration report on page 34. 
Board Effectiveness 
All Directors take part in a thorough induction process on joining the 
Board, tailored to the existing knowledge and experience of the Director 
concerned. 
The performance of the Board is fundamental to the Company’s 
success. The performance of the Board and its Committees, including 
individual members, is evaluated regularly by the Chairman, with the 
aim of improving their effectiveness.
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. In 
addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary and Chief Financial Officer.
Key Management
The Key Management roles that have been identified by the Board are 
as follows:
 • Group Chief Executive Officer
 • Chief Executive Officer, Time Out Digital
 • Chief Executive Officer, Time Out Market
 • Chief Financial Officer 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED 
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However well the system 
is designed to manage risk, it cannot eliminate all risk, and therefore 
it provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board considers that the internal controls 
in place are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the 
Group. The principal elements of the Group’s internal control system 
include:
 • Close management of the day-to-day activities of the Group by the 
Executive Directors;
 • An organisational structure with defined levels of responsibility, 
which promotes entrepreneurial decision making and rapid 
implementation whilst minimising risks;
 • A comprehensive annual budgeting process, producing a detailed 
integrated profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow, which is 
approved by the Board;
 • Detailed monthly reporting of performance against budget; and
 • Central control over key areas such as capital expenditure 
authorisation and banking facilities.
The Group continues to review its system of internal control to ensure 
compliance with best practice, whilst also having regard to its size and 
the resources available. The Board considers that the introduction of an 
internal audit function is not appropriate at the current time, however 
an internal review is completed by internal senior members of the 
finance function in order to ensure accuracy in the financial reporting.
During 2017, the Group took the opportunity to review their approach to 
business continuity and disaster recovery and towards the end of the 
year, entered in to a three year contract with a specialised third party 
solution provider.  A recovery site has been in place since November 
2017 with further testing and risk assessments scheduled through 
2018 for both head office and overseas locations.
Relations with shareholders
Copies of the annual report are sent to all Shareholders. Copies of 
the annual and interim reports can be downloaded from the investors 
section on www.timeout.com. Other information for Shareholders and 
interested parties is also provided on that website. Written or e-mailed 
enquiries are handled by the Company Secretary. The Secretary can be 
reached at the registered address or at companysecretary@timeout.
com. The Group has an ongoing programme of individual meetings with 
institutional Shareholders and analysts following the preliminary and 
half-year results presentations to the City. These meetings allow the 
Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to update 
shareholders on strategy and the Group’s performance. Additional 
meetings with institutional investors and/or analysts are arranged from 
time to time. All members of the Board receive copies of feedback 
reports from the City presentations and meetings, thus keeping them in 
touch with shareholder opinion.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to ask questions and raise 
issues at the Annual General Meeting (AGM); this can be done formally 
during the meeting or informally with the Directors after it. The AGM will 
be held on 8 June 2018 at 77 Wicklow Street, London, WC1X 9JY. The 
notice of the AGM accompanies this Annual Report and Accounts.

DIRECTORS’
REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ Indemnity  
and Liability Insurance
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the financial 
year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and 
its Directors.
The Directors also have the benefit of the indemnity provision 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association which represents a 
qualifying third-party indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of 
the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force throughout the 
financial period and at the date of approval of the financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in 
Respect of the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 • state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have 
been followed for the Company financial statements, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to  
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in Board 
of Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 • the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law), give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the company;
 • the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the Group; and
 • the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report 
is approved:
 • so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group and Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 • they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information. 
Website Publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and 
Accounts are made available on a website and are published on 
the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the Annual 
Report and Accounts, which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website 
is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also 
extends to the ongoing integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 
contained therein.
Political Donations

Going Concern
The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future and at least 12 months from the date of 
signing these financial statements and consider it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Company and 
Group financial statements.
This confirmation is made having considered the financial position of 
the Group on the basis of the latest budgets and forecasts, the cash 
balance of £29.8 million at 31 December 2017 and the availability of 
future financing, including the £20 million credit facility entered into 
in March 2018, committed until October 2019, to help accelerate the 
roll-out of new markets.  As new markets are opened the Directors 
will explore alternative financing options from a number of potential 
sources.  The Directors have considered downside risks to the Group’s 
plans, together with options available to reduce the rate of cash burn 
in the short to medium term, and assessed the potential impact 
these would have on the Group’s liquidity. In evaluating these risks 
the Directors have considered the Group’s history of operating losses 
and the cash outflows that are expected to continue as the Group 
undertakes the expansion of the Time Out Markets business.
Research & Development
The Group undertakes activity which could be classified as research 
and development. This is further explained in note 2 of the accounts. 
Conflicts of Interest

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly reported and reviewed. Its role 
includes monitoring the integrity of the financial statements (including 
the Annual Report and Accounts and interim accounts and results 
announcements), reviewing internal control and risk management 
systems, reviewing any changes to accounting policies, reviewing and 
monitoring the extent of the non-audit services undertaken by external 
auditors and advising on the appointment of external auditors.
Composition and Role  
of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s members during the year were Christine Petersen, 
who resigned from the Committee on 23 January 2017, Matthew Riley, 
who was appointed Chairman on 23 January 2017, and Lord Rose. 
Richard Boult also attended Committee meetings in his role as Chief 
Financial Officer. The Committee met three times in 2017 and aims 
to meet at least three times annually. Details on attendance for these 
meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 26.

resignation from the committee, Matthew Riley was appointed in her 
place. The Board is satisfied that the Chairmen and other members of 
the committee have senior Director experience in major listed companies 
and is therefore satisfied that members have recent and relevant 
financial experience. More information on Mr Riley and Lord Rose’s 
background can be found in the Directors’ Biographies on page 24.
The main duties of the Audit Committee are set out in its Terms of 
Reference which are available on the Company’s website www.timeout.

ensure that auditor independence and objectivity are maintained. As 
part of its review the Committee monitors the provision of non-audit 
services by the external Auditor. The breakdown of fees between audit 
and non-audit services is provided in note 7 of the Group’s accounts. 
The non-audit fees relate to a half-year review, company secretarial 
services and transfer pricing advice.
The Audit Committee also assesses the Auditor’s performance. Having 
reviewed the Auditor’s independence and performance, the Audit 
Committee has recommended that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be 
reappointed as the Company’s Auditor at the next AGM.
Audit Process
The Auditor prepares an audit plan for its review of the full year 
financial statements. The audit plan sets out the scope of the audit, 
areas to be targeted and the audit timetable. This plan is reviewed and 
agreed in advance by the Audit Committee. Following its review, the 
Auditor presents its finding to the Committee for discussion. Areas 
of significant risk and other matters of audit relevance are regularly 
communicated.
Internal Audit
At present, the Group does not have an internal audit function, and 
the Committee believes that management is able to derive assurance 
as to the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management procedures without one. The Committee will continue to 
review this decision.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
As described on page 28 of the Corporate Governance Report, the 
Group has established a framework of risk management and internal 
control systems, policies and procedures. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the risk management and internal control 
framework and ensuring that it operates effectively. During the year, the 
Committee has reviewed the framework and the Committee is satisfied 
that the internal control systems in place are currently operating 
effectively.
Whistleblowing
The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy which sets out the 
formal process by which an employee of the Group may, in confidence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or 
other matters. Whistleblowing is a standing item on the Committee’s 
agenda and updates are provided at each meeting.
During the year there were no incidents for consideration.

Matthew Riley, who was appointed Chairman on 23 January 2017, and 
Lord Rose. The Committee operated under the Terms of Reference 
and was responsible for reviewing the performance of the Executive 
Directors and for making recommendations to the Board on matters 
relating to their remuneration and terms of service. The Committee 
was also responsible for making recommendations to the Board on 
proposals for the granting of share options.

Remuneration Policy
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy is to attract, 
motivate and retain high quality individuals who will contribute fully 
to the success of the Group. To achieve this objective, the Group 
provides competitive salaries and benefits to all employees. Executive 
Directors’ remuneration is set to create an appropriate balance 
between both fixed and performance-related elements. Remuneration 
is reviewed each year in light of the Group’s business objectives. It 
is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that remuneration should 
reward achievement of objectives and that these are aligned with 
Shareholders’ interests over the medium term. 
No director has any involvement in setting their own remuneration.
Remuneration consists of the following elements:
 • Basic salary;
 • Performance-related annual bonus; 
 • Share options; 
 • Pensions; and 
 • Benefits including insurance and allowances.
Share Options
The Company operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which is a

AUDITORS’ REPORT
Report on the audit of the financial 
statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 • Time Out Group plc’s group financial statements and company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
 • the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 • the company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the 
consolidated and company statements of financial position as at 31 
December 2017; the consolidated income statement and consolidated 
statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement 
of cash flows, and the consolidated and company statements of 
changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview
 • Overall group materiality: £442,000 (2016: £357,000), based on  
1% of total revenues.
 • Overall company materiality: £419,000 (2016: £339,000), based 
on 1% of total assets, restricted to 95% of group materiality.
 • The focus of the group team’s 
work was on the UK and US 
operations. We received 
reporting from Portugal on 
audits of the complete financial 
information.
 • In addition, specified audit 
procedures were performed by 
the group team on the other UK 
non-operating subsidiaries.
 • Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets (Group).
 • Recoverability of Time Out Markets set up costs (Group).
 • Ability of the group to continue as a going concern.  
(Group and Company).
 • Capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets (Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.  25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

AUDITORS’ REPORT
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified 
by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
Refer to notes 12 and 13 
Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises on the acquisition of a business 
and reflects the portion of the consideration paid which cannot be allocated 
to separately identifiable acquired assets. Goodwill is not amortised but 
tested for impairment at least once a year or more frequently where there is 
an indication that it may be impaired.
The group has also recognised both acquired and internally generated 
intangible assets. Whilst these are amortised over their useful economic life, 
there is a risk that their value may need to impaired, and so they are included 
in the impairment testing.
We focused on this area because goodwill and intangible assets are material 
to the consolidated financial statements and the assumptions used in the 
impairment assessment are inherently subjective. In particular, the fair value 
less costs to sell model that forms the basis of management’s assessment 
contains a number of judgements, the most sensitive of which are the 
revenue projections for the group and the revenue multiple used, which is 
based on revenue multiples of other similar groups
Group
We assessed whether the selected revenue multiples were reasonable by 
comparing them to other data sources, including revenue multiples from a 
number of similar businesses.  We also considered whether the revenue used 
in these calculations was reasonable in light of historic performance and 
industry projections. We considered whether there had been any changes to 
the business or to the market environment which could increase the level of 
uncertainty in the forecast.
We performed sensitivities to assess the level that revenue multiples 
and forecast revenue would need to decrease, either individually or in 
combination, in order to indicate an impairment. 
Based on the work performed, we concluded that it was reasonable to 
conclude that the revenue forecasts and multiples would not decrease by 
the levels required to cause a material impairment in the model used by 
management.
Recoverability of Time Out Markets set up costs
Refer to note 14
In the process of expanding the Time Out Markets business into new 
locations the group has incurred material pre-opening costs which have been 
capitalised. There is judgement involved as to whether these assets will be 
recoverable in the future, in particular in relation to the costs incurred of £0.9 
million in London and £0.8 million in Miami, both of which have been subject 
to objections during the planning process.
Group
We considered the accuracy and completeness of the costs by agreeing them 
back to supporting documentation and considered the appropriateness of 
capitalisation of the costs.
We have reviewed the economic forecasts of the markets to ensure that costs 
incurred are forecast to be recovered by the future economic benefits to flow 
to the group. We have compared these forecasts to the existing market in 
Lisbon and also other information indicating commercial interest in these two 
markets
Where there is uncertainty around the outcome of planning and licensing 
applications and appeals we have corresponded with planning advisors and 
external legal counsel to understand the expected outcomes of the cases.
Based on the work performed we have found that the forecasted cash flows 
for both the London and Miami markets indicate that the set-up costs will be 
recovered and that management’s assessment that it is still probable that 
planning will be approved for both sites is supported by our correspondence 
with external legal counsel. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Ability of the group to continue as a going concern
Refer to note 2
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the group made a loss of £26.0 
million and had a cash outflow from operating activities of £21.3 million.  
The group is also expected to open a number of new market sites in the near 
future, which will require capital expenditure.
The directors performed a going concern assessment, based on their latest 
budgets and forecasts, and taking into account the credit facility of £20 
million which is available until October 2019. The directors’ assessment 
included a number of downside sensitivities and identified mitigating 
actions that could be taken to reduce cash burn if necessary. The directors 
concluded that it was appropriate to prepare the group and company financial 
statements on a going concern basis. 
We considered this to be a key audit matter because of the cash outflow in 
the year, and the potential impact on the Group’s liquidity of downside risks 
applied to management’s forecasts.
Group and Company
We examined the group’s cash flow forecast for the 12 month period 30 
April 2019 and agreed that this are based on Board approved budgets. We 
also requested the directors to extend their forecast to October 2019. The 
forecast included key assumptions in relation to future revenue growth, as 
well as capital expenditure relating to the roll-out of new markets. We tested 
the key assumptions in the forecast by comparing the sales growth to historic 
performance and agreeing the capital expenditure assumptions on the 
markets to lease agreements and management estimates We also tested the 
mathematical accuracy of the forecast.
We held discussions with management to understand the nature of downside 
risks, and considered whether further risks should be applied to the 
forecasts. We used our understanding of the group and industry to assess 
the possibility of such risks arising and their potential impact. We examined 
documentation supporting the mitigating actions identified by management 
to reduce the rate of cash burn should downside risks arise.  We inspected 
the credit facility agreement entered into in March 2018 with Oakley Capital 
Investments Limited, to check that it was committed until October 2019. 
We examined the disclosure in note 2 and found it to be sufficient to inform 
members about the directors’ conclusions on the appropriateness of using 
the going concern basis of accounting.  
Our conclusion on going concern is set out below. 
Capitalisation of development costs
Refer to note 13
We focused on this area because of the significant level of judgement by 
the directors involved in determining whether internal time and external 
costs incurred in respect of development costs satisfy the requirements 
of the financial reporting framework (International Accounting Standard 38 
Intangible assets) to be capitalised, including that they are separable from 
the other assets of the business and will provide future economic benefits for 
the group.
The internally generated intangible assets are all within the UK. 
Group
We gained an understanding of the controls and review process over the 
capitalisation of development costs.
We discussed the future cash flow projections of each project with relevant 
personnel and obtained explanations for the assumptions made. We have 
reviewed management’s classification of costs between new projects, 
improvements and maintenance expenditure.  
We have assessed whether any existing assets are impaired as a result of 
new developments in the year.
We selected a sample of projects and reviewed management’s assessment 
for these projects that they satisfied the recognition criteria in IAS 38. We 
also tested a sample of internal costs to work systems and supporting payroll 
records and verified the allocation of employee costs to the correct projects 
and external costs to invoices.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The group reports its operating results and financial position in seven territories, being UK, USA, Portugal, Australia, Spain, Hong Kong and 
Singapore. The group Financial Statements are a consolidation of the group’s operating businesses and central functions. The group’s operating 
reporting units vary significantly in size, the most significant being the UK, US and Portugal. The group team performed the audits of the UK and 
USA. We also performed an audit of the complete financial information of Portugal. We issued instructions to our Portuguese team, which included 
guidance on the areas of focus for the audit.  We then had regular communication with them and received reporting on their work. In addition, 
specified audit procedures were performed on the UK non-operating subsidiaries by the group team.
The group team assessed the appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of group journals and other adjustments performed on the 
consolidation and obtained an understanding of the internal control environment related to the financial reporting process. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

AUDITORS’ REPORT
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Company  
financial statements
Overall materiality £442,000 (2016: £357,000). £419,000 (2016: £339,000).
How we determined it 1% of total revenues. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the annual 
report, revenue is the primary measure used by 
the shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the group, and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.
We believe that total assets are the primary measure 
used by the shareholders in assessing the performance 
of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark. The materiality has been limited to 95% of 
overall group materiality.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £152,000 and £419,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit 
materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £22,100 (Group audit) (2016: 
£17,000) and £22,100 (Company audit) (2016: £17,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
 • the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 • the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date 
when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain 
opinions and matters as described below. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Rolling Out Time Out Market
With Time Out Market Lisbon, the Group 
created the country’s most visited 
attraction with 3.6 million visitors in 
2017. They came to enjoy affordable fine 
food from 32 restaurants and kiosks, 
and drinks from eight bars and cafes; 
they attended 245 events at the Chefs 
Academy and 123 events in the Time Out 
Market Studio. It is this unique mix of 
the best of the city, based on Time Out’s 
editorial curation, that continues to attract 
both locals and visitors alike and takes 
Time Out Market from strength to strength.
To capitalise on the growth opportunity Time Out Market 
offers, the Group has developed an exciting pipeline for new 
openings in 2018 and thereafter. This comes at a time when 
such experiences are increasingly popular around the world 
with Time Out Market spearheading this trend. In March 2018, 
the Group announced that later that year it would bring Time 
Out Market to New York. There will be 20 food offerings, three 
bars, a stage for cultural activities and around 520 seats 
across 21,000 sq ft; its waterfront location in Brooklyn will 
offer fantastic views of Manhattan’s skyline. Time Out Market 
Miami is set to open in Q4 2018 and a first, highly-anticipated 
line-up of some of the city’s most celebrated chefs was 
revealed for the curated mix of 17 kitchens. New markets 
are also set to open in Boston and Chicago in 2019. Time 
Out Market Boston will be located at the heart of the popular 
Fenway neighbourhood in a warehouse built in 1929; it is 
expected to have a footprint of 21,500 sq ft and 3,700 sq ft of 
outdoor space. Time Out Market Chicago, set within a stand-
alone brick building, will showcase across nearly 50,000 sq ft 
16 food offerings, three bars, a demonstration kitchen, a retail 
area and a spectacular rooftop with views of the skyline.

NOTES TO THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Time Out Group plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 March 2017. Time Out Group plc (the “Company”) is a public limited 
company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the Alternative Investment Market. The registered office is 
located at 77 Wicklow Street, London, WC1X 9JY. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under paragraph 8(g) of the disclosure exemptions 
from EU-adopted IFRS for qualifying entities included in Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). The Time 
Out Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 contain a consolidated statement of cash flows. The 
Company is exempt under paragraph 8(k) of the disclosure exemptions from EU-adopted IFRS included in FRS 101 for qualifying entities from 
disclosing related party transactions with entities that form part of the Time Out Group plc group of which Time Out Group plc is the ultimate parent 
undertaking. The Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is also the Company’s functional currency, and all 
values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when otherwise indicated. The Company’s financial statements are individual entity 
financial statements.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Strategic Report that accompanies these financial statements.
2. Accounting policies
Time Out Group is the leading global media and entertainment business that inspires and enables people to make the most of a city. Through 
powerful content, top-quality curation, enabling technology and exceptional experiences, Time Out helps discover, book and share what the world’s 
cities have to offer. 
Across multiple platforms comprising digital, app, mobile, social and print and its physical presence via Live Events and Time Out Market, the 
Group aims to connect consumers and businesses in the leisure, travel and local entertainment sector through B2C and B2B offerings.
Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Alternative performance measures
Underlying results are presented excluding the contribution from the acquisitions of the Australia franchisee in June 2017 and the Spain franchisee 
in September 2017, and the addition of Singapore and Hong Kong. The businesses combined contributed a net revenue of £2.8m in the period. 
EBITDA contribution was a loss of £0.5m. For Business Review purposes, the figures for Time Out Market in 2016 include the first six months of 
that year, prior to its acquisition by the Group, given that this is a separate reportable segment. The measure is used to show the performance of 
the business before the effects of other acquisitions.
Adjusted EBITDA is profit or loss before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments, share of associate’s loss and one-
off exceptional items. Used by management and analysts to assess the business before one off and non-cash items. A reconciliation of adjusted 
EBITDA to operating loss is presented in note 4.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Time Out Group plc have been prepared under the historic cost convention except for certain financial 
liabilities measured at fair value and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 
December 2017 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and Companies Act 2006. The financial statements are prepared 
on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value. The accounting policies 
which follow in note 3 set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have 
been applied consistently to all years presented. The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101 in 
respect of:
a. IFRS 3 Business Combinations;
b. the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
c. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;   25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting policies continued

e. Intra-Group-related party transactions;
f. Related party transactions.
g. IAS 7 Statement of cash flows
Going concern
The Group made a loss after tax of £26,020k (2016: loss of £18,640k). The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future and at least 12 months from the date of signing 
these financial statements and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Company and Group 
financial statements.
This confirmation is made having considered the financial position of the Group on the basis of the latest budgets and forecasts, the cash balance 
of £29.8 million at 31 December 2017 and the availability of future financing, including the £20 million credit facility entered into in March 2018, 
committed until October 2019, to help accelerate the roll-out of new markets.  As new markets are opened the Directors will explore alternative 
financing options from a number of potential sources.  The Directors have considered downside risks to the Group’s plans, together with options 
available to reduce the rate of cash burn in the short to medium term, and assessed the potential impact these would have on the Group’s 
liquidity. In evaluating these risks the Directors have considered the Group’s history of operating losses and the cash outflows that are expected to 
continue as the Group undertakes the expansion of the Time Out Market business.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The accounting standards and policies adopted in these financial statements are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 as presented under IFRS. No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the 
financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017 have had a material impact on the Group or Company. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Time Out Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 
December each year.
As permitted by S408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the parent Company is not presented as part of these financial 
statements. The parent Company’s loss for the financial year was £862k (2016: £1,568k loss). The parent Company is primarily a holding 
company and had minimal cash flows during the year. It did not hold any cash or cash equivalents at the beginning or end of the year.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
In the Group financial statements the acquisition method is adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or 
disposed of in the period are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control is passed. The consideration transferred for 
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and presented as exceptional items.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof 4
53
www.timeout.com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting policies continued 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39; either in profit or loss or as 
a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement 
is accounted for within equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated on consolidation. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
Non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions 
with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the 
carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in 
equity.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity and consist of the amount 
of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Associates
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%–50% of the equity voting rights, in respect 
of the financial and operating policy. The Group accounts for its interests in associates using the equity method. Under the equity method, the 
investment in the associate is initially measured at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of associates since the acquisition date. 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the entity. The statement of comprehensive income includes 
the Group’s share of any other comprehensive income recognised by the associate. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the 
payment is established.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the 
case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value 
and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified 
as the group of key management personnel, as identified in the strategic report, that makes strategic decisions.
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is sterling. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency which is a 
foreign currency are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period and the result of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated at the average exchange rate for the period. All transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the time of the transaction. All foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise. At the 
statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate. Upon 
the translation of any subsidiary’s results for the year and financial position at any given year end, the foreign exchange differences which may 
arise are recognised directly in other comprehensive income as currency translation differences.
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated 
residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code: TMO
2. Accounting policies continued 
Computer equipment – over three years on a straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings – over five years on a straight line basis
Leasehold improvements – over the lease term or useful life, whichever is shorter
The Group operates in jurisdictions which have set useful lives for certain types of assets, and where different, local guidelines override the Group 
policies mentioned above. However, the Group confirms that this treatment does not materially change the accounts.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Time Out Group plc’s interest in 
the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating unit (“CGU”) that is 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity 
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value 
less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured at either the proportion of the recognised 
net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest or at the fair value of the acquired company at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets 
Trademarks and copyrights
Trademark and copyright assets are amortised over a period of 15 years from the month of acquisition. 
Development costs
Development costs comprising costs incurred relating to websites and other digital platform elements are written off over a period of two, three 
or four years, depending on the relevant project. The cost of internally generated and acquired technology is recognised as an intangible asset 
providing it satisfies all of the conditions set out in the research and development policy below. Assets are subsequently measured and amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, from the month in which the expenditure is incurred.
Service concession arrangements
The concession granted by the Municipality of Lisbon to occupy and operate an area within the Mercado da Ribeira in Lisbon is accounted for as 
a service concession arrangement under IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’. The present value of all payments to the Municipality are 
capitalised and recognised as a separate intangible asset and a corresponding obligation is recognised. The intangible asset is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the concession arrangement.
Customer relationships and other intangible assets
These intangible assets are comprised of customer and advertiser relationships and internally generated software related to the US business, 
acquired in 2014, reacquired trade-name rights and customer relationships relating to the Portuguese businesses acquired in 2015 and 2016 
respectively, as well as the new assets which will be created relating to Australia and Spain.

The fair value of these assets was determined by agreement between the Directors and an independent valuation consultant, and was conducted 
in order to comply with IAS 3, ‘Business Combinations’. These assets are amortised over five years (internally generated software and customer 
relationships), 15 years (advertiser relationships), or two years (reacquired trade-name rights).
Research and development 
Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs 
incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 • Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
 • The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
 • The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and it will generate probable future economic benefits;
 • There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
 • The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all 
directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 
Directly attributable costs include employee (other than Director) costs incurred along with third party costs.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial assets that are not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at 
the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (CGUs). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are 
reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Government grants
Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that the 
group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the 
costs that they are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as 
deferred government grants, and they are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
Financial assets
Classifications
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for 
sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its 
financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. 
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current 
assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise of ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

2. Accounting policies continued 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the 
reporting period.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income 
statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise. Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-
sale are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Group 
has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold, or impaired, the 
accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
Impairment of financial assets
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) 
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable 
data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that 
correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If 
a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective 
interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair 
value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement.
Assets classified as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired.

2. Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities. 
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including preference shares) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those financial 
instruments are classified as financial liabilities. Where the contractual terms of preference shares do not have any terms meeting the definition of 
a financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. 
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment. The Company assesses these investments for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the investment, 
the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
profit and loss account.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Inventories 
are comprised of raw materials and goods held for resale. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection 
is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are 
presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment.
Cash and bank balances
Cash and bank balances comprises cash and cash equivalents, being cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three 
months or less, and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits which represent cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that 
restrict the use of these monies by the Group and, as such, does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Line of credit
Certain of the Group’s accounts receivable balances are assigned, with recourse, to financial institutions. In return, the Group receives a 
cash advance of 80%–85% of eligible accounts receivable. Both financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with regards to this 
arrangement. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity, only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares of options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts 
payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If 
not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

2. Accounting policies continued
Borrowings
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all 
of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period to 
which it relates.
Preference shares that are mandatorily redeemable on a specific date are classified as liabilities. The dividends on these preference shares are 
recognised in the income statement as an interest expense.
Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as 
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where 
the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at 
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, 
except for any deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference for associates. Only where there is an agreement in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference is the deferred tax liability not recognised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities and there is no intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Tax grants related to research and development expenditure are recognised under IAS 12 against expenditure and are recognised when reasonably 
certain estimates can be made.

Employee benefit costs
The Group contributes to certain employees’ personal pension plans on a defined contribution basis. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan 
under which the Group and employee pay fixed contributions, on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis depending on the location, to a third 
party financial provider. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense in the income statement when due.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period 
as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the 
charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as an interest expense.
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which is stated net of sales tax, represents the amounts derived from the sale of goods and services which fall within the Group’s 
ordinary activities.
 • Advertising revenue is recognised at the time the advertisement is published.
 • Subscription and Premium Profiles revenue is recognised evenly over the length of each subscription.
 • Circulation revenue is recognised at the time of sale. Provision is made for returns of distributor returns.
 • Ticket revenues for Time Out events are recognised in the month of the event. Tickets for Time Out offers and commissions for sales of tickets 
to external events and experiences are recognised at the point of sale.
 • Licence/royalty revenue is recognised over the contract period in accordance with the substance of the underlying agreement. Where these 
revenues are uncertain, they are recognised only on receipt.
 • Market related revenue is predominantly turnover related rent from restaurants in the markets and is recognised as the turnover is earned by 
the sub-letting restaurants. These are treated as operating leases and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease.
Interest income and expenses
Interest income and expenses are recognised using the effective interest method. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

Leases
Operating leases
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group, the total rentals payable under the lease 
are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of any lease incentive is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis.
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and long-term payables.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is 
no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where, given their nature or size, it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. Exceptional items mainly relate to costs associated with a material restructuring 
(including termination payments and associated legal fees), costs relating to acquisitions, including legal and consultancy fees, costs arising from 
significant office moves and the revaluation of minority interests.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting 
period. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
The key assumptions and judgements concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described 
below. The Group based its assumptions, estimates and judgements on parameters available when the consolidated statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising 
beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
a) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment i.e. when the carrying value of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available 
data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for 
disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model, where appropriate. The cash flows are derived 
from the business plan for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future 
investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to 
the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation 
purposes. The estimation uncertainty exists here due to a number of estimation factors applied to any model used.
b) Capitalisation of development costs
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for capitalised development costs have been 
met under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Asset’. Before capitalisation commences on a specific project, a business plan is prepared and approved in order to 
ascertain that the project meets all criteria of the standard as well as to determine the asset’s useful life. Judgements and assumptions are made 
using all information known at the end of the reporting period.

c) Business combinations
When acquiring a business, the Group has to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price and 
the fair value of any contingent deferred consideration. Judgement is applied in determining what part of a business transaction relates to the 
acquisition of that business. Parts of a business transaction that do not relate to the acquisition (for example, employee costs) are accounted for 
in accordance with the relevant accounting standard.
d) Capitalisation of pre-opening expenditure
When investing in the expansion of new Time Out Market sites, the Group makes a judgement as to when the new site has passed feasibility and 
reached development stage. During feasibility, all costs associated with the new site are expensed. When a site reaches development stage, 
which is normally determined following the agreement of Heads of Terms for a new lease, applicable costs incurred are capitalised as an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Impairment reviews are performed on the pre-opening expenditure balances at least every six months.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2018 
and as such, have not been adopted in these financial statements but have been adopted by the Group from that date. None of these are expected 
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces 
the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
 • IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: 
amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income; and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the 
entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to 
be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income, not recycling. 
 • An expected credit losses model replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there are no changes 
to classification and measurement, except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities 
designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
 • IFRS 9 introduces changes to the requirements for hedge effectiveness. 
The Directors anticipate that the classification and measurement basis for its financial assets and liabilities will be largely unchanged by adoption 
of IFRS 9. The main impact of adopting IFRS 9 is likely to arise from the implementation of the expected loss model. The expected impact at  
1 January 2018 is to increase retained earnings by £52k. No material impact on results for future periods is expected.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ replaces IAS 18, ‘Revenue’, and IAS 11, ‘Construction contracts’, and related interpretations 
and deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a 
customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
Following a review of existing contractual arrangements, the directors anticipate there will be no material impact for the group’s revenue streams.
The following standard is not yet effective and has not been adopted by the Group: 
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ applies for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. It replaces the current leasing standard, IAS 17, and requires all 
leases to be treated in a consistent way to the current rules on finance leases, requiring all leases, with limited exceptions, to be disclosed in the 
statement of financial position. The most significant effect of the new requirements will be an increase in lease assets and financial liabilities. 
IFRS 16 changes the nature of expenses related to those leases, replacing the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for 
the lease asset (included within operating costs) and an interest expense on the lease liability included within finance costs).
The group is working towards the implementation of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019. Adoption of this new standard is likely to have an impact on the 
group and the Directors are yet to assess the impact. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

In accordance with IFRS 8, the Group’s operating segments are based on the figures reviewed by the Board, which represents the chief operating 
decision maker. The Group is organised into four operating segments, having added a segment to report the acquired Markets business:
 • Print – sale of print advertising and publications;
 • Digital – sale of digital advertising (including premium profiles) and e-commerce and sales of live events commissions generated by online 
bookings and transactions;
 • International – fees and royalties from third party licensees for the rights to publish print magazines and produce website content under the 
Time Out brand;
 • Markets – predominantly turnover related rent from restaurants in the market and charges for services.
No information is provided at the segment level concerning interest income, interest expense, depreciation or amortisation, income taxes, profit/
loss from associates or other material non-cash items. The Board of Directors do not review any measures of assets, liabilities or cash flows at a 
segment level.

consolidated entities as follows:
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Loss on ordinary activities before income tax (26,345) (18,843)
Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by the domestic tax rates applicable to the respective countries (5,166) (3,769)

Potential deferred tax assets of £15,441k (2016: £9,754k) relating to timing differences on fixed assets, short-term timing differences and losses 
carried forward have not been recognised as the Directors take an approach not to recognise any deferred tax asset until such time as there is 
greater visibility of profitability in the medium term. 
The Group has deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquired intangible assets as follows:

in more than twelve months.

10. Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares during the year.
For diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion for all dilutive potential shares. All 
potential ordinary shares including options and deferred shares are anti-dilutive as they would decrease the loss per share, and are therefore not 
considered, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share.

11. Business combinations
During 2017, the Group acquired Print & Digital Publishing Pty (“Time Out Australia”) and 80 Mes 4 Publicacions (“Time Out Spain”). The Group had 
a presence in both locations prior to acquisition, through international licencing agreements.  
As a result of these acquisitions, the Group continues its global expansion program, allowing further growth and monetisation opportunities across 
e-commerce, advertising and Premium Profiles.
Time Out Australia
On 2 June 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued ordinary share capital of Print & Digital Publishing Pty Limited for the issue of 1,656,930 
Ordinary Shares valued at £2,212k based on a share price of £1.335. Pre-acquisition international licensing revenues of £38k have been 
recognised as revenue directly in the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows:
£’000
Property, plant and equipment 8
Customer relationships 593
Trade and other receivables 201
Cash and cash equivalents 37
Deferred tax liability (178)
Trade and other payables (485)
Net assets acquired 176
Goodwill 2,036
Consideration paid 2,212
Revenue of £1,734k and operating profit of £79k since the acquisition date have been included in the consolidated income statement. If the 
business combination had occurred at the beginning of the year the revenue contribution to the Group for the year would have been £2,891k and 
the operating loss contribution to the Group for the year would have been £209k. 
The goodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce in the Australian business. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of £255k have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 
December 2017. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

in exchange for purchase consideration of cash of £905k and deferred consideration of £909k in the form of Time Out Group plc shares or cash, 
with payment on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. Pre-acquisition international licensing revenues of £53k have been recognised as

business combination had occurred at the beginning of the year the revenue contribution to the Group for the year would have been £2,546k and 
the operating loss contribution to the Group for the year would have been £20k. 
The goodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce in the Spanish business. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes.

The carrying value of the goodwill is analysed by business segment as follows:
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
2015
£’000
Digital 33,333 33,231 28,340

Market 8,138 7,819 –
50,057 49,230 35,525
There were no impairment losses relating to goodwill at the end of the year (2016: £nil).
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair 
value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Group’s CGUs 
consist of: Digital, Print and Market. This represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes. There is no goodwill in respect to the Group’s international segment.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. 
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
An exercise was undertaken to establish whether there was any impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2017, determined by comparison of the 
carrying value to the fair value of the CGUs less costs of disposal using a market approach and assumptions reflecting a market participant view. 
The valuation applies multiples of 5.0x to 2017 Digital revenues, including acquired businesses, 8.0x 2017 Market revenues and 1.0x to 2018 
forecast Print revenues including acquired businesses, which are based upon sensitised benchmarks for comparable businesses. The 2018 
revenues were taken from the latest forecasts approved by the Board. For the Digital CGU the key assumptions were the growth in advertising 
revenues, the number of transacting members and the average revenue per user. For the Market CGU the key assumptions were relating to new 
markets worldwide and the continuing growth of the Lisbon market. For the Print CGU the key assumption was the ability of the Group to maintain 
print advertising revenues during the transition to digital. Since the forecast future revenues are based on significant unobservable inputs, the fair 
value less costs of disposal of the goodwill is classified as a level 3 fair value. 
A full sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed as management believes that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the 
carrying value of the Digital or Market CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts. For the Print CGU, which has the lowest amount of headroom, 
if either revenues decline by 18% in the next 12 months or the multiple used decreased to .82x, it would most likely lead to an impairment of the 
goodwill of that segment.
The Company has no goodwill (2016: £nil). 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

23. Financial risk management and policies
Financial risk factors and management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management 
programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance.
Foreign currency
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk as it operates in overseas markets. The Group’s realised loss on foreign exchange for the year was 
£246k (2016: £250k gain). The Group does not hedge its foreign currency risk as the majority of the Group’s receivables, payables and borrowings 
are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entity. Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose (2016: £nil).
A sensitivity analysis was conducted at the end of the year ending 31 December 2017 in order to understand the exposure of the Group’s income 
statement to currency fluctuations. The analysis used the actual monthly average rates and appreciated/depreciated each of the rates by 10%. 
The main assumptions revolve around this 10% adjustment to the rates which was applied linearly across the months instead of for a specific time.
The effects of the analysis showed that if the euro and US dollar had appreciated by 10% during the year, reported revenue would be £47,270k 
and the adjusted EBITDA loss would be £15,071k. If, conversely, the euro and US dollar had depreciated by 10% during the year, reported revenue 
would be £41,987k and adjusted EBITDA loss would be £13,524k. 
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. In order to 
minimise this risk the Group endeavours to only deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy. The maximum exposure to credit risk is 
the value of the outstanding trade receivables. The management do not consider that there is any concentration of risk within trade receivables. 
The Group puts provisions in place for specific known bad debts. In addition, further provisions are made based on historical customer payment 
trends, current local market conditions and the normal average time taken to pay in each individual country. An analysis of the Group’s trade 
receivables and provision for bad debts is included in note 18. The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each 
of its financial assets.
As well as credit risk on accounts receivable balances with customers, credit risk arises on cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only reputable institutions with a strong, independently rated credit rating are used.
Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group finance. Group finance monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom 
to meet any repayment requirements. 
In June 2016, the Group raised gross proceeds of £90m from the IPO process. This funding was partially used to repay the existing shareholder 
debt at the time of listing. The remainder of the proceeds funded investment in the business. The maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings is set 
out in note 22.
The table below analyses the group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the 
balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are 
essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rates is low. Lines of credit are subject to increases in the Bank of England base rate and both the Time Out 
Market and Time Out Spain loans are subject to increases in EURIBOR, but all other debt is at a fixed rate. The Group has not completed a 
sensitivity analysis for this risk because the low debt levels would result in an immaterial impact to the accounts.
Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objective is to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. To meet this objective the Group reviews the budgets and forecasts on a regular basis to ensure 
there is sufficient capital to meet the needs of the Group. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity as set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. All working 
capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and borrowings.
24. Financial instruments
Fair values
The table below illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.
The Group’s financial liability for the option over the non-controlling interests of MC-Mercados da Capital, LDA is measured at fair value through 
profit or loss. The initial recognition, as part of the acquisition of Time Out Market Limited, was at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value 
are charged to the Income Statement.
All other liabilities, including loans and trade and other payables are held at amortised cost. After initial fair value recognition, these instruments 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of these liabilities approximates to the fair value.

The Group assesses at each year end reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. In the financial year 2017 
there was no objective evidence that would have necessitated the impairment of loans and receivables or available for sale assets except the 
provision for impairment of receivables (see note 18).
The Company had financial asset investments held at amortised cost of £100,346k (2016: £100,374k) relating to intercompany debtors and also 
had financial liabilities measured at amortised cost of £1,200k (2016: £1,026k) related to deferred consideration and accruals. 25887  11 April 2018 10:34 AM  Proof4

30. Related party transactions
Group
The Group is controlled by Oakley Capital Limited and Oakley Capital Private Equity, who together owned 57.6% of the Company’s shares as at 31 
December 2017. There is a summary of majority ownership interests in the Directors’ Report on page 31. 
Subsequent to the year end, the Company entered into a £20m term loan facility agreement with Oakley Capital Investments Limited (“OCI”). The 
facility is for a period of 19 months and has an interest rate of between 10 -15% depending on amounts drawn. The proceeds of the new facilities 
are intended to be used by the Group to fund future Time Out Market developments.
OCI is a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined by the AIM Rules and as such entering into the revolving credit facility constitutes 
a related party transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13. With the exception of Peter Dubens, who is a director of OCI, the Directors of the Group 
consider that, having consulted with Liberum, the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders are concerned.

£9,530k. 
Other relating to Time Out Market Limited
Time Out Digital Limited had a debtor balance with Time Out Market Limited at the year end of £5,251k of which £3,147k related to funding. In
