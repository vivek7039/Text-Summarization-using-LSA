Our Business
 “I joined Vesuvius in 
Brazil as part of 
Project Columbus”
Building on my degree in Chemical 
Engineering and several industry 
internships, I joined Vesuvius in Brazil 
in 2013, as part of Project Columbus, 
the Group’s international graduate 
programme. I always wanted to work 
overseas since ﬁ rst starting college, 
and was excited to start my nine-
month international assignment.
After initial training at home in Brazil, 
I moved to India where over the 
course of my nine month secondment, 
I developed three projects, focusing 
on resin production and machine 
maintenance at Foseco in Pune, 
and on VISO production in Vesuvius 
Calcutta . This enabled me to apply 
my interest and expertise in process 
management and optimisation. 
It also gave me the opportunity to 
immerse myself in a culturally very 
different operation.
Having enjoyed the challenge of 
working abroad, I then moved to 
Germany as a Production Manager 
Assistant at the newly acquired 
mould powder plant in Mülheim. 
Whilst there, I worked on the 
optimisation of spraying processes, 
improved packaging standards and 
implemented other safety standards 
– all whilst learning to speak German. 
More recently, I was pleased to 
accept the additional responsibility 
of  working as the Quality Coordinator 
at Mülheim, which allows me to 
work with Vesuvius’ many different 
departments and learn how the 
company works as a whole.  
I have achieved a lot in my ﬁ rst ﬁ ve 
years at Vesuvius, developing technical 
skills, growing in experience and 
expanding my language capabilities 
and geographical horizons.

The Foundry Process
The foundry process is highly 
sequential and consistency 
of quality and productivity is 
essential. The conditioning of 
molten metal, the nature of 
the mould, and the way metal 
ﬂ ows in the mould affects both 
the quality of the ﬁ nished 
casting and the effort, energy 
and metal usage.

Our Markets
Steel 
Customers of the Steel Division 
are principally steel producers 
and manufacturers of steel 
production equipment. 
Steel production volumes 
are the critical driver of 
demand as the Steel 
Division primarily sells products 
that are consumed during 
the steel making process. 
This is particularly true in the 
production of higher-quality 
steels where our highly 
technical products deliver 
the most value. 
The Advanced Refractories 
business also supplies 
other high-temperature 
industries such as primary 
aluminium, copper, cement, 
petrochemical and energy 
from waste. Around 7% of 
revenues in the Steel Division 
arise from non-steel related 
process industries.
Steel production
Steel quality as a driver for demand
According to the World Steel 
Association (‘WSA’), the 
worldwide steel industry saw 
growth of 5.3% in 201 7 with 
1,691.2 million tonnes (‘mt’) 
produced globally. 
For many years, China has 
been the world’s largest 
producer of steel.  In 201 7 , 
the WSA reported that 
China’s crude steel production 
increased by 5.7% to 832mt 
and accounted for 49% of 
the world’s steel production. 
Production in Japan was 
mostly ﬂ at at 105mt in 201 7 , 
whilst India’s steel production 
increased by 6.2% to 101mt, 
and South Korea’s increased 
by 3.7% to 71mt.
Steel manufacturers are 
increasingly searching for 
products that can support the 
production of higher grades of 
steel. The ‘ﬂ at’ steel used in 
‘later cycle’ consumer goods, 
e.g. cars and fridges, requires 
signiﬁ cantly higher uniformity 
than the ‘long’ steel used in 
‘early cycle’ construction 
and infrastructure. In the 
developed market of NAFT A, 
the production ratio is 
currently 65:35% (ﬂ at:long). 
As developing countries move 
from infrastructure-based 
economies to consumer -based 
economies, the ratio of ﬂ at 
to long steel consumption 
also transitions. According to 
the Chinese Iron and Steel 
Association, this trend has 
been seen in China over the 
past few years and is expected 
to continue. The quality 
demands are even higher 
for production of speciality 
and high-strength steels.
Our highly technical, innovative 
refractory products are 
designed to preserve the 
quality of molten steel during 
the steel making process. 
Vesuvius’ engineered 
refractories prevent the build-
up of impurities in the steel, 
protect the molten metal from 
oxidisation, moderate its ﬂ ow, 
and manage its ﬂ uid dynamics 
to harmonise consistency and 
reduce the pick-up of inclusions. 
T o do this our products need to 
be highly resistant to erosion, 
corrosion and thermal shock 
to ensure that they do not 
themselves contaminate 
the steel during casting. 
The capabilities of Vesuvius’ 
products – particularly when 
used as a total solution - are 
much more in demand for 
higher quality steel grades 
where the consistency of the 
ﬁ nished steel is paramount.

Our Business
Foundry 
The vehicle sector, comprising 
light vehicles (passenger cars 
and light trucks) and heavy 
trucks, is the largest end 
market for worldwide castings. 
Other end markets for foundry 
castings include machinery for 
the agricultural, construction 
and mining industries, 
petrochemicals, power 
generation equipment, railroad 
and general engineering 
sectors. Our customers include 
the world’s major automotive 
OEMs, truck producers and 
equipment manufacturers. 
Foundry Division end markets Casting quality as a driver for demand
Whilst Foseco products 
typically represent less than 5% 
of a foundry’s production cost, 
they contribute signiﬁ cantly 
to improving product 
quality and manufacturing 
efﬁ ciency, whilst reducing 
the environmental impact 
of the casting process 
and improving the ratio of 
ﬁ nished castings to the 
amount of metal poured – 
a key parameter for foundry 
efﬁ ciency. As castings become 
increasingly complicated 
(driven in the case of 
automotive casting by the need 
for lightness), they demand 
cleaner metal, better ﬂ ow into 
the mould, and more consistent 
solidiﬁ cation. This supports 
the computer modelling, 
ﬂ ow simulation and casting 
methoding capabilities that 
are central to the services 
provided by Foseco. 
Demand drivers for castings
Light vehicle demand is largely 
driven by consumer conﬁ dence 
and, in commercial purchasing, 
the age of the overall ﬂ eet. 
Demand in the majority of 
the remaining casting 
end-markets is driven by the 
cost of capital and the level 
of current proﬁ tability in the 
given sector. Certain sectors 
are consumption-driven, such 
as construction, mining, 
agriculture and heavy truck, 
where usage drives demand 
for replacement parts 
(e.g. bulldozer blades, digger 
teeth, track pads and bowls, 
etc.) based on actual wear. 
 T echnology changes and 
environmental drivers
New technologies, such as 
3D printing, are expected 
to continue to inﬂ uence 
the metal casting industry, 
allowing for faster prototyping 
and  production of smaller 
volume parts. Environmental 
regulations, driven by the 
desire to reduce volatile 
organic compound emissions 
and the use of silica within the 
industry, are also expected to 
continue to tighten. This will 
drive the trend to ﬁ nd 
processes and consumable 
products which support 
production efﬁ ciency and 
reduce a foundry’s impact 
on the environment.
Steel casting Aluminium/
Non-ferrous casting
Iron casting
Iron casting is split between 
grey and ductile iron with 
grey iron representing the 
majority of metal being cast. 
This is a cost-efﬁ cient and 
robust process to produce 
components that do not need 
to tolerate extreme mechanical 
stress. All iron casting requires 
ﬁ lters and coatings but grey 
iron is not as reliant on feeding 
system utilisation due to 
its lower shrinkage on 
solidiﬁ cation. Conversely, 
ductile iron production requires 
more sophisticated products to 
cope with the high shrinkages 
of metal whilst solidifying.
Steel is used in casting for 
manufacturing components 
with very high mechanical 
performance. Steel casting is 
the most demanding casting 
process due to higher melting 
temperatures and greater 
tendency for shrinkage, 
thus the greater demand 
for products and technical 
expertise in this segment.
Aluminium casting is the 
segment of the foundry 
market growing the fastest. 
It has captured a signiﬁ cant 
share of the light vehicle 
market. Being molten below 
700°C aluminium can be 
cast in iron moulds which 
can then be reused. Foseco 
concentrates on supplying 
ﬂ uxes, ﬁ lters and machines 
that reﬁ ne the composition 
and cleanliness of the metal.  Vesuvius plc

V esuvius has articulated ﬁ ve key execution priorities. These will enable 
us to achieve our core strategic objectives of delivering long-term 
sustainable and proﬁ table growth.
Vesuvius was built and grew on technology breakthroughs. 
These enabled the steel continuous casting and foundry 
industries to improve their efﬁ ciency and quality substantially. 
Focusing on technology leadership continues to drive our unique 
value proposition and underpins our ability to deliver ongoing 
value enhancement to our customers. 
The percentage of revenue accounted for by ‘New Products’, that is 
products launched within the last ﬁ ve years, grew from 8% in 2014 
to nearly 15% in 2017 . Our objective is for this to reach 20%. The new 
R&D centre for Advanced Refractories at Visakhapatnam, India, 
was inaugurated in November 2017 . Our spend on R&D increased 
year-on-year to £33.2m, being 2.0% of our total revenue, and we 
increased the efﬁ ciency of our R&D by focusing our efforts on a 
reduced number of potentially high-impact R&D  projects. We also 
moved the R&D function closer to our customers, embedding R&D 
within the business units which will ensure a closer link between R&D 
activities and the return we receive on our investment.
Our Business
Progress in 2017 Description
Our technology has been widely adopted by the most sophisticated 
producers in the most developed markets. However , marked 
differences remain in the penetration of our solutions within the 
industry . Consequently , there is a wider audience of customers whom 
we believe can beneﬁ t from them. As steel and foundry markets in 
developing markets become more quality focused, we have the 
opportunity to signiﬁ cantly increase our penetration of these 
markets  through offering value creating solutions.
Our outperformance in the majority of end markets across both 
our Steel and Foundry Divisions is evidence of the penetration 
gains we are achieving due to increased customer interest in our 
value-creating solutions. For our Steel Division, this outperformance 
is reﬂ ected in our underlying 2017 revenue growth of 14. 1% versus 
5.3% growth in global steel production volumes. For our Foundry 
Division, underlying 2017 revenue growth of 9.3% is further 
evidence of this outperformance.
Building on our long-standing presence in all markets, we can 
leverage the high growth enjoyed by our customers’ industries 
in emerging markets which are large consumers of steel goods 
and foundry castings.
Our growth in developing markets is especially encouraging 
and we delivered outperformance relative to end markets, due to 
greater interest in our high value-added solutions. Our 201 7 
revenue growth rates for our key developing markets were as 
follows: China +9 .2%; India +6.2%; South America + 1 7 .5%; Mexico 
+ 7 . 1%; EMEA excl. EU28 +37 .0%. The acceleration of our revenue 
growth in China is also especially notable and we are beneﬁ ting 
from several favourable market trends which are driving a shift 
towards our higher quality consumables and services.
In 201 5, we initiated a restructuring programme throughout the 
Group to adapt our business and our cost base to the changing 
trading environment. This is core to our efforts to improve profitability . 
Furthermore, we have embedded the principles of Lean manufacturing 
across all our sites, continuously focusing on quality and productivity 
to enable us to maintain our margins. Our global presence allows us 
to beneﬁ t from economies of scale and deliver excellent service from 
local sites.
We continued to make good progress with our previously announced 
restructuring programme, mainly focused on the Flow Control 
business, delivering savings of £16.2m in 201 7 , which was ahead of 
expectations. As a result, the total savings delivered since launching 
the programme in 2015 are now £43.2m. This programme is now 
expected to deliver £60m of savings at a total cost of £75m. We also 
commenced a completely new restructuring programme targeting 
the Foundry Division in Europe and NAFT A, the Advanced  
Refractories business unit in Europe, and Group corporate functions, 
from which we expect £15m of recurring savings by 2020.
Our customers’ processes require increasing levels of engineering 
services to reach the demanding levels of safety , accuracy and 
consistency required by their end-customers’ quality specifications. 
The key elements of V esuvius’ T echnical Services strategy are, firstly , 
the Digital Services business unit, which is focused on incubating our 
data capture technologies, and secondly , the business units which 
play a critical role in integrating these products into our broader 
consumables offering as well as ensuring customer access. In this 
way , our T echnical Services strategy is progressively penetrating all 
activities of both our Steel and Foundry Divisions. 
We saw good progress of our global T echnical Services offering, 
which is now embedded in the operations of all our business units. 
Global T echnical Services turnover across all business units 
reached £88m in 201 7 , growing by 14% year -on-year . In late 201 7 , 
we made a strategic investment in Sapotech Oy, a Finnish technology 
company offering optical measurement services for the continuous 
casting process. The Sapotech business will be managed by our 
Flow Control business unit.  12

Chairman’s Statement
 “W e have outperformed 
the market and delivered 
a strong set of results”
John McDonough CBE Chairman
Overview 
2017 was a year of good progress for 
the Group as we saw improvements 
in our trading environment following 
the challenging market conditions 
experienced in 2015 and 2016. We also 
completed a successful transition of 
Chief Executive, with the appointment 
of Patrick André to the role as part of 
a planned succession process. Global 
steel production growth exceeded our 
expectations and pleasingly our overall 
sales growth outperformed the global 
steel market. We also experienced 
positive momentum in the majority of 
foundry end markets. Overall, despite 
experiencing headwinds relating to 
signiﬁ cant raw material price increases 
and some temporary increased 
inter-company sourcing costs, the Group 
saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading 
proﬁ t (16. 1% on an underlying basis), 
and a 20.2% increase in reported 
revenue (12.5% on an underlying basis), 
with cash generation strengthening 
further. The Group continued to make 
good progress with the restructuring 
programme and we remained focused 
on the delivery of our strategy and its 
execution priorities. Finally, in December, 
we strengthened our balance sheet, 
repaying existing borrowing with the 
issuance of debt in the US Private 
Placement market. 
New Chief Executive 
The appointment of our new Chief 
Executive, Patrick André, was a key event 
for Vesuvius this year. It was the result of 
a rigorous process, during which both 
internal and external candidates were 
considered. We are delighted that the 
best ﬁ t for the role came from within 
our own ranks. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Patrick’s predecessor , 
François Wanecq, for his many years of 
dedicated service to the business and his 
diligence in ensuring a smooth transition. 
We look forward to the years ahead 
under Patrick’s executive leadership. 
Market Dynamics and Strategy
During the year, we saw global steel 
production increase by 5.3% with 
production in the majority of major steel 
countries up year-on-year. In our Foundry 
Division the overall trading environment 
and demand for our products was 
positive across the majority of our key 
end markets.
Throughout the year we faced notable 
inﬂ ationary pressures from signiﬁ cant 
price increases in several key raw 
materials. These initially impacted our 
Advanced Refractories business, but 
subsequently price rises were also 
experienced in the Steel Flow Control 
and Foundry businesses. We responded 
proactively to the pressure placed on 
our business making good progress in 
recovering cost inﬂ ation through higher 
selling prices by year-end.

Review on p18- 19
 See more about our Markets on p8-9
 See our Financial Review on p26-31 
 See more about our Governance in the 
Governance Section on p74- 121 17
Against this backdrop, we continued to 
focus on the execution of our strategy 
and made good progress on our ﬁ ve 
key execution priorities (see page 10). 
We remain conﬁ dent that these will 
enable us to create value and deliver 
sustainable proﬁ tability for our 
shareholders. We continue to recognise 
the fundamental importance to the 
Group of the capabilities of our people. 
Our highly talented leadership teams and 
operational staff ensure that we are able 
to drive our strategy forward, with quality 
underpinning not only the premium 
promise of our products, services and 
solutions, but also our overall approach 
to business excellence.
Performance and Dividend 
In 2017 , reported sales were £1,683.9m, 
an increase from 2016 of 20.2%. 
Our margins improved to 9.8%, delivering 
reported trading proﬁ t of £165.5m. 
Whilst we experienced some headwinds 
throughout the second half, over the year 
we outperformed our markets in terms of 
growth. These results serve to emphasise 
the strength of our management team 
and their ability to operate effectively 
against the backdrop of a volatile 
market. Vesuvius remains an intrinsically 
cash-generative business and we saw 
strong cash generation throughout 2017 , 
ending the year with a stronger balance 
sheet than in previous years.
The Group continued to make good 
progress in delivering the previously 
announced restructuring programme 
which focused mainly on our Flow 
Control  business. We also commenced 
a completely new programme focusing 
on the Foundry Division in Europe and 
NAFT A, the Advanced Refractories 
business unit in Europe, and Group 
corporate functions.   
Our Headline PBT was £152.9m, 27 .6% 
higher than last year on a reported basis. 
Including amortisation of £19.5m and 
restructuring costs of £36.3m, our PBT 
of £97 . 1m was 22.3% higher than 2016. 
Statutory EPS is 14. 1p.
Our dividend policy aims to deliver 
long-term dividend growth, provided 
this is supported by cash ﬂ ow and 
underlying earnings, and is justiﬁ ed in 
the context of our capital expenditure 
requirements and the prevailing market 
outlook. With this in mind, the Board 
has recommended a ﬁ nal dividend of 
12.5 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: 1 1.4 pence), 
which would result in a total dividend 
for the year of 18.0 pence per share 
(2016: 16.55 pence), an increase of 
8.8%. If approved at the Annual General 
Meeting, this ﬁ nal dividend will be paid 
on 25 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 13 April 2018.
Board and Governance
In April 2017 , we appointed Holly 
Koeppel as a Non-executive Director, 
replacing Nelda Connors, who resigned 
from the Board in late 2016. Holly has 
more than 35 years’ industry and 
ﬁ nancial experience, and has worked 
with businesses in Australia, China, the 
UK and the US. We are delighted to 
have her signiﬁ cant experience around 
the Board table.
The Board continues to place great 
importance on furthering our 
understanding of the Vesuvius business 
by visiting key operations and engaging 
with as many of our people as possible. 
This year, the full Board visited our 
Foundry operations and customers in 
Brazil, meeting management from all 
business lines and gaining a broader 
understanding of the overall South 
American business. As Chairman, 
I personally visited our operations in 
China in May and, during the year, 
other Non-executive Directors visited 
operations in Skawina in Poland, 
Cleveland and Pittsburgh in the US, 
and Borken in Germany. The Board will 
continue to visit sites across the Group, 
increasing individual knowledge and 
ensuring that we remain connected 
with our operations, management 
teams and people around the world.
The 2017 externally facilitated Board 
evaluation conﬁ rmed that the Board 
continues to function effectively. 
We believe it remains well balanced, 
setting the right tone from the top, with 
a strong mix of relevant experience 
and skills, ensuring that a collaborative 
yet challenging culture is embedded 
throughout the Group.
Our People
In 2016, I noted that to secure the 
current and future performance of 
the Group, the Board had widened its 
focus on succession planning issues, 
additionally reviewing the management 
level immediately below the Board. 
This continues to be a critical area 
for Board attention, with the Board 
fully recognising the importance of 
developing talent and maintaining 
a cadre of diverse and highly capable 
people throughout the business. 
The need for greater diversity 
throughout the business is a goal upon 
which the Board remains focused.
As ever, I continue to be impressed by 
the way in which our leadership teams 
and our people go the ‘extra mile’ to 
exceed our own, and our customers’ 
expectations, as evidenced by our 2017 
results. On behalf of the Board, I thank 
them all.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on 10 May 2018. The Notice 
of Meeting and explanatory notes 
containing details of the resolutions to 
be put to the meeting accompany this 
Annual Report and Accounts and are 
available on our website (www.vesuvius.
com). I and all my Board colleagues plan 
to attend the Annual General Meeting 
and we look forward to the opportunity 
to meet with as many shareholders as 
possible on the day.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Chief Executive’s Strategic Review
Introduction 
It is an honour to have been selected to 
lead Vesuvius and I am grateful to our 
Chairman, John McDonough, and the 
Board of Directors for their trust.
I would also like to thank François 
Wanecq for his exceptional commitment 
in leading Vesuvius over the past 1 2 years. 
Thanks to his achievements and the 
efforts of all our teams, the foundations 
of the Group are strong and sound. 
Our main objective is now to build on 
these foundations and to generate 
and accelerate the Group’s profitable 
growth over the coming years.
The strong performance of the Group 
in 2017 is an important first step in the 
implementation of this growth strategy.
Strong Performance
In a globally favourable economic 
environment, both our Steel and Foundry 
Divisions succeeded in outperforming 
the general market growth. This was 
particularly the case in China.
Thanks to this performance, Vesuvius’ 
global sales in 2017 reached £1,683.9m, 
an increase of 20.2% over 2016 on a 
reported basis. At constant currency, 
and adjusted for the effect of acquisitions, 
underlying revenue was up 12.5% as 
compared with 2016. 
Our trading profit in 2017 reached 
£165.5m, an increase of 24.2% over 2016 
on a reported basis and 16. 1% on an 
underlying basis. Our return on sales 
improved from 9.5% to 9.8%. After the 
inclusion of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and restructuring costs, 
operating profit was £109.7m, 18. 1% 
ahead of prior year on a reported basis.
Our financial performance would, 
however, have been even stronger in 
2017 if we had not been impacted by 
two temporary headwinds.
Some of the key raw materials used 
by our Steel and Foundry Divisions 
experienced significant price increases in 
2017 , particularly during the second half 
of the year. The speed of these increases 
was such that it was not possible to fully 
recover the increased costs through the 
sales price of our finished products, as we 
were bound by contractual obligations 
with some customers. This situation 
improved towards the end of 2017 due 
to prices stabilising for several key raw 
materials and major progress being 
made in recovering cost inflation through 
higher selling prices. Whilst the price of 
magnesite, the largest contributor to 
raw material price inflation in 2017 , 
has now stabilised, the price of other 
raw materials such as bauxite, silicon 
carbide and zirconia are still on an 
upward trend. As a result, the process 
of price adjustment will continue into 
2018, until realised cost increases have 
been fully recovered. 
Additionally, the very strong growth 
of our Flow Control sales in EMEA 
temporarily exceeded the capacity of 
our manufacturing plants in the region, 
requiring the import of products from our 
facilities in Asia and NAFT A, incurring 
additional freight, export duty and 
overtime costs. Measures were 
immediately taken to increase the 
capacity of the Flow Control EMEA 
plants and this ramp-up is now  
complete, substituting imports from 
non-EMEA plants.
Improved Financial Position
Despite the strong growth in our turnover 
and increased capital investment of 
£44.3m in 2017 versus £35.2m in 2016, 
our cash conversion ratio increased to 
104% in 2017 due to our focus on efficient 
working capital management. Our trade 
working capital to sales ratio decreased 
to 24.9% from 26.6% in 2016. 
This strong cash flow generation 
reduced our net debt to £274.3m at 
31 December 2017 versus £320.3m 
at 31 December 2016. We also partly 
refinanced our debt in December 2017 
with the issuance of a €100m US Private 
Placement, resulting in a significant 
decrease of our financing costs 
going forward.
Strategic Progress
Our strategy remains centred around 
five key execution priorities, designed 
to ensure the achievement of our core 
strategic objectives of delivering long-term, 
sustainable and profitable growth.
Each of these execution priorities saw 
significant progress in 2017:
>  Reinforce our technology leadership: 
With a global R&D spend of £33.2m in 
2017 (2016:£28.6m), representing 
2.0% of revenue, Vesuvius continues to 
lead the industry with a significantly 
larger R&D spend to sales ratio than 
most of our competitors. In 2017 , 
 “Our main objective is to 
accelerate the implementation 
of our profitable growth  
strategy over the coming years”
Patrick André Chief Executive 19
we continued to focus our R&D efforts 
on a reduced number of potentially 
high-impact R&D programmes. 
The new Advanced Refractory R&D 
centre in Visakhapatnam, India, was 
inaugurated in November, reinforcing 
our presence in this key market for our 
future growth, strengthening links with 
customers and enabling us to better 
tap into the growing talent pool of 
engineers and scientists in the country. 
The decision was also made to 
reorganise the Flow Control R&D 
network around three main R&D 
centres; in the US (Pittsburgh), Europe 
(Ghlin/Feignies) and China (Suzhou), 
operating under a common leadership. 
This structure will be fully operational 
in 2020 and will enable us to increase 
the efficiency of our research further, 
by reinforcing our proximity with 
customers and accessing a wider  
pool of worldwide scientific talents.
>  Increase penetration of our value-
creating solutions: The growth of sales 
in our Steel and Foundry Divisions 
outperformed underlying market 
growth in most areas, confirming the 
mounting interest of customers in our 
advanced solutions, enabling them to 
improve their manufacturing efficiency 
whilst at the same time raising the 
quality of their finished products. 
We were particularly pleased with  
our progress in China, where Steel 
Division sales increased by 7% and 
Foundry Division sales increased by 
13% on an underlying basis.
>  Capture growth in developing 
markets: Steel Division sales grew 
faster than the market in the key 
developing regions of China, India 
and the Middle East. However, sales 
growth in Latin America, while positive, 
was slightly below general steel 
market growth. Foundry sales also 
outperformed markets in most 
developing countries, with the 
exception of India where priority was 
given to the management of working 
capital and customer credit risk.
>  Improve cost leadership and margins: 
Our previously announced Lean and 
self-help programme to improve the 
cost competitiveness and efficiency of 
our manufacturing network continued 
to develop in 2017 , extending from 
Flow Control Europe to Flow Control 
NAFT A operations. £16.2m of savings 
were delivered in 2017 , bringing the 
total savings delivered since launching 
the programme to £43.2m. This 
programme is expected to deliver 
£60m of savings at a total cost of 
£75m. A completely new restructuring 
programme focused on the Foundry 
Division in Europe and NAFT A, the 
Advanced Refractories business unit in 
Europe and global corporate functions 
was launched at the end of 2017 , with 
expected recurring savings of £15m by 
2020. In parallel to these restructuring 
programmes, Vesuvius is reinforcing  
its focus on operational excellence  
and continuous improvement in its 
manufacturing operations. 
>  Develop our T echnical Services 
offering: Our T echnical Services 
offering has continued to develop 
in 2017 , not only within our Digital 
Services business unit but also within 
Flow Control, Foundry and Advanced 
Refractories. Late in 2017 , we made a 
strategic investment in Sapotech Oy, 
a Finnish technology company 
developing optical defect detection 
services in the steel continuous casting 
process. This investment will reinforce 
the Flow Control business unit. 
Attracting, Developing and 
Retaining T alent
The success of our strategy ultimately 
relies on the quality and motivation of 
our people. In 2017 , we continued our 
efforts to attract, develop and retain the 
best talents worldwide. This will intensify 
in 2018.
We believe in diversity of talents and 
origins and in the importance of an 
entrepreneurial and decentralised 
culture, with empowered, accountable, 
innovative and results-oriented 
managers, operating close to our 
markets and our customers.
I will strongly support the reinforcement 
of this culture within the Group going 
forward.
Stable Safety Performance 
in 2017
With a lost time injury frequency rate of 
1.63 per million hours in 2017 , our safety 
performance improved slightly over 
2016 (1.72). 
The Group’s injury severity rate improved 
more markedly in 2017 with a severity 
rate of 62.8 days lost per million hours 
worked versus 74.6 days lost per million 
hours worked in 2016, highlighting the 
success of the Group’s efforts to address 
the most dangerous situations in our 
manufacturing plants. 
Our objective is to improve this 
performance further year-on-year.
A new safety management organisation, 
updating responsibility and accountability 
for the management of safety across  
the Group, was established at the end  
of 2017 and will be fully operational in  
the first half of 2018.
Sustainability 
Vesuvius R&D reinforced its efforts in 
2017 to develop products and services 
helping our Steel and Foundry customers 
to reduce their energy consumption and 
carbon footprint through the improved 
service life of our products and reduction 
of waste in their manufacturing processes. 
At the same time, we continued our 
efforts to reduce waste and energy 
consumption in our own manufacturing 
processes.
Outlook 
Our main Steel and Foundry markets 
remain positively oriented at the 
beginning of 2018. However, we expect 
a lower growth rate of steel production 
outside China in 2018 compared to 2017 , 
as the significant decrease in Chinese 
steel exports which occurred in 2017 may 
not repeat in 2018. Our self-help and 
manufacturing optimisation programme 
will continue to develop and expand in 
2018. The temporary raw material and 
product supply headwinds that impacted 
our 2017 results have now been mostly 
mitigated and will substantially unwind 
during the year, subject to any further 
raw material cost increases. We remain 
confident in our ability to further improve 
working capital management and 
generate strong operating cash flow. 
For these reasons, the Board is confident 
that in comparison to 2017 , further strong 
progress will be made in 2018.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Risk
The Board continually monitors the internal and 
external risks which could signiﬁ cantly impact 
the long-term performance of the Group
Risk Management in 201 7
The Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s risk appetite and ensuring that 
appropriate risk management systems 
are in place. The Group undertakes a 
continuous process of risk identiﬁ cation 
and review, which includes both a 
top-down and bottom-up process, 
independently gathering views on risk 
from each business unit, and from 
operational, functional and senior 
executive management, and the Board 
of Directors. Building on the process 
conducted in 2016, where a clean sheet 
review of the Group’s principal risks was 
undertaken, the Group’s assessment of 
principal risks has been reviewed and 
considered against a further group 
of emerging risks and uncertainties 
identiﬁ ed through our 2017 Board 
process.
Changes to Risk in 201 7
The Board believes that there has been 
no material change to the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties during 
the year. However, the Board reﬂ ected 
on the implications of certain emerging 
‘macro’ trends during the year. These 
included the increase in automation 
in manufacturing as a competitive 
disruption and the potential for negative 
implications for the business from the 
Brexit process, the outcome of which 
remains unclear, but which is not 
expected to be material in the context of 
the Group. The Board also discussed the 
risks that could arise from a failure by 
the Group to foster the correct culture 
for success. In addition to these wider 
trends, the Board focused on identiﬁ ed 
risks where issues had arisen during the 
year – the interruption of supply of quality 
raw materials, the related challenges of 
instigating price increases as input costs 
go up, the more protectionist approach 
being implemented in some major 
markets, and the potential for ﬁ nancial 
instability and worldwide recession. 
Finally, the Board continued its oversight 
of cyber issues as an emerging risk. The 
Board’s view on each of these issues was 
integrated into management discussions 
on risk and factored into the approach 
the Group takes to successful mitigation. 
Risk Mitigation
The risks identiﬁ ed are actively managed 
in order to mitigate exposure. Senior 
management ‘owners’ are identiﬁ ed 
for each principal risk to manage the 
mitigations of that speciﬁ c risk and 
contribute to the analysis of its likelihood 
and materiality. This is reported to the 
Board. The risks are analysed in the 
context of our business structure which 
gives protection against a number of 
principal risks we face with diversiﬁ ed 
currencies, a widespread customer base, 
local production matching the diversity of

our markets and intensive training of

to mitigate risk through contractual 
measures. Where cost-effective, the risk 
is transferred to insurers. 
Board Monitoring
The Board defines the Group ’s risk 
appetite, considering the nature and 
extent of the principal risks that the 
Group should take. The Board’s 
oversight of principal risks also involves 
a Board review of the processes by 
which the Group manages those risks, 
establishing a clear understanding at 
Board level of the individuals and groups 
in the business formally responsible for 
the management of speciﬁ c risks.
 See more in Governance on pages74- 121
Principal Risks
The risks identiﬁ ed on pages 24 and 25 
are those the Board considers to be the 
most relevant to the Group in relation to 
their potential impact on the achievement 
of its strategic objectives. All of the risks 
set out on pages 2 4 and 25 could materially 
affect the Group, its businesses, future 
operations and ﬁ nancial condition and 
could cause actual results to differ 
materially from expected or historical 
results. These risks are not the only ones 
that the Group will face. Some risks are 
not yet known and some currently not 
deemed to be material could become so.
Viability Statement
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have 
assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three year period to 31 December 2020, 
taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the 
principal risks and uncertainties.
The Directors have determined that a 
three year period is an appropriate 
period over which to provide the Viability 
Statement because this is the period that 
the strategic business plan focuses on 
and is sufﬁ ciently funded by ﬁ nancing 
facilities with average maturity terms of  
approximately six years. 
In making this statement, the Directors 
have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks that may threaten the 
business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity of the Group. 
This is embodied in the annual review 
of a three year bottom-up business 
plan process which includes a review 
of sensitivity to ‘business as usual’ risks, 
such as proﬁ t growth and working capital 
variances, severe but plausible events 
and the impact on the central debt and 
headroom proﬁ le analysis. The results 
take account of the availability and likely 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions 
that could be taken to avoid or reduce 
the impact or occurrence of the 
underlying risks.   
Whilst the review has considered all the 
principal risks identiﬁ ed by the Group, 
the following were selected for enhanced 
stress testing: an unplanned drop in 
customer demand, debt recovery risk 
due to customer default, raw material 
price inﬂ ation, reduction in earnings 
from increased interest charges and the 
impact of volatility in foreign currency 
earnings. The Group’s prudent balance 
sheet management, ﬂ exible cost base to 
react quickly to end market conditions, 
access to long-term capital at acceptable 
ﬁ nancing costs and well diversiﬁ ed 
international businesses in different 
currency earning proﬁ les leaves it well 
placed to manage these principal risks.  
In performing the stress testing, certain 
assumptions were made including that: 
customer failures result in write-offs of 
the full value of the receivables with no 
lost revenue replacement; and partial 
cash ﬂ ow mitigation is possible from 
working capital releases, restricted 
capital expenditure and operating cost 
reductions. Under the enhanced stress 
testing described above, a potential 
breach of a covenant would only occur 
in the event of an unforeseen reduction 
in revenue greater than 35%. 
Accordingly, the Directors conﬁ rm that 
they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three year period 
to 31 December 2020. 24

Introduction
We have made good progress towards 
our previously stated aim to enable the 
business to improve shareholder returns 
and sustain growth, whilst optimising 
operating costs and maintaining an 
appropriate level of control and 
compliance. The key components of our 
strategy to achieve this were successfully 
launched in 2017 , including structural and 
people changes to the Finance team, the 
building of a European shared service 
centre and improved performance 
reporting and measurement. Whilst there 
remains a lot still to do before all of our 
improvement plans are implemented, 
the pleasing progress to date is thanks 
to the dedication and professionalism of 
our ﬁ nance personnel across the Group. 
201 7 Performance Overview 
In contrast to 2016, end-markets were 
stronger during 2017 and our revenue 
beneﬁ ted from the improved demand for 
our products in both Steel and Foundry 
as a result, as well as business gains in 
many of our key markets, principally 
EMEA and NAFT A. Reported revenue 
increased by £282.5m over the prior year 
and by £186.4m on an underlying basis. 
The restructuring programme continued 
to deliver ahead of plan during 2017 with 
a total of £16.2m of incremental beneﬁ ts 
reported. The increased revenue and 
restructuring beneﬁ ts drove the higher 
reported trading proﬁ t of £165.5m, which 
was 24.2% higher than prior year. Return 
on sales for 2017 on a reported basis at 
9.8% was higher than the prior year by 
30bps despite a number of higher costs 
in the period. The higher costs related 
to price increases on several key raw 
materials, as well as temporary costs 
associated with importing product into 
Europe from other facilities in the Group 
to satisfy the higher demand. In a 
year of strong sales growth, our cash 
management performance was strong, 
achieving a 104% cash conversion, 
due largely to better working capital 
management. As a result, we have 
decreased our net debt position and 
improved our leverage ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA to 1.3x from 1.8x at 
December 2016.

Dividend 
The Board has recommended a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 12.50 pence per share to be 
paid on 25 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register at 13 April 2018. When 
added to the 2017 interim dividend 
of 5.50 pence per share paid on 
22 September 2017 , this represents 
a full-year dividend of 18.0 pence 
per share.
It remains the Board’s intention to deliver 
long-term dividend growth, provided this 
is supported by underlying earnings, cash 
ﬂ ows, capital expenditure requirements 
and the prevailing market outlook.
Key Performance Indicators 
We have identiﬁ ed a number of KPIs 
against which we  have consistently 
reported since demerger. Details of the 
KPIs are provided on pages 20 and 21. As 
with prior years, we measure our results 
on an underlying basis, where we adjust 
to ensure appropriate comparability 
between periods, irrespective of 
currency ﬂ uctuations and any 
business acquisitions and disposals.
This is done by:
> Restating the previous period’s results 
at the same foreign exchange (FX) 
rates used in the current period
> Removing the results of disposed 
businesses in both the current and 
prior years
> Removing the results of businesses 
acquired in both the current year 
and prior years
Therefore, for 2017 , we have:
> Retranslated 2016 results at the 
FX rates used in calculating the 
2017 results
> Removed the results of our mould 
and tundish ﬂ ux business in Brazil, 
Mastercodi, which was acquired 
in 2016
Objective: Deliver growth over 
the long term
KPI: Underlying revenue growth
Reported revenue for 201 6 was £1 ,401 .4m, 
which after FX translation effects and 
removing the impact of acquired 
businesses, equates to £1,492.0m on an 
underlying basis. The reported revenue 
in 2017 of £1,683.9m, when adjusted for 
acquisitions made, is £1,678.4m on an 
underlying basis, which is an increase 
of 12.5% year-on-year. The growth has 
been as a result of stronger end-market 
demand and business gains during the 
period, particularly in EMEA and NAFT A.
KPI: R&D spend
We believe that our market-leading 
product technology and services deliver 
fundamental value to our customers and 
that the primary mechanism to deliver 
that value is to invest signiﬁ cantly in 
research and development. In 2017 , 
we spent £33.2m (2016: £28.6m) on 
R&D activities, which represents 2.0% 
of our revenue (2016: 2.0%).
Objective: Deliver attractive 
proﬁ tability
KPI: T rading proﬁ t and return on sales
We continue to measure underlying 
trading proﬁ t of the Group as well as 
trading proﬁ t as a percentage of sales, 
which we refer to as our return on sales 
or RoS.
T rading proﬁ t of £165.5m increased by 
16. 1% on an underlying basis versus last 
year whilst RoS on a constant currency 
basis was 9.8%, a 30bps improvement 
over 2016. The improved trading proﬁ t is 
due in part to the higher revenue, along 
with the ongoing delivery of beneﬁ ts 
from the restructuring programme.
The Steel Division recorded RoS of 
8.7% this year, an increase from 8.4% 
in 2016, despite the additional costs 
incurred in importing non-European 
based product into EMEA as well as the 
substantial increases in raw material 
costs experienced in Advanced 
Refractories. Foundry reported a 12.2% 
RoS, another improvement over the 
prior year (2016: 1 1.8%) with production 
efﬁ ciency gains and operating expense 
reductions offsetting raw material cost 
increases that started to impact results 
in the second half.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
KPI: Headline PBT and headline EPS
Headline proﬁ t before tax (PBT) and 
headline earnings per share (EPS) 
are used to measure the underlying 
ﬁ nancial performance of the Group. 
The main difference between trading 
proﬁ t and PBT is net ﬁ nance costs.
Net ﬁ nance costs in 2017 of £13.9m 
were £0.6m below 2016. The reduction 
in ﬁ nance costs was largely due to 
lower net debt levels that triggered a 
more favourable interest cost on the 
Company’s revolving credit facility. 
During the year this facility was 
successfully extended for a further 
two years to 2022 and $1 10m of the US 
Private Placement programme (‘USPP’)
was redeemed and replaced by a 
Euro-denominated USPP of the same 
value but on more favourable terms. 
Our headline PBT was £152.9m, 27 .6% 
higher than last year on a reported basis. 
Including amortisation (£19.5m) and the  
restructuring charges (£36.3m), our PBT 
of £97 . 1m was 22.3% higher than 2016. 
Headline EPS at  40.7 p is 33.9% higher 
than 2016.
Objective: Ensure capital is 
deployed efﬁ ciently
KPI: Free cash ﬂ ow and working capital
Fundamental to ensuring that we 
have adequate capital to execute our 
corporate strategy is converting our 
proﬁ ts into cash, partly through strict 
management of our working capital. 
Free cash ﬂ ow from continuing 
operations was £93. 1m for the year, 
which is all the more pleasing against 
a backdrop of revenue growth that 
inevitably requires some cash investment 
in working capital. Free cash ﬂ ow from 
continuing operations in 2017 was 
£31.7m higher than last year on a 
reported basis because of the better 
working capital performance partially 
offset by higher cash restructuring costs. 
Our cash conversion in 2017 improved 
to 104% (2016: 94%).
We measure working capital both in 
terms of actual cash ﬂ ow movements, 
and as a percentage of sales revenue. 
T rade working capital as a percentage of 
sales in 2017 was 24.9% (2016: 26.6%), 
measured on a 12-month moving 
average basis. In absolute terms on a 
constant currency basis, trade working 
capital increased by £12.2m, well 
below the increase in sales and with 
an improved inventory and creditor 
position leading to an improvement 
as a percentage of sales.
KPI: Return on net assets (RONA)
RONA is our principal measure of capital 
efﬁ ciency. We do not exclude the results 
of businesses acquired and disposed 
from this calculation, as capital efﬁ ciency 
is an important consideration in our 
portfolio decisions. It is calculated by 
dividing trading proﬁ t plus our share of 
proﬁ ts from joint ventures by our average 
operating assets (property, plant and 
equipment, and trade working capital).
As with most of our KPIs, we measure 
this on a 12-month moving average 
basis at constant currency to ensure 
that we focus on sustainable underlying 
improvements. Our RONA for 2017 
was 24.2% (2016: 21. 1%).

Objective: Maintain a strong 
ﬁ nancial position
KPI: Interest cover and net debt
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group 
had committed borrowing facilities of 
£563.4m (2016: £576.9m), of which 
£153.7m was undrawn (2016: £158.3m). 
The revolving credit facility term was 
extended to 2022 and $1 10m of the 
USPP was redeemed and replaced with a 
Euro-denominated USPP at better rates.
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was 
£274.3m, a £46.0m decrease from 2016, 
as a result of our good cash generation. 
The main drivers of the decrease were 
the impact of strong cash conversion 
partially offset by higher restructuring 
costs and tax payments. 
The Group’s debt facilities have two 
ﬁ nancial covenants: the ratios of net debt 
to EBITDA (maximum three times limit) 
and EBITDA to interest (minimum four 
times limit). These ratios are monitored 
regularly to ensure that the Group has 
sufﬁ cient ﬁ nancing available to run 
the business and fund future growth. 
At the end of 2017 , the net debt to 
EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, an improvement 
over last year (2016: 1.8x) and EBITDA 
to interest was 15.8x (2016: 13.4x).
Further information on our ﬁ nance 
costs can be found in Note 9 to the Group 
Financial Statements on page 143.
Financial Risk Factors
The Group undertakes regular risk 
reviews and, as a minimum, a full risk 
assessment process twice a year. As in 
previous years this included input from 
the Board in both the assessment of risk 
and the proposed mitigation. As referred 
to in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
and Viability Statement on pages 23,24 
and 25, we consider the main ﬁ nancial 
risks faced by the Group as being 
demand volatility and the impact of 
ﬁ nancial uncertainty, leading to reduced 
revenue and proﬁ t as well as potential 
customer default, and a lack of liquidity, 
brought on by market volatility. 
Important but lesser risk exists in interest 
rate movements and cost inﬂ ation but 
neither is expected to have a material 
impact on the business after considering 
the controls we have in place. 
Our key mitigation of demand volatility 
is to manage the Group’s exposure 
through balancing our portfolio of 
business geographically and by end-
market and to invest in product 
innovation. We do so through targeted 
capital investment in new and growing 
businesses and a combination of capital 
and human resource in emerging 
markets. The second main ﬁ nancial 
risk of a lack of liquidity is mitigated by 
ﬁ nancing using both the bank and 
private placement markets. The Group 
also seeks to avoid a concentration of 
debt maturities in any one period to 
spread its reﬁ nancing risk. The Group’s 
undrawn committed bank facilities at 
31 December 2017 were £153.7m. 
Counterparty risk and customer 
default are mitigated by our relatively 
widespread customer base – with no 
customer being greater than 10% of 
revenue – and credit control procedures.

Other Relevant Financial 
Information
Restructuring
We continued to make good progress in 
implementing our previously announced 
restructuring programme, mainly in Flow 
Control, with £16.2m savings delivered in 
2017 , which was ahead of expectations. 
The total savings delivered since 
launching the programme are now 
£43.2m. In 2017 , we reported £36.3m 
of restructuring costs (2016: £28.5m) 
that were predominantly made up of 
redundancy and plant closure costs, 
along with related consulting fees. These 
costs included the ﬁ nal costs related to 
the previously announced restructuring 
plan as well as £4.8m of costs related to 
a completely new restructuring plan 
launched at the end of 2017 , targeting 
the Foundry Division in Europe and 
NAFT A, the Advanced Refractories 
Business Unit in Europe, and Group 
corporate functions. The cash costs 
in 2017 were £27 .3m (2016: £16.8m). 
We are carrying a restructuring 
provision forward into 2018 of £22.9m.
Taxation
A key measure of tax performance is 
the effective tax rate, which the Group 
calculates on the income tax associated 
with headline performance, divided by 
the headline proﬁ t before tax and before 
the Group’s share of post-tax proﬁ t of 
joint ventures (2017: £151.6m, 2016: 
£1 18.8m). The Group’s effective tax rate, 
based on the income tax costs associated 
with headline performance of £36.4m 
(2016: £31.4m), was 24.0% in 2017 
(2016: 26.4%). This was lower than 
expected due largely to better proﬁ t 
performance in countries where we had 
tax losses, the impact of the weakening 
of the peso on our Mexican tax position 
and the release of provisions due to 
favourable tax litigation outcomes.
The Group’s effective tax rate is sensitive 
to changes in the geographic mix of 
proﬁ ts and level of proﬁ ts, and reﬂ ects 
a combination of higher rates in certain 
jurisdictions such as India, Mexico, 
Germany and Belgium, nil effective rates 
in the UK and US due to the availability 
of unutilised tax losses, and rates that lie 
somewhere in between.
Other key factors impacting the 
sustainability of the Group’s effective 
tax rate are set out in Note 10.6 to the 
Group Financial Statements.
The income tax charge on separately 
reported items of £18.0m (2016: £5.0m 
credit) comprises £6.0m non-cash 
deferred tax movements relating to the 
amortisation of a deferred tax liability 
arising from the 2008 acquisition of 
Foseco plc (2016: £3.7m), £4.3m tax 
credits relating to restructuring charges 
(2016: £3.8m), and a net reduction in the 
deferred tax asset previously recognised 
in respect of US tax losses and certain 
other temporary differences of £28.3m 
(2016: £2. 1m) largely caused by US tax 
reform enacted in late December 2017 in 
the form of the US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(‘TCJA’). A combination of the reduction 
in the US  Federal tax rate from 35% to 
21%, the repatriation tolling charge 
and other provisions of TCJA caused a 
£25.7m reduction in our US deferred tax 
asset which, together with other normal 
movements and foreign exchange 
revaluation, reduced from £65.9m at the 
end of 2016 to £32.6m at the end of 2017 .  
However, this write-down did not impact 
our Headline earnings after tax, as the 
change in the asset was reﬂ ected through 
separately reported items. 
Based on our initial interpretation, the 
Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse T ax 
provisions introduced by the Act may 
increase the Group’s effective tax rate 
by approximately 0.7% in 2018 and 1.2% 
in 2019.
We expect the Group’s effective tax rate 
from 2018 onwards to be between 27% 
and 28%, including the expected adverse 
impact of US tax reform, reﬂ ecting the 
tax beneﬁ t of initiatives being taken.
The net income tax charge recognised 
directly in the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income of £3. 1m 
(2016: £0.7m) comprises a £2.4m charge 
(2016: £0.7m charge) in respect of 
deferred tax on pension obligations and  
£0.7m (2016: £nil) UK tax in respect of 
foreign exchange differences arising on 
hedged positions. 
Financial Review continued 31
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2017 of £44.3m 
(2016: £35.2m) comprised £34.0m in 
the Steel Division (2016: £23.7m) and 
£10.3m in the Foundry Division 
(2016: £1 1.5m). Capital expenditure 
on revenue-generating customer 
installation assets, primarily in Steel, has 
been increased to £10.7m (2016: £6.5m). 
Pensions
The Group has a limited number of 
historical deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans mainly 
in the UK, US, Germany and Belgium. 
The main plans in the UK and US are 
largely closed to further beneﬁ t accruals 
and 56.5% of the liabilities in the UK have 
already been insured. The total net deﬁ cit 
attributed to these deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligations at the end of December 2017 
was £16.5m (2016: £29.4m), representing 
an improvement of £12.9m. The key 
movements giving rise to this were 
increases of £1.8m to the deﬁ cit arising 
out of changes to actuarial assumptions 
(attributable to increasing discount 
rates; updated mortality assumptions 
and pension membership data) and 
additional accrual and administrative 
expenditure paid for the year (£6.8m); 
offset by reductions to the deﬁ cit of 
£10.2m from asset returns and cash 
contributions of £1 1.6m.
The majority of the ongoing pension 
plans are deﬁ ned contribution plans, 
where our only obligation is to make 
contributions, with no further 
commitments on the level of post-
retirement beneﬁ ts. During 2017 , cash 
contributions of £12.6m (2016: £10.8m) 
were made into the deﬁ ned contribution 
plans and charged to trading proﬁ t.
Corporate Activity
Late in 2017 , we made a strategic 
investment in Sapotech Oy, a Finnish 
technology company with which we will 
be jointly developing predictive analytical 
service offerings to Steel customers. 
Acquisition opportunities remain part of 
our growth strategy and are evaluated 
on an ongoing basis.

Innovation
 “W e engage the creativity of 
our people across the entire 
organisation to drive innovation”
Alan Charnock Vice President and Chief Technology Ofﬁ cer
Vesuvius’ R&D organisation has been 
a major factor in maintaining our 
technology leadership position. We are 
now three years into our initiative to 
engage the creativity of people across 
the whole organisation, and to drive 
innovation across the entire Group. 
Like all our other major Group initiatives 
– safety, quality and excellence – 
embedding a culture of innovation 
requires focus on leadership, structure, 
process, tools, training and incentivisation. 
The structures are in place with the 
necessary process and tools, which 
are constantly being streamlined 
and improved.
Digital T ransformation 
Digital T ransformation is a key theme 
for companies targeting signiﬁ cant 
growth, strategic regeneration or 
market disruption with breakthrough 
technologies. For Vesuvius, this has 
been manifested by our Digital Services 
business unit. This also engages each 
of the Group’s other business units 
in adopting a business model 
complementary to and independent of 
their existing consumables business. 
Vesuvius is extremely well positioned to 
harness the digital transformation trend 
by creating this new market offering built 
on the reputation of over 100 years as 
a leader of innovation giving technical 
support to the Steel and Foundry 
industries. Our customers already 
recognise our expertise in developing 
engineering solutions using our 
understanding of our own technology 
platforms and our customers’ processes. 
This is borne out of our long-term daily 
presence at customer plants, working 
in partnership with them to improve 
the performance of our products, 
and providing the continuous 
process improvement that our 
customers demand to maintain 
their own competitiveness. 
Ideation 
Understanding our customers’ processes 
and the application of our products, 
knowing what to look for and then 
understanding what we see, are the 
ﬁ rst essential ingredients of the creative 
process of ideation. Ideation links 
experience and knowledge with the 
situation in front of you, generating 
new ways to make improvements. 
Occasionally this can lead to 
breakthrough ideas giving a step change 
in performance or a disruptive new 
technology platform. It is this presence 
at, and interaction with, the customer 
that is at the heart of the Vesuvius 
business model. It is also illustrated in our 
T echnical Services strategy: developing 
sensors, software tools and techniques to

Our Performance
Katarzyna Szafraniec, Quality Engineer , Poland
 “ As a Quality Engineer I continue to draw 
on my R&D experience.”
Having studied Chemical 
T echnology at university, 
I joined Vesuvius in 201 1, 
beginning as a R&D Assistant 
at the Vesuvius site in Skawina, 
Poland working on refractory 
material. In this role, 
I collaborated with engineers 
across numerous projects, 
conducting physical and 
chemical analysis. Using X-ray 
diffraction, Thermogravimetric 
Analysers and Scanning 
Electron Microscopy, I was 
able to gain a thorough 
understanding of Vesuvius’ 
products and their structure. 
T wo years later, I was promoted 
to the position of R&D Engineer 
at Skawina where part of my 
role was to conduct on-site 
product analysis for customers, 
solving production issues for 
them. I was also responsible 
for the development of 
new products such as the 
industrialisation of our 
spinel-forming self-ﬂ ow 
castable. During this time, 
I also participated in 
Vesuvius’ in-house technical 
‘Hea T t’ training. 
In 2016, I was selected to join 
Skawina’s new Casting & 
Precast Department as a 
Quality Engineer, where I 
continue to draw on my R&D 
experience to monitor and 
further improve production 
processes. My career at 
Vesuvius has enabled me to 
develop my technical expertise, 
as well as understand 
production processes, 
develop training programmes 
and manage a team of 
motivated colleagues.

Innovation continued
constantly monitor customer processes 
and our products in use, interpreting the 
data obtained, reacting with process 
adjustments in real time and allowing for 
new process and product developments. 
This model can create new services, 
add value to our existing product 
offering and accelerate our traditional 
ideation process. 
Innovation is the creative process of 
converting ideas into value-creating 
technologies or creating value by doing 
things differently. But to be effective we 
need to identify and prioritise the right 
ideas, and have the courage to put the 
other ones aside.
Our new product introduction (‘NPI’) 
process has been in place for three years, 
enabling us to identify and focus on 
the ideas and projects which are most 
aligned with our strategic plans, injecting 
greater rigour into decision-making 
with a stage gate approach. T oday, we 
have no shortage of ideas, but actively 
work on a much smaller number of 
prioritised projects than we worked on 
four years ago. We operate a continuous 
portfolio review process to ensure 
that the R&D technology roadmaps 
emphasise both current needs and the 
essential longer-term programmes.
In 2017 , we launched an Ideation 
Platform where new ideas are reviewed 
and reﬁ ned, with viable and valuable 
ideas funnelled into the NPI pipeline. 
The Ideation Platform is presently 
targeted only at new products and 
manufacturing processes, but our 
intention is to broaden its scope to 
include ideas on all topics for all 
functions, each with their own 
review process. 
R&D Performance 
During 2017 , our new product sales 
growth rate (for products launched within 
the last 5 years) slowed slightly after an 
initial two years of very healthy growth. 
By the end of 2017 , we reached c. 15% 
from our starting position of 8% in 2014. 
We launched a total of 26 new products 
in 2017 , with more than 30 new products 
planned for 2018 launch. 
The R&D resource allocation to 
technology projects has steadily 
increased in all business units. The 
maturity of our NPI process means we 
can now monitor additional KPIs to 
provide a deeper level of analysis on 
our innovation performance so we can 
continue to improve and ensure that 
we achieve the targets we set ourselves. 
In 2018, we will introduce new input and 
output indicators for innovation to 
monitor our pipeline of breakthrough 
projects, how efﬁ ciently we move 
projects through the NPI process, and 
how effective we are at achieving 
our  forecasted project targets. We spend 
2.0% of revenue on R&D, a signiﬁ cantly 
larger proportion of sales than most of 
our competition and expect to deliver 
signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts from this investment.
New Product Development
Enabling T echnologies, our fundamental 
research group, continues to pursue a 
range of new technology platforms. 
The team monitors technology trends 
across a broad range of industries, 
both inside and outside our own 
markets. The team looks for previously 
unimagined or unconventional ways to 
use materials and processes, ﬁ ltering 
these concepts through our front-end 
innovation process and incubating them 
until they become new technology 
platforms. These can then be used by 
R&D departments across our business 
to foster new product or process 
development projects. Our NPI projects 
usually start from an identiﬁ ed customer 
need but this front-end innovation 
process starts with no speciﬁ c product 
or market in mind, meaning that the 
new technology platforms may have 
applications across multiple business 
units, and be integrated into many 
different products, multiplying the value 
of the technology. T echnology platforms 
that come from these unorthodox 
beginnings are more likely to lead to 
breakthrough and disruptive innovations. 
We have several such new technology 
platforms that are ready to move into 
the NPI process and therefore look 
forward to exciting prospects for these 
in the years ahead. 
Another important group in Vesuvius’ 
drive for innovation is the Solutions 
Group. This group’s activities have 
become a differentiator for Vesuvius in 
our Steel market and an essential driver 
for the development of our T echnical 
Services strategy. The team translates 
what we see in customer processes, either 
directly or through data analysis, into 
new solutions ranging from new designs 
for existing products, to new products 
and process control functionalities. 
More fundamentally, it looks at the entire 
customer process and all the products 
in use rather than just a single element, 
enabling the root cause of a problem 
to be identiﬁ ed, rather than tackling 
individual symptoms. 
The Solutions Group, combining its 
process application, modelling and 
metallurgical expertise, is in high 
demand from both the Vesuvius 
regional organisations and our 
customers because of the positive 
results it has demonstrated in solving 
complex problems.
IP portfolio
The protection of our IP is as important as 
its generation. In 2017 , we tested, and are 
now ready to roll out, an enhanced audit 
process to measure the security of our IP 
across the Group starting with R&D and 
manufacturing locations in 2018. Our IP 
portfolio was reviewed in 2015 and 2016, 
and we continued with a stable level of 
ﬁ lings in 2017 to maintain our portfolio 
at 156 families, 1,569 granted patents 
and 518 applications pending.  35
Training
During 2017 , we extended our 
training efforts to the broader Vesuvius 
community. T o date, our project 
management training programme has 
included over 300 people, giving each 
an understanding of the full innovation 
process – covering not only their role in 
the process, but also providing them 
with the skills to function more effectively 
in the cross-functional teams required 
to deliver new product introduction. 
The training provided interactions with 
their future collaborators, identifying 
the good practices and operating 
skills necessary to drive our NPI projects 
to greater successes. 
T raining will continue with a new 
programme called ‘Quality in the NPI 
process’, speciﬁ cally focusing on: 
> Project deﬁ nition: to ensure that 
projects going into the NPI process all 
have clear success criteria, converting 
the customer need/voice of the 
customer into SMART objectives
> Design Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) and design of 
experiments: to accelerate the R&D 
stage of the NPI process, reducing 
the risk that the solutions developed 
and tested in the laboratory do not 
perform as expected in the ﬁ eld, 
causing recycled developments and 
project delays
> Process FMEA: to ensure that our 
industrialisation process is effective 
and the product we ultimately 
manufacture consistently achieves 
the desired performance objectives 
as detailed in the project deﬁ nition 
Joining Up Innovation
Vesuvius consists of two divisions and 
four business units. Whilst this creates an 
opportunity to cross-fertilise products, 
services, processes and technologies, 
the divisional structure does not naturally 
facilitate the sharing of knowledge. 
In 2017 , we launched a T echnology 
Bridge Initiative, taking experts from the 
R&D department of each division, our 
fundamental research group and our 
central process development group. 
The ‘bridges’ are structured around 
various technology themes related to 
materials, processes and the new 
technology platforms with the goal of: 
> Promoting... new ideas and 
applications for technology
> Measuring... the evolution of 
technologies that are key to our 
industries
> Building... Technology Maps that 
will include internal and external 
information
> Constructing... a knowledge network
We launched the initiative with ten areas 
of focus and will gradually add new 
themes over time. All generated data 
is collated and stored in our R&D 
collaboration platform – T echConnect – 
making the sharing of information 
as simple as possible and avoiding 
duplication. The learning generated by 
these community practice groups will be 
converted into tutorial presentations to 
allow for dissemination throughout 
the technical community of Vesuvius. 
The ‘community of practice groups’ 
became the go to experts for these 
speciﬁ c topics ensuring that the resources 
with the most knowledge and experience 
in any ﬁ eld are referenced, making for 
more efﬁ cient progress of our projects.
Excellence 
Our innovation activities are supported 
by the Group Excellence programme, 
which allows for self-assessment against 
designated benchmarks. Within the 
R&D community, progress has already 
been made on the various Excellence 
roadmaps, not only in Innovation, but 
also with respect to other initiatives such 
as standardising the career ladder for 
R&D staff, developing standard job 
descriptions across all divisions, 
enhancing performance assessment, 
and supporting the career and personal 
development of our staff. Making steady 
progress along all the roads of the 
Excellence road map will ensure that the 
Innovation pillar of the Vesuvius strategy 
will continue to strengthen, maintaining a 
solid foundation on which we continue to 
build for the future.

Operating Review
Steel Flow Control
Vesuvius’ Flow Control business unit, 
supplies the global steel industry with 
consumable ceramic products used to 
contain and control the ﬂ ow of molten 
steel in the continuous casting process.
This process enables steel manufactured 
in a blast furnace or electric arc furnace 
to be cast without interruption, whilst 
protecting it from the atmosphere. 
Avoiding  atmospheric contact is crucial 
as it signiﬁ cantly reduces contamination 
and oxidation levels in the steel. 
The products Vesuvius supplies into the 
continuous casting process have a short 
service life (often a matter of a few hours) 
due to the signiﬁ cant wear caused by the 
extremely demanding environment in 
which they are used. These products 
must withstand extreme temperature 
changes, whilst resisting liquid steel 
and slag corrosion. In addition, the 
ceramic parts in contact with the liquid 
steel must not in any way contaminate it. 
The quality, reliability and consistency 
of the products and process control 
equipment are therefore critical 
to the quality of the ﬁ nished metal 
being produced and the productivity, 
proﬁ tability and safety of our customers’ 
processes.
Steel Flow Control products supplied by 
Vesuvius include:
> Viso™ isostatically pressed alumina 
graphite and VAPEX® extruded clay 
graphite products These include ladle 
shrouds, stopper rods, submerged 
entry nozzles and shrouds, which 
channel and control the ﬂ ow of molten 
steel from ladle to tundish and from 
tundish to mould 
> Slide-gate refractories These include 
nozzles, plates and speciality shapes 
used in furnace, ladle and tundish slide 
gate systems 
> T emperature measurement and 
RADAR™ These provide optical 
temperature measurement and slag 
detection
> Gaskets These create an airtight seal 
between refractory components to 
minimise the risk of air ingress and 
steel oxidisation
> Fluxes These are powders, spread 
on the surface of the molten steel 
which provide thermal and chemical 
insulation and remove inclusions

201 7 Performance 
Steel Flow Control sales growth has 
continued to outperform growth in the 
global steel market. In 2017 , we reported 
revenues of £605.9m, an increase of 
1 1.8% on an underlying basis compared 
with 2016. All regions outperformed 
underlying steel volume growth and 
EMEA was our fastest growing region. 
Steel production in EMEA increased 4.9% 
in 2017 , and Vesuvius outperformed the 
market with underlying revenue up 
17 .5% to £240. 1m, reﬂ ecting market 
share gains. 
During 2017 , we experienced very strong 
growth of our Flow Control sales in 
EMEA, which temporarily exceeded the 
capacity of our manufacturing plants 
in the region, requiring the import of 
products from our facilities in Asia 
and NAFT A, incurring additional 
freight, export duty and overtime costs. 
Measures were immediately taken to 
increase the capacity of the Flow Control 
EMEA plants and this ramp-up is now 
complete, substituting imports from 
non-EMEA plants.
In the Americas, Steel Flow Control’s 
underlying revenues increased 8.8% 
to £201.7m in 2017 , against a 5.9% 
increase in steel production volumes. 
Our outperformance relative to steel 
production was due to market share 
gains in North America. In the US in 
particular, our market share is 
continuing to recover from the low 
point of the second half of 2015 
when we were impacted by customer 
closures and volume losses due to 
market pricing pressure. 
Our Performance
 “Our teams worked together 
to provide a solution for the 
customer utilising the ﬁ rst 
worldwide application of new 
patented sealing technology”
Andrew Morrison and Linna Sun, heads of NAFT A 
and Asia VISO Development teams
The Challenge
A large integrated steel producer in 
NAFTA resolved to convert most of 
their production to Vesuvius’ Flex 
Cold Start™ T undish Shroud , which 
channels the ﬂ ow of steel into the 
ﬁ nal  mould for solidiﬁ cation. 
The cold-start technology eliminates 
the need for preheat, increasing the 
safety of the tube changing process, 
and reducing energy consumption. 
However, as cold start tubes require 
additional time to expand after 
production starts to form an airtight 
seal  at the joint of the tundish and the 
tube to prevent air contamination, a 
preheat would still have been required 
for some speciﬁ c automotive steel 
grades to improve sealing times.
Our Solution
Dale Bower, leading the local NAFTA 
sales team, challenged the VISO 
Global Development team to provide 
a solution.  Andrew Morrison and 
Linna Sun, the heads of the NAFTA 
and Asia VISO Development teams 
respectively, collaborated in the 
development of an innovation born 
in our R&D centre in Suzhou, China: 
the combination of an intumescent 
coating and an integral groove sealant 
which provides a quicker gas tight seal 
by expanding many multiples of its 
original thickness on commencement, 
and for the duration, of service.  
The Beneﬁ ts 
This combination of the coating and 
groove sealant allows the customer 
to reliably use the cold start piece for 
higher steel grades. The new patented 
technology creates a tight seal within 
one minute of service commencement, 
resulting in immediate reduction in 
steel re-oxidation, reduced steel 
ﬁ nishing, and overall improved 
steel quality.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Underlying revenue increased by 7 .8% 
in Asia-Paciﬁ c in 2017 to £164. 1m, 
compared to a 5.7% increase in steel 
production volume in the region. 
Revenues increased faster than the 
steel market in the key regional markets 
of China, India and South Korea.
The beneﬁ ts of the restructuring 
programme implemented during 2016 
and 2017 started to deliver a positive 
impact on the ﬁ nancial performance 
of the business unit.
Strategic Highlights from 
the Y ear
Following the success of the 
manufacturing rationalisation 
programme in EMEA, a similar initiative 
was launched for the NAFT A region, 
where through a combination of 
improving efﬁ ciency and adapting 
production volumes between plants, 
improvements in cost base have been 
made. We will continue to pursue this 
effort in 2018 in order to deliver 
further beneﬁ ts. 
We are now translating this methodology 
to new territories, through which 
we expect to drive further cost 
improvements. The additional projects 
identiﬁ ed include a focus on industrial 
efﬁ ciencies in Brazil and India. 
In addition to these wider initiatives, we 
targeted process improvements aimed 
at increasing the output in speciﬁ c 
areas, such as in our mix plant in China. 
Optimisation work performed here has 
allowed us to simplify our supply chain, 
make it more cost-efﬁ cient and create 
capacity to absorb growth.
Over the last few years, Vesuvius has 
invested in developing robotics solutions 
which improve the safety and consistency 
of our customers’ operations while 
supporting our sales. Our unique value 
proposition is the result of the integration 
of speciﬁ c refractory, system and robotic 
design - three core competencies inside 
Vesuvius. Several steel makers have been 
pioneers in adopting this technology, 
delivering process efﬁ ciency and 
removing personnel from the harsh 
environment around the caster. In 2017 , 
we saw an increase in demand for 
robotics solutions and received orders 
to convert steel plants in South Korea, 
South America and Europe. This 
positions Vesuvius well to support our 
customers in facing the future challenges 
of automation and a greater focus 
on quality. 
In 2017 , we also further developed our 
capabilities in data capture and 
continuous temperature measurement. 
Our investment in, and exclusive 
distribution agreement with Sapotech 
Oy, a Finnish technology company 
offering optical defect detection services 
and real-time data on steel surface 
quality, now places us well to address the 
requirements for data management at 
our customers. From the start of 2018, 
this business is being managed within 
the Steel Flow Control business unit. 
Our R&D efforts also delivered new 
products to support the growth in the 
ladle slide-gate business with the 
introduction of our next generation 
slide-gate mechanism, which is robot-
ready and uses optimised refractory 
plates creating value for our customers 
in terms of ergonomics, safety and 
reliability while reducing their operating 
cost. In addition, we launched our new 
Flex Cold Start™ T undish Shroud, which 
allows customers to operate their casters 
with more ﬂ exibility in terms of sequence 
length and daily operation as well as 
reducing their waste and cost. As shown 
in the case study on page 37 , we have 
also developed complementary 
technology to allow for the use of this 
product in higher grade steel production.
We continued to develop our service 
offering helping our customers to 
understand better their mould ﬂ ow 
pattern. This is a key element in the 
casting process, as it is the last step 
between liquid and solid steel. This audit 
service is carried out by our process 
experts using speciﬁ cally designed tools 
and software to measure ﬂ ow pattern 
through monitoring temperature, mould 
level and meniscus velocity. We can then 
compare this with the data generated 
from our Computational Fluid Dynamic 
simulation capabilities. Comparing the 
data allows us to recommend improved 
solutions to our customers. More details 
on the work of our Solutions Group are 
contained in the Innovation Section on 
pages 32 to 35.
Looking Ahead
It is our expectation that, despite the 
relatively high growth achieved in 2017 
and a broadly positive outlook for 2018, 
steel production in the mature economies 
of Europe and North America will not 
exhibit material growth in the medium/
long term, given that the nature of 
economic growth requires less steel than 
in the past. This is a key driver behind the 
efforts to adapt our manufacturing 
footprint and overhead structure in the 
mature markets.

China is the world’s largest producer of 
steel, accounting for approximately 50% 
of global production. The adjustment of 
the Chinese steel industry from producing 
‘long’ steel for infrastructure to producing 
‘ﬂ at’ steel, typically used for consumer 
products and automotives, is highly 
beneﬁ cial for Vesuvius. Flat steel typically 
uses three times as much Vesuvius 
products by value and as a result we 
believe the accessible market for Vesuvius’ 
Flow Control business in China could grow 
signiﬁ cantly in the long term.
Furthermore, China’s Government is 
focused on a comprehensive upgrade 
of Chinese manufacturing, making it 
innovation-driven, emphasising quality 
over quantity and achieving ‘green’ 
development though ‘Made in China 
2025’. This trend towards higher quality 
industrial manufacturing is beneﬁ cial to 
Vesuvius’ steel division. Our current strong 
position in this market will help us to 
beneﬁ t from these trends.
India is another key growth market and 
one where we enjoy high penetration 
rates. It was one of the fastest growing 
steel markets in 2017 and closely tied to 
the Government’s economic development 
plans is the target to increase steel 
capacity to 300 million tonnes per annum 
by 2030, versus a production level in 
2017 of c. 101 million tonnes. As a result, 
Vesuvius also considers that this market 
presents an opportunity for Vesuvius to 
grow sales by a factor of approximately 
three times in the long term.
We also remain optimistic about the 
outlook for future steel production growth 
in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, T urkey, 
the Middle East, Russia and Vietnam.

Joe Gu, Production Manager of Slide Gate Refractories and Purge 
Plugs, North Asia 
The Challenge
The Castrip® process is a recent 
technology developed to directly cast 
steel in a thin strip. This enables the 
production of steel coils with less 
energy consumption and a reduced 
production cost compared with the 
conventional process which requires 
hot rolling after casting to reduce 
slab thickness. 
For this technology, Vesuvius has 
developed speciﬁ c technology for 
core refractory materials and designs, 
as well as associated know-how on 
operational best practices from our 
experience at sites running this 
technology in NAFTA. Recently, 
Castrip® machines were installed 
at a Chinese steel producer, who 
required local refractory sourcing.
Our Solution 
A T ransfer of Technology team was 
formed inside Vesuvius before the 
ﬁ rst Castrip® machine commenced 
production in China. Joe Gu was 
appointed as the Chinese team leader 
for this project, which drew experts 
from the product lines of Advanced 
Refractories, VISO and Systems, the 
design and manufacturing teams, and 
the local sales team. He and his team 
identiﬁ ed a solid benchmark based 
on Vesuvius’ experience in NAFTA, 
visiting Vesuvius R&D sites and 
manufacturing plants, and also steel 
producers using the technology. 
Once sufﬁ cient information had been 
gathered, the Chinese teams were 
trained on how to support the new 
Chinese customers, covering refractory 
design and manufacturing, and on-site 
operational support. 
The Beneﬁ ts
With local production and support 
capabilities, we secured an important 
contract, offering the ﬁ rst Chinese user 
of the Castrip® process the shortest 
delivery time at the best price, while 
maintaining the original product 
quality developed in NAFTA. The 
Chinese and NAFTA teams continue 
to share the expertise gained on this 
process to allow for a continuous 
improvement of the refractory parts.

Advanced Refractories produces 
specialised refractory materials 
for lining steelmaking vessels such 
as blast furnaces, ladles and 
tundishes, which are subject to 
extreme temperatures, corrosion 
and abrasion. These materials are 
in the form of powder mixes, which 
are spray-applied or cast onto the 
vessel to be lined (‘monolithics’) and 
refractory shapes (e.g. bricks, pads 
and dams). Vesuvius is one of the 
world’s largest manufacturers of 
monolithic refractory linings. 
Advanced Refractories delivers 
installation technologies, products 
adapted to ﬁ t customers’ speciﬁ c 
processes and plants, and effective 
and efﬁ cient logistics services. 
These factors are combined with 
signiﬁ cant R&D, a deep knowledge 
of customers’ processes and project 
management capability to deliver 
market-leading solutions for 
our customers.
Customers of Advanced Refractories 
are principally steel producers and 
manufacturers of steel production 
equipment. Our products accompany 
the steel-making process from the 
early steps of the process all the way 
downstream to the ﬁ nishing end in the 
rolling mill. This array of heat-intensive 
production processes and physical 
transformation of the iron ore into 
semi-ﬁ nished products, accounts 
for two thirds of the revenue of the 
business unit. In addition, Vesuvius’ 
Advanced Refractories business services 
other high-temperature industries such 
as primary aluminium, copper, cement, 
petrochemicals and energy from waste. 
These refractory lining materials are 
supplied in the form of powder mixes, 
which are spray-applied or cast onto the 
vessels to be lined (‘monolithics’), or in 
pre-cast shapes and bricks. 
An integral part of our success depends 
upon the level of collaboration with our 
customers. Our experts’ presence at 
our customers’ facilities allows us a 
fundamental understanding of their 
needs. The level of trust our business 
model creates makes it more resilient to 
market cycles enabling us to generate 
growth by adding new products and 
services throughout the business cycle.

The service life of the products Advanced 
Refractories supplies into the steel 
making process can vary (some a matter 
of hours and others for a period of years) 
based upon the type of refractory 
and the level of wear caused by the 
demanding environment in which they 
are used.
Advanced Refractories’ key products are:
> Blast furnace casthouse applications 
These are special refractories used to 
line the blast furnace and a network of 
runners to transfer molten iron from 
torpedo ladles to the melt shop for 
further processing into steel
>  Blast furnace tap hole clay This is 
a refractory mass used to plug the 
tapping hole in a blast furnace. 
When molten iron is ready to be 
extracted from the blast furnace, 
a drilling machine perforates a hole 
through the solidiﬁ ed clay to start 
the tapping process
>  Steel ladle applications These are 
refractories (typically bricks) used to 
line a steel vessel which contains the 
molten metal and transports it from 
the furnace to a casting machine

development”
Andy T oner , Director of Marketing and T echnology for Iron and Steel , NAFT A
My career at Vesuvius began 
in 2008, when I joined as 
a Service T echnician, 
responsible for the 
preparation of tundishes at 
Gerdau’s steel manufacturing 
plant at Midlothian, T exas, in 
the United States. As a result 
of my work there, I was offered 
the opportunity to become the 
Application Specialist for 
Brick Products, based at our 
site at Pittsburgh, United 
States, but also working in 
steel manufacturing plants 
across America. I then moved 
on to work as an Application 
Specialist for Ladles, with 
a focus on ladle bottoms, 
working with customers in 
their steel mills to ensure 
that they were deriving the 
maximum beneﬁ t from 
our products. 
T wo years after that, I was 
promoted to Product 
Manager for the Ladle 
Program and in 2014, I moved 
to become the Marketing 
Manager for our Advanced 
Refractory business not only 
for ladles, but also for the 
basic oxygen furnaces and 
electric arc furnaces operated 
by our steel manufacturing 
customers. In 2016, I became 
Regional Manager for the 
East Region USA in Steel 
Applications and ﬁ nally in 
2017 , I was named Director of 
Marketing and T echnology for 
Iron and Steel, NAFT A. In this 
role, I am responsible for the 
expansion of our product 
portfolio and the technical 
product development to 
support this growth across 
the entire NAFT A region.  
At Vesuvius I have been

Integrated material 
supply , robotic

and laser scanning for 
Electric Arc Furnace 
maintenance
The Challenge
Vesuvius has a historically well- 
established business in Electric Arc 
Furnace maintenance, using entirely 
manual application techniques. 
An ongoing dialogue with the customer 
identiﬁ ed some key improvement 
opportunities. These improvements 
were centred around three main 
drivers: (1 ) the application of the 
material; (2)  the accurate assessment 
of the condition of the active lining 
in service; and (3) safety for the 
operation and application teams.
Our Solution 
Working with established partner 
companies and cross-functional 
expertise, the Vesuvius team 
developed an optimised design for 
a Robotic Application unit for the 
customer’s furnaces. These units 
were speciﬁ cally constructed to suit 
the individual plant conﬁ guration. 
Using the latest laser scanner devices 
from our subsidiary Process Metrix 
to identify the areas of the furnace 
lining that required repair, we 
achieved accurate, targeted and 
safe material placement.
The Beneﬁ ts
The ability to safely repair refractory 
lining in a hot and difﬁ cult environment 
was a key demand. The robot arm and 
laser scanner signiﬁ cantly improve the 
safe working conditions for the plant 
operations. The integration of the 
robot and laser equipment also 
enables more accurate gunning of 
refractory material in the areas where 
it is most required. This delivers better 
performance and improved material 
consumption rates for the customer.
> Steel tundish monolithics These are 
powder-mix refractories used to line 
the tundish, which receives molten steel 
from the ladle then acts as a reservoir 
to control the ﬂ ow of the liquid metal 
and feed the continuous casting 
machine at the required rate 
>  Aluminium applications These 
products are used for secondary 
aluminium production, and are mostly 
used in furnace lining
>  Cement applications Monolithic 
technology used in the pre-heater 
stage before materials are transferred 
into the rotary kiln during the 
continuous calcination process for 
cement making
201 7 Performance 
Advanced Refractories reported 
revenues of £499. 1m in 2017 , an increase 
of 25.2% compared to 2016. On an 
underlying basis, the year-on-year 
increase was 1 7 .4%. This outperformance 
relative to steel volume growth was 
supported by increased customer interest 
in our value-creating solutions and the 
successful launch of new products such 
as our Supergard™ T undish refractory 
line, which is a patented tundish lining 
product for improving steel quality. 
We also beneﬁ ted from customers 
seeking to diversify their supplier base 
in response to recent consolidation. 
We achieved attractive underlying 
revenue growth in each of our key regions 
in 2017 , with the Americas up 8.6%, 
EMEA up 28.4% and Asia-Paciﬁ c up 
9.4%. The particularly high growth level 
in EMEA was due to signiﬁ cant progress 
regaining market share in Europe despite 
competitive market conditions.
Some of the key raw materials used by 
Advanced Refractories experienced 
signiﬁ cant price increases in 2017 , 
particularly during the second half of 
the year. The speed of these increases 
was such that there was a time lag in 
recovering the increased costs through 
the sales price of our ﬁ nished products,  43
Our Performance
as we were bound by contractual 
obligations with some customers. 
We have made major progress in 
recovering this cost inﬂ ation through 
higher selling prices. This process of price 
adjustment will continue into 2018, until 
realised cost increases have been fully 
recovered. This conﬁ rms our ability to 
recover raw material cost inﬂ ation 
through price rises over time.
Strategic Highlights from 
the Y ear
The addition of new customers in Europe 
in the melting and reﬁ ning segment was 
a signiﬁ cant contributor to our growth 
in 2017 . This was also boosted by a 
positive volume growth in the steel 
industry in Europe.
An increased focus on value-added 
solutions in niche segments like steel 
ﬁ nishing also allowed us to achieve 
good momentum during the period.
We continuously review and seek to 
improve our manufacturing efﬁ ciency, 
with targeted capital investment 
delivering signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts in process 
ﬂ ow, inventory management and labour 
and energy efﬁ ciency. In Brazil, we 
rationalised our manufacturing footprint 
and maximised capacity utilisation by 
relocating our Brazilian manufacturing 
facilities to Rio de Janeiro from Sao Paulo 
in 2017 . 
We also commenced a cost efﬁ ciency 
study in Europe to review our 
manufacturing footprint as part of our 
wider focus on cost efﬁ ciency. We are 
initiating a similar exercise in 2018 at 
our facilities in the NAFT A region.
Our business model is underpinned by 
our focus on value-creating solutions and 
maintaining technological leadership 
from investment in R&D. We improved 
our R&D footprint in 2017 with the 
inauguration of our newest R&D facility 
in Visakhapatnam, India. The addition 
of this state-of-the- art facility will allow 
us to complement our existing technical 
capabilities and tackle speciﬁ c problems 
in the local market. Our investment in this 
new facility is proof of our commitment 
to staying at the forefront of new 
technology. Our existing R&D centres 
are well positioned to support our 
existing markets whilst this new facility 
is the next building block to support our 
future growth in developing markets. 
Looking Ahead
As 70% of Advanced Refractories’ 
revenue comes from the steel making 
industry, steel production is a key driver 
for the business. In mature economies, 
it is our expectation that these regions 
will not exhibit material growth in the 
medium/ long term, given that the nature 
of economic growth requires less steel 
than in the past. However, as growth 
in emerging markets moves forward 
and our business in mature markets 
continues to evolve, we are constantly 
developing our resource base to align 
with activity levels. 
In the developed markets of Europe and 
North America, we are experiencing 
a greater demand for higher quality 
refractories. In response to recent 
consolidation, we are also seeing 
increased interest in certain segments, 
such as bricks, as customers in these 
regions seek to diversify their supplier 
base as well as market evolution towards 
other technologies like monolithic 
refractories. We expect this to continue 
going forward.
Improving the proﬁ tability of Advanced 
Refractories is a key area of focus. 
Market share, whilst important, is not 
the main driver of our strategy as there 
is signiﬁ cant fragmentation both on a 
global and regional basis in our area of 
the refractory supply business. Achieving 
consolidation at the expense of margins 
will not meet our goals for value creation. 
In the developing markets of India, China 
and Brazil, our focus is to capture or 
exceed the growth rate of the industry.
Our long-standing presence and local 
manufacturing capabilities position us 
well to take advantage of future growth 
opportunities in India. Solidifying our 
presence with the installation of our 
newest R&D facility in India is a strong 
step forward. As the country continues 
demanding more technology with the 
evolution of the market, we are well 
positioned to maintain our leadership 
position in the segments we currently 
operate in, whilst at the same time, 
look at new avenues for growth.

with steel quality, reduce energy 
costs and optimise caster speed. 
Current solutions include Accuoptix ™, 
Accucone ™, and the Accumetrix® 
continuous temperature 
measurement systems 
> Mould level sensors and control 
systems These are critical to ensure 
the stable, controlled ﬂ ow of metal 
during the casting process and have 
a signiﬁ cant impact on slab quality.
In addition, mould audit services, 
using our unique XMA T™ device, in 
combination with computerised 
ﬂ ow modelling, provide our Steel 
customers with an ‘expert eye’ inside 
the mould, allowing them to gain an 
intimate understanding of liquid

On an underlying basis, revenues 
increased 8.9%. This reﬂ ected market 
share gains in North America and 
India, and the signiﬁ cant success we 
experienced in South America as a 
result of increased penetration of our 
sensors and probes business. 
In our Process Metrix lasers business, we 
had a record year of sales with shipments 
up over 50% versus 2016. Avemis, our 
mould level sensors and continuous 
temperature measurement products, 
also had a strong year with revenues 
up c.30%.
Strategic Highlights from 
the Y ear
In December 2017 , we ﬁ nalised a 
strategic investment in Sapotech Oy, a 
Finnish technology company developing 
optical defect detection services in the 
steel continuous casting process. This 
investment will be managed by the Flow 
Control business unit. 
We continued to integrate the Digital 
Services companies, ECIL Met T ec and 
Sidermes into the existing Group sales 
networks. This enabled the businesses to 
access the wider footprint of the Vesuvius 
customer base. As a result, we made 
signiﬁ cant product performance 
improvements in key lines such as probes 
for measuring hydrogen and oxygen. 
We also initiated restructuring actions 
to optimise our cost base and 
manufacturing footprint, and to 
reduce operating costs. 
We introduced a number of new features 
in laser technology in 2017 through 
completely revamped software and the 
T wo Colour Pyrometer, which combines 
dimensional measurements with our 
most accurate surface temperature 
measurements to date. 
Our focus on increasing sales in the 
continuous temperature measurement 
space began to drive sales volumes and 
proﬁ ts in this area and we expect this to 
continue in the years ahead.
Looking ahead
The development of a digital offering 
for our customers, complementary to 
our consumables offering, remains a 
fundamental priority of our Group 
strategy. T o ensure that we continue to 
maximise the opportunities to leverage 
our existing customer relationships to 
expand this area of business, the 
ongoing support of our Flow Control 
and Advanced Refractories business 
units is critical. Flow Control’s involvement 
is focused on developing value-added 
services around the tundish and the 
mould in the continuous casting part of 
the steel process. SERT , Avemis and the 
new investment in Sapotech Oy are key to 
these efforts. For Advanced Refractories, 
laser technology business Process Metrix 
has a key role to play in the development 
of its technical services offering.
Going forward we are optimising our 
manufacturing footprint for sensors and 
probes with the closure of a site in France 
and in Germany. T o reduce operating 
costs further, we have initiated an 
investment programme to automate 
the manufacturing process.
We will continue to review acquisition 
opportunities for additional technological 
solutions to complement our existing 
customer offerings, focused on data 
gathering and information analysis to 
provide customers with the information 
they need to deliver process improvements. 
The amount of data generated by 
sensors is growing exponentially, so allied 
with this approach, we intend to focus on 
solutions for converting this data into 
valuable decision support information, 
maximising the value our various sensor 
technologies bring to customers.

Foundry revenue £m
£535.2m 
Vesuvius’ Foundry Division, trading 
as Foseco, is a world leader in the 
supply of consumable products, 
solutions and associated services 
related to the foundry industry. The 
foundry process is highly sequential 
and is critically dependent on 
consistency of product quality 
and productivity optimisation. 
The Foundry Division’s products, 
solutions and use of advanced 
computer simulation techniques 
allow foundries to reduce defects 
and hence reduce labour intensive 
fettling and machining, minimise 
metal usage requirements, 
inﬂ uence the metal solidiﬁ cation 
process and automate moulding 
and casting, thus reducing cost, 
energy usage and mould size. 
The conditioning of molten metal, 
the nature of the mould used and, 
especially, the design of the way 
metal ﬂ ows into the mould are 
key parameters in a foundry, 
determining both the quality of 
the ﬁ nished castings and the 
labour, energy and metal usage 
efﬁ ciency of the foundry. 
Vesuvius’ products and 
associated services to foundries 
improve these parameters.
The Foundry Division supplies ceramic 
consumables, such as ﬁ lters and feeding 
systems, and chemical coatings and 
binders to foundries which use these 
products in the production of metal 
castings. Working alongside customers 
at their sites, our engineers provide 
on-site technical expertise in addition to 
simulation software to develop the best 
individualised solutions. Each of our 
products typically represents a small 
element of the overall cost of the foundry 
processes but contributes signiﬁ cantly to 
product quality and yield. 
We support our customer offering with 
the ‘Foseco University’, an online library 
of expertise in foundry practice which 
demonstrates our expertise and provides  
technical support to our engineers and 
customers across the globe. 
Key Products
Foseco’s key products are: 
> Binders These are used to prepare the 
sand moulds and cores, the quality of 
which improves the precision and 
surface ﬁ nish of the ﬁ nal casting 
> Coatings These are designed to 
protect both sand and permanent 
moulds from the effects of being ﬁ lled 
with liquid metal. This is especially 
important on cores, where liquid metal 
may cover up to three sides of the sand
17 535.2
16 459.4
15 424.4
> Filtration Our ﬁ ltration products 
remove impurities from the liquid metal 
before it enters the mould and reduce 
turbulence during pouring 
> Feeding Systems Our speciﬁ cally-
shaped insulating and exothermic 
feeding systems allow for the efﬁ cient 
supply of molten metal to key areas 
of complex or large castings, and 
prevent liquid shrinkage defects in the 
ﬁ nished casting, improving yields and 
productivity by reducing the amount 
of molten metal required per casting. 
Our exothermic feeding aids also 
provide a secondary heat source 
which can also control metal cooling, 
minimising the adverse effects of 
shrinkage during solidiﬁ cation 
> Crucibles These are used in a wide 
range of melting and holding 
applications for non-ferrous alloys, 
particularly aluminium, copper and 
zinc. Each of these applications 
requires a crucible with speciﬁ c 
properties to maximise productivity 
and minimise energy costs 
> Other products These include 
innoculants used for ferrous and 
non-ferrous castings; ﬂ ux degassing 
equipment for removing unwanted gas 
in liquid aluminium; and refractory 
materials used for the transportation 
of liquid metal 47
Our Performance
201 7 Performance 
There was positive momentum in the 
majority of Foundry end markets 
during 2017 , with particular strength in 
heavy trucks and a recovery in mining 
equipment as well as construction and 
agricultural equipment after several 
years of weakness. 
Revenue in the Foundry Division 
increased 16.5% to £535.2m in 2017 on a 
reported basis, whilst underlying revenue 
increased by 9.3%. T rading proﬁ t 
improved by 12.0% on an underlying 
basis. Our 2017 performance beneﬁ ted 
materially from our commitment to 
technological leadership through 
investment in R&D, which resulted in 
13 new product launches during the year, 
the highest on record. These new product 
launches supported double-digit revenue 
growth across Foundry’s highest margin 
product lines – feeding systems, ﬁ lters 
and coatings. T rading proﬁ t also 
benefited from the ongoing organisational 
restructuring in North America, which 
commenced in 2016 and is focused on 
developing a ﬂ atter, leaner structure.
In the Americas, underlying revenue 
increased 1 1.2% despite weakness in 
the light vehicle and rail sectors in North 
America and the closure of a number 
of customer plants in the steel foundry 
sector. This was offset by growth in 
heavy trucks as well as increases in iron 
casting output related to construction 
and agricultural equipment. We were 
successful in gaining market share as a 
result of new product introductions and 
we experienced signiﬁ cant success in 
Brazil growing our feeding systems, 
ﬁ lters and non-ferrous metal treatment 
revenues.
Underlying revenue in EMEA increased 
8.8% year-on-year as a result of growth 
across the majority of foundry end 
markets with particular strength in 
heavy trucks as well as high growth in 
the non-ferrous market. We were also 
successful in gaining market share as 
a result of new product introductions. 
In Asia-Paciﬁ c, underlying revenue 
increased by 8.8%, with sales increasing 
in all major markets. Our revenues in 
China were up c. 13%, due to booming 
demand in heavy truck production 
as well as our tangible progress in 
developing a strong local sales force 
and marketing organisation. In India, 
our revenues were up c.5%, beneﬁ ting 
from growth in light vehicle production 
as well as strength in construction and 
agricultural equipment, and mining 
equipment. Our revenue growth in India 
could potentially have been higher, 
had it not been for high raw material 
costs and supply issues as well as an 
increased focus by Foseco on customer 
payment terms.
Strategic Highlights from the Y ear
The organisational restructuring in North 
America, which commenced in 2016, 
continued through the year with a focus 
on developing a ﬂ atter, leaner structure. 
We also focused on improved succession 
planning with several key new employees 
joining during the year. Each of these 
initiatives saw a focus on improving 
organisational culture and accountability , 
which has allowed us to move decision-
making closer to the customer and 
improve our speed of doing business. 
We continued our efforts to rationalise 
our manufacturing footprint and 
maximise capacity utilisation with the 
closure of the Cleveland ﬁ lter plant and 
Conneaut shank production. We also 
continued to focus on the implementation 
of Lean principles and improvement 
in our support and planning systems 
for operations.
In addition, we have initiated a cost 
efﬁ ciency study at our facilities in Borken 
and Grossalmerode in Germany as part 
of our wider focus on cost efﬁ ciency.
The investment in our world-class R&D 
facility in Enschede, The Netherlands, 
continues to generate new products. In 
2017 , New Product sales as a percentage 
of Foundry sales reached 10%.
T o drive penetration into Japanese 
foundries in ASEAN, we appointed 
a Japanese business development 
manager in Thailand and also refocused 
our efforts on our business in Vietnam. 
A new ﬁ lter production line was launched 
in India and is expected to be completed 
by Q3 2018. The availability of a local 
ﬁ lter source will improve customer 
service levels and support increased 
market penetration. 
In China, the focus remains on further 
developing the local sales and marketing 
organisation and growing market share 
in our major product segments, mainly 
coatings, ﬁ lters and feeding systems. 
Our R&D facility in Enschede,

production costs.  48
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Looking Ahead
The potential revenue per customer 
and per tonne of castings produced is 
strongly inﬂ uenced by the technical 
sophistication of the customer, the 
end-market for the casting, and the 
processes used in its production. These 
factors tend to correlate with the level of 
industrial development within a given  
market. Therefore, we see signiﬁ cant 
growth potential in markets where 
industrial development continues to 
gather momentum, particularly certain 
parts of Eastern Europe and Asia. 
T o position Foseco to beneﬁ t from this 
trend we are expanding our network of 
technical sales staff and application 
engineers within developing markets, 
ensuring that customers there have 
local access to the same high levels 
of expertise and technical support in 
all markets.
In Europe, we expect modest growth in 
the Foundry market for the next few 
years, with an improving outlook for 
growth in the steel foundry segment 
mainly due to growth in the construction 
and mining industries. Consolidation of 
the Foundry industry continues, reducing 
the gap between capacity on offer and 
real demand. We anticipate that plant 
closures and mergers and acquisitions 
will continue in the industry, as will the 
trend to transfer production from 
western countries to Eastern Europe 
and T urkey. Cheaper labour and energy 
costs, together with the availability of 
technical skills, remain key for the future 
development of the industrial footprint 
in these developing markets. In the 
automotive industry, the trend to 
develop lighter vehicles is pushing 
further growth of aluminium castings, 
increasing volumes in the non-ferrous 
foundry segment.
The foundry market in Mexico continues 
to see rapid growth, with foreign 
investment from Asia, Europe, and the 
US in new foundry facilities and the 
ongoing expansion of existing facilities. 
We are positioning ourselves to 
beneﬁ t from this growth with a new 
manufacturing site in Monterrey.  The 
market recovery in mining, agriculture 
and construction that started in 2017 is 
expected to accelerate in 2018 for both 
NAFT A and South America. 
Further growth is also anticipated in India 
and South East Asia, with increasing 
quality requirements expected to drive 
increased penetration of Foseco’s 
feeding systems, ﬁ ltration, coatings, 
and non-ferrous product lines.

Consistent application of coatings 
through automated density control
The Challenge
When manufacturing a casting, 
applying the correct thickness of 
mould coating is critical in providing a 
protective barrier between the liquid 
metal and the core or mould surface. 
A challenge for all foundries is to ensure 
that coating is applied correctly. In a 
recent review we identiﬁ ed one major 
problem - the coating is often diluted 
manually and its density is checked 
only periodically during a shift. 
Inevitably, this can lead to variations 
in performance, as coating that is too 
thick can compromise dimensional 
accuracy and gas permeability and 
coating that is too thin can fail to 
prevent steel penetration into the 
mould sand and can result in surface 
defects on the casting.
Our Solution 
The development team investigated 
potential solutions, but realised that 
available technology would either 
adversely affect the mixing of the 
coating or used delicate pipes and 
pumps that were impractical requiring 
extra cleaning and maintenance 
(and therefore potential production 
downtime). Working with a third-party 
engineering unit we developed a new 
design that did not impact the mixing 
process and provides very accurate 
continuous density and level 
measurement with no moving parts.
The Beneﬁ ts
The Intelligent Coating Unit (ICU) helps 
our customers achieve better and more 
consistent casting results, by ensuring 
that at all points in the production cycle, 
coating products are diluted to their 
optimum application density on a 
continuous basis. This signiﬁ cantly 
reduces the risk of defects in the 
ﬁ nished casting, reduces scrapped 
casting and lowers cleaning costs. 
The ICU also continuously records the 
application density data providing 
an audit trail for use in process 
optimisation and quality reviews.  49

employees are represented by the six 
Vesuvius Values. They are an expression 
of the common culture of the Group, 
promoting our image to external 
stakeholders, and underpinning the 
commercial promise we provide to our 
customers. The Values are displayed in 
all our facilities and in Vesuvius ofﬁ ces 
at customer sites. 
During 2017 , we continued to engage 
our employees on the importance of the 
Vesuvius Values through the addition of a 
new value of ‘Excellence’. Our approach 
to our customers and business operations 
has always been to strive for Excellence, 
and the addition of this sixth Value 
reinforces our objective to integrate 
continuous improvement into our 
business approach.   
Our Values are celebrated annually 
through the Group’s Living the Values 
Awards (‘L TVA’). In 2017 , we came 
together to celebrate the outstanding 
individual contributions to the 
implementation of Vesuvius’ Values 
by 74 employees from 1 1 countries 
who were nominated by their peers.

Awards in our People and Community

Our Values
Creativity
Our commitment to technology and quality is the 
basis for our competitive advantage. Creativity 
allows us to develop innovative products and 
solutions and the continuous improvements 
that generate value through performance 
enhancement. Employees are actively 
encouraged to be innovative and to register their 
ideas in our newly developed Ideation database. 
Cooperation
Encouraging internal and external cooperation 
enables us to create unique solutions with our 
partners. Through cooperation, each Vesuvius 
employee is committed to the success of their 
community of colleagues and customers and 
that of the wider Group.
Reliability
Our solutions involve us in critical aspects of 
our customers’ manufacturing processes. 
Our commitment to deliver consistent products 
and services gives them the level of conﬁ dence 
they require.
Integrity
At the heart of our promise lies the trustworthiness 
of all Vesuvius employees in their acts and words. 
Integrity, honesty and transparency are essential 
in all our exchanges.
Embracing Diversity
Vesuvius is a global company built upon
a true respect for local customs and experience. 
We recognise and embrace the potential that 
comes from the coexistence of so many different 
cultures and of diversity in its broadest sense.
Excellence
This new value, introduced in 2017 , represents 
our aim to deliver optimised performance to our 
customers and stakeholders, eliminating waste 
and striving for continuous improvement. 
Excellence is our attitude as we engage with our 
colleagues, our customers and our communities. 
Our Principles
Working together as a community with 
shared values makes V esuvius stronger .
Vesuvius has established a framework for explaining and delivering the culture 
and principles we consider to be fundamental to our sustained success:

Code of Conduct  
Our Code of Conduct sets out the 
standards of conduct expected, without 
exception, of everyone who works 
for Vesuvius in any of its worldwide 
operations. The Code emphasises our 
commitment to ethics and compliance 
with the law, and covers every aspect 
of our approach to business, from the 
way that we engage with customers, 
employees, the markets, and each of 
our other stakeholders, to the safety 
of our employees and workplaces. 
Everyone within Vesuvius is individually 
accountable for upholding its 
requirements. We recognise that lasting 
business success is measured not only in 
our ﬁ nancial performance, but in the 
way in which we deal with our customers, 
business associates, employees, investors 
and local communities. The Code of 
Conduct is published in our 29 major 
functional languages.
Policies and  Procedures  
We continue to enhance the policies that 
underpin the principles set out in the Code 
of Conduct. These assist employees to 
comply with our ethical standards and the 
legal requirements of the jurisdictions in 
which we conduct our business. They also 
give practical guidance on how this can be 
achieved. Amongst these policies are:
Speak Up
The foundation of our compliance 
programme is the ability to speak up 
without fear of retaliation, either to 
Vesuvius management or independent 
of them. A third party-operated 
conﬁ dential Employee Concern Helpline 
(Speak Up) is available for employees 
wishing to raise concerns anonymously 
or in situations where they feel unable 
to report internally. This independent 
helpline provides the ability to make 
reports online through a web portal, by 
phone or by voicemail. Ensuring global 
accessibility, employees can now speak 
with operators in any of our 29 functional 
languages. No individual is ever 
penalised or disadvantaged for reporting 
a legitimate concern in good faith.
Reports received via Speak Up are 
managed by the General Counsel, 
assisted by senior managers from the 
Legal Department and HR. All reports 
are investigated following a protocol for 
review, action, closure and feedback. 
For complex issues, formal investigation 
plans are drawn up, and support from 
external experts is engaged where 
necessary. Feedback is recognised as 
an important element of the Speak Up 
process and we aim to provide an update 
on all reports within 28 days of receipt.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption and 
Working With Third Parties
Vesuvius engages with various third-
party representatives and intermediaries 
which can present an increased anti-
bribery and corruption risk. Our 
procedure on working with third parties 
clearly outlines our zero-tolerance 
approach to bribery and provides 
practical guidance for our employees in 
identifying concerns and how to report 
them. Vesuvius engages with third-party 
sales agents, many of whom operate 
in countries where we do not have a 
physical presence. Our employees’ 
interaction with sales agents is supported 
by an ongoing training programme for 
those who have speciﬁ c responsibility 
for these relationships.  
Data Protection
Our data protection policy requires a 
uniform approach in the handling of 
personal data to manage the privacy 
obligations of the Group. Everyone has 
rights in respect of how their personal 
data is handled. Our policy recognises 
that the lawful and correct treatment of 
personal data is vital to our continued 
success in an increasingly regulated 
global marketplace. During the course of 
our activities we may collect, store and 
process personal data about our staff, 
customers, suppliers and other third 
parties. We are committed to treating 
this data in an appropriate manner.
Human Rights
The Group human rights policy reﬂ ects 
the principles contained within the 
United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the International 
Labour Organisation’s Fundamental 
Conventions on Labour Standards and 
the United Nations Global Compact. 
The policy applies to all Group 
employees. It sets out the principles for 
our actions and behaviour in conducting 
our business and provides guidance 
to those working for us on how we 
approach human rights issues. The 
Group commits not to discriminate in 
any of our employment practices and 
to offer equal opportunities to all. 
The Group respects the principles of 
freedom of association and the effective 
recognition of the right to collective 
bargaining and opposes the use of, 
and will not use, forced, compulsory 
or child labour. These principles have 
been integrated into the work of our 
procurement teams as we assess our 
suppliers and their business practices.   
Training
During the year we continued to operate 
our training programme on the principles 
contained in the Vesuvius Code of 
Conduct and associated anti-bribery, 
corruption and other compliance policies 
and procedures. T raining gives our 
employees a clearer understanding of 
the scope of risks that exist as we conduct 
our business, and gives context to how 
the Group expects each one of us to 
respond to those risks. In 2017 , our 
training processes have developed 
to include an integrated learning 
management system which allows us 
to deliver Vesuvius-speciﬁ c e-learning 
modules to employees on topics 
relevant to their role through an 
online interactive platform.
T raining provided during 2017 included:
> E-learning modules for modern 
slavery, data protection and trade 
sanctions
> Webex and video conference 
workshops on data protection
> Face-to-face training by the Legal 
and Compliance team to staff at 
several sites covering anti-bribery 
and corruption, gifts, hospitality and 
entertainment and trade sanctions
Our e-learning platform supplements 
the face-to-face training provided to 
employees by the Legal and Compliance 
team, enabling us to reach more 
employees, more quickly and in a more 
targeted way. In 2018, we will continue 
to develop our training processes and 
modules available in the e-learning 
platform to help our staff understand the 
Vesuvius policies and procedures relating 
to our Code of Conduct and regulatory 
compliance requirements. 
Monitoring and Evaluation
Alongside our training programme, we 
assist employees with the implementation 
and interpretation of the Group’s policies, 
and their application through a process 
of monitoring and evaluation. Part of this 
process involves performing ongoing and 
targeted due diligence to understand 
the background to policy design and 
application. This forms part of our 
compliance framework to ensure that our 
ethical and legal approach remains ﬁ t for 
purpose and is understood throughout 
the business.
Our Principles continued 59
Speak Up
The Group continues to monitor the 
volume, geographic distribution and 
range of reports made to its Speak Up 
facility to ascertain not only whether 
there are signiﬁ cant regional compliance 
concerns, but also whether there are 
countries where access to this facility 
is less well understood or publicised. 
The Audit Committee continues to 
monitor and oversee the Group’s 
procedures for reporting allegations of 
improper behaviour, and throughout 
2017 the Audit Committee received 
updates on the volume of reports 
received from the conﬁ dential Speak 
Up Helpline, key themes emerging from 
these reports and the results of any 
investigations undertaken. In 2017 , 
we received 76 reports through the 
Speak Up facility, a number of which 
related to the same set of facts. Each one 
of these was investigated. A substantial 
majority of reports received in 2017 were 
human resource issues which indicated 
no compliance concerns, nor serious 
breaches of the Code of Conduct. In 
relation to the repetitive reports, even 
though these did not identify compliance 
concerns, steps were taken to ensure 
that changes were implemented locally, 
including in certain cases entity-wide 
management training, recommunication 
of policies and reinforcement of our 
business culture, supported by senior 
management oversight. Of the small 
number of reports received that 
contained allegations in breach of 
our Code of Conduct, thorough 
investigations were performed and, 
where appropriate, disciplinary action 
taken, including one termination. 
Prevention of Slavery and Human 
Trafﬁ cking
During 2017 we published our second 
transparency statement outlining the 
Group’s approach to the prevention of 
slavery and human trafﬁ cking in our 
business and supply chain. Y ou can 
ﬁ nd a copy of our latest statement on 
our home page at www.vesuvius.com. 
Since the publication of our ﬁ rst 
statement we have conducted a 
Group-wide risk assessment as well as 
developing our internal policies and 
enhancing our supplier assessment 
programme. T o ensure effective 
communication of our Human Rights 
Policy we have provided training to our 
key purchasing staff and introduced an 
online e-learning module to upgrade the 
training given to all supplier-facing staff, 
which provides key guidance on the red 
ﬂ ags associated with modern slavery to 
assist them in identifying these during 
supplier visits and accreditation. 
Working with Third Parties
During 2017 the Group continued the 
review of our third-party representatives 
and intermediaries.  This included 
detailed review of our due diligence 
activities for active sales agents across 
the Group. This process covers 
reputation, public information searches, 
regulatory searches and ultimate 
beneﬁ cial ownership, and has been 
applied to each one of our active sales 
agents. The review of our due diligence 
processes will continue to be extended 
on a risk-based approach during 2018 
and beyond.
Data Protection
In 2017 , we spent considerable time 
reviewing our approach to data 
protection, in anticipation of the 
implementation of the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation in May. 
We formally identiﬁ ed a Data 
Protection Ofﬁ cer (‘DPO’) in July 2017 
whose role includes setting Group policy, 
implementing procedures, monitoring 
compliance with data protection 
provisions and championing Vesuvius’ 
approach to the protection of personal 
data. Our review involved Group-wide 
due diligence to clarify the data we 
control and process, the methods by 
which we do this, the security of the 
systems that hold our data and the 
assignment of responsibilities for 
responding to this. 
The DPO is also responsible for raising 
awareness of data protection issues 
across the Group and training staff 
who undertake roles that involve the 
processing of data. 
Other Due Diligence
The Group continues to undertake 
focused, country- and function-speciﬁ c 
risk assessments, reviewing ﬁ nancial 
records and the quality of implementation 
of our policies and procedures, often 
engaging the assistance of external 
advisers. The outputs of these 
assessments are used to identify activities 
that require further improvement, ensure 
that our Group policies and procedures 
for the management of anti-bribery and 
corruption risk continue to be appropriate 
for the business, and ensure that within 
our business there is the necessary 
awareness and understanding to be 
able to manage risks appropriately.

Health and Safety
V esuvius remains fundamentally committed to 
protecting the health and safety of employees, 
contractors, visitors, customers and any other 
persons affected by our activities.   
Our approach to health and safety is based on the following beliefs
Health and safety is one of Vesuvius’ core 
principles, and our commitment to health 
and safety is embedded throughout the 
organisation. The Vesuvius ethos is to 
identify, eliminate, reduce or control all 
workplace risks and an ongoing system 
of training, assessment and improvement 
is in place to focus on achieving this. 
Safety Leadership
Safety performance remains the ﬁ rst 
item on the agenda at all our Group 
Executive Committee and management 
meetings, and safety performance is 
reported to the Board by the Chief 
Executive as a matter of priority at each 
Board meeting. Any site experiencing 
a serious dangerous occurrence or 
medically treated injury is required to 
carry out a full 8D investigation and  
incorporate the ﬁ ndings into their site 
improvement plan. The Group Executive 
Committee reviews the more serious 
incidents and the responses from the 
sites. The Group remains fully committed 
to continuing safety improvement with a 
Group health and safety policy stating 
a clear goal of:
This goal is pursued through a range of 
policies, standards and procedures, 
which are reviewed and updated on an 
ongoing basis. In 2017 , the accident and 
incident reporting, personal protective 
equipment, road vehicle and machine 
safety standards were all reviewed and 
updated to maintain their relevance to 
the current Vesuvius risk proﬁ le.
Health and Safety
Health and safety is regarded as a core 
management responsibility, with 
executives and line managers directly 
responsible for health and safety matters 
in the operations under their control. 
This tone from the top is demonstrated 
by the requirement for all senior 
managers to perform executive safety 
tours, report on their ﬁ ndings to local 
operations management and follow 
up on improvement requirements. 
Management is accountable for health 
and safety performance against 
objectives and all employees understand 
that they have a responsibility to take 
care of themselves and others whilst at 
work. We expect everyone to participate 
positively in the task of preserving 
workplace health and safety.
Every business facility has an appointed 
health and safety manager, who works 
with management and all employees 
to review site health and safety, assess 
training needs and develop and 
implement site safety improvement 
plans. These local health and safety 
managers are assisted by a central 
team of experts who not only identify 
adverse trends and respond to them, 
but also enable the sharing of best 
practice across Vesuvius. 
In 2017 , a thorough review was 
undertaken of the operation of the health 
and safety function in Vesuvius. Following 
this review, the function was restructured 
with the creation of a new position of 
Group Vice President Quality, Health and 
Safety and the restructuring of central 
functions. The Vice President QHSE will 
be responsible for setting the Group’s 
policies for quality and safety and 
controlling their application, with the 
business units taking full responsibility for 
their implementation and accountability 
for performance against them. A new 
safety auditing team will be established, 
to develop and maintain policies and 
standards, improving them in the light 
of external and internal changes on a

consistent Group-wide basis. In addition, 
this team will systematically audit Group 
locations worldwide, including customer 
locations, against these policies and 
standards, providing recommendations 
on improvements and assisting the 
locations with their implementation.
Health and Safety Policy
All employees are expected to adhere 
to the Group’s health and safety policy. 
A copy of the policy signed by all 
members of the Group Executive 
Committee is translated into local 
languages and displayed prominently 
in all locations.
Safety Breakthrough
Safety Breakthrough is Vesuvius’ global 
initiative to reduce the number of 
accidents, ﬁ res and lost time injuries, and 
to increase safety awareness through 
greater employee engagement. Our aim 
is to raise health and safety performance 
to best-in-class levels throughout the 
Vesuvius business. Safety Breakthrough 
sets a goal of attaining the lowest level 
of accidents within our industry sector 
with the ultimate goal of reaching zero 
accidents throughout Vesuvius, as 
identiﬁ ed in our safety goals. The speciﬁ c 
focus on employees based at customer 
locations continues to yield results not 
only for the safety of our employees but 
also our customers’ employees – helping 
to support the strong relationships built 
between customers and Vesuvius.
T raining Employees to Work Safely 
T urbo S training pulls together all 
Vesuvius’ good safety management 
practices that are aimed at enabling all 
Vesuvius employees to work in a safe 
environment. Using a train-the-trainer 
approach, T urbo S training sessions are 
tailored to the audience and their activities. 
For example, there is a special training 
course developed for customer locations 
that focuses speciﬁ cally on the risks faced 
by our employees at our customers’ 
premises and how best to manage them. 
Vesuvius conducts Permit to Work 
training in all Group facilities, including 
customer locations and extends 
recognised best practices throughout the 
Group. This ensures that all non-standard 
work conducted in our facilities, whether 
by Vesuvius employees or contractors, 
is the subject of a pre-commencement 
risk assessment and a formal permission 
to commence activity, setting out the 
safety requirements.
Vesuvius has developed machinery 
safety training with an outside industry 
leader, Pilz GmbH & Co, a company 
specialising in safe automation 
technology. We are now extending 
recognised best practices throughout 
the Group through a series of machinery 
assessments and training programmes.
Working Safely 
The executive safety tours carried out by 
senior managers provide visible safety 
leadership on the shop ﬂ oor in Vesuvius’ 
sites and in customer locations. These, 
along with our daily safety audits are 
a pillar of our Safety Breakthrough 
initiative. In 2017 , 1 1 1 Executive Safety 
T ours, of which 12 were in customer 
locations, were carried out by the 
members of the Executive Committee 
and their direct reports across all 
territories where Vesuvius operates. 
In our plants, more than 76% of our 
working population performed routine 
safety audits, generating an average 
of nine improvement opportunities per 
person, resulting in an improvement in 
worker safety. The audit programme 
involves employees at all levels – from 
the Group Executive Committee and 
safety specialists through to local site 
management, employees and contractors. 
Our Responsibility
Turbo S
The current phase of the Safety Breakthrough 
initiative – Turbo S – builds on the foundation of 
Safety Breakthrough and includes a strong 
focus on the standardisation of all our repetitive 
activities. Turbo S also integrates good 
management practices in the workplace, with a 
strong emphasis on the need to implement an 
organisation which enables everybody to work to 
the same high standards in safety performance. 
As part of the continuing T urbo S initiative:
> Senior executives regularly lead safety tours 
at all locations
> Severe accidents are formally reviewed by the 
Group Executive Committee
> Employees are routinely engaged in safety 
audits
> We invest signiﬁ cantly in safety training for 
all employees, irrespective of their roles and 
functions within our business
> All employees are expected to routinely 
raise and implement safety improvement 
opportunities; we focus on the number of 
implemented ideas
> Safety standards are continually updated, 
translated and deployed throughout Vesuvius
> All injuries and dangerous occurrences are 
analysed locally, with a formal presentation of 
ﬁ ndings, root causes and improvement actions 
cascaded through management.

Safety performance in 2017
T raining activities undertaken in 201 7 include: 
In Poland a Road Safety Champion was 
established and a Road Safety training plan 
developed. In addition, work was undertaken on 
machinery safety. Four presses were assessed by 
Pilz. They identiﬁ ed safety improvement actions 
and a plan was put in place to complete these. 
One piece of equipment which could not be made 
compliant, a friction press, was dismantled.
In the Netherlands, Turbo S training was 
completed for 24 participants and 10 employees 
were trained in machinery safety by Pilz.
In Germany,  dust control, Turbo S, permit 
to work and 5S Lean training were all completed.
In the USA, 11 production employees and 
19 NAFTA HSE professionals were trained 
on machinery safety, by Pilz. In addition a Road 
Safety Champion and a Road Safety Committee 
were appointed. The team developed a 
road safety action plan, safe driving policy, 
training for speciﬁ c categories of drivers and 
updated car pool process. These programmes/
policies were shared and adopted by Canada 
and Mexico. 
The safe driving policy was sent to all drivers, who 
signed and returned it to their manager. Monthly 
general awareness topics were created and sent 
out, and the basic level of training was completed 
for all categories of drivers. Skid control training 
was completed for high-risk drivers in Canada 
and Mexico. In addition, Turbo S, permit to work, 
dust and vibration and furfural training were 
undertaken. 
Health and Safety highlights
As part of the customer’s Steel Zone Safety 
Month (December 2017) at our JSW customer 
location in India, three of our employees received 
awards from the Customer:
>  Mr Chandrakant for Best Essay on Steel 
Plant Safety
>  Mr Venu Jaya Prakash for Best Drawing 
competition on Steel Plant Safety
>  Mr Srinath and Vishnu Arat for Hazard 
Identiﬁ cation in the working area
Vesuvius Chesterﬁ eld in the UK gained national 
recognition for its efforts to improve the working 
environment by reducing the amount of airborne 
dust.  The Pilot dust reduction and awareness 
training course was awarded a certiﬁ cate 
of achievement by the Health and Safety 
Executive-endorsed awarding body at the 
annual Ceramic Industry H&S Pledge Awards.  
Furthermore, the training initiative has since 
been developed into the Group Global Dust 
and Vibration initiative which was deployed 
throughout 2017 .
In ArcelorMittal Galati, Vesuvius took on 
six ﬁ tters from their previous company and 
trained them in all Vesuvius policies with a 5S 
implemented workshop as part of the renewed 
contract covering additional activities in the 
customer’s plant.
In 2017 , Vesuvius Ibérica Refractarios was 
awarded with an ‘honourable mention’ in 
the National and International Prevention 
Awards  as a recognition of the work done in 
the prevention of accidents.
Our T ake 2 initiative ensures that 
employees think again before 
performing any unusual or non-standard 
activity. Simply stated, the employees 
take 2 minutes to discuss the task, any 
hazards and how to prevent accidents 
before any work is started. 
For new contracts in customer locations, 
Vesuvius uses a formal risk assessment 
which aims to identify signiﬁ cant risks 
to our employees and contractors. 
This enables appropriate control 
measures to be agreed and implemented 
with the support of our customers in 
advance of work commencing. 
Safety Performance in 2017
We continue to work hard to reduce 
incident severity and develop robust 
policies, standards and practices aimed 
at improving the safety and health of 
our people in all that they do and to 
develop actionable insight from the 
performance indicators. The lost time 
injuries frequency chart shows how 
injuries have been reduced and how 
that reduction has been maintained 
through a combination of a behaviour-
based approach to safety and the 
implementation of physical safeguards. 63
In 2018, the business units will continue 
to build on the embedded behaviour-
based safety approach taken to date 
to drive continual improvement in 
safety performance.
Working in Tidy Plants
The continuing use of 5S, the workplace 
organisation method, throughout 
the Group has driven signiﬁ cant 
improvements in our workplace 
environment. Employees are encouraged 
to develop ownership of their working 
areas, and take pride in their cleanliness 
and organisation. The added support of 
Vesuvius Lean specialists has been key 
to improving plant safety by removing 
hazards for employees and offering 
a clear, bright and safe working 
environment. Daily 5S audits led by team 
leaders ensure continuous improvement 
of working conditions and promote a 
safer workplace.
Accident and Incident Reporting 
and Analysis 
A signiﬁ cant investment in time and 
resources has been made over recent 
years to develop robust, comprehensive 
and timely reporting of incidents 
(including all ﬁ res, explosions and any 
major spill or other chemical releases). 
In its internal standards, Vesuvius 
continues to use more stringent 
deﬁ nitions for lost time injuries (L TIs) 
and ‘severe accidents’ than the deﬁ nitions 
used by local regulatory bodies. 
This extends investigation to all medically 
treated injuries and serious dangerous 
occurrences. Vesuvius has implemented 
a full investigation based on the 8D 
Practical Problem Solving (‘8D’) tool to 
identify the true root causes to prevent 
repeat incidents with a formal 
presentation of ﬁ ndings, 8D-based 
root causes and improvement actions 
cascaded through management.As part 
of management reporting, the Board 
receives a monthly update on all lost 
time injuries.
Involving Accountable Management for 
Safety Performance
Site safety improvement plans are now 
in place for all production sites with 
deployment being the direct responsibility 
of local managers. Any site experiencing 
a dangerous occurrence or severe injury 
is required to investigate using 8D and to 
share their incident investigation and 
action plans across the Group. In 2017 , 
there were no severe injuries, but 407 
dangerous occurrences. Vesuvius 
encourages the reporting of all 
dangerous occurrences and injuries 
as only through a sound root cause 
analysis and preventative action plan 
implementation can future occurrences 
be prevented.

Vesuvius and its Processes
The Board recognises that good 
environmental management is aligned 
with our focus on cost optimisation and 
operational excellence. Whilst Vesuvius’ 
products do vary signiﬁ cantly in the 
energy intensity of their manufacture, the 
majority of our manufacturing processes 
are not energy intensive, nor do they 
produce large quantities of waste and 
emissions. Vesuvius’ total energy costs 
are less than 3% of revenue, with only 
1.8% of the total energy requirements 
across the Group consumed in the UK. 
T otal Energy Consumption
Overall gas use increased by 6.4% 
in 2017 and electricity use by 1 1.9%, 
primarily as a result of the increased 
production of energy-intensive bricks 
and of our South African production of 
Slagdol, an energy-intensive product 
used in converters. In this way, changes 
in product mix can have a positive 
or negative effect on our energy 
performance, such that they can 
outweigh any underlying changes. 
The underlying data for 2017 does 
indicate improvements in energy 
consumption in some areas. This detailed 
analysis of normalised data is used by 
Vesuvius’ senior engineers to drive 
improvements across the business. 
Environmental Monitoring
All our factory emissions are proactively 
managed in accordance with local 
regulations. Regular analysis enables us 
to take action to reduce our emissions 
where possible and to operate more 
efﬁ ciently. The Group monitors its energy 
consumption, worldwide CO
2
e emissions 
and usage of water. Vesuvius proactively 
seeks to reduce waste in production 
and to reuse and to recycle materials 
where practical.
In 2017 , Vesuvius recorded nine minor 
environmental incidents. These included 
items such as encroachment of waste 
water from a neighbouring property, 
complaints about a factory odour and 
contained spillages. All of the incidents 
were contained via Vesuvius’ site 
environmental response plans and 
reported through the Vesuvius incident 
reporting system. T wo of these incidents 
in China were reported to the local 
environmental regulators. No action 
was taken by the authorities after 
Vesuvius made process changes. 
In all cases we complied with our 
local reporting requirements.

Sustainability Highlights
Vesuvius France installed a water network 
separation and rain water collection system 
linked  to an on-site ﬁ reﬁ ghting water lagoon.
In Korea, 4,891 square metres of asbestos 
containing rooﬁ ng was safely replaced with 
steel cladding to improve the health, safety 
and environmental risk proﬁ le of the site.
Process Metrix shipped a record number 
of laser systems in 2017 with the new 
Hyperion
TM
 software.
Process Metrix also released their new 
Two-Color Pyrometer for surface temperature 
measurement in conjunction with lining thickness 
measurement. The systems typically increase 
ladle refractory lifetime by 10–30% with a 
concomitant reduction in waste with less brick 
consumed over the lifetime of the ladle. 65
Greenhouse Gas Reporting
In line with our total energy consumption, 
both total emissions and normalised 
emissions increased in 2017 , driven 
predominantly by the issue mentioned 
above – the increased production of 
Slagdol which generated high process 
CO
2
 emissions, and increase in 
production of our brick plants, although 
we also undertook a switch from coal to 
a cleaner gas fuel during the year in our 
Chinese brick plant. In 2017 , Vesuvius also 
included the emission from our newly 
acquired ﬂ ux plant in Brazil. If these 
products are excluded, then there is an 
underlying downward year-on-year 
trend in normalised emissions of CO
2
e 
of 7 .7% and of normalised energy 
consumption of 7 .3%.
In reporting greenhouse gas (‘GHG’)
emissions, we have used the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
methodology to identify our GHG 
inventory of Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 
(indirect) CO
2
e. We report in kg of CO
2
 
equivalent (‘CO
2
e’).
The Group also meets all of its obligations 
in relation to the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (‘CRC’) Energy Efﬁ ciency 
Scheme, the Producer Responsibility 
Packaging Waste regulations and the 
Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme 
by which the UK has implemented the 
EU Energy Efﬁ ciency Directive.
Energy Conservation Plan
The Vesuvius Energy Conservation Plan 
was launched in 201 1 with the objective 
of reducing our normalised energy 
consumption by 10% over the following 
three years. In June 2015, we reset our 
focus and set the objective of a 10% 
improvement (using 2014 as our base 
year) by 2018. Against that 2014 base, 
a 4.2% improvement has been realised 
towards this target (making a 7 . 1% 
improvement since 2010). Managing 
our energy intensity not only has an 
environmental beneﬁ t but is also part 
of our long-term strategy to enhance 
our cost competitiveness.

Methodology We have reported to the extent reasonably practicable on all the emission sources required 
under Part 7 of the Accounting Regulations which fall within our consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Scope 1 covers emissions from fuels used in our factories and ofﬁ ces.
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, heat, steam and 
hot water we purchase to supply our ofﬁ ces and factories. We have used data gathered to fulﬁ l our 
requirements under the CRC Energy Efﬁ ciency scheme and emission factors from UK Government’s 
and the IEA GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2016 in the calculation of our GHG.
New Insural® furnace lining 
system increases productivity 
and casting quality
The Challenge
The need to improve productivity, 
commercial competitiveness and 
environmental impact is increasingly 
driving the adoption of energy efﬁ cient 
furnaces in aluminium foundries. 
However, the efﬁ ciency of these furnaces 
is often undermined by the choice of the 
refractory lining. 
Our Solution 
Foseco has developed a new, multi-part 
and highly insulating lining made of Insural 
material. The lining is delivered ready to 
install, and combines energy saving 
potential with long service life and 
resistance to oxide build-up. 
The Beneﬁ ts 
As most of the lining system is made of 
pre-cast Insural shapes, the installation 
can be completed in under three days 
unlike traditional linings which require 
several weeks to fully stabilise. In addition, 
no sintering is necessary. The furnace just 
needs to be pre-heated and maintained at 
working temperature for 48 hours and is 
then ready for service.
The Insural furnace lining system is 
completely water free. Consequently, 
hydrogen pick-up from the new lining 
system is negligible and the aluminium 
melt density index speciﬁ cation can 
be achieved immediately following 
installation. Furnace downtime is 
dramatically reduced and the risk of 
increased rejects associated with re-lining 
work is avoided.
With conventional linings, the external 
furnace body temperature often runs in 
excess of 100° C, while with Insural 
furnace lining systems installed an 
external furnace body temperature of only 
64°C can be achieved. This signiﬁ cantly 
improves the foundry working 
environment and reduces energy loss. 
Our tests show that Insural lining runs on 
33% less energy than a tradional lining. 
The Insural furnace lining system offers 
the foundry a reduction in cost, increased 
productivity and security in casting quality . 66

Water Conservation
Whilst water is not a scarce resource in 
the places where Vesuvius operates, 
Vesuvius works to reduce the consumption 
of water in its manufacturing processes 
by recycling and improving processes 
to reduce consumption. Normalised 
consumption of water does vary with 
product mix; however, there is an overall 
downward trend for both absolute water 
consumption, and normalised water 
consumption – that is water use per tonne 
of product manufactured.
Our Customers and Their 
Processes
Under the Vesuvius and Foseco brands, 
we deliver a wide range of solutions 
that help our customers improve the 
productivity of their operations. 
These solutions also improve the 
quality of our customers’ products 
and reduce the environmental footprint 
of their processes.
Thermal optimisation and reject 
reduction are key factors in the processes 
for which we supply solutions. We 
contribute to the reduction of our 
customers’ energy usage and subsequent 
CO
2
 emissions through insulating 
materials, metal ﬂ ow management, 
facilitating extended manufacturing 
sequences (meaning less reheating) 
and reduced downtime.
The iron and steel industry accounts for 
approximately 6.7% of total world CO
2
 
emissions and 18% of industrial CO
2
 
emissions, with, on average, 1.8 tonnes 
of CO
2
 being emitted for every tonne of 
steel produced. With around 10 kg of 
refractory material required per tonne 
of  steel produced, careful selection 
of energy-saving refractories can 
beneﬁ cially impact on the net emission 
of CO
2
.
In the foundry process, the amount of 
metal melted versus the amount sold 
is critical to a foundry’s proﬁ tability. 
Foseco continuously works with its 
customers to increase the ratio of metal 
sold to metal melted. Sometimes this is 
as low as 40% and we work with them 
to increase it to 70%. 
How Does Vesuvius Contribute? 
Since 201 1 we have used a CO
2
 impact 
stamp to highlight the most energy-
efﬁ cient solutions in our portfolio of 
products and services and to support 
the deployment of energy-efﬁ cient and 
sustainable solutions engineered by 
our technology departments.
Vesuvius products and services facilitate 
environmental beneﬁ ts by:
> Enabling lighter, thinner and stronger 
components, leading to lighter vehicles 
and less energy consumption
> Improving customer processes through 
the supply of innovative consumables 
to reduce energy intensity and the 
CO
2
e intensity ratio
> Reducing customers’ refractory 
usage per tonne of steel produced 
through higher-quality, longer 
service-life products
> Increasing the level of sound castings 
produced per tonne of metal melted 
through improved mould design and 
the application of molten metal 
ﬁ ltration and feeding systems

People and Community
Our people are unique and important to us. 
We are unequivocally committed to helping 
them to be the best they can at what they do. 
Our aim at Vesuvius is to foster a working 
environment that is inclusive and diverse, 
where people can be themselves 
without fear of harassment, bullying or 
discrimination. We recognise that the 
dedication and professionalism of our 
people, their capacity for owning their 
roles and their drive for results, are the 
most signiﬁ cant contributors to Vesuvius’ 
success. In order to get the best from 
our people, we emphasise that one of 
the most important tasks of being a 
manager in Vesuvius is the development 
of their direct reports. We recognise that 
we attain our goals through our people.
Line and functional managers are guided 
in managing and developing their people 
by a central HR function, head-quartered 
in London delivering support through 
its expertise in Reward, T alent 
Management, and Global Mobility, and 
backed up by modern HR information 
systems. Management in the business 
units and regional and local HR staff 
draw upon this expertise and cascade 
it to their respective business units and 
local organisations. Much care is taken 
to ensure that Corporate HR initiatives 
are properly communicated and 
implemented at local level, with the 
cooperation of identiﬁ ed employee 
representatives.
The main area of attention for the central 
HR function is identifying and fostering 
talent across the organisation and 
making sure that those individuals 
identiﬁ ed as having high potential are 
seen as a company-wide resource, with 
appropriate development plans put in 
place. In recruiting talent, whether it 
be recent graduates or seasoned 
professionals, we are looking for 
individuals who embody an entrepreneurial 
mindset and an international outlook. 
Special attention is paid in addressing 
matters such as gender balance and the 
employment of a diverse workforce. 
For 2018, a strengthening of both the 
T alent Management and Reward 
functions is planned, to equip them better 
for the ever-increasing battle for talent in 
the marketplace.
T alent Management
Strengthening the leadership pipeline 
and facilitating people development 
throughout the organisation remain 
key areas of focus for Vesuvius. We work 
hard to ensure that across all operational 
and functional areas of the business, at a 
senior managerial level, there is the 
appropriate level of alignment in 
strategic outlook and performance 
goals. This increases accountability and 
drives results. We encourage and reward 
high performance, foster talent and aim 
to create an environment where all can 
realise their individual potential. T o meet 
the demands of the business and add 
rigour to our employee value proposition, 
we have launched a number of 
programmes to assist our employees in 
growing their careers through utilising 
world-class learning opportunities.
Our Responsibility
Our T raining Programmes
ADVANCE
This is a ﬁ rst generation management 
development programme aimed at developing 
individual contributors who are likely to occupy a 
line management role in the short to medium term 
and managers who have no direct reports but 
need to be familiar with a broad range of people 
management skills to use in one-off projects. 
In its ﬁ rst year, the programme is designed to 
take place over 12 months, and includes a blended 
learning approach of online learning, face-to-face 
workshops and individual projects. Participants 
are supported by line management and 
HR business partners throughout the duration of 
the programme and thereafter where additional 
support is needed. The programme includes a 
360° assessment of each participant to enable 
them to compile a personal development plan 
for the next stage of their career.
WINGS
This is the Vesuvius middle management 
development programme aimed at those 
who manage other managers. Wings, now 
in its eighth year, is held in Spring each year 
at Vlerick University in Belgium. In 2017 , 
26 employees successfully completed the course. 
The programme entails an introduction to 
general management theory and practice and, 
like the ADVANCE programme, includes a 360° 
assessment of each participant.
ASCENT
This is the Vesuvius high potential and senior 
leadership development programme, which 
Vesuvius offers in partnership with Insead. It is 
aimed at accelerating the development of top 
talent within the organisation. The programme 
is highly structured and takes place over a 
nine-month period, involving initial online 
modules, face-to-face workshops and individual 
and group projects, in which participants are 
assessed individually and also against each other. 
Participants are supported by senior executives 
and senior HR management for the duration of 
the programme and thereafter. Participants on 
this programme are those identiﬁ ed as being 
potential future senior management of the Group.
HeaTt
These courses form part of the Vesuvius Technical 
University aimed at the continuous technical 
development of Vesuvius personnel. Courses 
range from entry to expert levels, and are 
continuously updated to keep pace with 
developing technology, thereby guaranteeing 
that Vesuvius staff are at the forefront of 
technical innovation. 
HR4HR 
During 2016/17 , under the Vesuvius HR4HR 
project, 30 HR professionals underwent 
accredited professional training in psychometric 
assessment and evaluation, and simulation of key 
talent management processes, each achieving 
‘Expert’ status. These HR4HR graduates will act 
now as catalysts for implementing innovative 
recruitment and talent identiﬁ cation techniques 
across the business. The project will be progressed 
in 2018. 68

SuccessFactors
Vesuvius has invested heavily in a new 
people platform and key digital 
products. The SuccessFactors HRIS 
project was launched globally in January 
2017 . It provides greater transparency 
across the business, facilitating better 
performance management and focused 
talent identiﬁ cation and development, 
and has been implemented across all our 
businesses and geographies.
Reward
Vesuvius’ reward systems are designed 
to create a market competitive and fair 
pay environment for all of our employees
and to reinforce the vision, strategy and 
expectations set by the Board. 
We have adopted the Willis T owers 
Watson job grading model, which 
enables us to compare roles and deploy 
a structured assessment methodology 
across countries and specialisms to 
ensure that roles are rewarded 
consistently throughout the organisation. 
Employees can also visualise their 
potential career paths within Vesuvius on 
the grade map. Vesuvius is committed 
to creating reward systems which are 
transparent and objective, where 
employees receive equal pay for work 
of equal value, regardless of their age, 
race, disability, sexual orientation, 
gender, marital, civil partnership or 
parental status, religion or beliefs.
The Corporate Annual Incentive Plan for 
managers ensures that our people are 
motivated to achieve their objectives, 
with awards linked to business 
performance. The Mid- T erm Incentive 
Plan for managers and senior managers 
acts as a retention tool for key talent, 
reducing employee turnover and 
diversifying our pay methods. The 
Vesuvius Share Plan for Executive 
Directors and Group Executive 
Committee members encourages 
decisions based on long-term goals 
rather than short-term gains and works 
to align the interests of participants 
and shareholders. 
People and Community continued
Following an early career in 
construction and refractory 
manufacturing, I joined Vesuvius 
Canada as a Sales Account 
Manager in 2000. I was gradually 
promoted to the roles of District 
Manager and Steel Sales 
Manager , before becoming 
General Manager of the Canadian 
business in 2005. My ﬁ rst 
international posting was to 
Suzhou, China where I became 
Vice President Advanced 
Refractories , Asia Paciﬁ c. There 
I oversaw all of our Advanced 
Refractories operations for the 
Asia Paciﬁ c region, covering 
Korea, Japan, T aiwan and China, 
including our Chinese joint venture 
with Angang Steel. My next move 
was to Australia, where I became 
the General Manager , overseeing 
the opening of the new Port 
Kembla manufacturing site  and 
the sale of some of our non-core 
businesses. 
In 201 3, I moved back to 
Canada to take over the General 
Manager role once again and, 
in November 2015, became the 
Operations Director for Advanced 
Refractories NAFT A, responsible 
for managing our production sites 
in the US, Canada and Mexico.  
Finally, in May 201 7 , I moved to 
Pittsburgh to take on the position 
of Vice President of Advanced 
Refractories NAFT A, leading the 
business in this region. Vesuvius 
has given me the chance to work 
overseas gaining international and 
intercultural experience enabling 
me to take on senior management 
roles around the world.

Global Mobility 
Although Vesuvius is active worldwide, 
we keep the number of international 
assignments as low as possible as we 
believe that local Vesuvius companies 
should be managed and staffed by local 
personnel. International assignments are 
therefore limited in time, usually to three 
years. Currently 29 employees are on 
long-term assignments.
Employee Diversity
Vesuvius believes that the diversity of its employees is one of the core strengths of the Group. Having a balance of cultures, 
ethnicities and genders helps to promote the innovation and creativity that is key to our success. We recognise that, in line with other 
engineering companies of our size and nature, we have an unbalanced gender representation. We are seeking to address this as 
part of our wider commitment to diversity.

Our Responsibility
Global mobility at Vesuvius
> Providing Vesuvius companies with skills that are 
not locally available and that are required at 
short notice. This typically occurs in countries 
where we are establishing a new presence. 
The number of expatriates working on this basis 
diminishes over time as the organisation 
matures and we recruit and train local talent 
to take over
>  Career development. We believe that 
the personal development plan of any employee 
being developed for a senior management, or 
senior expert position should include a posting 
outside their home country. This encourages 
them to develop the skills necessary to function 
successfully in an international environment. 
These postings are tailored to the needs of the 
organisation and the needs of the individual
> Enhancing diversity. Management teams 
beneﬁ t from having a mix of gender and 
cultures. In speciﬁ c cases we use international 
assignments to achieve this goal
Vesuvius expatriates do not come from 
one or two countries alone, we have a 
truly international mix of nationalities in 
our expatriate population. Individuals 
move not only within a region, but 
also between regions, with existing 
assignments including Malaysia to 
China, China to Germany, Poland to the 
USA and Brazil to China. Our mobility 
programme shows that our expatriate 
population is as diverse as our Group.
Vesuvius operates a number of 
international assignment policies to 
provide for the different circumstances 
of these assignments – whether they 
be short term, longer term, or require 
extended commuting. These policies are 
supplemented with clearly identiﬁ ed 
beneﬁ ts, delivering support appropriate 
to the nature of the assignment. 
By accessing this broad range of policies, 
we can manage our international 
assignments with greater ﬂ exibility, thus 
catering for changing expectations and 
demands from employees, whilst at the 
same time meeting the demands of 
the business. 70

Employee Consultation and 
Industrial Relations
In most of the countries in which we 
operate we discuss matters concerning 
the Vesuvius business with local works 
councils and trade unions. These 
processes and procedures are regulated 
by local law and we ﬁ nd that the 
constructive dialogue that takes place 
between employee representatives and 
management provides beneﬁ t to our 
business. In addition to local employee 
representation we operate a European 
Works Council (‘EWC’) that contains 
representatives from each of the EU 
countries where Vesuvius has employees. 
European management and the EWC 
meet formally once a year. At this 
meeting management provides an 
update on the performance of the 
business, with a particular focus on 
developments likely to impact European 
employees. Additional ‘Special Event 
Meetings’ are held when the Group is 
required to consult with the EWC about 
particular matters, including proposed 
restructurings in the European 
organisation. One such meeting was 
held in 2017 . The EWC Select Committee 
also meets twice a year to receive 
additional updates, and the Chief 
Human Resources Ofﬁ cer of Vesuvius 
joins part of these meetings. All EWC 
representatives receive four dedicated 
training days per year, to ensure they 
are appropriately equipped to fulﬁ l 
their duties.
In addition to formal discussion and 
consultation mechanisms, in many 
countries our operations hold ‘town hall’ 
meetings on a regular basis. These 
provide an opportunity for local 
management to meet with staff and 
provide an update on corporate 
developments and matters material to 
the business.
Valuing our Employees
Vesuvius operates a number of awards 
and initiatives aimed at recognising the 
contribution of particular individuals and 
disseminating best practice throughout 
the Group. Examples of these include the 
Living the Values Awards and the EMEA 
8D PPS Awards.
Our Living the Values Awards 
programme is central to maintaining 
our Group’s collective focus on Vesuvius’ 
Values. On 14 December 2017 , 
we gathered for our ﬁ fth awards 
ceremony to celebrate and acknowledge 
the efforts of 74 employees. Awards 
were presented to 14 individuals and 
13 teams from 1 1 different countries, 
all of whom, nominated by their peers, 
were credited with embodying Vesuvius’ 
Values. They were rewarded with a 
specially designed trophy, with Vesuvius 
making a ﬁ nancial contribution to each 
winner’s chosen charity.
The EMEA 8D PPS Awards 2017 took 
place in Pavia, Italy, in October. These 
awards showcase the beneﬁ ts of the 
8 Disciplines approach to practical 
problem-solving. They were launched to 
reinforce the messages of our intensive 
training courses, to promote the use of 
practical problem-solving in the business 
and to recognise excellence in quality. 
During a two-day programme, Vesuvius 
employees were invited to present case 
studies evidencing the application of the 
8D methodology to offer to customers 
sustainable business solutions. A panel, 
chaired by Vesuvius’ Chief Executive, 
judged the presentations, selecting the 
winning team from Olifantsfontein, 
South Africa. This team demonstrated 
outstanding capabilities in pushing the 
boundaries in high temperature 
solutions. Their case study demonstrated 
the use of 8D in a joint effort between 
the customer and our ﬁ eld service 
engineers, to develop a unique solution 
for the customer’s team to increase 
operational efﬁ ciency, and to develop 
new business for Vesuvius.
Vesuvius in the Local Community
Our social responsibility activities 
complement our values in driving our 
culture. Our operating sites engage with 
their local communities through various 
social action projects. 
In Germany, Vesuvius GmbH opened 
its doors to junior researchers from 
Borken kindergartens. About 30 children 
interested in research, accompanied by 
their nursery school teachers, turned 
the Vesuvius canteen into an exciting 
research island. At ten research stations 
the boys and girls experimented with 
colours, sowed herbs, and built noise 
protectors and boats.

Our Responsibility
In the Netherlands, Foseco Nederland 
BV operates an employee charity 
donation competition. Employees write 
an essay explaining why the charity 
organisation with which they have a 
connection, should win the donation. 
In June 2017 , Marloes Goorhuis won 
the award for her contribution to an 
organisation named MeeReizen. 
MeeReizen organises holidays for 
mentally disabled people, providing the 
participants with an exciting adventure 
and their carers with some respite at 
home. Marloes has been a volunteer on 
these holidays for years. The trip is paid 
for by the participants themselves, so 
there is a very limited budget. Additional 
donations are used to provide additional 
experiences such as a visit to the zoo, 
a theme park or a museum.
In France, colleagues from Vesuvius 
France SA trained a futsal (a special form 
of football team), to participate in an 
inter-company competition organised 
by the local association. This annual 
competition is organised to support 
the charity L ’Enfant Bleu which ﬁ ghts 
against the maltreatment of children.
In addition, Vesuvius France SA again 
worked with Feignies’ local ﬁ re brigades, 
this time conducting four major exercises 
to learn more about managing chemical 
risk at high temperatures. We helped 
them explore how best to assess 
situations without prior knowledge, 
how to evaluate circumstantial and 
environmental factors under pressure, 
as well as how to communicate effectively 
with teams when facing speciﬁ c chemical 
ﬂ ow hazards.
In China, Vesuvius Suzhou sponsors

I joined Vesuvius in 2006, taking 
the role of HR Coordinator at 
Monterrey, Mexico whilst Vesuvius 
was expanding the production 
lines at its Mexico facility. 
Following the inauguration of the 
new Pre-Cast production line, I 
was offered the opportunity to join

Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am delighted to present the 2017 
Corporate Governance Report. As a Board, we remain 
committed to applying the highest standards of corporate 
governance, recognising that robust governance and culture 
underpin business success. This year the Company is reporting 
against the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). 
This version of the Code includes minor changes following the 
implementation of the European Union’s Audit Regulation and 
Directive. I am pleased to report that the Company is fully 
compliant with the Code.
There was much debate in 2017 about the future direction 
of corporate governance, with the publication in April of 
the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Select 
Committee’s report on corporate governance, and the 
Government’s publication of its response to the Green Paper 
on Corporate Governance Reform in August. During the 
year, institutions and voting agencies also issued guidance 
on governance and voting issues, and the FRC produced 
commentaries on key governance issues and responded to the 
Government’s announcements. This culminated in December 
with the FRC’s publication of its consultation on a new draft of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board monitored 
each of these developments, and remains focused on ensuring 
that the Company continues to comply with all its governance 
obligations, including full compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Board Composition
2017 has been a year of signiﬁ cant development for the Board, 
with two new Board appointments.
In April, the Board was strengthened by the appointment of 
Holly Koeppel as an independent Non-executive Director, 
replacing Nelda Connors, who resigned from the Board in 
2016. Having spent 35 years working in global utility, power 
and infrastructure businesses, Holly brings with her extensive 
international experience. 
In September, we welcomed Patrick André to the Board as 
Chief Executive, replacing François Wanecq who retired from 
the Board on 31 August 2017 . Patrick was appointed as part of 
a planned succession process, which involved a comprehensive 
review of external and internal candidates. Patrick joined the 
Group in early 2016, and has displayed signiﬁ cant drive and 
energy since then, strengthening the Flow Control business, 
and exhibiting strong leadership skills and a constant customer 
focus. The Board believes that Patrick is the ideal candidate to 
lead the Group in the next stages of its development. 
Following a period of transition, François Wanecq retired from 
the Group on 31 December 2017 . François led the business 
through a period of signiﬁ cant challenges and change. He 
worked tirelessly to strengthen Vesuvius’ business and to 
champion safety and quality throughout the Group. We thank 
him for his dedication, leadership and stewardship of the Group.
Prior to undertaking these new appointments, the Nomination 
Committee spent time reﬂ ecting on the balance of skills and 
experience of the existing Board members, and considering 
these against the future needs of the business. Balancing 
independence with the skills, knowledge and experience 
required on the Board, and on the Committees which support 
it, is crucial to the Group’s success. With the appointments of 
Holly and Patrick we are conﬁ dent that the Board has the 
appropriate composition to ensure the continued long-term 
success of the business. Consequently, I encourage all 
shareholders to support the election and re-election of our 
incumbent Directors at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Further details about the recruitment processes for Patrick 
and Holly can be found in the Nomination Committee Report.
Culture and Diversity
Corporate culture continues to be an important focus for 
our organisation. Following the recruitment of a new Chief 
Executive, the Board looks to him to continue the work of his 
predecessor in ensuring that appropriate values and a robust 
ethical stance are reﬂ ected consistently in our behaviour as we 
conduct our business. One of the key strengths of Vesuvius has 
always been in the diversity of our employees. With a wide 
geographic spread and local hiring of the clear majority of 
staff, the Group encompasses individuals from a multitude 
of different nationalities and ethnicities. At a Board level 
we recognise the signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts of diversity in our 
business, and understand its importance in supporting 
candid and constructive boardroom debate. During 2017 , 
the Board reﬂ ected further on this theme, monitoring the 
recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander, Parker and 
McGregor-Smith Reviews on gender and ethnic diversity, and 
approving a Board diversity policy. This policy sets out our 
commitment to diversity and explains the actions we will take 
to afﬁ rm this going forward. Whilst recognising that the 
Hampton-Alexander Review has set a target of 33% female 
representation on FTSE 350 Boards by 2020, the Board 
considers its diversity, size and composition to be appropriate 
for the requirements of the business, and does not believe that 
at this time it needs to accelerate the usual rotation of Directors 
to meet this target. However, the Board will continue to consider 
the acknowledged beneﬁ ts of greater diversity in all future 
Director recruitment decisions. With respect to the Group as 
a whole, we recognise that our commitment to diversity is not 
currently reﬂ ected in the gender diversity of our employees. 
Like many other industrial engineering companies, we know 
that our organisation must work harder to attract, develop 
and retain talented women.
A copy of the Board Diversity Policy can be found in the 
Governance Report.
Chairman’s Governance 
Letter 77
Board Evaluation and T raining
This year the Board’s formal evaluation process was again 
externally facilitated by the corporate advisory ﬁ rm, Lintstock. 
It utilised a fresh approach, with the key element constituting 
one-on-one interviews with each Director conducted by 
Lintstock, aimed at gaining a deeper insight into Directors’ 
responses. Overall, the evaluation concluded that the Board 
remained of a high calibre and was functioning well, with 
open and challenging debate and transparent information 
ﬂ ow. The Nomination Committee was felt to have dealt 
successfully with Board succession during the year, identifying 
an accomplished candidate to replace François Wanecq 
as Chief Executive and securing an excellent new Non-executive 
Director. Similarly, the Audit Committee continued to deliver 
robust challenge to management on ﬁ nancial matters and had 
overseen a smooth transition of external auditor. Finally, the 
Remuneration Committee had prepared and recommended 
an updated Remuneration Policy for 2017 .
The evaluation highlighted a number of Board priorities for 
2018 including the need to integrate the new Chief Executive, 
an ongoing emphasis on strategy and its delivery, and the 
need for the Board to continue to set the right tone from the 
top and monitor the culture of the Group. The development of 
senior management level talent, and succession plans for them, 
was again noted as being a key area for focus in 2018, with 
new training programmes implemented, and continuing 
initiatives in place to ensure greater Board access to these 
high-potential individuals.
As Chairman, I recognise that I am responsible for ensuring 
that the Board continues to operate effectively, and that part 
of this role is to ensure that all Directors attain an appropriate 
understanding of the business, and continue to refresh their 
skills and knowledge. During the year, both new Directors 
undertook a tailored induction programme to ensure that they 
quickly gained a good understanding of the Group and their 
responsibilities and obligations. As well as receiving brieﬁ ngs 
and updates on key ﬁ nancial, legal and governance issues 
impacting the organisation, the Directors furthered their 
knowledge by undertaking visits to various operations during 
the year. The Board visited Group operations and a customer’s 
facilities in Brazil, I visited our operations in China and other 
Non-executive Directors visited operations in Poland, the US 
and Germany. During 2018, the Non-executive Directors will 
continue to broaden their understanding of the Group through 
individual site visits as well as scheduled Board visits.
Financial Reporting and Risk 
In 2016, the Audit Committee conducted a competitive 
tender for the external audit which led to the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) as the Company’s 
new auditor in 2017 . PwC formulated a detailed transition 
plan, working with people across the business to build on their 
understanding of the Group and reﬁ ne the planned approach 
to the audit. During the year PwC provided regular updates 
to the Audit Committee on the status and progress of the 
auditor transition plan, along with valuable insights into the 
Group’s audit environment. Further details about the transition 
process are contained in the Audit Committee Report.
The Board continually assesses the Group’s key risks, and the 
methods by which we manage our risks. The impacts of the 
risks are also reviewed and tested as part of our ongoing risk 
management approach. This process continued in 2017 . 
A number of emerging risks were raised and discussed, 
reﬂ ecting developing ‘macro’ trends and identiﬁ ed risks 
where issues had arisen during the year. Whilst none of these 
was considered signiﬁ cant enough to change the overall 
characterisation of the Group’s risks and uncertainties, the 
Board’s view on each of these issues was integrated into 
management discussions on risk and factored into the 
approach the Group takes to mitigation. The Board continues 
to  monitor all perceived risks and the methods by which these 
are managed.
Y ours sincerely

Governance Report
The Board of Vesuvius plc (the ‘Company’) is responsible for the 
Group’s system of corporate governance and is committed to 
maintaining high standards of governance and to developing 
them to reﬂ ect progression in best practice. This report 
describes the Company’s corporate governance structure 
and explains how, during the year ended 31 December 2017 , 
Vesuvius applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the ‘Code’). Throughout the year and up until the 
date of this report, Vesuvius was in full compliance with 
the requirements of the Code. The Board has noted the 
consultation that has commenced regarding a new revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code, and has begun to consider the 
changes that the Company would need to make to its existing 
practices and procedures to ensure continuing full compliance 
in the future. A number of the proposed new requirements are 
already reﬂ ected in the Company’s approach to governance.

John McDonough was absent from a Board meeting due to a family emergency. The meeting was chaired in his absence by the 
Senior Independent Director (‘SID’), Douglas Hurt. Hock Goh and Douglas Hurt were unable to make additional Board and 
Remuneration Committee meetings, scheduled at short notice, due to prior engagements. 
T o the extent that Directors are unable to attend scheduled meetings, or additional meetings called on short notice, they receive the 
papers in advance and relay their comments to the Chairman for communication at the meeting. The Chairman follows up after 
the meeting in relation to the decisions taken. In 2017 , the Chairman sought Hock Goh and Douglas Hurt’s views on the matters to 
be discussed at the Board meeting they were due to miss, in each case prior to the meeting, and provided feedback to them on 
the outcome of discussions. The Committee Chairmen likewise contacted those Directors who were unable to attend Committee 
meetings in advance of those meetings, to canvass their views and understand any issues they wished to raise in respect of the 
subject matters being discussed. The SID maintained contact with the Chairman regarding his priorities for the meeting he was 
unable to attend, together with the discussions undertaken and the action points that stemmed from that meeting.

Board Effectiveness
Board Composition
The Board comprises eight Directors – the Non-executive 
Chairman, John McDonough CBE; the Chief Executive, 
Patrick André; the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, Guy Y oung; and 
ﬁ ve Non-executive Directors. Patrick André joined the Board 
as Chief Executive on 1 September 2017 , replacing François 
Wanecq who retired from the Board on 31 August 2017 as 
part of a planned succession process. Holly Koeppel joined 
the Board as an independent Non-executive Director on 
3 April 2017 . Douglas Hurt is the Senior Independent Director. 
Henry Knowles is the Company Secretary. 
The Board focuses on ensuring that both it, and its Committees, 
have the appropriate range of diversity, skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company, and the 
markets in which it operates, to enable it to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively. The Board continues to look 
at diversity in its broadest sense – reﬂ ected in the range of 
backgrounds and experience of our Board members who are 
drawn from different nationalities and have managed a variety 
of complex global businesses. During the year, the Board 
reﬂ ected on the recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander, 
Parker and McGregor-Smith reviews on gender and ethnic 
diversity and formalised its approach to diversity with the 
approval of a Board Diversity Policy. The policy sets out the 
Board’s objectives with regard to diversity to ensure that the 
Company maintains the optimum Board and Committee 
composition, underpinning the fundamental requirement 
to maintain the right balance of independence, skills and 
knowledge in the boardroom. Details of the Nomination 
Committee’s activities in compliance with the policy during 
the year are included in the Nomination Committee Report.
The Board’s overall skills and experience, as well as Non-
executive Director independence, were reviewed during the 
year as part of the process of recruiting the two new Directors. 
The Board’s composition also formed part of the Board 
evaluation process. T wo of the eight Directors (25%) are women 
and four (50%) are non-UK citizens. The Board also contains 
individuals from a range of ethnic backgrounds. The Board 
consequently considers its diversity, size and composition to 
be appropriate for the requirements of the business, and in 
line with its adopted policy. The Board recognises that the 
Hampton-Alexander Review has set a target of 33% female 
representation on FTSE 350 Boards by 2020. Whilst the Board 
does not believe that it is appropriate to accelerate its planned 
rotation of Directors purely to meet this target, it will continue to 
consider the beneﬁ ts of greater diversity in all future Director 
recruitment decisions. 
Board Diversity Policy
Purpose
This policy sets out the approach to diversity in respect of the Board of 
Directors of Vesuvius plc. The policy is intended to assist the Board, through 
the work of the Nomination Committee, in creating and maintaining 
optimum Board and Committee composition.
The broad principles of diversity contained in this policy apply to all 
employees of the Vesuvius Group. The Vesuvius Code of Conduct reﬂ ects 
Vesuvius’ commitment to diversity and respect for its employees.
Policy Statement
Vesuvius plc recognises the value of a diverse and skilled workforce and is 
committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and collaborative 
workplace culture that will provide sustainability for the organisation into 
the future.
Policy Objectives
The Nomination Committee will focus on ensuring that it, the Board and the 
Board’s other Committees have the appropriate range of diversity, skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable them 
to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively. 
The Nomination Committee will ensure that all appointments to the Board 
are based on merit with each candidate assessed against objective criteria 
focused on the skills, experience and knowledge required of the position, 
and with due regard to the beneﬁ ts of diversity on the Board.
The Nomination Committee will engage with executive search ﬁ rms in a 
manner which ensures that opportunities are taken for a diverse range of 
candidates to be considered for appointment. This will include ensuring that 
the Committee only uses search ﬁ rms that are signed up to the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.
The Nomination Committee supports senior management efforts to increase 
diversity in the senior management pipeline to facilitate succession planning 
towards executive Board positions.
With respect to the representation of women on the Board, highlighted by 
the Davies and Hampton-Alexander Reviews, the Board is supportive of the 
initiative to increase the proportion of women on the boards of FTSE 350 
companies. Vesuvius, which at the date of this policy has a Board comprising 
25% female membership, will continue to ensure that the Board of Vesuvius 
plc reﬂ ects this level, or greater levels of gender diversity, as are appropriate 
for its size and dynamics, to enable it to continue to deliver on the 
requirements of the Vesuvius business.
Monitoring and Reporting
This policy and progress against its objectives will be reviewed annually.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the implementation of this 
policy and for monitoring progress towards the achievement of its objectives.

Governance
Committee composition is set out in the relevant Committee 
reports. No one, other than the Committee Chairman and 
members of the Committee, is entitled to participate in meetings 
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. 
However, as detailed in the Committee reports, where the 
agenda permits, other Directors and senior management 
regularly attend by invitation, supporting the operation of 
each of the Committees in an open and consensual manner.
The Board considers that, for the purposes of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, four Non-executive Directors (excluding the 
Non-executive Chairman), namely Hock Goh, Jane Hinkley , 
Douglas Hurt and Holly Koeppel, are independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could affect the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Christer Gardell is Managing Partner of Cevian Capital which 
holds 21. 1 1% of Vesuvius’ issued ordinary share capital and is not 
considered to be independent. He brings a wealth of commercial 
acumen to the Board. The Chairman satisﬁ ed the independence 
criteria on his appointment to the Board. Biographical details of 
the Directors are set out on pages 50 and 51.
Appointment to the Board
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made 
by the Nomination Committee. Further information is set out 
in the Nomination Committee report on pages 93 to 95. 
Time Commitment of the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors  
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors each have a letter 
of appointment which sets out the terms and conditions of their 
directorship. An indication of the anticipated time commitment 
is provided in any recruitment role speciﬁ cation, and each 
Non-executive Director’s letter of appointment provides details 
of the meetings that they are expected to attend, along with the 
need to accommodate travelling time. Non-executive Directors 
are required to set aside sufﬁ cient time to prepare for meetings, 
and regularly to refresh and update their skills and knowledge. 
All Non-executive Directors have agreed to commit sufﬁ cient 
time for the proper performance of their responsibilities, 
acknowledging that this will vary from year to year depending 
on the Group’s activities, and will involve visiting manufacturing 
and customer sites around the Group. The Chairman in 
particular dedicates a signiﬁ cant amount of time to Vesuvius 
in discharging his duties. The Board notes that the Chairman 
holds chairmanships other than Vesuvius, but that only one of 
these is for a listed company. The other two chairmanships 
are for much smaller private companies where the time 
commitment is limited. 
All Directors are expected to attend all scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings and any additional meetings as required. 
Each Director’s other signiﬁ cant commitments are disclosed to 
the Board during the process for their appointment and they are 
required to notify the Board of any subsequent changes. The 
Company has reviewed the availability of the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors and considers that each of them can, 
and in practice does, devote the necessary amount of time to 
the Company’s business. 
At the time of her appointment, Holly Koeppel served on a 
number of Boards and was in the process of adjusting her 
portfolio and retiring from her executive positions. During 2017 , 
she stepped down from all but one of her board appointments, 
and now only serves as a Non-executive Director on two other 
boards, having taken on a new Non-executive position at 
British American T obacco plc in July 2017 . 
The Board notes that Hock Goh holds a number of other 
directorships, but that these other commitments typically only 
require a total of 25 days’ work per year. MEC Resources Ltd 
is the listed parent company of Advent Energy Ltd, an 
investment company that is not currently operational. As a 
result, Hok Goh’s commitments as Chairman of these 
companies are currently minimal and he is only required to 
attend two Board meetings a year. His other directorships 
require attendance at a small number of Board meetings each 
year. Having reviewed this, the Board believes that Hock’s 
additional commitments do not prevent him from properly 
fulﬁ lling his duties as a Non-executive Director of Vesuvius plc.
Information and Support 
The Board ensures that it receives, in a timely manner, 
information of an appropriate quality to enable it adequately 
to discharge its responsibilities. Papers are provided to the 
Directors in advance of the relevant Board or Committee 
meeting to enable them to make further enquiries about any 
matters prior to the meeting should they so wish. This also 
allows Directors who are unable to attend to submit views in 
advance of the meeting.
In addition to the formal Board processes, the Chief Executive 
provides written updates on important Company business 
issues between meetings, and the Board is provided with 
a comprehensive monthly report of key ﬁ nancial and 
management information. Regular updates on shareholder 
issues are provided to the Directors, who also receive copies of 
analysts’ notes issued on the Company. For the distribution of 
all information, Directors have access to a secure online portal, 
which contains a reference section containing background 
information on the Company. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place 
for Non-executive Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, 
to take independent legal advice at the Company’s expense.
Induction and T raining
A comprehensive induction programme is available to new 
Directors. The core of the induction programme is designed in 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, and is 
tailored to meet the requirements of the individual appointee 
and the dynamics of the Group. This process was undertaken 
twice during the year, on the appointment of Holly Koeppel as 
a Non executive Director and the appointment of Patrick André 
as Chief Executive.
The Chairman, through the Company Secretary, continues to 
ensure that there is an ongoing process to review training and 
development needs. Directors are provided with details of 
seminars and training courses relevant to their role, and are  82

encouraged and supported by the Company in attending them. 
In 2017 , regulatory updates were provided as a standing item 
at each Board meeting in a Secretary’s Report. External input 
on legal and regulatory developments impacting the business 
was also given, with specialist advisers invited to the Board 
and its Committees to provide brieﬁ ngs on overall market 
and economic developments including Brexit, forthcoming 
accounting changes, legal developments in data protection and 
tax matters, and other general corporate governance issues. 
In addition, in 2017 the full Board visited our operations and 
customers in Brazil, gaining a broader understanding of the 
South American business. The Chairman visited our operations 
in China in May, and other Non-executive Directors visited 
operations in Poland, the US and Germany during the year. 
In 2018, the Non-executive Directors will continue to broaden 
their understanding of the Group through further site visits.
Governance in Action – Chief Executive Induction
1.  Following his appointment as Chief Executive, the Board requested that 
the Company Secretary arrange a comprehensive induction programme 
for Patrick André. This recognised his prior employment with the Group 
as President, Flow Control and was therefore tailored to focus on the 
corporate aspects of his new role and the work of the other business units. 
2.  Reference materials were provided, including information about the 
Board, its Committees, procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares 
and other regulatory and governance matters. All aspects of risk and 
its management through insurance, compliance and relevant corporate 
policies and procedures were covered. Patrick was advised of his legal 
and other duties, and obligations as a Director of a listed company. 
These matters were discussed in detail in a series of meetings conducted 
by internal management and external advisers.
3.  Patrick held one-to-one meetings with all other Board members, and 
conducted meetings with key executives throughout the Group, including 
regular meetings and joint site and customer visits with the outgoing 
Chief Executive. He also held a week of off-site meetings with the Group 
Executive Committee to strengthen the relationship with his new team and 
focus on the organisational structure of the key functions of the Group.
4.  Since his appointment Patrick has been undertaking a comprehensive 
programme of site visits, with a view to visiting all the Group’s key R&D 
and manufacturing facilities.
5.  Patrick has met with the Group’s principal advisers, the Company’s brokers 
and investor community, using this as an opportunity to understand their 
roles and the corporate governance environment in greater detail. 
6.  The Board monitored the induction process, and asked the Company 
Secretary to provide updates on its progress.
Performance Evaluation
The Board carries out an evaluation of its performance and that 
of its Committees every year. In 2017 , this evaluation took place 
in the fourth quarter and was again externally facilitated by 
the corporate advisory ﬁ rm, Lintstock. The Group subscribes 
to access Lintstock’s Insider database, but has no other 
connection with the organisation. This year’s evaluation utilised 
a fresh approach. Rather than conducting the evaluation via 
a series of questionnaires, this year Lintstock issued a short 
questionnaire and then conducted a series of in-depth interviews 
with each Director and the Company Secretary aimed at 
analysing and gaining further insight into their responses. 
As with previous years, the evaluation not only covered the 
performance of the Board but also that of its Committees, 
along with individual reviews of each Director and analysis of 
the performance of the Chairman. A narrative report, broken 
down into thematic areas, was then presented to the Board.
The 2016 evaluation had highlighted several priorities for 2017 , 
including strategy and Board succession, and had also 
identiﬁ ed areas for ongoing improvement, including greater 
efforts to support the development of staff members below 
senior management level. As part of the 2017 evaluation, the 
Board assessed that the Nomination Committee had dealt 
successfully with Board succession during the year, securing 
an excellent new Non-executive Director, and identifying an 
accomplished candidate to replace François Wanecq as Chief 
Executive. Overall, the Board felt that the transition of Chief 
Executive had been effectively managed. The development 
of  staff members below senior management level continued 
during 2017 and remains a focus for 2018, with new training 
programmes implemented, and continuing initiatives in place 
to ensure greater Board access to these individuals.
Regarding priorities for 2018, the evaluation highlighted the 
need to continue to support the integration of the new Chief 
Executive, to ensure he establishes effective working relationships 
with members of the Board and senior management, and is 
supported in formulating and implementing his objectives 
for the Group. The Board noted there would be an ongoing 
emphasis on strategy, and recognising the increasing corporate 
governance focus on stakeholder communication, the Board 
would need to continue to develop plans to interact with 
stakeholders and oversee the culture of the Group. The evaluation 
also identiﬁ ed a consistent theme regarding personal 
development plans. It was agreed that the Board would focus 
on this during its oversight of senior management. In respect of 
its own activities, individual Non-executive Directors would be 
encouraged to continue undertaking site visits to operations 
throughout the Group.
On more practical matters, there was a continuing need to 
improve Board processes, with the reﬁ nement of Board packs, 
and the promotion of consistency in Board presentations. 
As in previous years, a set of action points was compiled from 
the output of the evaluation to ensure that its ﬁ ndings are 
implemented into the Board’s activities. This is supervised by 
the Chairman and reviewed throughout the year.
The Chairman noted that, overall, the evaluation had concluded 
that the Board remained of a high calibre and was functioning 
well, with open debate and good information ﬂ ow. The individual 
assessment of Directors concluded that all continued to contribute 
effectively, devoting adequate time to their duties and being 
engaged and proactive in debate at all meetings. Each of the 
Committees was considered to have operated effectively during 
the year, with recognition that the Remuneration Committee 
had overseen the successful implementation of the new 
Remuneration Policy, the Audit Committee had overseen the 
smooth transition in external auditor, and the Nomination 
Committee had undertaken two productive rounds of recruitment. 
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
Board membership should not be fewer than ﬁ ve nor more 
than 15 Directors, save that the Company may, by ordinary 
resolution, from time to time, vary this minimum and/or 
maximum number of Directors. Directors may be appointed 
by ordinary resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed by 
the Board must retire from ofﬁ ce at the ﬁ rst Annual General 
Governance Report continued 83
Meeting (‘AGM’) after his/her appointment. A Director who 
retires in this way is then eligible for reappointment. The Board 
may appoint one or more Directors to any executive ofﬁ ce, 
on such terms and for such period as it thinks ﬁ t, and it can also 
terminate or vary such an appointment at any time. The Articles 
specify that, at every AGM, any Director who has been appointed 
by the Vesuvius Board since the last AGM and any Director who 
held ofﬁ ce at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did 
not retire at either of them, shall retire from ofﬁ ce. However, in 
accordance with the requirements of the Code, all the Directors 
will offer themselves for election or re-election at this year’s 
AGM. The biographical details of the Directors offering 
themselves for election and re-election, including details of 
their other directorships and relevant skills and experience, 
will be set out in the 2018 Notice of AGM. The biographical 
details of the Directors are also set out on pages 50 and 51. 
The Board believes that each of the current Directors is 
effective and demonstrates commitment to his or her respective 
role. Accordingly, the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the resolutions to be proposed at the 2018 AGM 
relating to the re-election of all the Directors then standing.
Directors’ Conﬂ icts of Interest
The Board has established a formal system to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conﬂ icts, or may 
possibly conﬂ ict, with the interests of the Company (situational 
conﬂ icts). Directors declare situational conﬂ icts so that they can 
be considered for authorisation by the non-conﬂ icted Directors. 
In considering a situational conﬂ ict, these Directors act in the 
way they consider would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company, and may impose limits or conditions when 
giving authorisation or subsequently if they think this is 
appropriate. The Company Secretary records the consideration 
of any conﬂ ict and records any authorisations granted. 
The Board believes that the approach it has in place for 
reporting situational conﬂ icts continues to operate effectively. 
No situational conﬂ icts were brought to the Board for 
authorisation during the year under review. 
Board Accountability
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining a system of risk management and internal control, 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks facing the Group and 
safeguard its assets. No system of internal control can provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with 
reasonable assurance that problems are identiﬁ ed on a timely 
basis and are dealt with appropriately. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control, 
including ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance controls, and 
risk management systems. The key features of the Group’s 
system of internal control are set out in the table below.

Risk Management and Internal Control – Key Features 84
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Reviewing the Effectiveness of Risk Management 
and Internal Control
The internal control system covers the Group as a whole, and 
is monitored and supported by the Group’s Internal Audit 
function, which conducts reviews of Vesuvius’ businesses and 
reports objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system of internal control and on those businesses’ 
compliance with Group policies and procedures. The Audit 
Committee receives reports from the Group Head of Internal 
Audit and reports to the Board on the results of its review.
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control, it delegates certain matters 
to the Audit Committee.
Following the Audit Committee’s review of internal ﬁ nancial 
controls and of the processes covering other controls, the Board 
annually evaluates the results of the internal control and risk 
management procedures conducted by senior management. 
This includes a self-certiﬁ cation exercise by which senior 
ﬁ nancial, operational and functional management certify 
the compliance throughout the year of the areas under their 
responsibility with the Group’s policies and procedures and 
highlight any material issues that have occurred during the year.
Since the date of this review, there have been no signiﬁ cant 
changes in internal controls or other matters identiﬁ ed which 
could signiﬁ cantly affect them.
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, the Directors 
conﬁ rm that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company, including those that 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. They have also reviewed the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal control and conﬁ rm that the 
necessary actions have been taken to remedy any control 
weaknesses identiﬁ ed during the year. 
The Group’s principal risks and how they are being managed 
or mitigated are detailed on pages 24 and 25, and the Viability 
Statement which considers the Group’s future prospects is 
detailed on page 23. Risk management and internal control 
is discussed in greater detail in the Audit Committee report.
The Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are set out on page 85. 
The Audit Committee report which describes the Audit 
Committee’s work in discharging its responsibilities, is set 
out on pages 85 to 92.
Executive Compensation and Risk
All of the independent Non-executive Directors serve on 
both the Audit and Remuneration Committees. They therefore 
bring their experience and knowledge of the activities of 
each Committee to bear when considering critical areas of 
judgement. This means that, for example, the Directors are 
able to consider carefully the impact of incentive arrangements 
on the Group’s risk proﬁ le and to ensure that the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy and programme are structured to align 
with the long-term objectives and risk appetite of the Company.
Share Capital and Voting
Disclosure of the information regarding share capital, the 
authorisation received by Directors at the AGM regarding the 
issue of shares and the authority to purchase own shares, is 
contained on page 1 18 within the Directors’ Report. There are 
no restrictions on voting contained in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. Further details are set out in the Directors’ Report 
on page 1 19.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to communicating with shareholders 
and other stakeholders in a clear and open manner, and seeks 
to ensure effective engagement through the Company’s 
regular communications, the AGM and other investor relations 
activities. The Company undertakes an ongoing programme 
of meetings with investors, which is managed by the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. The majority of 
meetings with investors are led by them. Following the 
announcement of his appointment as Chief Executive, Patrick 
André accompanied Guy Y oung and François Wanecq on the 
investor roadshows conducted to communicate the half-year 
results. Since formally taking up his Chief Executive position, 
Patrick has been continuing to meet with investors, attending 
investor conferences and meeting with market analysts. 
In advance of the 2017 AGM, we wrote to our largest 
shareholders inviting discussion on any questions they might 
like to raise and making the Chairmen of the Board, the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee available to 
meet shareholders should they so wish. In 2017 , other than 
one institutional shareholder, no requests for discussions were 
received from shareholders following this communication. 
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Committee 
Chairmen remain available for discussion with shareholders 
throughout the year on matters under their areas of 
responsibility, either through contacting the Company 
Secretary or directly at the AGM. 
The Company reports its ﬁ nancial results to shareholders twice 
a year, with the publication of its annual and half-year ﬁ nancial 
reports. In addition, to maintain transparency in performance, 
it also issued two scheduled trading updates during 2017 . 
One was published immediately prior to the 2017 AGM on 
10 May 2017 , and the second was published on 14 November 
2017 . In conjunction with these announcements, presentations 
or teleconference calls were held by the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer with institutional investors and analysts.
All Directors are expected to attend the Company’s AGM, 
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them 
about issues relating to the Group, either during the meeting or 
informally afterwards.
Governance Report continued 85
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present the 
Audit Committee Report for 2017 . The Committee works largely 
to a recurring and structured programme of activities which 
are deﬁ ned in an annual rolling Audit Committee timetable. 
Additional items are then added and the Committee agenda is 
modiﬁ ed as the year progresses, to accommodate new topics 
and priorities. Signiﬁ cant non-standard items that required 
Committee focus during the year were the appointment of 
the new external auditor and updating of the Internal Audit 
reporting process. The Committee also continued its review of 
‘deep dive’ topics during the year, covering deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes and cyber security. 
Following the completion of the formal audit tender in 2016, 
and the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
in May 2017 , the Committee oversaw the seamless transition of 
the external audit from KPMG LLP to PwC during the year. PwC 
followed a detailed transition plan, focused on gaining a good 
understanding of the Group and establishing contact with key 
management and local personnel. The Committee received 
regular updates on progress against this plan and beneﬁ ted 
from PwC’s insights into the Group’s risk control framework as 
they conducted their initial meetings and reviews.
During the year, the approach to internal audit was updated to 
allow for clearer focus at the Audit Committee on key control 
issues, albeit that the overall scope and coverage of the annual 
Internal Audit plan remained as broad as in previous years. 
Internal audits are now identiﬁ ed by separate designations – 
Compliance & Control (‘C&C’), or Effectiveness & Efﬁ ciency 
(‘E&E’). C&C audit activities focus entirely on internal ﬁ nancial 
control and key Board compliance issues, with the E&E audits 
examining a broader constituency of business performance 
issues. The Audit Committee receives detailed feedback on 
any issues identiﬁ ed in C&C audit activity, and more general 
oversight of the results of E&E audit activity. The latter highlight  
broader performance issues identiﬁ ed by the Internal Audit 
team for management response and remediation.
The Audit Committee Report describes the work of the 
Committee during the year including its role in monitoring 
the integrity of the Company’s ﬁ nancial statements and the 
effectiveness of the internal and external audit processes. 
It provides an overview of the signiﬁ cant issues the Committee 
has considered during the year and its material judgements. 
It  also describes how the Committee fulﬁ lled its responsibilities 
to assist the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control, including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls, and risk management systems.
Y ours sincerely

Committee Members

The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all the independent Non-
executive Directors of the Company, who bring a wide range 
of ﬁ nancial and commercial expertise to the Committee’s 
decision-making and evaluation processes. Douglas Hurt is 
the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, having been appointed to these roles by the Board 
following the 2015 AGM. He was the Finance Director of IMI plc 
for nine years prior to that and has worked in various ﬁ nancial 
roles throughout his career. Douglas is also Chairman of the 
Audit Committees of Countryside Properties PLC and T ate & 
Lyle plc, and a Chartered Accountant. This background 
provides him with the ‘recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience’ 
required under the Code. The Company Secretary is Secretary 
to the Committee.
The Code and Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure 
Guidance and T ransparency Rules also contain requirements 
for the Audit Committee as a whole to have competence 
relevant to the sector in which the Company operates. 
Vesuvius’ Non-executive Directors have signiﬁ cant breadth 
of experience and depth of knowledge on matters related to 
Vesuvius’ operations, both from their previous roles and from 
their induction and other activities since joining the Board of 
Vesuvius. The Directors’ biographies on pages 50 and 51 outline 
their range of multinational business-to-business experience 
and expertise in ﬁ elds including engineering, manufacturing, 
services and logistics as well as ﬁ nancial and commercial 
acumen. The Board therefore considers that the Audit 
Committee as a whole has competence relevant to Vesuvius’ 
business sector. 
Meetings
The Committee met ﬁ ve times during 2017 . The Committee has 
also met twice since the end of the ﬁ nancial year and prior to 
the signing of this Annual Report. The Board Chairman, the 
non-independent Non-executive Director, the Chief Executive, 
the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, the Group Financial Controller, the 
Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor were all invited 
to each meeting. Other management staff were also invited to 
attend as appropriate. In preparation for their tenure as the 
new external auditor, PwC attended Audit Committee meetings 
prior to their formal appointment by shareholders at the 
2017 AGM.
In February 2017 , the Audit Committee held a preliminary 
meeting on year-end issues in advance of the ﬁ nalisation of 
the ﬁ nancial statements in early March. This approach was 
judged to be effective and has been integrated into the Audit 
Committee schedule going forward. 
Audit Committee
Governance 86
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Audit Committee meetings are conducted to promote an open 
debate, to challenge constructively signiﬁ cant accounting 
judgements, to provide guidance and oversight to management 
to ensure that the business maintains an appropriately robust 
control environment and to provide informed advice to the 
Board on ﬁ nancial matters. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee encourages open dialogue between the external 
auditors, the management team and the Head of Internal Audit 
between Audit Committee meetings to ensure that emerging 
issues are addressed in a timely manner.
During the year, as is the Audit Committee’s established 
practice, the Committee members met and discussed business 
and control matters with senior management during site visits, 
informal meetings and Board presentations. The Committee 
also met privately with the Head of Internal Audit, and the 
external auditor without any executives present.
The outcomes of Audit Committee meetings were reported to 
the Board and all members of the Board received the agenda, 
papers and minutes of the Committee.
Role and Responsibilities
The main role and responsibilities of the Committee continue to 
be to: 
>  Monitor the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements of the 
Company and the Group, and any formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance, informing the 
Board of the outcome of the audit 
>  Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
ﬁ nancial controls and the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems
>  Establish and review procedures for detecting fraud, systems 
and controls for the prevention of bribery and oversee the 
Company’s arrangements for employees to raise concerns 
about possible wrongdoing in ﬁ nancial reporting or other 
matters 
>  Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
Internal Audit function
>  Make recommendations to the Board on the appointment,

The Committee operates under formal terms of reference 
approved by the Board, which were reviewed during the year. 
They are available in the Investors/Corporate Governance 
section of the Company’s website, www.vesuvius.com. 
Within these terms, the Committee and its individual members 
are empowered to obtain outside legal or other independent 
professional advice at the cost of the Company. These powers 
were not utilised during the year. The Committee may also 
secure the attendance at its meetings of any employee or other 
parties with relevant experience and expertise should it be 
considered necessary.
Activities in 201 7
1.  The Committee’s agenda covered the usual standing items – the review 
of ﬁ nancial results, the effectiveness of the Group’s internal ﬁ nancial 
controls, and the review of the internal control and risk management 
systems – as well as non-standard items, including oversight of the 
transition of the external audit from KPMG to PwC.
2.  The Audit Committee continued to devote time to ensure that initiatives 
to mitigate potential risks and ﬁ nancial exposure remained robust and 
appropriate. The Committee challenged the adequacy of inventory and 
receivables provisions, the assumed growth rates and discount rates used 
for asset impairment assessments, as well as the accounting for and 
presentation of the Group-wide restructuring programme undertaken 
in response to the challenging conditions within our end-markets. 
3.  The Committee considered the Company’s going concern statement and 
challenged the nature, quantum and assessment of the signiﬁ cant risks 
to the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity of the 
Group that were modelled as part of the scenarios and stress testing 
undertaken to support the Viability Statement made by the Company in 
the 2016 Accounts. The 2017 Viability Statement, which was also critically 
reviewed, is contained within the Strategic Report and can be found on 
page 23.
4.  The Committee monitored the resourcing and delivery of the 2017 Internal 
Audit plan and approved the 2018 Internal Audit plan. The Committee 
monitored both the responses from and follow-up by management to 
Internal Audit recommendations arising during the year and, where 
necessary, the Committee tasked management to verify their successful 
closure within deﬁ ned timescales. 
5.  The Committee  examined speciﬁ c audit issues such as tax matters, 
including the judgements inherent in the partial recognition of deferred 
tax assets for US tax losses and undertook  ‘deep dive’ reviews of cyber 
security and the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements. 
6.  The Committee considered the impact of new accounting standards 
including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from 
contracts with customers – and reviewed the implementation plan for 
these in the 2018 ﬁ nancial year. Based on an assessment of these 
standards, the Group does not believe there will be a signiﬁ cant impact 
on its Group Financial Statements.
The Committee members believe that they received sufﬁ cient, 
relevant and reliable information throughout the year from 
management and the external auditor to enable the Committee 
to fully discharge its responsibilities. The work of the Audit 
Committee is further elaborated in the paragraphs below. 
Statement of compliance with the Competition and 
Markets Authority (‘CMA’) Order
The Committee considers that the Company has complied with 
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (Article 7 . 1 ), 
published by the CMA on 26 September 2014, including with 
respect to the Audit Committee’s responsibilities for agreeing 
the audit scope and fees and authorising non-audit services.
Audit Committee continued 87
Financial Reporting
The Committee fulﬁ lled its primary responsibility to review 
the integrity of the 2017 half-year and 2017 annual ﬁ nancial 
statements and recommended their approval to the Board. 
The Committee also reviewed the two trading updates released 
during the year. 
In forming its views, the Committee assessed: 
>  The quality, acceptability and consistency of the accounting 
policies and practices 
>  The clarity and consistency of the disclosures, including 
compliance with relevant ﬁ nancial reporting standards and 
other reporting requirements 
>  Signiﬁ cant issues where management judgements and/or 
estimates had been made that were material to the reporting 
or where discussions had taken place with the external 
auditor in arriving at the judgement or estimate 
>  In relation to the overall Annual Report, whether the Annual 
Report and Accounts taken as a whole was fair, balanced and 
understandable, taking into consideration all the information 
available to the Committee
>  The application of the FRC’s guidance on clear and concise 
reporting 
>  The disclosure and presentation of alternative performance 
measures, in view of the new guidance from the European 
Securities and Markets Association
The Committee actively deliberated and challenged reports 
from the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and Group Financial Controller. 
These were well prepared and, for areas of judgement and/or 
estimation, set out the rationale for the accounting treatment 
and disclosures, and the pertinent assumptions and the 
sensitivities of the estimates to changes in the assumptions. 
PwC also delivered memoranda for the half-year and year-end, 
stating their views on the treatment of signiﬁ cant issues. PwC 
provided a summary for each issue, including its assessment 
of the prudence of management’s judgements or estimates. 
The Committee considered the overall level of prudence applied 
this year, compared this with the prior year and concluded that it 
remained unchanged. 
Signiﬁ cant Issues and Material Judgements
The Committee considered the following signiﬁ cant issues in 
the context of the 2017 ﬁ nancial statements. It considered 
these areas to be signiﬁ cant taking into account the level 
of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by 
management. The Committee resolved that the judgements 
and estimates made on each of the signiﬁ cant issues detailed 
below were appropriate and acceptable.
Income T ax
Income tax remains a complex area where signiﬁ cant 
judgements are required to estimate both uncertain tax 
liabilities and the value of deferred tax assets. 
The Committee challenged the assumptions used to arrive at 
the £34.3m (2016: 34.9m) provided for income tax payable 
which includes £23.2m (2016: £24.5m) for uncertain tax 
provisions as set out in Note 10.5. After discussions with internal 
tax experts and considering the results of recent tax audits and 
the views of the external auditors, the Committee concurred 
with management’s judgement.
At the end of 2017 , the Group recognised a US deferred tax 
asset of £32.6m (2016: £65.9m). The Group has signiﬁ cant 
additional tax losses and other temporary differences in the 
US and elsewhere which have not been recognised, which are 
kept under review. The recognition of deferred tax assets for 
tax losses and other temporary differences is a highly technical 
area and the Committee has drawn on internal experts to 
understand the treatment. The future prospects for US 
proﬁ tability were carefully modelled by management and 
challenged by the Committee, as was the impact of the 
signiﬁ cant tax reform announced in late December 2017 in the 
US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘TCJA’).  The Committee particularly 
noted that this reform had a material impact on the Group’s 
deferred tax position, and of itself caused a write-down in 
Vesuvius’ US deferred tax asset of £25.7m which, in addition to 
other normal movements in the year and exchange revaluation, 
resulted in the signiﬁ cant decrease in the value of this asset in 
2017 .  The Committee also noted that, as there is uncertainty in 
how some of the provisions of TCJA will operate, subsequent 
guidance issued by US T reasury may impact Vesuvius’ reported 
tax position. The Committee reviewed the Group’s projections 
for trading in the US which had improved in 2017 , and 
concurred with management that the US forecast proﬁ ts are 
considered sufﬁ cient to sustain the deferred tax asset in the 
US at the end of 2017 .
Other Provisions
The Committee has been made aware of a number of potential 
exposures and claims arising from ongoing litigation, product 
quality issues, employee disputes, restructuring, environmental 
matters, onerous leases, indirect tax disputes and indemnities 
or warranties outstanding for disposed businesses. Due to 
the long gestation period before settlement can be reached, 
provisioning for these items requires careful judgement in 
order to establish a reasonable estimate of future liabilities. 
The Committee also assessed the strength of any insurance 
coverage for certain of these liabilities and challenged the 
accounting treatment for any amounts deemed to be 
recoverable from insurers. Subsequent to this challenge, certain 
insured liabilities have been represented in the balance sheet 
on a gross basis. After due consideration and challenge, with 
expert advice sought in certain areas, the Committee is satisﬁ ed 
that there are appropriate levels of provisions set aside to settle 
third-party claims and disputes (Note 32) and that adequate 
disclosure has been made under International Accounting 
Standards (IAS) 1 (paragraph 129) in respect of estimation 
uncertainties that might impact the accounts in the following 
Governance 88
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
ﬁ nancial year. Where the outcome of an existing issue is 
uncertain, or where no reliable estimate of the potential liability 
can be made, no provision has been made and appropriate 
disclosure is included under contingent liabilities (Note 34).
Restructuring Charges
The Group restructuring programme continued in 2017 in 
response to the structural changes in the end-markets that we 
serve. The Committee critically reviewed the treatment of the 
restructuring costs disclosed as separately reported items in 
2017 and concluded that these have been treated consistently 
with the accounting policy. This ensures that only signiﬁ cant 
restructuring programmes that have a deﬁ ned scope and are 
material in nature are reported separately, which enables the 
reader more clearly to understand the underlying results of 
the Group.  
Impairment of Intangible Assets
The year-end carrying value of goodwill of £643.2m was tested 
against the current and planned performance of the Steel 
and Foundry cash-generating units (CGUs). The Committee 
challenged both the determination of the relevant CGUs, the 
planned and terminal growth assumptions as well as the 
discount rates used in the assessments and the relevant 
sensitivities that were evaluated. The detailed assumptions, 
provided in Note 17 , reﬂ ect both a reduction in global risk-free 
rates offset by the impact of the increasing contribution from 
the Group’s operations in emerging markets.
The Committee considered the Board-approved medium-term 
business plans, the range of industry longer-term projections 
and expert views on discount rates. Given that the models 
indicated that there remains signiﬁ cant headroom between the 
value in use and the carrying value, the Committee concurred 
that no goodwill impairment charges were required. 
Working Capital Provisions
The Committee challenged the level of provisions held against 
both receivables and inventories (Notes 18 and 19) and, 
after reviewing ageing analyses, regional analyses and 
speciﬁ c customer accounts, concluded that the provisions 
held were appropriate.
Pensions
Determining the current value of the Group’s future pension 
obligations requires a number of assumptions. The 
appropriateness of assumptions used (described in Note 28) 
was questioned by the Committee, as small changes in the 
assumptions could have material effects and bond yields in 
particular have been volatile. The assumptions made by 
management for each of the major schemes were compared 
by PwC with other similar schemes. The Committee agreed 
the reasonableness of the assumptions.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Reporting
The Committee considered all the information available to 
it in reviewing the overall content of the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the process by which it was compiled and 
reviewed, to enable it to provide advice to the Board that the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. In doing 
so, the Committee ensured that time was again dedicated to 
the drafting and review process so that internal linkages were 
identiﬁ ed and consistency was tested. The Committee 
welcomed the attention that had been paid in the 2017 Annual 
Report to explain further the strategy, markets, execution 
priorities and business model of the Group. Drafts of the Annual 
Report and Accounts were also reviewed by a senior executive 
not directly involved in the year-end process who reported to the 
Committee on his impressions of clarity, comprehensiveness, 
balance and disclosure in the document. On completion of the 
process, the Committee was satisﬁ ed that it could recommend 
to the Board that the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
As highlighted in the reviews of strategy and principal risks in the 
Strategic Report, risk management is inherent in management’s 
thinking and is embedded in the business planning processes of 
the Group. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing 
and maintaining a system of risk management and internal 
control, and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Audit 
Committee assists the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal control, including ﬁ nancial, 
operational and compliance controls, and risk management 
systems. This framework is consistent with the Code. 
As part of its review of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, the Committee supported the Board in its review 
of risks in 2017 . As in previous years, a bottom-up mapping of 
the risks was constructed and reviewed in each major business 
unit, delivering a risk register that was then reviewed by the 
Head of Internal Audit, to deliver a coordinated picture of the 
key operational risks identiﬁ ed by the business. In conjunction 
with this, all the members of the Committee and the Board 
contributed their individual views of top-down strategic risks 
facing the Group into this process – drawing on the broad 
commercial and ﬁ nancial experience gained both inside and 
outside the Group. This information was collated by the Head 
of Internal Audit into a paper for discussion in the context of 
the Group’s identiﬁ ed principal risks. This was reviewed and 
discussed at the Board, and, taking note of the Board’s 
comments, subsequently by the Group Executive Committee. 
In monitoring the overall process, Committee members also 
fully participated in the Board review of existing risks and 
ongoing mitigating actions. The Committee determined that 
this approach once again enhanced the Group’s process for 
identifying and understanding the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties, which are set out on pages 24 and 25. 
The Committee continues to consider that this process is robust 
and appropriate.
Audit Committee continued 89
The Committee considered the Company’s going concern 
statement and challenged the nature, quantum and 
combination of the unlikely but signiﬁ cant risks to the business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity of the Group 
that were modelled as part of the scenarios and stress testing 
undertaken to support the Viability Statement. As part of this 
review, the Committee considered the Group’s forecast funding 
position over the next three years and analysed the impact of 
various scenarios based upon pertinent key risks faced by the 
Group and with reference to the Group’s debt covenants. 
The scenarios considered the impact of multiple risks occurring 
simultaneously and additional mitigating actions that the 
Group could take. The Committee noted that the Group’s debt 
proﬁ le had improved in terms of maturity with the completion of 
a new placement of €100m USPP Notes, and that the resultant 
debt headroom was sufﬁ cient to accommodate the modelled 
stress scenarios. As a result of their review, the Committee was 
satisﬁ ed that the going concern and Viability Statements had 
been prepared on an appropriate basis. The 2017 going 
concern statement is contained in the Directors’ Report on 
page 1 17 and the 2017 Viability Statement is contained within 
the Strategic Report and can be found on page 23.
The Committee also maintains a programme of in-depth 
reviews into speciﬁ c ﬁ nancial, operational and regulatory areas 
for the business. These reviews allow the Committee to meet 
with the business colleagues responsible for these areas and 
gain greater in-depth understanding about key areas for the 
Group. In 2017 , the Committee undertook ‘deep dive’ reviews 
of  pensions and cyber security. The former provided the 
Committee with a detailed overview of the Group’s principal 
liabilities under deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes and the steps that were 
being taken to manage these, noting that de-risking roadmaps 
are in place for each of the funds. The cyber review covered the 
assessment of the Group’s cyber security risks, the operation of 
the Group’s Cyber Security Steering Committee and the actions 
that were being taken throughout the organisation to improve 
cyber security.  It was noted that improvements had been seen 
in overall cyber awareness following two successful training 
campaigns and that plans were in place to allocate additional 
resources to cyber security during 2018.
In addition, the Committee reviewed the draft UK T ax Strategy 
disclosure, noting that this had been prepared for publication 
on the Group’s website in line with statutory requirements, 
and recommended that it be approved by the Board.
The key features of the Group’s internal control system, 
which provides assurance on the accuracy and reliability of 
the Group’s ﬁ nancial reporting are detailed in the Governance 
Report on page 83. During 2017 , the Committee considered 
the process by which management evaluates internal controls 
across the Group. The Head of Internal Audit provided the 
Committee with a summary overview of the assurance provided 
by the Group’s control framework and the testing of these 
controls. PwC also reviewed controls in the businesses within the 
scope of its audit. This review indicated an appropriate control 
environment, with identiﬁ ed improvement actions under careful 
management by the Group.
The Group is made up of several large operating units, but 
also many small units in geographically diverse locations. 
Consequently, segregation of duties, overlapping access 
controls on systems and remote management oversight can 
give rise to control vulnerabilities and fraud opportunities. 
The Group has not adopted a common Enterprise Resource 
Planning system as a Group-wide standard. Over time, 
management intends to move to more sharing of services, 
enabled by process and systems standardisation between 
businesses. This is likely to improve the overall internal controls 
in the smaller operating units. 
The Group undertakes a range of activities to mitigate the risk 
of fraud. This framework is regularly reviewed to determine 
areas for improvement. In assessing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls, the Committee considered the following 
initiatives which had been implemented over the past two years:
>  The publication of a revised Group authority matrix to 
emphasise a clear assignment of responsibilities 
and authorities 
>  A continued focus by regional ﬁ nance directors and the 
central ﬁ nance team on balance sheet reconciliations;
>  The ongoing review by Internal Audit of the separation of 
duties and access rights at operating entities, to ensure that no 
one person is in sole control of all aspects of any transaction, 
to mitigate the risk of fraud
>  An updated employee vetting process for prospective senior 
employees in higher-risk countries
>  Ongoing internal communications on the heightened risk 
of social-engineering fraud, coupled with increased cyber 
security training to raise awareness of the use of malware 
>  The formation of a cyber security working group, to focus 
on enhancing the Group’s resilience to cyber risks
Eliminating the risk of fraud remains one of the key areas of 
focus for Internal Audit, forming a fundamental part of ‘full 
scope’ and ﬁ nancial audits. These assess the quality of the 
balance sheet reconciliation, review key judgement matters, 
consider ERP access rights, review tenders and quotations, 
review the entity’s controls over master data changes, and 
controls over payments and associated applications.
During 2017 the Group continued its review of third-party 
representatives and intermediaries. This included detailed due 
diligence for active sales agents and, where required, updates 
to the contractual basis on which these agents are engaged. 
The review will be extended to other third-party representatives 
and intermediaries during 2018. The Committee continued its 
assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to bribery and 
corruption risks, noting the ongoing work conducted by the 
Group in this context, such as face-to-face visits to operations, 
providing focused, country-speciﬁ c training and reviewing 
ﬁ nancial records, sometimes with the assistance of external 
advisers. The output of these processes and previous risk 
assessments continue to be used to develop Group policies and 
procedures for the management of anti-bribery and corruption 
risk, reﬂ ecting an appropriate level of control for the business.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
The Committee continues to monitor and oversee procedures 
regarding allegations of improper behaviour and employee 
complaints. Further details of the operation of the Group’s 
Speak-Up policy and helpline can be found in the ‘Our 
Principles’ section. Throughout the year the Audit Committee 
received updates on the volume of reports, key themes emerging 
from these reports and the results of investigations undertaken. 
Each year the senior ﬁ nancial, operational and functional 
management of the businesses self-certify compliance with 
Group policies and procedures for the areas of the business 
under their responsibility and conﬁ rm the existence of adequate 
internal control systems throughout the year. The Committee 
reviews any exceptions noted in this bottom-up exercise.
After considering these various inputs, the Committee was 
able to provide assurance to the Board on the effectiveness 
of internal ﬁ nancial control within the Group, and on the 
adequacy of the Group’s broader internal control systems. 
Internal Audit
The Group’s Internal Audit function operates on a global basis 
through professionally qualiﬁ ed and experienced individual 
members located around the world, including an auditor with 
specialist IT knowledge. They report to the Head of Internal 
Audit, based in London, who in turn reports directly to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
During the year the approach to internal audit was updated, 
with audit activities subdivided into two different categories: 
Compliance & Control (‘C&C’), and Effectiveness & Efﬁ ciency 
(‘E&E’). C&C audit activities focus entirely on internal ﬁ nancial 
control and key Board compliance issues, whereas the E&E 
audit activities examine a broader constituency of business 
performance issues. Characterising the audit process in this way 
enables the Audit Committee to concentrate more speciﬁ cally 
on key control issues for resolution, with reporting focused on 
C&C audit activity, and more general commentary provided 
on the outcome of E&E audit activities. The detailed outcomes 
of E&E audits are then used to engage management on the 
broader performance issues identiﬁ ed by the Internal Audit 
team. During the year, the frequency of meetings between the 
Head of Internal Audit and the Business Unit Presidents was 
also increased, to ensure that engagement on the resolution 
of issues is clearly understood at all levels of the business and 
responsibility for remediation taken accordingly.
The Committee received, considered and approved the 2017 
Internal Audit plan which was constructed using a risk-based 
approach to cover the Group’s control environment. The plan 
was based on the premise that all operating units are internally 
audited at least once in every three-year period, whilst 
maintaining a focus on smaller operating units. A third of 
operating units are now subject to internal audit twice in every 
three-year period, and Internal Audit annually audits each 
of  the large operating entities located in Germany, the US, 
China, Mexico and Brazil. During the year the Committee also 
considered and approved changes to the Internal Audit plan as 
required. These changes meant that the Internal Audit coverage 
was greater than in previous years and audits were carried out 
with more in-depth analysis across legal entities and operating 
units. In addition, in 2017 many project-based reviews were 
also undertaken. 
In 201 7 , a total of 56 audit assignments, including three 
unplanned audits, were undertaken by Internal Audit, covering 
65% of the Group’s revenue and 60% of the Group’s proﬁ t 
before tax. The Committee received a ‘dashboard’ from the 
Head of Internal Audit at each of its meetings, detailing 
progress against the agreed plan and identifying key trends 
and ﬁ ndings from Internal Audit reports, along with progress on 
the resolution of actions agreed. Common themes emerging 
from Internal Audit reports were discussed and these 
discussions have informed the compilation of the 2018 Internal 
Audit plan. When necessary Internal Audit uses external 
outsourced auditors to supplement Internal Audit on an ad-hoc 
basis. The outsourcing process provides valuable learning 
opportunities and we expect to continue to use outsourcing 
in specialist areas and geographies in the future.  Where control 
issues or other problems are ﬂ agged by the ﬁ eldwork, they are 
recorded in a live web-based database into which management 
and operational entities are required to report progress 
against audit exceptions. In this way, Internal Audit monitors 
the progress and adequacy of the remediation steps taken. 
Additionally, regular meetings are held with each business unit 
President to discuss the progress against high-priority issues. 
Consequently, the Committee has oversight of appropriate and 
timely actions taken by the responsible management. The Audit 
Committee also involved senior management as necessary to 
provide an update against high-priority actions and Internal 
Audit provided follow-up reviews as required, to ensure that 
there was clarity on the responsibility for delivery of solutions to 
the audit ﬁ ndings. In situations where audit ﬁ ndings required 
longer-term solutions, the Committee oversaw the process for 
ensuring that adequate mitigation actions were taken while 
permanent solutions are pursued.
During the year, a review was undertaken of the effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function. The review, which canvassed the 
views of Non-executive Directors and senior management, 
conﬁ rmed that the Internal Audit function continued to operate 
to a high standard, with a good understanding of the business 
and an appropriate scope. Respondents noted the high degree 
of energy, professionalism and independence exhibited by the 
function, and welcomed the steps that had been taken to 
improve the interface with the management of each of the 
business units.
Having considered the work of the Internal Audit function 
during 2017 , including progress against the 2017 Internal 
Audit plan, the quality of reports provided to the Committee, 
and the results of the review of the function’s effectiveness, 
the Committee concluded that the Internal Audit function 
operated effectively during 2017 .
Audit Committee continued 91
External Audit
Auditor Appointment
In 2016, the Committee undertook a tender process to 
appoint a new statutory auditor for the ﬁ nancial year ending 
31 December 2017 . The tender culminated in the appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) as external auditor 
and the appointment of Mazars LLP to audit the non-material 
entities within the Group. As a result, KPMG concluded its tenure 
as the Group’s external auditor during the year and, further to 
the approval of the Company’s shareholders at the 2017 AGM, 
PwC was appointed as the Group’s external auditor for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 . PwC nominated Julian Jenkins as 
the audit partner responsible for the Group audit. In line with the 
regulations on auditor rotation, the external audit contract will 
be put out to tender at least every ten years. In addition, PwC 
will be required to rotate the audit partner every ﬁ ve years.
Auditor T ransition and 2017 Audit Plan
PwC’s transition plan focused on exiting the non-audit services 
that PwC provided to the Group, and working with people from 
across the business to build on their understanding of the Group 
and reﬁ ne the planned approach to the audit. Key elements of 
the transition plan included: meeting with senior management, 
local management, key functional heads and wider business 
stakeholders to gain insight into the business; meeting with 
KPMG and performing a detailed review of their working papers; 
attending Committee meetings prior to the formal appointment; 
undertaking a risk assessment to identify signiﬁ cant and 
elevated audit risks; and formulating and communicating a 
detailed audit plan. During the year PwC provided regular 
updates to the Committee on the status and progress of the 
auditor transition plan, and valuable insights into the Group’s 
audit environment from the results of their review. 
In February 2018, the Audit Committee held a preliminary 
meeting on year-end issues in advance of the ﬁ nalisation of 
the ﬁ nancial statements in early March. During the year, private 
sessions were held with PwC without management being 
present, covering reporting and control issues in the context of 
the resourcing of the Group Finance team. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee met on a number of occasions with PwC to 
monitor the progress of the audit and discuss questions as they 
arose. The strength of the ﬁ nance teams across the Group was 
also considered. In these sessions PwC conﬁ rmed that its work 
had not been constrained in any way and that it was able to 
exercise appropriate professional scepticism and challenge 
throughout the audit process. 
The Independent Auditors’ Report provided by PwC on pages 
124 to 129 includes PwC’s assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement in the accounts. These risk areas are discussed 
in the signiﬁ cant issues and material judgements comments 
above. The report also summarises the scope, coverage and 
materiality levels applied by PwC in its audit. As part of the audit 
planning process and based on a detailed risk assessment, the 
Committee agreed a materiality ﬁ gure of £7 .6m for Group 
ﬁ nancial reporting purposes which is higher than last year 
(£4.0m) and, in line with similar groups, is set at 5% of headline  
proﬁ t before tax of £152.9m. Importantly, much lower levels of 
materiality are used in the audit ﬁ eldwork on the individual 
businesses across the Group and these lower ﬁ gures drive the 
scope and depth of audit work. Any misstatement at or above 
£0.4m was reported to the Committee. 
There were no signiﬁ cant changes this year to the coverage of 
the audit which stood at 68% of the Group’s revenue and 76% of 
headline proﬁ t before tax. This coverage was considered to be 
sufﬁ cient by the Committee. The audit coverage is reﬂ ective 
of the long tail of smaller businesses within the Group that 
individually are not ‘material’ to the Group result.
The PwC audit fee approved by the Audit Committee was 
£1.3m. This was constructed bottom-up on a local currency 
basis and was assessed in light of the audit work required by the 
agreed materiality level and scope. It was agreed as part of the 
audit tender process and updated for changes in scope that 
were required during the year. The fee approved by Mazars for 
the audit of the non-material entities was £0.4m, resulting in a 
combined fee with PwC of £1.7m, compared to £2.0m paid to 
KPMG LLP in 2016. The reduction in fee follows from the tender 
and the utilisation of two audit ﬁ rms. The Committee noted the 
ruling by the Securities Exchange Board of India regarding the 
prohibition placed on PwC network companies performing 
audits of listed entities for two years from 1 January 2018.  The 
Committee is watching developments on this matter carefully in 
the context of the Group’s two listed Indian subsidiaries Foseco 
India Limited and Vesuvius India Limited.
Independence and Objectivity
The Committee is responsible for safeguarding the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors in 
order to ensure the integrity of the external audit process. In 
discharging this responsibility during 2017 , the Committee:
>  Sought regular conﬁ rmation from the incumbent external 
auditor that it considered itself to be independent of the 
Company in its own professional judgement, and within 
the context of applicable professional standards
>  Evaluated all the relationships between the external auditor 
and the Group, including compliance with the Group’s policy 
on the employment of former employees of the external 
auditor, to determine whether these impaired, or appear to 
impair, the auditor’s independence 
>  Reviewed compliance against the policy on the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor 
>  Reviewed details of the non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor and associated fees 
The Committee noted that, in Sweden, a non-permitted service 
had been performed by PwC during the transition process, 
being supporting compliance in respect of payroll taxes. Given 
the de minimis nature of the fee incurred and balances involved, 
the Committee concluded that the conduct of this work had not 
affected PwC’s independence.
As a result of its review the Committee concluded that PwC 
remained appropriately independent.

Non-audit Services
Vesuvius operates a policy for the approval of non-audit 
services. This was revised in 2016, with the new policy applying 
to the audit of the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2017 and 
for ﬁ nancial years thereafter. A copy is available to view on the 
‘Investors/Corporate Governance’ section of the Company’s 
website, www.vesuvius.com. Group companies are not 
permitted to use the external auditor for any “prohibited 
non-audit services” as speciﬁ ed by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC’s) Revised Ethical Standard 2016, unless subject 
to a permitted derogation. The restrictions broadly prohibit 
external auditors’ involvement in tax services, any services 
that involve playing a part in management decision-making, 
preparing accounting records, designing or implementing 
internal control/risk management services or ﬁ nancial systems, 
certain HR services and other legal, investment and share-
dealing services. The external auditor can be invited to provide 
non-audit services which, in its position as external auditor, it 
must or is best placed to undertake and which do not impact 
auditor objectivity or independence. All audit-related and 
permissible non-audit services proposed to be carried out for 
any Group company worldwide by the external auditor must be 
pre-approved by the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, who thereafter 
will refer matters to be further approved by the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee or the full Audit Committee before an 
engagement is agreed. Any assignment proposed to be carried 
out by the external auditor must also have cleared the external 
auditor’s own internal pre-approval process to conﬁ rm the 
ﬁ rm’s ethical ability to do the work. 
In practice, the Group did not seek to engage PwC for non-audit 
services during 2017 unless there were compelling advantages 
to doing so. In 2017 , the fees for non-audit services payable to 
PwC amounted to £0. 1m, similar to the non-audit fees of £0. 1m 
payable to KPMG LLP last year . The 201 7 fees represent  payment 
for assurance services related to the review of the Company’s 
half-year ﬁ nancial statements and quarterly reviews and tax 
accounts in India (required by regulation). T ax compliance and 
other non-audit services were for the previously mentioned 
Swedish service, and the transition of expatriate tax services to 
the new outsourced provider. 
Effectiveness and Reappointment of PwC for 2018
The Committee and the Board are committed to maintaining 
the high quality of the external audit process. Throughout the 
year the Committee assessed the performance of the external 
auditor, taking into consideration: 
>  The quality of reports provided to the Committee, and the 
quality of issues and challenges raised with the Committee 
and with management across the Group
>  The level of insight exhibited in the feedback they provided 
as part of the transition process
>  Management’s assessment of the transition process
>  Their deﬁ nition and completion of the 2017 audit plan
>  Their performance during their review of the 2017 half 
year results
>  The effectiveness of their relationship with the Committee, 
with management and with Internal Audit
>  Feedback from the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and Group 
Financial Controller on the quality of local audit teams
The Committee also considered the FRC’s Audit Quality 
Inspection of PwC published in June 2017 .
A process to formally assess PwC’s performance in respect 
of the 2017 ﬁ nancial year will be completed following the 
completion of their year-end work, taking account of the 
guidance for audit committees prepared by the FRC. As part 
of this review, PwC will be asked to identify any issues they 
consider could pose a risk to audit quality.
In an initial assessment of PwC’s performance during their ﬁ rst 
year of audit, the Committee concluded that PwC had provided 
an effective audit for 2017 . They had exhibited a good 
understanding of the Group’s businesses and internal control 
environment (based on a signiﬁ cant process of engagement 
with the business as part of audit transition) and had provided 
sound feedback to the Committee on the product of their 
transition work. They had established effective working 
relationships with the Committee and with management, and 
had exhibited an appropriate level of professional scepticism 
and robust challenge of management’s judgements as 
appropriate. The Committee has therefore recommended to 
the Board that PwC be reappointed for 2018. It conﬁ rms that its 
recommendation is free from the inﬂ uence of any third party 
and that there are no contractual restrictions on the choice of 
auditor. A resolution proposing the reappointment of PwC is 
included in the notice of AGM for 2018.
Audit Committee Evaluation
The Audit Committee’s performance was evaluated as part 
of the overall externally facilitated Board and Committee 
performance evaluation, which is described in depth on page 
82. The performance of the Committee was rated highly, with 
its oversight seen to be of a very high standard. A number of 
areas of focus had been identiﬁ ed by the 2016 evaluation and it 
was felt that these had all been managed effectively in 2017 . 
The transition of the external auditor had progressed smoothly 
and the institution by the Audit Committee Chairman of more 
regular meetings with management outside formal Committee 
meetings had enhanced the ﬂ ow of information with the 
Committee. The ‘deep dive’ initiative had once again proved 
useful in providing the Committee with detailed information 
on key topics and would be continued in 2018, and the 
implementation of an additional Audit Committee meeting 
early in the year end cycle had been positively received, and 
would be continued.

Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Nomination Committee, I am pleased to 
present the Nomination Committee Report for 2017 . 
The primary responsibility of the Nomination Committee is to 
focus on Board succession planning to ensure that the Board is 
made up of individuals with the appropriate drive, abilities and 
experience to lead the Company in the delivery of its strategy. 
In 2017 the Committee presided over the appointment of a new 
Chief Executive as part of a planned succession process for 
François Wanecq, who retired from his role as Chief Executive at 
the end of August 2017 . We also appointed a new independent 
Non-executive Director, Holly Koeppel, in April 2017 , who 
strengthens the Board in terms of its knowledge, skills and 
experience, replacing Nelda Connors who stepped down 
from the Board in late 2016. 
The Committee reviews the current and future needs of the 
Board and its Committees on an ongoing basis. In line with this, 
during 2017 , the Committee reviewed the tenure of all of the 
Directors and discussed future Board rotation. 
In additon, as part of the annual corporate governance 
review conducted each year, the Committee examines the 
independence of the Board and the balance of skills, and 
development needs, of Board members. The output from this 
process was used to deﬁ ne the recruitment requirements for the 
new Directors, with each then having a job speciﬁ cation drawn 
up to target the attributes required. 
The Committee’s succession planning activities do not 
exclusively relate to the Board, but also encompass the 
senior management levels immediately below the Board. 
The Committee is working to support and encourage the 
growth of a consistent pool of talent able to step up to the top 
roles in future years. The oversight of senior management 
succession planning and talent development will be a key area 
for emphasis in 2018. 
During 2017 the Board formalised its approach to diversity, 
and approved a Board Diversity Policy. In line with this, the 
Committee continues to consider the mix of skills, experience 
and knowledge required on the Board, and to promote diversity 
not only on the Board but also throughout the wider business.
Y ours sincerely

The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is made up of myself as Chairman 
of the Company and any three of the Non-executive Directors. 
During the year I continued as Chairman of the Committee, 
though I would not act as Chairman if the Committee was 
considering the appointment of my successor. In that case, the 
Chairman would be an appropriate Non-executive Director. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. 
Members’ biographies are set out on pages 50 and 51. 
Key Activities during the Y ear
>  Completion of Chief Executive recruitment: The Committee 
completed the Chief Executive succession process which 
culminated in the selection and recommended appointment 
of Patrick André as Chief Executive, succeeding François 
Wanecq on his retirement from the Company 
>  Non-executive appointment: The Committee led the search 
for a new Non-executive Director resulting in the selection 
and recommended appointment of Holly Koeppel
>  Board composition: The Committee reviewed the skills, 
knowledge and experience required for the Board to 
continue to function effectively, and evaluated the current 
Board composition against an assessment of these future 
business needs 
>  Board succession: The Committee reviewed the ongoing 
requirements for Board rotation to maintain the correct skills, 
experience and diversity at Board level
>  Directors’ elections: The Committee considered the Directors’ 
annual re-election at the 2017 AGM
>  Committee evaluation: The Committee reviewed its 
performance and effectiveness during 2017
Role and Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee’s foremost priorities are to ensure 
that the Company has the best possible leadership, maintains 
a clear plan for orderly Executive and Non-executive Director 
succession, and cultivates the appropriate skills, experience and 
diversity in the Board’s overall composition. Its primary focus is 
therefore on the strength of the Board, for which appointments 
are made on merit, against objective criteria, selecting the best 
candidate for the post. The Nomination Committee advises the 
Board on appointments, retirements and resignations from the 
Board and its Committees.
Nomination Committee
Governance 94
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference 
which were reviewed and conﬁ rmed during the year. 
The terms of reference are available on the Group’s website 
www.vesuvius.com.
The Committee and its members are empowered to obtain 
outside legal or other independent professional advice at the 
cost of the Company in relation to its deliberations. These rights 
were not exercised during the year. The Committee may also 
secure the attendance at its meetings of any employee or other 
parties it considers necessary.
Process for Board Appointments
The Committee follows formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedures for the appointment of new Directors. When 
considering a Board appointment, the Nomination Committee 
draws up a speciﬁ cation for the role, taking into consideration 
the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of its existing 
members, the diversity of the Board, the independence of 
continuing Board members, and the ongoing requirements and 
anticipated strategic developments of the Group. The search 
process is then able to focus on appointing a candidate with 
the necessary attributes to enhance the Board’s performance. 
The Committee uses the services of search ﬁ rms to identify 
appropriate candidates, ensuring that any selected ﬁ rm is not 
in any way conﬂ icted in the delivery of its role. In addition, the 
Committee will only use those ﬁ rms that have adopted the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and 
best practice in search assignments. 
During 2017 , the Committee oversaw a selection process to 
identify a new Chief Executive to succeed François Wanecq 
on his retirement from the Company, and the ongoing search 
for a new Non-executive Director, following Nelda Connors’ 
retirement from the Board in 2016. The Committee reviewed 
the skills and attributes required for each role, and agreed 
individual job speciﬁ cations. The Committee utilised the 
services of specialist recruitment agencies to search for suitable 
candidates – Korn Ferry to identify prospective candidates 
for the Chief Executive role, and Spencer Stuart to search for 
a new Non-executive Director. Both agencies have adopted 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct, and neither have any 
other connection with the Group other than in respect of 
management recruitment work undertaken during normal 
trading activities. Each agency was selected for their 
assignment following a review of potential agencies based 
on their skills, expertise and price. 
Chief Executive
As part of the Group’s ongoing senior management succession 
planning processes, a detailed independent review of internal 
candidates was undertaken, to consider candidates for 
succession to the role of Chief Executive, with those individuals 
identiﬁ ed as potential candidates fully integrated by Korn Ferry 
into the search process. The Nomination Committee also 
engaged external assistance to benchmark the skills and 
experience required for the Chief Executive role, deﬁ ning the 
issues fundamental to the Vesuvius role, given the Group’s 
business, scale, geographical diversity, performance and 
the stage of its development. The search was conducted 
globally and a long-list of potential appointees was produced, 
including external, internal, international and female 
candidates. The Committee reviewed the long-list and a 
shortlist of candidates for interview was drawn up for the 
role, based upon the objective criteria identiﬁ ed at inception. 
The Chairman, and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee interviewed an initial short-list of candidates, 
with a shorter list of candidates then interviewed by the 
Senior Independent Director and again by the Chairman. 
The two ﬁ nal  preferred candidates then met with all the 
other Board members. Finally, detailed external references 
were taken up and following this the Committee made formal 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of 
Patrick André as the new Chief Executive. Patrick André was 
supported in undertaking due diligence on the Company 
in areas not connected to his previous role as President 
Flow Control.
Non-executive Director
The search was conducted globally and a long-list of potential 
appointees was produced by Spencer Stuart. The Committee 
reviewed the long-list and a short-list of candidates for interview 
was drawn up, based upon the objective criteria identiﬁ ed at 
inception. The Chairman and the Chief Executive interviewed 
the short listed candidates, and the preferred candidate then 
met with all other Board members. Detailed external references 
were taken up and, following this, the Committee made a 
formal recommendation to the Board for the appointment of 
Holly Koeppel as a new Non-executive Director. Holly Koeppel 
was supported in undertaking her own due diligence on the 
Company and meeting with its advisers. She was also required 
to demonstrate that she had sufﬁ cient time available to devote 
to the role and to identify any potential conﬂ icts of interest. No 
conﬂ icts were identiﬁ ed. 
Following their appointment, the Committee has continued to 
monitor the development and integration onto the Board of the  
two new Directors. Holly Koeppel and Patrick André both 
undertook a full induction programme and have continued to 
gain insight into the business and meet executives throughout 
the organisation. 
Board Composition
On an ongoing basis, the Committee reviews the current and 
future needs of the Board and its Committees – reﬂ ecting on 
the balance of skills and experience of current Directors, 
and comparing this against the Board’s list of key skills. 
The Committee also considers existing lengths of tenure and 
the prospective rotation and retirement of Board members, so 
that it can plan accordingly. As part of the annual corporate 
Nomination Committee continued 95
Governance
governance review conducted during the year, the Committee 
examined the independence of the Board and the balance of 
skills, and development needs of Board members. Based on 
this analysis in 2016, the Committee concluded that the Board 
would beneﬁ t from the appointment of a new Non-executive 
Director with expert knowledge of the industrial sector, together 
with a high degree of commercial acumen and global markets 
knowledge. The Non-executive Director search identiﬁ ed 
above was commenced on this basis. In addition, the 
Nomination Committee considered the future needs of the 
business, its corporate strategy, culture and direction in 
assessing its requirements of a new Chief Executive and used 
this analysis to inform the recruitment process. The Committee 
recognised that the business needed an individual who had 
a proven track record of enhanced strategic thinking and 
managing complexity, who also excelled at managing and 
developing relationships with a cross-section of people.
Diversity
All Directors have served at a very senior level in global 
organisations, have international experience across a variety of 
industries, and most have spent a considerable amount of time 
resident outside the UK. The Nomination Committee believes 
that diversity underpins the successful operation of the Board. 
It recognises that this is a key ingredient in creating a balanced 
culture for discussions and minimising ‘group-think’, and 
continues with its policy to review the requirements for different 
skills, experience, background and gender in respect of the 
Board’s composition. During the year, the Board formalised its 
approach to diversity, and approved a Board Diversity Policy, 
details of which are set out on page 80. The Committee will 
continue to consider the mix of skills, experience and knowledge 
required on the Board, and promote diversity not only on the 
Board but also throughout the wider business. 
Senior Management Succession 
During the year, the Committee’s succession planning activities 
did not exclusively relate to the Board, but continued to 
encompass the senior management levels immediately below 
the Board, aiming to support and encourage the growth of a 
consistent pool of talent able to step up to the top roles in future 
years. Consequently, the Committee continued to monitor the 
execution of development plans for the Group Executive 
Committee and supported the Board in understanding the 
process for the development of high potentials throughout 
the business. The Board met key executives throughout the 
Group to gain a greater understanding of the breadth and 
depth of management talent. This process included a series of 
presentations to the Board by business unit, functional and 
geographical heads providing the basis for a more informed 
approach to executive succession planning and talent 
development across the Group. As identiﬁ ed by the Board 
evaluation process, the oversight of senior management 
succession planning will be a key area for emphasis in 2018. 
Committee Evaluation 
The Committee’s activities were part of the externally facilitated 
evaluation of Board effectiveness during the year . The Committee 
was considered to have performed effectively over the past 
year and the oversight of the Chief Executive succession process 
was commented on favourably. Priorities for the Committee 
going forward include Board rotation over the longer term, 
as well as succession planning and talent development for 
senior management.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2017 , which 
sets out details of the pay received by Directors in 2017 and how 
we intend to apply our Remuneration Policy in 2018. This report 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 
AGM. In 2017 , Shareholders approved a new Remuneration 
Policy for the Group. If no changes are made prior to the 2020 
AGM, then the Company will next need to formally table a 
Remuneration Policy at that meeting. All payments received 
by Directors in 2017 were in line with our Remuneration Policy. 
I have set out details below of the key decisions made by the 
Committee during 2017 . More details about these are included 
in the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration.
Performance in 201 7
As described in the Strategic Report, 2017 was a year of 
good progress for the Group with revenue growth of 20.2% 
outperforming end markets and the global steel market. 
Despite experiencing headwinds related to rising raw material 
prices and inter-company imports required by Flow Control in 
Europe, the Group saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading 
proﬁ t, with cash generation remaining strong. Throughout the 
year, the Group remained focused on its strategic priorities 
and made good progress with the restructuring programme 
delivering increased annualised savings, strong progress in 
developing markets and further investment in R&D.
In 2017 , Annual Incentive awards for the Executive Directors 
were based 60% on Group headline earnings per share (EPS), 
20% on the Group’s cash conversion (deﬁ ned as operating cash 
ﬂ ow divided by trading proﬁ t) and 20% on speciﬁ ed personal 
objectives. In order to further align the interests of our Directors 
with those of our shareholders, we introduced a requirement 
in the 2017 Remuneration Policy for deferral of a proportion 
(normally 33%) of the Annual Incentive into awards over shares 
for three years. Given the appointment part way through 
the year of a new Chief Executive, both Mr Wanecq’s and 
Mr André’s awards, as Chief Executives, were accordingly 
pro-rated. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Overview
In 2017 , our retranslated headline EPS of 39. 1p was above the 
maximum Annual Incentive target of 35.6p. The Group’s 2017 
cash conversion of 104% was between the threshold of 90% and 
the target of 105%. This results in awards of 75% and 1 1.38% of 
base salary respectively, being  86.38% in total for the current 
Executive Directors, Patrick André and Guy Y oung, and for 
François Wanecq, in respect of the ﬁ nancial performance 
metrics. In addition, we assessed each Executive Director’s 
completion of the personal objectives they were set for 2017 , 
awarding Mr André and Mr Y oung 19.65% and 15.75% 
respectively of their maximum entitlements of 25%, and 
Mr Wanecq 15.00%. As a result, the overall Annual Incentive 
payable to Mr André for 2017 is 106.03% of base salary 
(pro-rated in respect of his service as an Executive Director), 
Mr Y oung 102. 13% of base salary, and Mr Wanecq 101.38% 
of base salary against maximum bonus opportunities of 125%. 
In addition, Mr André received an Annual Incentive payout 
of 65.04% of his pro-rated base salary for 2017 , out of a 
maximum bonus opportunity of 80%, in respect of his tenure 
as President, Flow Control prior to his appointment as Chief 
Executive. Mr Wanecq received an Annual Incentive payout 
of 106.38% of his pro-rated base salary for the period of 
service from 1 September 2017 to 31 December 2017 , when 
he had ceased to be a Director but remained as an employee 
of the Group.
The performance period for the awards made under the 
Vesuvius Share Plan in 2015 matured at the end of December 
2017 . Performance was measured equally by reference to T otal 
Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts) and headline EPS growth above compound 
annual GDP growth over the three-year period. Relative TSR 
performance was between median and upper quintile; as a 
result 27 . 1% of Performance Share awards will vest under the 
TSR element (out of a maximum 50%). The annual compound 
headline EPS growth above GDP for the period was 4.3%. 
As a result, 16.6% of Performance Share awards will vest under 
the EPS performance element (out of a maximum of 50%).

Other Key Decisions made by the Committee 
for 201 7
Key decisions made by the Committee in 2017 included:
> Review, consideration and approval of an appropriate 
remuneration package for Patrick André, our new Chief 
Executive. The principal features of his remuneration 
package were announced at the time of his appointment 
and they are included in the applicable sections of this year’s 
Remuneration Report.
> In conjunction with the transition of Chief Executive, the 
Committee also considered the retirement arrangements for 
François Wanecq. A summary of these arrangements was 
included in the Section 430(2B) statement published on the 
Company’s website, and details are also included in this year’s 
Remuneration Report.
> The Remuneration Policy approved in 2017 states that, whilst 
an individual’s performance is reviewed annually, changes to 
base salary are normally appraised over a two or three-year 
period. In line with this policy, the Committee reviewed Guy 
Y oung’s salary in 2017 . It was agreed that his salary should be 
increased by 7 .7% to £350,000 with effect from 1 January 
2018. This is the ﬁ rst increase in Guy’s salary since he joined 
Vesuvius in 2015 and reﬂ ects the considerable diligence and 
dedication he has brought to the role and his development in 
it since the time of his appointment.
> The Committee considered the structure of performance 
measures for incentives in 2018. Having reviewed the existing 
arrangements, the Committee intends to use the same 
framework for performance measures in 2018 that was used 
in 2017 for Executive Directors’ incentive awards, updating 
one of the metrics to reﬂ ect more effectively the strategic 
demands of the business. Thus, these measures reward: 
– Growth: through the EPS measure used in the Annual 
Incentive and the Vesuvius Share Plan – as in 2017 
– Effective working capital management: through an 
updated target of working capital to sales ratio (based 
on the 12-month moving average) to be used in the 
Annual Incentive 
– Delivery of shareholder value: through the TSR measure 
used in the Vesuvius Share Plan – as in 2017
> In addition, the Committee also took decisions about the 
grant and vesting of Share Plan awards in 2017 and the 
Annual Incentive Plan payments made in 2017 in respect 
of 2016.
Shareholders’ Views 
The Committee encourages dialogue with its major 
shareholders. It is satisﬁ ed that the current Remuneration Policy 
is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company, 
and that the performance-related elements of remuneration, 
which are kept under review, are transparent, stretching and 
rigorously applied. The Committee was encouraged by the 
signiﬁ cant support shown for the new Remuneration Policy 
when it was tabled at the 2017 AGM (99% of votes in favour).
I remain keen to hear shareholders’ views on remuneration 
matters and look forward to an ongoing dialogue with 
shareholders and their continued support for our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report resolution at the AGM.
Y ours sincerely

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
The Company’s existing Remuneration Policy was approved at the AGM held on 10 May 2017 . The previous policy applied in its 
entirety up until this date and after this date those elements of the previous policy that related to remuneration that remained 
extant on this date (such  as outstanding share awards) continued to apply until these commitments cease.
The full policy report, as approved by shareholders, can be found in the 2016 Annual Report (a copy of which is available under the 
Reports tab in the ‘Investors’ section of the Group website www.vesuvius.com). For the beneﬁ t of shareholders, we have reprinted 
the Policy below. T o ensure that the Policy is relevant to the 2018 ﬁ nancial year, we have made minor textual changes to refer to the 
applicable ﬁ nancial year in the following sections: Illustration of the Application of the Remuneration Policy for 2018 (which also 
contains, as described, 2017 data); and Consideration of Shareholder Views. We have amended the ‘Service contracts’ section to 
refer to the terms of the current Executive Directors and the ‘T erms of service’ section to refer to the dates of appointment of the 
current non-executive directors.  
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofﬁ ce (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments), notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy 
set out here, where the terms of the payment were agreed; (i) before the date the Company’s ﬁrst Remuneration Policy approved 
by shareholders in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act came into effect; (ii) before the policy set out here came 
into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy in force 
at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion 
of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes, ‘payments’ includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.

employees in the Group over a similar period. 
In considering any increase in base salary, 
the Committee will also consider: 
(i)  the role and value of the individual; 
(ii) changes in job scope or responsibility; 
(iii)  progression in the role (e.g. for a new 
appointee); 
(iv)  a signiﬁ cant increase in the scale of role 
and/or size, value or complexity of the 
Group; and 
(v)  the need to maintain market 
competitiveness. 
In line with the two to three-year period for 
base salary appraisal, individual increases 
when paid are likely to be in excess of those 
for the wider population of employees for 
that year .
No absolute maximum has been set for 
Executive Director base salaries. Current 
Executive Directors’ salaries are set out in the 
Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
section of this Remuneration Report.
Performance
Any increase will take into account the 
individual’s performance, contribution 
and increasing experience.
Other beneﬁ ts
Alignment/purpose
Provides normal market practice beneﬁ ts.
Operation
A range of standard beneﬁ ts including, 
but not limited to: car allowance, private

relocation allowance and expatriate beneﬁ ts, 
in some instances grossed up for tax, in 
accordance with the Group’s policies, and 
participation in any employee share scheme

can ﬂ uctuate depending on changes in 
provider, cost and individual circumstances.
Performance
None 99
Pension
Alignment/purpose
Helps to recruit and retain key employees. 
Ensures income in retirement.
Operation
An allowance is given as a percentage of 
base salary. This may be used to participate 
in Vesuvius’ pension arrangements, invested 
in own pension arrangements or taken as a 
cash supplement (or any combination of the 
above options).
Opportunity
Maximum of 30% of base salary.
Performance
None
Annual Incentive
Alignment/purpose
Incentivises Executive Directors to achieve 
key short-term ﬁ nancial and strategic 
targets of the Group.
Additional alignment with shareholders’ 
interests through the operation of 
bonus deferral.
Operation
Normally 33% of any Annual Incentive 
earned by Executive Directors will be 
deferred into awards over shares under 
the Vesuvius Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
which normally vest after at least three 
years, other than in speciﬁ ed circumstances 
outlined elsewhere in this Policy. These may 
be cash or share settled.
The Committee has the discretion to 
determine that actual incentive payments 
should be lower than levels calculated by 
reference to achievement against targets 
if it considers this to be appropriate. 
The Committee has the discretion to 
award participants the equivalent value 
of dividends accrued during the vesting 
period on any shares that vest. 
Subject to malus and clawback.
Opportunity
Below threshold: 0%. 
On-target: 62.5% of base salary. 
Maximum: 1 25% of base salary. 
Payments made between threshold 
and on-target and between on-target 
and maximum are pro-rated.
Performance
Annual Incentive is measured on targets set at 
the beginning of each year . The Committee 
establishes threshold and maximum 
performance targets for each ﬁ nancial year. 
The majority of the Annual Incentive will be 
determined by measure(s) of Group ﬁ nancial 
performance. The remainder of the Annual 
Incentive will be based on ﬁ nancial, strategic 
or operational measures appropriate to the 
individual Director . Performance is measured 
over a one-year period. Actual performance 
targets will be disclosed after the 
performance period has ended. They are 
not disclosed in advance due to their 
commercial sensitivity.
Vesuvius Share Plan
Alignment/purpose
Flexible ‘umbrella’ plan. 
Aligns Executive Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders through the delivery 
of shares. Rewards Executive Directors 
for achieving the strategic objectives of 
growth in shareholder value and earnings. 
Assists retention of Executive Directors 
over a three-year performance period. 
Operation
Awards may be granted as: 
>  Performance share awards 
>  Deferred share bonus awards 
>  Restricted share awards 
>  Market-price options 
These may be cash or share settled.
Individuals are entitled to an aggregate 
annual maximum amount of awards. 
If more than one type of award is granted, 
the individual limit for all awards is reduced 
to remain within the maximum. 
Awards vest three years after their award 
date, other than in speciﬁ ed circumstances 
outlined elsewhere in this policy, subject to 
the achievement of speciﬁ ed conditions. 
The Committee may decide that the shares in 
respect of which an award vests are delivered 
to participants at that point or that awards 
will then be subject to an additional holding 
period before participants are entitled to 
receive their shares. 
The Committee has the discretion to award 
participants the equivalent value of dividends 
accrued during the vesting period on any 
shares that vest. 
Subject to malus and clawback. 
Opportunity
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
an annual award with a face value of up 
to 200% of base salary in Performance 
share awards.
Vesting at threshold performance is 25% 
rising to vesting of the full award at maximum.
Performance
Vesting of Performance Share awards is 
usually dependent on measures of Group 
EPS and relative TSR with the precise 
measures and weighting of the measures 
determined by the Committee ahead of each 
award. These details are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
section of this Remuneration Report.
The Company reserves the right only to 
disclose EPS performance targets after the 
performance period has ended, due to their 
commercial sensitivity. 
Prior to any vesting, the Remuneration 
Committee also reviews the underlying 
ﬁ nancial performance of the Company over 
the performance period to ensure the vesting 
is justiﬁ ed.

Malus/Clawback Arrangements 
The Executive Directors’ variable remuneration is subject to 
malus and clawback provisions. These provide the Committee 
with the ﬂ exibility, if required, to withhold or recover payments 
made to Executive Directors under the Annual Incentive Plan 
(including deferred awards) and/or to withhold or recover share 
awards granted to Executive Directors under the Vesuvius 
Share Plan, including any dividends granted on such awards. 
The circumstances in which the Committee could potentially 
elect to apply malus and clawback provisions include: a 
material misstatement in the Company’s ﬁ nancial statements; 
an error in the calculation of the extent of payment or vesting of 
an incentive; gross misconduct by an individual; or signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ nancial loss or serious reputational damage to Vesuvius plc 
resulting from an individual’s conduct, a material failure of 
risk management or a serious breach of health and safety. 
These malus and clawback provisions apply for a period of 
up to three years after the end of a performance period 
(or end of the deferral period in respect of deferred awards). 
Performance Measures
In selecting performance measures for the Annual Incentive, 
the Committee seeks to reﬂ ect key strategic aims and the 
need for a rigorous focus on ﬁ nancial performance. Each year 
the Committee agrees challenging targets to ensure that 
underperformance is not rewarded. The Company will not be 
disclosing the speciﬁ c ﬁ nancial or personal objectives set until 
after the relevant performance period has ended because of 
commercial sensitivities. The personal objectives are all 
non-ﬁ nancial or job-speciﬁ c in nature and track performance 
against key strategic, organisational and operational goals. 
In selecting performance measures for the Vesuvius Share 
Plan, the Committee seeks to focus Executive Directors on 
the execution of long-term strategy and also align their 
rewards with value created for shareholders. On this basis, 
the  performance conditions for the Vesuvius Performance 
Share awards will usually be dependent on measures based 
on TSR and EPS performance.
Within the policy period, the Committee will continually review 
the performance measures used, including TSR and the 
applicable comparator group, and EPS and other ﬁ nancial 
measures, to ensure that awards are made on the basis of 
challenging targets that clearly support the achievement of 
the Group’s strategic aims.
The Committee may vary or waive any performance 
condition(s) if circumstances occur which cause it to determine 
that the original condition(s) have ceased to be appropriate, 
provided that any such variation or waiver is fair, reasonable 
and not materially less difﬁ cult to satisfy than the original 
condition (in its opinion). In the event that the Committee were 
to make an adjustment of this sort, a full explanation would be 
provided in the next Remuneration Report.
The Committee may: (a) in the event of a variation of the 
Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend or any 
other corporate event which it reasonably determines justiﬁ es 
such an adjustment, adjust; and (b) amend the terms of 
awards granted under the share schemes referred to above 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plans. 
Share awards may be settled by the issue of new shares or 
by the transfer of existing shares. In line with prevailing best 
practice at the time this Policy Report was approved, any 
issuance of new shares is limited to 5% of share capital over a 
rolling ten-year period in relation to discretionary employee 
share schemes and 10% of share capital over a rolling ten-year 
period in relation to all employee share schemes. 
Remuneration Policy continued 101
Illustration of the Application of the Remuneration 
Policy for 2018
The charts below show the total remuneration for Executive 
Directors for 2018 for minimum, on-target and maximum 
performance. The ﬁ xed elements of remuneration comprise 
base salary, pension and other beneﬁ ts, using 2018 salary data. 
The assumptions on which they are calculated are as follows:
Minimum: Fixed remuneration only. 
On-target: Fixed remuneration plus on-target Annual Incentive 
(made at 62.5% of base salary for Patrick André and 
Guy Y oung) and threshold vesting (i.e. median performance 
for TSR and threshold for EPS) for Performance Share awards 
(made at 200% of base salary for Patrick André and 150% of 
base salary for Guy Y oung) under the Vesuvius Share Plan. 
Maximum: Fixed remuneration plus maximum Annual Incentive 
(being full achievement of ﬁ nancial and personal targets, made 
at 125% of base salary for Patrick André and Guy Y oung) and 
100% vesting for Performance Share awards (made at 200% 
of base salary for Patrick André and 150% of base salary for 
Guy Y oung) under the Vesuvius Share Plan.
Note: In addition the Committee retains the discretion to award dividends 
(either shares or their cash equivalent) on any shares that vest.
Service Contracts of Executive Directors
The Committee will periodically review the contractual terms 
for new Executive Directors to ensure these reﬂ ect best practice. 
Service contracts currently operate on a rolling basis and are 
limited to a 12-month notice period. 
Patrick André is employed as Chief Executive of Vesuvius plc 
pursuant to the terms of a service agreement made with 
Vesuvius plc dated 17 July 2017 . Guy Y oung is employed as 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer pursuant to the terms of a service 
agreement with Vesuvius plc dated 16 September 2015. 
Each Executive Director’s appointment is terminable by 
Vesuvius on not less than 12 months’ written notice, and by each 
Executive Director on not less than six months’ written notice. 
External Appointments of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors do not currently serve as Non-executive 
Directors of any other quoted company. Subject always to 
consent being granted by the Company for them to take up such 
an appointment, were they to so serve, the Company would 
allow them to retain any fees they received for the performance 
of their duties.

Remuneration Policy for Non-executive Directors
The Company seeks to appoint Non-executive Directors who have relevant professional knowledge, and have gained experience 
in a relevant industry and geographical sector, to support diversity of expertise at the Board and match the wide geographical 
spread of the Company’s activities.
Non-executive Directors attend Board, Committee and other meetings, held mainly in the UK, together with an annual strategy 
review to debate the Company’s strategic direction. All Non-executive Directors are expected to familiarise themselves with the 
scale and scope of the Company’s business and to maintain their speciﬁ c technical skills and knowledge.
The Board sets the level of fees paid to the Non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director 
and the practice of other companies of a similar size and international complexity. The Non-executive Directors do not participate 
in Board discussions on their own remuneration. No variable remuneration is available to Non-executive Directors. Non-executive 
Directors receive reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending the Board, Committee and other ad hoc meetings, 
including gross up payments to cover any personal tax owed on such expenses.
T erms of Service of the Chairman and other Non-executive Directors
The terms of service of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are contained in letters of appointment. Each Non-executive 
Director is appointed subject to their election at the Company’s ﬁ rst Annual General Meeting following their appointment and 
re-election at subsequent Annual General Meetings. During the ﬁ rst year of his/her appointment, the Chairman is entitled to 
12 months’ notice from the Company; thereafter, he/she is entitled to six months’ notice from the Company. None of the other 
Non-executive Directors is entitled to receive compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce at any time. All Non-executive Directors are subject 
to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The current policy is for 
Non-executive Directors to serve on the Board for a maximum of nine years, with review at the end of three and six years, 
subject always to mutual agreement and annual performance evaluation. The Board retains discretion to extend the tenure of 
Non-executive Directors beyond this time, subject to the requirements of Board balance and independence being satisﬁ ed.
Fees
Alignment/purpose
T o attract and retain Non-executive Directors 
of the necessary skill  and experience by 
offering market-competitive fees. 
Operation
Fees are usually reviewed every other 
year by the Board. 
Non-executive Directors are paid a base 
fee for the performance of their role, 
payable in cash, plus additional fees for 
Committee chairmanship or acting as 
the Senior Independent Director . 
The Chairman is paid a single fee and 
receives administrative support from 
the Company.
Opportunity
Non-executive Directors and the Chairman 
will be paid market-appropriate fees,  with 
any increase reﬂ ecting changes in the market 
or adjustments to a speciﬁ c Non-executive 
Director’s role. 
No eligibility for bonuses, retirement beneﬁ ts 
or to participate in the Group’s employee 
share plans. 
Base fees paid to Non-executive 
Directors will in aggregate remain within 
the aggregate limit stated in our Articles, 
currently being £500,000.

Recruitment Policy
On appointment or promotion of a new Executive Director, 
the Committee will typically use the Remuneration Policy in 
force at the time of the Committee’s decision to determine 
ongoing remuneration. 
Base salary levels will generally be set in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy current at the time of the Committee’s 
decision, taking into account the experience and calibre of the 
appointee. If it is appropriate to appoint an individual on a base 
salary initially below what is adjudged to be market positioning, 
contingent on individual performance, the Committee retains 
the discretion to realign base salary over the one to three years 
following appointment, which may result in a higher rate of 
annualised increase than might otherwise be awarded under 
the policy. If the Committee intends to rely on this discretion, 
it will be noted in the ﬁ rst Remuneration Report following 
an individual’s appointment. Other than in exceptional 
circumstances, other elements of annual remuneration will, 
typically, be set in line with the Remuneration Policy including a 
limit on awards under the Annual Incentive and Vesuvius Share 
Plan of 325% of salary in aggregate. The Committee retains 
the discretion to make the following further exceptions:
>   In the event that an internal appointment is made, or where 
a Director is appointed as a result of transfer into the Group 
on an acquisition of another Company, the Committee 
may continue with existing remuneration provisions for this 
individual, including pension entitlements, where appropriate
>   If necessary and appropriate to secure the appointment 
of a candidate who has to move locations as a result of the 
appointment, whether internal or external, the Committee 
may make additional payments linked to relocation, 
above those outlined in the policy table, and would 
authorise the payment of a relocation allowance and 
repatriation, as well as other associated international 
mobility terms. Such beneﬁ ts would be set at a level which 
the Committee considers appropriate for the role and the 
individual’s circumstances
>   If appropriate the Committee may apply different 
performance measures and/or targets to a Director’s 
ﬁ rst incentive awards in his/her year of appointment
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those 
for the existing Executive Directors, summarised in the ‘Service 
contracts of Executive Directors’ section above. 
In addition to the annual remuneration elements noted above, 
the Committee may consider buying out terms, incentives and 
any other compensation arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer that an individual forfeits in accepting 
an appointment with Vesuvius. The Committee will have the 
authority to rely on Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) or to apply the 
existing limits within the Vesuvius Share Plan to make Restricted 
Share awards on recruitment. In making any such awards, 
the Committee will review the terms of any forfeited awards, 
including, but not limited to, vesting periods, the expected value 
of such awards on vesting and the likelihood of the performance 
targets applicable to such awards being met, while retaining 
the discretion to make any buy-out award the Committee 
determines is necessary and appropriate. The Committee may 
also require the appointee to purchase shares in Vesuvius to a 
pre-agreed level prior to vesting of any such awards. The value 
of any buy-out award will be capped, to ensure its maximum 
value is no higher than the value of the awards that the 
individual forfeited on joining Vesuvius. Any such awards will 
be subject to malus and clawback.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or 
Non-executive Director, appointment terms will be consistent 
with those applicable at the time the appointment is agreed. 
Variable pay will not be considered. With respect to 
Non-executive Directors, fees will be consistent with the 
policy at the time the appointment is agreed. If, in exceptional 
circumstances, a Non-executive Director was asked to assume 
an interim executive role, the Company retains the discretion 
to pay them appropriate executive compensation, in line 
with the policy.
Exit Payment Policy
Vesuvius has the option to make a payment in lieu of part or all 
of the required notice period for Executive Directors. Any such 
payment in lieu will consist of the base salary , pension contributions 
and value of beneﬁ ts to which the Director would have been 
entitled for the duration of the remaining notice period, net of 
statutory deductions in each case. Half of any payments in lieu 
of notice would be made in a lump sum, the remainder in equal 
monthly instalments commencing in the month in which the 
midpoint of their foregone notice period falls (and are reduced 
or extinguished by salary from any role undertaken by the 
departing Executive in this time). Executive Directors are subject 
to certain non-compete covenants for a period of nine months, 
and non-solicitation covenants for a period of 12 months, 
following the termination of their employment. Their service 
agreements are governed by English law.
Governance 104
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Executive Directors’ contracts do not contain any change of 
control provisions; they do contain a duty to mitigate should 
the Director ﬁ nd an alternative paid occupation in any period 
during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation 
on early termination.
The table below summarises how the awards under the 
annual bonus and Vesuvius Share Plan are typically treated 
in different leaver scenarios and on a change of control. 
Whilst the Committee retains overall discretion on determining 
‘good leaver’ status, it typically deﬁ nes a ‘good leaver’ in 
circumstances such as retirement with agreement of the 
Company, ill health, disability, death, redundancy, or part of 
the business in which the individual is employed or engaged 
ceasing to be part of the Group. Final treatment is subject to 
the Committee’s discretion. 
Event Timing Calculation of vesting/payment
Annual Incentive Plan
Good leaver Paid at the same time as to continuing 
employees.
Annual bonus is paid only to the extent 
that any performance conditions have been 
satisﬁ ed and is pro rated for the proportion 
of the ﬁ nancial year worked before cessation 
of  employment.
Bad leaver Not applicable. Individuals lose the right to their annual bonus.
Change of control Paid on the effective date of change 
of control.
Annual bonus is paid only to the extent that 
any performance conditions have been 
satisﬁ ed and is pro rated for the proportion 
of the ﬁ nancial year worked.
Vesuvius Share Plan
Good leaver On normal vesting date (or earlier at 
the Committee’s discretion).
Unvested awards vest to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed 
and a pro rata reduction applies to the value 
of the awards to take into account the 
proportion of vesting period not served, unless 
the Committee decides that the reduction in 
the  number of vested shares is inappropriate.
Bad leaver Unvested awards lapse. Unvested awards lapse on cessation 
of employment.
Change of control
1
On the date of the event. Unvested awards vest to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed 
and a pro rata reduction applies for the 
proportion of the vesting period not served.
Note:
1.  In certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that unvested awards under the V esuvius Share Plan will not vest on a change of control but will instead be replaced 
by an equivalent grant of a new award, as determined by the Committee, in the new company .
In the case of the Vesuvius Deferred Share Bonus Plan if the 
individual leaves for any reason (other than dismissal for cause) 
or in the event of a change in control, the deferred award will 
vest in full, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
Beneﬁ ts normally cease to be provided on the date employment 
ends. However, the Committee has the discretion to allow some 
minor beneﬁ ts (such as health insurance, tax advice and 
repatriation expenses) to continue to be provided for a period 
following cessation where this is considered fair and reasonable 
or appropriate on the basis of local market practice. In addition, 
the Committee retains discretion to fund other expenses for the 
Executive Director, for example, payments to meet legal fees 
incurred in connection with termination of employment, or to 
meet the costs of providing outplacement support, and de 
minimis termination costs up to £5,000 to cover transfer of 
mobile phone or other administrative expenses. 
The Committee reserves the right to make any other 
payments in connection with a Director’s cessation of ofﬁ ce or 
employment where the payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation) or by way of a compromise or 
settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation 
of a Director’s ofﬁ ce or employment. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new 
contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors 
including (but not limited to) settlement, conﬁ dentiality, 
restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements. 
These would be used only where the Committee believed it 
was in the best interests of the Company to do so. 
Remuneration Policy continued 105
Comparison of Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors with that for other Employees
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is designed 
in line with the remuneration philosophy set out in this report 
– which also underpins remuneration for the wider Group. 
Remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors draw on 
the same elements as those for other employees – base salary, 
ﬁ xed beneﬁ ts and retirement beneﬁ ts – with performance-
related pay extending down into the management cadres and 
beyond. However, given that remuneration structures for other 
employees need to reﬂ ect both seniority and local market 
practice, they differ from the policy for Executive Directors. 
In particular, Executive Directors receive a higher proportion 
of their remuneration in performance-related pay and 
share-based payments. Individual percentages of ﬁ xed 
versus variable remuneration and participation in share-based 
structures decline as seniority decreases.
The process for delivering salary increases on a two to 
three-year cycle for Executive Directors is also applied to 
other members of the Group Executive Committee and their 
direct managerial reports. Whilst all employees receive an 
annual performance appraisal, other employees continue to 
receive salary reviews on an annual basis.
As with Executive Directors, middle and senior managers 
participate in the Annual Incentive Plan. For members of the 
Group Executive Committee and functional employees, 
the award is predominantly based on Group performance, 
with the remainder awarded against achievement of personal 
objectives. For operational employees, any potential award 
is based upon achieving three measures relating to Group 
performance, business unit performance, and individual 
achievement of personal objectives. 
All members of the Group Executive Committee participate in 
the Vesuvius Share Plan and receive awards of Performance 
Shares, which vest in accordance with measures and targets set 
against EPS and TSR. The level of awards granted to members 
of the Group Executive Committee who don’t serve on the 
Board are lower than those payable to the Executive Directors.
For certain senior and middle managers, awards are made 
under the Vesuvius Medium T erm Plan (‘MTP’). These managers 
participate in the MTP at varying percentage levels, and 
awards are based on the same measures and targets as the 
Annual Incentive Plan. Senior managers have their MTP awards 
made over Vesuvius shares, whilst middle managers receive 
their awards in cash. In each case, awards are granted following 
the end of the relevant ﬁ nancial year. The MTP share awards 
vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to 
continuing employment. 
Consideration of Conditions elsewhere in the Group 
in Developing Policy
The Company does not consult directly with employees on 
Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements. However, 
the Remuneration Committee will take into account the pay 
and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly 
when determining base salary increases, when the Committee 
will consider the salary increases for other Group employees in 
the same jurisdiction. 
Consideration of Shareholder Views
Vesuvius is committed to open and transparent dialogue with 
its shareholders on remuneration as well as other governance 
matters. As Chairman of the Committee, Jane Hinkley 
welcomes shareholder engagement and is available for any 
discussions investors wish to have on remuneration matters. 
During 2017 , remuneration matters were discussed at a number 
of meetings with investors. The feedback from such meetings is 
always shared with the Committee and taken into consideration 
when decisions are made about future remuneration strategy 
and arrangements.
Shareholding Guidelines
The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors 
to build and hold a shareholding in the Company. The required 
holding of the Chief Executive is to be equivalent in value to at 
least 2x salary and that required of other Executive Directors 
is to be equivalent in value to at least 1x salary. 
Compliance with the shareholding policy is tested at the end of 
each year for application in the following year using the average 
of the closing prices of a Vesuvius ordinary share for the trading 
days in that December.
General
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy 
set out in this Policy Report (for regulatory, exchange control, 
tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change 
in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for 
that amendment.

Meetings
The Committee met ﬁ ve times during the year. The Group’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Human Resources Ofﬁ cer 
were invited to each meeting, together with Christer Gardell, our 
non-independent Non-executive Director, though none of them 
participated in discussions regarding their own remuneration. 
In addition, a representative from Deloitte, the Remuneration

Committee, giving critical insight into the operational demands 
of the business and their application to the overall remuneration 
strategy within the Group. In receiving views on remuneration 
matters from the Executive Directors and senior management, 
the Committee recognised the potential for conﬂ icts of interest 
to arise and considered the advice accordingly. The Chairman 
of the Committee reported the outcomes of all meetings to 
the Board.
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference 
which were reviewed during the year. The terms of reference 
are available on the Group website www.vesuvius.com. 
The Committee members are permitted to obtain outside 
legal advice at the Company’s expense in relation to their 
deliberations. These powers were not exercised during the year. 
The Committee may also secure the attendance at its meetings 
of any employee or other parties it considers necessary.
Role and Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for:
> Determining the overall remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors including the terms of their service agreements, 
pension rights and compensation payments
> Setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary
> Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of 
remuneration for senior management, being the ﬁ rst layer 
of management below Board level and their direct reports
> Overseeing the operation of the executive share incentive plans
Advice Provided to the Remuneration Committee
Deloitte is appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee 
to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including 
remuneration structure and policy, updates on market practice 
and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation 
of share incentive plans. The Committee appointed Deloitte, 
a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of 
Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in 
the UK, following a formal tender process in 2014. Deloitte also 
provides the Remuneration Committee with ongoing calculations 
of total shareholder return (TSR) to enable the Committee to 
monitor the performance of long-term share incentive plans. 
In addition in 201 7 , within the wider Group, Deloitte was procured 
in various jurisdictions to provide accounting and tax advisory 
work. During 201 7 , Deloitte’s fees for advice to the Remuneration 
Committee, charged on a time spent basis, amounted to £71,975. 
The Committee conducted a review of the performance of 
Deloitte as remuneration adviser during the year and concluded 
that Deloitte continued to provide effective, objective and 
independent advice to the Committee. No conﬂ ict of interest arises 
as a result of other services provided by Deloitte to the Group.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee 
The key matters the Remuneration Committee considered 
during its ﬁ ve meetings in 2017 included:
> Considering, formulating and approving the remuneration 
arrangements for the new Chief Executive
> Agreeing the retirement arrangements for the outgoing 
Chief Executive
> Considering and approving the 2018 salary review proposals 
for the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and reviewing proposals for 
senior management, as appropriate
> Reviewing and approving achievement against performance 
targets for the 2016 annual incentive arrangements
> Setting performance targets and approving the structure of 
the 2017 annual incentive arrangements 
> Reviewing and assessing the Company’s attainment of 
performance conditions applicable to the Vesuvius 
Performance Share awards made in 2014
> Setting the performance measures and targets, and 
authorising the grant of new awards in 2017 under the 
Vesuvius Share Plan and Medium T erm Incentive Plan
> Considering the Company’s ongoing share sourcing 
requirements to meet obligations under the Company’s share 
plans, and funding of the ESOP
> In the light of advice received from the external advisers and 
trends in remuneration practice and governance, discussing 
the Company’s overall approach to executive remuneration 
and reviewing whether any changes should be made
> Reviewing the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference 
> Approving the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
reviewing the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report 107
As in previous years, the Committee was the subject of an 
externally moderated performance evaluation. The performance 
of the Remuneration Committee was rated positively overall. 
Several items had been identiﬁ ed in the 2016 evaluation, and it 
was noted that these had been effectively managed in 2017 , 
with, in particular, the Committee gaining greater insight into 
the remuneration arrangements for employees below the senior 
management tier and global remuneration policies. Going 
forward, communication was identiﬁ ed as an area of focus, 
with the Committee expressing the view that the appointment 
of the new Chief Executive should be taken as an opportunity to 
review the level of dialogue between the Committee Chairman, 
management and the external advisers. In addition, as with the 
Board in general, it was felt that the Remuneration Committee 
would beneﬁ t from the more concise presentation of data in 
Committee papers.
Regulatory Compliance
The Remuneration Policy, which is set out on pages 98 to 105 
was prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
It also meets the requirements of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and 
T ransparency Rules. This Remuneration Report sets out how the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code are applied 
by the Company in relation to matters of remuneration. We 
have complied for the year under review with these provisions. 
Share Usage
Under the rules of the Vesuvius Share Plan, the Company has 
the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of T reasury 
shares or other existing shares, or by the allotment of newly 
issued shares. Awards made under the Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan, to satisfy shares awarded to Directors under the Annual 
Incentive, and awards made to senior managers by the 
Company over shares pursuant to the Medium T erm Incentive 
Plan, must be satisﬁ ed out of Vesuvius shares held for this 
purpose by the Company’s employee share ownership plan 
trust (ESOP). The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by 
the Remuneration Committee which considers the most prudent 
and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
At 31 December 2017 , the Company held 7 ,271, 174 ordinary 
shares in T reasury and 877 ,744 ordinary shares in the ESOP . 
The ESOP can be gifted T reasury shares by the Company, can 
purchase shares in the open market or can subscribe for newly 
issued shares, as required, to meet obligations to satisfy options 
and awards that vest.
The Vesuvius Share Plan complies with the current Investment 
Association guidelines on headroom which provide that overall 
dilution under all plans over a rolling ten-year period should 
not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital, with 
a further limitation over a rolling ten-year period of 5% for 
discretionary share schemes. More than 9.9% of the 10% limit 
and more than 4.9% of the 5% limit is available as headroom for 
the issue of new shares or the transfer of T reasury shares for the 
Company. No T reasury shares have been transferred or newly 
issued shares allotted under the Vesuvius Share Plan during the 
year under review.
Policy Implementation
The following section provides details of how the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy was implemented during the ﬁ nancial year

Note:
1.  Patrick André joined the Board on 1 September 2017. Figures in the table relate to salary, beneﬁ ts and Annual Incentive earned in respect of the period 1 September 
– 31 December 2017.
2.  François Wanecq stepped down from the Board on 31 August 2017, and retired from the Company on 31 December 2017. Figures in the table relate to salary, 
beneﬁ ts and Annual Incentive earned in respect of his employment as Chief Executive pro-rated for the period from the beginning of the ﬁ nancial year to 31 August 
2017. Also included in the table is the full value of his Vesuvius Share Plan award due to vest in 2018 based on performance over the performance period 2015-2017 
(see footnote 8 for more details).
3.  Base salary (or fees, as appropriate) earned in relation to services as a Director during the ﬁ nancial year.
4.  The UK regulations require the inclusion of beneﬁ ts for Directors where these would be taxable in the UK on the assumption that the Director is tax resident in the 
UK. The ﬁ gures in the table therefore include expense reimbursement and associated tax relating to travel, accommodation and subsistence in connection with 
attendance at Board meetings and other Board business during the year , which are considered by HMRC to be taxable in the UK. Beneﬁ ts for Executive Directors 
include car allowance, private medical care, relocation expenses, tax advice, commuting costs, school fees and de minimis amounts for Directors’ spouse’s travel and 
administrative expenses, and beneﬁ ts incurred in connection with François Wanecq’s retirement. 
5.  Patrick André and Guy Young receive a pension allowance of 25% of base salary. François Wanecq received a pension allowance of 30% of base salary. The ﬁ gures 
in the table represent the value of all cash allowances and contributions received in respect of pension beneﬁ ts.
6.  The sum of total salary, taxable beneﬁ ts and pension.
7.  This ﬁ gure includes any Annual Incentive payments made to the Executive Directors in relation to services as a Director in the year under review. See pages 109 to

8.  This represents the Performance Share award granted to François Wanecq in 2015 under the Vesuvius Share Plan, that is due to vest in 2018. See Note 6 of the 
Vesuvius Performance Share Awards Allocations table on page 113. At an average Vesuvius mid-market closing share price (from 1 October 2017-31 December 
2017) of 580 pence, the total value of the awards that are due to vest, along with the cash payment for the dividend that has accrued on these vested shares was 
£609,364.
9.  The sum of the value of the Annual Incentive and the long-term incentives where the performance period ended during the ﬁ nancial year.
10.  The sum of base salary, beneﬁ ts, pension, Annual Incentive and long-term incentives where the performance period ended during the ﬁ nancial year.
11.  Holly Koeppel joined the Board on 3 April 2017. 
Additional note:
12.   Total 2016 Director remuneration for the Directors who served during 2016 was £2.255m. This included fees of £34k and taxable beneﬁ ts of £8k paid to Nelda 
Connors in 2016. Nelda retired from the Board on 30 September 2016.
Remuneration for the Former Chief Executive – 
Audited
François Wanecq stepped down as an Executive Director and 
Chief Executive on 31 August 2017 and, to assist the transition of 
ofﬁ ce to the new Chief Executive, he continued in employment 
receiving his salary, beneﬁ ts and pension allowance, totalling 
£471k, until he retired from the Company on 31 December 2017 . 
François Wanecq remained entitled to be considered for an 
Annual Incentive in respect of services rendered in the calendar 
year 2017 . It was agreed that the amount payable, if any, 
would be calculated and paid in 2018 at the same time as other 
Executives, and at a maximum would equal 125% of his base 
salary in 2017 . Calculation and payment of the 2017 Annual 
Incentive was subject to the Company’s achievement of the 
ﬁ nancial targets, and his achievement of his personal objectives 
for this period (see Annual Incentive section below). The Annual 
Incentive earned in relation to the period 1 September – 
31 December 2017 totalled £209k, being 106% of his base 
salary for this period.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee exercised its 
discretion to treat François Wanecq as a good leaver for the 
purposes of the Vesuvius Share Plan, retaining his right to the 
awards granted in 2015 in full (as he was employed by Vesuvius 
for the full performance period) and those granted in 2016 and 
2017 on a pro-rated basis. The vesting of all these awards is 
subject to the achievement of the applicable performance 
criteria over the full performance period, the rules of the 
Vesuvius Share Plan, and the approval of the Remuneration 
Committee. The extent of vesting of the 2016 and 2017 awards 
will be determined by the Remuneration Committee in 2019 
and 2020. Details of the vesting of François Wanecq’s 2015 
award, the extent of which has already been determined by 
the Remuneration Committee, are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration table and also detailed in the Longer-term Pay 
section below.
Under the applicable company relocation policy, François 
Wanecq has received one month’s salary as a relocation 
allowance. In addition, the Company conﬁ rmed in the Section 
Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration continued 109
430(B) Statement that it would pay his removal costs, the 
reasonable costs of any international tax advice required in 
connection with his retirement from employment and any tax 
support to meet his ongoing obligations to correctly report 
income received from the Company for a three-year period 
following his retirement. In addition, the Statement conﬁ rmed 
that the Company will also pay de minimis administrative 
expenses and beneﬁ ts incurred in connection with his 
retirement.
No further termination payment will be made to Mr Wanecq.
There were no payments made to any Director for loss of ofﬁ ce 
during the year ended 31 December 2017 , and no payments 
were made to any other past Directors of the Company during 
the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
Base Salary and Fees
In the year under review, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer received 
a base salary of £325,000 per annum. François Wanecq 
received a base salary of £590,000 per annum, and following 
his promotion to Chief Executive, Patrick André received a base 
salary of £525,000 per annum. The Non-executive Directors’ 
fees were set at £45,000 per annum. Supplementary fees of 
£15,000 per annum were paid to the Chairmen of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees. A supplementary annual fee 
of £5,000 was also paid to the Senior Independent Director. 
The Chairman was paid an annual fee of £185,000. Neither the 
Chairman nor the other Non-executive Directors are members 
of the Group’s pension plans, nor do they participate in the 
Group’s incentive schemes.
In line with the Group’s longer-term approach of reviewing the 
salaries of Executive Directors and senior Executives every 
two to three years, Guy Y oung’s base salary was reviewed for 
application in 2018. This was the ﬁ rst time his base salary 
had been reviewed since he joined the Company in 2015 and, 
following this review, it was resolved that his salary should be 
increased by 7 .7%, with effect from 1 January 2018, up to 
£350,000 per annum, in recognition of his leadership of the 
Group’s Finance function over the past three years and his 
development in the role. In considering this increase, the 
Committee also noted that over the previous two years the 
average salary increase for UK salaried employees had been 
3.36%. Following his recent promotion, there is no change to 
Patrick André’s salary in 2018, but, as announced at the time 
of his appointment, the Remuneration Committee has 
committed to review his salary annually for the ﬁ rst three 
years of his appointment (January 2019, 2020 and 2021 ). 
Pension Arrangements – Audited
In accordance with their service agreements, Patrick André 
and Guy Y oung are entitled to pension allowances of 25% 
of base salary. (François Wanecq was entitled to a pension 
allowance of 30% of base salary up until the date of his 
retirement.) This allowance can be used to participate in 
Vesuvius’ pension arrangements, be invested in their own 
pension arrangements or be taken as a cash supplement 
(or any combination of these alternatives). 
Annual Incentive
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an Annual 
Incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary, based 
on achievement against speciﬁ ed ﬁ nancial targets and 
personal objectives. Each year the Remuneration Committee 
establishes the performance criteria for the forthcoming year. 
The ﬁ nancial targets are set by reference to the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial budget. The target range is set to ensure that Annual 
Incentives are only paid out at maximum for signiﬁ cantly 
exceeding performance expectations. The Remuneration 
Committee considers that the setting and attainment of 
these targets is important in the context of achievement of 
the Company’s longer-term strategic goals. 
The Annual Incentive has a threshold level of performance 
below which no award is paid, a target level and a maximum 
performance level at which a maximum award is earned. 
2017 Annual Incentive
For 2017 the maximum Annual Incentive potential for the 
Executive Directors was 125% of base salary and their target 
Annual Incentive potential was 62.5% of base salary. Following 
his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 September 2017 , it 
was agreed that Patrick André would participate in the Annual 
Incentive at these incentive levels with effect from that date. 
With respect to his service with the Group prior to that date 
he remained entitled to receive any payouts due under the 
Flow Control business unit Annual Incentive Plan. 
Following his retirement as a Director, François Wanecq 
remained entitled to be considered for an Annual Incentive in 
respect of services rendered in the calendar year 2017 . It was 
agreed that the amount payable, if any, would be calculated 
and paid in 2018 at the same time as other Executives.
For the ﬁ nancial year 2017 the Executive Directors’ Annual 
Incentives were based 60% on Group headline earnings 
per share, 20% on the Group’s cash conversion (deﬁ ned as 
operating cash ﬂ ow divided by trading proﬁ t) and 20% on 
speciﬁ ed personal objectives. 
Financial T argets
The 2017 Vesuvius Group headline earnings per share 
performance targets set out below were set at the December 
2016 full-year average foreign exchange rates, being the rates 
used for the 2017 budget process: 
Threshold: 
30.4 pence
On-target: 
33.0 pence
Maximum: 
35.6 pence
The 2017 Group’s cash conversion targets were set as follows:
Threshold: 
90%
On-target: 
105%
Maximum: 
120%
In assessing the Group’s performance against these targets, the 
Committee uses a constant currency approach. Thus, the 2017 
full-year EPS performance was retranslated at December 
2016 full-year average foreign exchange rates to establish 
performance. This is consistent with practice in previous years.
Governance 11 0
Vesuvius plc
Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
In 201 7 , Vesuvius’ retranslated EPS performance was 39 . 1 pence, 
and cash conversion was 104%. Consequently EPS performance 
was above maximum and the cash conversion performance was 
between threshold and target. Payments of 75% and 1 1.38% of 
base salary respectively , 86.38% in total were therefore due to 
the Executive Directors and François Wanecq under the Annual 
Incentive in respect of the ﬁ nancial performance metrics.
Personal Objectives
In 2017 , a proportion (20%) of the Annual Incentive for 
Executive Directors (representing 25% of the maximum 125% 
bonus entitlement) was based on the achievement of personal 
objectives. A summary of the objectives set and performance 
achieved is set out below.

base salary, out of the 25%, in respect of the personal objectives of Patrick André for the period of his tenure as Chief Executive. 
For the period of his tenure as President Flow Control, Mr André was awarded 9.76% of base salary, out of 16%, in respect of his

Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration continued 111
In summary, after considering performance as outlined above, 
the Committee approved an Annual Incentive payoutof 15% of 
pro-rated base salary, out of the 25%, in respect of the personal 
objectives of Francois Wanecq for the period of his tenure as 
Chief Executive during the year.
The total Annual Incentive awards payable to Patrick André and 
Guy Y oung in respect of their services as a Director during 2017 
are therefore 106% of pro-rated salary and 102% of salary 
respectively. The total Annual Incentive award payable to 
François Wanecq in respect of 2017 is 101% of salary. François 
Wanecq will receive his Annual Incentive payment in cash in 
line with the Remuneration Policy. 33% of Patrick André and 
Guy Y oung’s Annual Incentive payments will be deferred into 
awards over shares, to be held for a period of three years. 
2018 Annual Incentive
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2018 
the structure of the Annual Incentive will remain broadly the 
same as for 2017: 60% of the Executive Directors’ Annual 
Incentives will therefore be based on Group headline earnings 
per share, 20% on working capital using an updated objective 
of the Group’s working capital to sales ratio (based on the 
12-month moving average) and 20% on the achievement of 
personal objectives. The Company will not be disclosing the 
targets set until after the relevant performance period has 
ended because of commercial sensitivities. The personal 
objectives for 2018 are all non-ﬁ nancial or job-speciﬁ c in nature 
and track performance against key strategic, organisational 
and operational goals. The maximum Annual Incentive 
potential for 2018 will be 125% of base salary. 33% of any 
Annual Incentive earned will be deferred into awards over 
shares, to be held for a period of three years.
Malus/Clawback Arrangements in 2018
Vesuvius has malus and clawback arrangements in respect of 
Executive Directors’ variable remuneration. The structure of 
those arrangements is outlined in our Remuneration Policy. 
Longer-term Pay (“L TIPs”) – Audited
Performance Share awards are allocated to the Executive 
Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan (VSP). In accordance 
with the Remuneration Policy and the rules of the VSP , they are 
eligible to receive, on an annual basis, a Performance Share 
award with a face value of up to 200% of salary. Vesting of 50% 
of shares awarded is based upon the Company’s three-year 
TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies 
of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts), and 50% on 
headline EPS growth. The level of compound headline EPS 
growth speciﬁ ed in the targets is set by the Remuneration 
Committee each year, taking into account the Group’s 
prospects and the broader global economic environment. 
The schedule of EPS targets is designed at the maximum level to 
be highly challenging, whilst remaining an effective incentive for 
the management team. The EPS and TSR measures operate 
independently. The use of these performance measures is 
intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders’ 
interests. UK Executives receive awards in the form of nil-cost 
options with a ﬂ exible exercise date and non-UK Executives 
receive awards which are exercised on the date of vesting.
On 16 March 2017 , François Wanecq and Guy Y oung received 
allocations of Performance Shares worth 200% and 150% of 
their base salaries, respectively. Following his appointment 
as Chief Executive on 1 September 2017 , it was agreed that 
Patrick  André would receive a pro-rated ‘top up’ of his 2017 
Performance Share award. As a result on 1 September 2017 , 
he was granted an additional Performance Share award of 
42,257 shares. This award, in addition to the Performance 
Share award of 60,413 shares awarded to him on 16 March 
2017 , brought his total award of Performance Shares in 2017 to 
200% of his salary on a pro-rated basis. It reﬂ ected the increase 
in his Performance Share percentage entitlement and the 
increase in his salary for the ﬁ nal four months of the year. 
The Remuneration Committee has determined that Patrick 
André will receive a Performance Share award in 2018 
equivalent in value to 200% of his base salary and Guy Y oung 
an award equivalent in value to 150% of his base salary. 
The performance period applicable to the awards made in 
2015 ended on 31 December 2017 . The TSR performance 
during this three-year performance period was assessed 
against the comparator group and it was determined that the 
Company’s performance was between median and upper 
quintile. As a result, 27 . 1% of Performance Share awards 
will  vest under the TSR performance element. The Committee  
reviewed statistics from various sources which gave a large 
range of outcomes of global GDP growth. The Committee 
concluded that 2½% p.a. was a reasonable base against which 
to measure the Company’s EPS growth of 6.8% p.a. for the 
2015-2017 performance period. As a result the Group’s annual 
compound headline EPS growth above this GDP measure

Shareholding Guidelines
The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company. The required 
holding of the Chief Executive is to be equivalent in value to at least 2x salary and that required of other Executive Directors is to 
be equivalent in value to at least 1x salary. T o this end, Executive Directors are required to retain at least 50% (measured as the 
value after tax) of any shares received through the operation of share schemes; in addition, permission to sell shares held – whether 
acquired through the operation of share schemes or otherwise – will not be given, other than in exceptional circumstances, if, 
following the disposal, the shareholding requirements have not been achieved. 
Compliance with the shareholding policy is tested at the end of each year for application in the following year using the average 
of the closing prices of a Vesuvius ordinary share for the trading days in that December.
Executive Directors’ Shareholdings – Audited
As at 31 December 2017 , the Executive Directors’ shareholdings against the current shareholding guidelines (using the Company’s 
share price averaged over the trading days of the period 1 December to 31 December 2017 , of 565.97 pence per share) were

Annual Changes in Chief Executive Pay vs Employee Pay
The table below shows the percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive – comprising salary, taxable beneﬁ ts 
and Annual Incentive – and comparable data for UK salaried employees. The UK salaried employee workforce was chosen as 
a fair representation of a suitable comparator group as both the former Chief Executive François Wanecq and the incumbent 
Chief Executive Patrick André are based in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and levels of pay vary widely 
across the Group depending on geography and local market conditions.

price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. A spot rate has been used for this graph. The demerger of Vesuvius plc 
was effective on 19 December 2012 and therefore the graph shows the period from 19 December 2012 to 31 December 2017 .

This Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report contained in 
pages 1 to 73 together represent the management report for

£1,356,069, and for the purposes of ﬁ nancing (or reﬁ nancing, 
if the authority is to be used within six months after the original 
transaction) a transaction which the Board of the Company 
determines to be an acquisition or other capital investment, 
to allot equity securities, or sell T reasury Shares, for cash on a 
non pre-emptive basis up to an additional nominal amount of 
£1,356,069. Each of the authorities given in these resolutions 
expires at the earlier of the date of the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting or 30 June 2018. The resolutions were all tabled in 
accordance with the terms of the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles. The Directors propose to renew these 
authorities at the 2018 Annual General Meeting for a further 
year. In the year ahead, other than in respect of Vesuvius’ 
ability to satisfy rights granted to employees under its various 
share-based incentive arrangements, the Directors have no 
present intention of issuing any share capital of Vesuvius plc.
Authority for Purchase of Own Shares
Subject to the provisions of company law and any other 
applicable regulations, the Company may purchase its own 
shares. At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held 
on 10 May 2017 , Vesuvius shareholders gave authority to the 
Company to make market purchases of up to 27 , 121,389 
Vesuvius ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at the latest practicable day 
prior to the publication of the Notice of AGM. This authority 
expires on 30 June 2018 or the date of the AGM to be held in 
2018, whichever is the earlier. The Directors will seek renewal 
of this authority at the forthcoming AGM.
In 2013 the Company acquired 7 ,271, 174 ordinary shares, 
representing a nominal value of £727 , 1 17 and 2.6% of the entire 
called-up share capital of the Company prior to the purchase.  11 9
These shares were purchased pursuant to the Board’s 
commitment to return the majority of the net proceeds of 
the disposal of the Precious Metals Processing division to 
shareholders. These shares are currently held as T reasury 
shares. The Company has not subsequently disposed of any of 
the repurchased shares. During the year, the Company did not 
make any further acquisitions of shares, any acquisitions by 
nominee, nor did it dispose of any shares previously acquired. 
The Company does not have a lien over any of its shares.
Share Plans
Vesuvius operates a number of share-based incentive plans. 
Under these plans the Group can satisfy entitlements by the 
acquisition of existing shares, the transfer of T reasury shares 
or by the issue of new shares. Existing shares are held in an 
employee share ownership plan trust (‘ESOP’). The T rustee of 
the ESOP purchases shares in the open market as required to 
enable the Group to meet liabilities for the issue of shares to 
satisfy awards that vest. The T rustee does not register votes 
in respect of these shares and has waived the right to receive 
any dividends.
Restrictions on T ransfer of Shares and Voting
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) do not 
contain any speciﬁ c restrictions on the size of a holding or on 
the transfer of shares. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights. 
No person has any special rights with regard to the control of 
the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully 
paid. This is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the 
Articles should be consulted if further information is required.
Interests in the Company’s Shares
The Company has been notiﬁ ed in accordance with DTR 5 of 
the Disclosure and T ransparency Rules of the following interests 
of 3%, or more, of its issued ordinary shares:

Report and details of the Directors’ long-term incentive awards 
are set out on page 1 14.
Equal Opportunities Employment
Vesuvius plc is an equal opportunities employer, and decisions 
on recruitment, development, training and promotion, and 
other employment-related issues are made solely on the 
grounds of individual ability, achievement, expertise and 
conduct. These principles are operated on a non-discriminatory 
basis, without regard to race, colour, nationality, culture, 
ethnic origin, religion, belief, gender, sexual orientation, age, 
disability or any other reason not related to job performance 
or prohibited by applicable law. In cases where employees are 
injured or disabled during employment with the Group, support, 
including appropriate training, is provided to those employees 
and workplace adjustments are made as appropriate in respect 
of their duties and working environment, supporting recovery 
and continued employment.
Employee Communications
Vesuvius adopts an open and honest approach to employee 
communications, supported by regular updates from senior 
management across all businesses and operations within the 
Group. Regular communications include direct email updates 
on the ﬁ nancial performance of the Company, the industry 
environment in which Vesuvius operates, and other signiﬁ cant 
operational developments. The Company operates an 
employee intranet which distributes Company news and events, 
as well as local initiatives for employee engagement on a 
site-by-site basis. The HR department is the primary point 
of contact for employees on employment and workplace 
matters, operating with an open-door policy and advising 
employees of any local legal, tax, pension or other employment 
changes. There are numerous employee-sponsored and 
led representative bodies within Vesuvius which differ with 
respect to jurisdiction and geography. Senior management, 
supported and facilitated by the HR department, encourages 
open dialogue and seeks opportunities to consult with these 
employee representative bodies as appropriate.
Pensions
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension 
arrangements in place are considered to be consistent with 
good employment practice in that particular area. Independent 
advisers are used to ensure that the plans are operated in 
accordance with local legislation and the rules of each plan. 
Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets 
in the Company’s shares. Outside the UK, the US, Germany and 
Belgium, the majority of pension plans in the Group are of a 
deﬁ ned contribution nature. 
In 2016 the main German deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan was closed for 
new entrants and existing members were offered a buy-out of 
their beneﬁ ts under this plan. Those who accepted this buy-out 
then joined the new deﬁ ned contribution plan.
The Group’s UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts plan (the ‘UK Plan’) and the 
main US deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts plans are closed to new entrants and 
have ceased providing future beneﬁ ts accrual, with all eligible 
employees instead being provided with beneﬁ ts through 
deﬁ ned contribution arrangements.

For the Group’s closed UK Plan, a T rustee Board exists 
comprising employees, former employees and an independent 
trustee. The Board currently comprises six trustee Directors, 
of whom two are member-nominated. The administration 
of  the UK Plan is outsourced. The Company is mindful of its 
obligations under the Pensions Act 2004 and of the need to 
comply with the guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator. 
Regular dialogue is maintained between the Company and the 
T rustee Board of the UK Plan to ensure that both the Company 
and T rustee Board are apprised of the same ﬁ nancial and other 
information about the Group and the UK Plan. This is pertinent 
to each being able to contribute to the effective functioning of 
the UK Plan. 
Vesuvius continues to seek ways to de-risk its existing pension 
plans through a combination of asset matching, buy-in 
opportunities and, where prudent, voluntary cash contributions. 
The Group’s worldwide net pension deﬁ cit at 31 December 
2017 was £16.5m (31 December 2016: £29.4m). The principal 
reasons for the £12.9m reduction were increases of £1.8m to 
the deﬁ cit arising out of changes to actuarial assumptions 
(attributable to increasing discount rates; updated mortality 
assumptions and pension membership data) and additional 
accrual and administrative expenditure paid for the year 
(£6.8m); offest by reductions to the deﬁ cit of £10.2m from 
asset returns and cash contributions of £1 1.6m.

Directors’ Report continued 12 1
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial 
statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Company ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial statements unless 
they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Company and of the proﬁ t of the 
Group for that period. In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
>  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
> state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, have been followed for the Company ﬁ nancial 
statements, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the ﬁ nancial statements;
>  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
>  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Responsibilities Statement of the Directors in 
respect of the Annual Financial Report
Each of the Directors conﬁ rm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
>  the Company ﬁ nancial statements, which have been

of the Company;
>  the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial 
position and proﬁ t of the Group; and

My career with Vesuvius began in 
Poland in 2001, when I joined the 
Skawina Brick Plant as Production 
Coordinator. After a series of 
promotions, I became Production 
Manager for the whole Skawina 
Brick Plant in 2009. 
I was later given the exciting 
opportunity to work overseas, 
relocating ﬁ rst to the UAE in 2012 
to help start operations at our 
brand-new manufacturing facility 
in Ras Al Khaimah, and later 
moved to the United States as 
Operations Manager at our plant 
in Chicago Heights, Illinois. Whilst 
there, I worked with our Chicago 
Heights team to set the foundations 
for the Yellowstone project, 
targeting increased manufacturing 
efﬁ ciency at our site. 
Following this project, I took on my 
next challenge, by becoming the 
Operations Director for Advanced 
Refractories NAFT A, responsible 
for the manufacturing operations 
of  sites across the US, Canada and 
Mexico.  My career at Vesuvius 
has brought me professional 
advancement, the opportunity 
to work across cultures and to 
become a real citizen  of the world. 12 4

Report on the audit of the 
ﬁ nancial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
> Vesuvius plc’s Group ﬁ nancial statements and Company 
ﬁ nancial statements (the ‘ﬁ nancial statements’) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s proﬁ t and 
cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended
> The Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union
> The Company ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’, and applicable law)
> The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements, included within 
the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), 
which comprise: the Group and Company Balance Sheets 
as at 31 December 2017; the Group Income Statement and 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Statement 
of Cash Flows, and the Group and Company Statements of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to 
the ﬁ nancial statements, which include a description of the 
signiﬁ cant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit  Committee.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufﬁ cient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
ﬁ nancial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulﬁ lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
During the period, we identiﬁ ed that we had provided a 
prohibited tax compliance service in respect of payroll taxes 
to the Group in breach of paragraph 5. 167R(a)(ii) of the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard. T otal fees billed in the period in respect of 
the service amounted to £1,800. Upon identifying the breach, 
we immediately ceased providing this prohibited service. 
The prohibited service was provided to a component that did 
not form part of our audit evidence in respect of the audit of 
the Group. We conﬁ rm that, based on our assessment of this 
breach, and the subsequent actions taken, we have not, in our 
view, compromised our independence.
Other than the matter referred to above, and to the best of our 
knowledge and belief, we declare that no non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were provided to the 
Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Audit Committee’s Report, 
we have provided no other non-audit services to the Group 
or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 
31 December 2017 .

Our Audit Approach – Overview

Key audit 
matters 12 5
The Scope of our Audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
signiﬁ cant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it 
operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which 
were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including 
fraud. We designed audit procedures at the Group and 
signiﬁ cant component level to respond to the risk, recognising 
that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to 
fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through 
collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give 
rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Company 
ﬁ nancial statements, including, but not limited to, the UK 
Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, and global tax 
compliance matters. Our tests included, but were not limited 
to, review of the ﬁ nancial statement disclosures to underlying 
supporting documentation, review of correspondence with 
legal advisers, enquiries of management, review of signiﬁ cant 
component auditors’ work and review of Internal Audit reports 
in so far as they related to the ﬁ nancial statements. 
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above and the further removed non-compliance with laws 
and regulations is from the events and transactions reﬂ ected 
in the ﬁ nancial statements, the less likely we would become 
aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to 
irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most signiﬁ cance in the audit 
of the ﬁ nancial statements of the current period and include 
the most signiﬁ cant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identiﬁ ed by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
ﬁ nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identiﬁ ed by 
our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Provisions for exposures
The Group holds a number of provisions 
for exposures including those resulting 
from indirect tax, regulatory, legal 
and environmental matters as well 
as restructuring commitments.
Refer to Restructuring Charges (Note 7), 
Provisions (Note 32), Accounting Policies 
and Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Estimates (Note 3) and Signiﬁ cant Issues 
and Material Judgements in the Audit 
Committee Report (page 87).
Determining the quantum of provisions 
requires the Directors to use judgement 
and estimation, and for certain provisions, 
obtain specialist knowledge.
We focused on this area due to the 
judgement and estimates involved.
We obtained an understanding for the basis of each signiﬁ cant estimate and the key 
assumptions used for provisions and, in certain cases, the related insurance assets.
Restructuring costs related to the Group’s rationalisation of its operational and 
support functions. The costs predominantly included redundancies and severance 
payments, professional adviser fees and other impairment charges for obsolete 
inventories and property, plant and equipment. 
> We have tested a sample of restructuring costs to determine that these are 
directly attributable to the Group’s restructuring activities 
> For costs which are provided for at the year-end, we have veriﬁ ed for a sample 
of transactions that a legal or constructive obligation exists 
> From our procedures we concluded that restructuring costs were appropriately 
recognised and classiﬁ ed within the ﬁ nancial statements
For provisions for disposal and closure costs, including litigation matters:
> We obtained supporting computations for the estimated costs and tested the 
mathematical accuracy of these 
> We discussed obligations arising with in-house and external legal counsel and 
inspected supporting evidence of the history of claims arising where these were 
used as inputs into client models used to estimate the provisions 
> We also inspected evidence of available insurance cover and that this was 
appropriately presented gross of the associated provisions (within ‘Other 
receivables’) and considered the ﬁ nancial condition of insurance providers 
> We found no exceptions in respect of this work

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
For all provisions we considered whether there is a range of possible outcomes in 
respect of each estimate. Where appropriate, we veriﬁ ed that disclosure is included 
within the Annual Report of this.
We also considered the impact of the provisions for exposures on the reporting and 
disclosure of separately reported items and Alternate Performance Measures in the 
ﬁ nancial statements and veriﬁ ed that appropriate disclosures are made in the 
Annual Report.
Provisions for income tax uncertainties
The Group holds a number of provisions 
for income tax exposures arising from tax 
structuring, transfer pricing and local 
authority reviews.
Refer to Income T ax (Note 10), Accounting 
Policies and Critical Accounting 
Judgements and Estimates (Note 3) and 
Signiﬁ cant Issues and Material Judgements 
in the Audit Committee Report (page 87).
Determining the quantum of these 
provisions requires the Directors to 
make judgements and estimates, and 
for certain provisions, obtain specialist 
knowledge.
We utilised our tax specialists to provide a view of material judgements made. Our 
audit procedures included:
> Obtaining relevant computations and correspondence in respect of each material 
element of the provision for income tax uncertainty
>  Understanding the key assumptions made by management in recognising the 
provision and forming an independent view on the reasonableness of the 
assumptions
> Assessing the consistency of approach used to determine provisions compared 
with prior periods, and considering whether such consistency remains appropriate
> Considering the range of possible outcomes in respect of the estimates and that 
the Annual Report discloses the nature of the estimation uncertainty
From our procedures we concluded that the estimates are reasonable and that 
appropriate disclosures have been included within the Annual Report.
Recognition of deferred tax assets for tax 
losses
In certain territories such as the US, the 
Group has a material quantum of 
historical tax losses.
The determination of whether these will 
be utilised in the future is judgemental, 
particularly as to how much of these could 
be reasonably expected to be utilised.
In addition, the impact of US tax changes 
enacted in December 2017 requires 
reassessment of the calculation of total 
tax losses and the lives attached to these. 
There is a risk of error and judgement 
given  these changes are complex and 
subject to interpretation.
Refer to Income T ax (Note 10), Accounting 
Policies and Critical Accounting 
Judgements and Estimates (Note 3) and 
Signiﬁ cant Issues and Material Judgements 
in the Audit Committee Report (page 87).
We utilised our tax specialists to support with the audit testing of the quantum of 
tax losses in the US and that this is accurately determined, taking into account the 
year-end US tax reforms. We concluded the tax losses are accurately determined.
In addition to testing the quantum of tax losses:
> We tested management’s forecasts supporting the amounts recognised as a 
deferred tax asset, and considered the likelihood of forecasts being achieved
> We also considered a range of possible outcomes in the forecast and that an 
appropriate midpoint was taken in selecting the amount to recognise
> We considered alternative views and whether a full versus partial recognition 
approach was appropriate. We concluded that the current approach, which 
recognises tax losses as deferred tax assets to the extent there is proﬁ t forecast 
against them which will be utilised, remains the most appropriate. We veriﬁ ed 
that appropriate disclosure of the amount of deferred tax asset not recognised 
is included within the ﬁ nancial statements
From our procedures we concluded that the estimate is reasonable and that 
appropriate disclosures have been included within the Annual Report.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report.

How We T ailored the Audit Scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the ﬁ nancial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of 
the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
Vesuvius has operations in 37 countries and has 66 production 
sites. The Group consolidates ﬁ nancial information through 
reporting from its components which include divisions and 
functions at these sites.
Our audit scope was determined by considering the 
signiﬁ cance of the entity’s contribution to revenue and 
contribution to individual ﬁ nancial statement line items, 
with speciﬁ c consideration to obtaining sufﬁ cient coverage 
over areas of high risk and locations and entities where we 
identiﬁ ed signiﬁ cant or inherent risks.
We identiﬁ ed one signiﬁ cant component being the Group’s 
German operations which comprise 14% of the Group’s revenue. 
As the Group’s remaining revenue is spread across 74 ﬁ nancial 
reporting components there were no other individually 
ﬁ nancially signiﬁ cant components. The audit scope, including 
Germany, comprised 20 components for which we determined 
that full-scope audits would need to be performed and nine 
components for which speciﬁ c audit procedures on certain 
balances and transactions were performed. This collectively 
gave us coverage of 68% of the Group’s revenue and 76% of 
the Group’s Headline proﬁ t before tax. This, together with the 
additional procedures performed at the Group level, including 
testing the consolidation process, gave us the evidence we 
needed for our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed 
at the entities by us, as the Group engagement team, or by 
component auditors of other PwC network ﬁ rms. Where the 
work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the level of involvement and oversight we needed to have in 
the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude 
whether sufﬁ cient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements 
as a whole. This was achieved through regular update meetings 
with the component auditors and visits to 17 of the 20 full-scope 
components by senior members of the Group audit team.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was inﬂ uenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
ﬁ nancial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole as follows:
Group ﬁ nancial statements Company ﬁ nancial statements
Overall materiality £7 .6 million £7 .6 million
How we determined it 5% of proﬁ t before tax and separately 
reported items (‘Headline proﬁ t before tax’)
1% of total assets, capped to the level of Group 
overall materiality
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We believe that proﬁ t before tax and 
separately reported items (‘Headline proﬁ t before 
tax’) provides us with an appropriate basis for 
determining our overall Group materiality given 
it is a key measure used by users of the ﬁ nancial 
statements. Headline proﬁ t before tax is an 
Alternative Performance Measure presented 
and deﬁ ned in the Annual Report and Accounts.
We believe that total assets is an appropriate 
basis for determining materiality for the Parent 
Company, given this entity is an investment 
holding company and this is an accepted auditing 
benchmark. The materiality was capped to the 
level of Group overall materiality. The Company is  
not an in-scope component in our Group audit.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we 
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across 
components was between £0. 1 million and £7 .3 million. 
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit 
materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identiﬁ ed during our audit above 
£0.4 million (Group and Company audit) as well as 
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of the Directors’ Statement in the ﬁ nancial statements about 
whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements and the Directors’ 
identiﬁ cation of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the ﬁ nancial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to going concern 
in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on Other Information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the ﬁ nancial statements and our 
Auditors’ Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the ﬁ nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
ﬁ nancial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.  
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006,  
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report (CA06).
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of 
the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of 
the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
regarding:
> The Directors’ conﬁ rmation on page 23 of the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity
> The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated
> The Directors’ explanation on page 23 of the Annual Report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualiﬁ cations or assumptions
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the 
Directors’ Statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and 
statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and 
only consisted of making enquiries and considering the 
Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit 
(Listing Rules).
Independent Auditors’ Report
T o the Members of V esuvius plc continued 12 9
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
>  The statement given by the Directors, on page 121, that 
they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the Members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group and Company obtained in the course of performing 
our audit
>  The section of the Annual Report on pages 85 to 92 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to 
the Audit Committee
>  The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code speciﬁ ed, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (CA06).
Responsibilities for the Financial Statements 
and the Audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements set out on page 121, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisﬁ ed that they 
give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these ﬁ nancial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the ﬁ nancial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our Auditors’ Report.
Use of this Report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s Members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Other Required Reporting
Companies Act 2006 Exception Reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
>  We have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit
>  Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us
>  Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by 
law are not made
>  The Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we 
were appointed by the Members on 10 May 2017 to audit the 
ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 
subsequent ﬁ nancial periods. This is therefore our ﬁ rst year of 
uninterrupted engagement.

Financial Statements
1.  General Information
Vesuvius plc (‘Vesuvius’ or ‘the Company’) is a public company limited by shares. It is incorporated and domiciled in England 
and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company 
and its subsidiary and joint venture companies (‘the Group’) is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 73 and its registered 
address is shown on page 189.
2. Basis of Preparation
2. 1 Basis of accounting
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
plans, certain provisions, available-for-sale investments and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its ‘subsidiaries’). Control exists when the Company has the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity that 
signiﬁ cantly affect the entity’s return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities. In assessing whether control 
exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the Group Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group Financial Statments are set out in the Notes. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed 
herein to ensure that the Group ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁ ed separately from the Group’s interest 
therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination 
together with the non-controlling interests’ share of proﬁ t or loss, each component of other comprehensive income, and 
dividends paid since the date of the combination. T otal comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deﬁ cit balance.
2.3  Going concern
The Directors have prepared cash ﬂ ow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval 
of the 2017 ﬁ nancial statements. These forecasts reﬂ ect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and 
their impact on the Group’s future trading performance. The forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the 
current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the Company’s ﬁ nancial covenants. On the basis of 
the exercise described above and the Group’s available committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and 
Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
signing of these accounts. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements of 
the Group and the Company.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency
The ﬁ nancial statements are presented in millions of pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, 
and rounded to one decimal place. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 27 . 1.
2.5 Disclosure of ‘separately reported items’
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items 
presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s ﬁ nancial 
performance. The Company has adopted a columnar presentation for its Group Income Statement, to separately identify 
headline performance results, as the Directors consider that this gives a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing 
business. As part of this presentation format, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its 
Group Income Statement, within the column entitled ‘Separately reported items’, the effect of any components of ﬁ nancial 
performance for which the Directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the ﬁ nancial 
performance achieved and in making projections of future results. 
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon 
such presentation. Such items may include, inter alia, the ﬁ nancial effect of exceptional items which occur infrequently, such 
as major restructuring activity, initial recognition and subsequent increase, decrease, utilisation and impact of tax reform on 
US deferred tax assets, together with items always reported separately, such as amortisation charges relating to acquired 
intangible assets, proﬁ ts or losses arising on the disposal of continuing or discontinued operations and the taxation impact 
of the aforementioned exceptional items and items reported separately.

2. Basis of Preparation (continued)
2.5 Disclosure of ‘separately reported items’ (continued)
The amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets recognised on business combniations is excluded from the trading results 
of the Group since they are non-cash charges and are not considered reflective of the core trading performance of the Group. 
Restructuring charges are excluded from the trading results of the Group due to the material nature of these non-recurring 
transformational initiatives. In its adoption of this policy , the Company applies an even-handed approach to both gains and 
losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of such items.
2.6 New and revised IFRS
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 
reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new 
standards and interpretations is set out below. Other new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to 
have a signiﬁ cant impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018) addresses the classiﬁ cation, 
measurement and derecognition of ﬁ nancial instruments, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment 
model for ﬁ nancial assets. It replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments guidance and comprehensive updates have been made 
to IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosure and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. The Group will apply IFRS 9 and 
the updated IFRS 7 disclosure requirements from their effective date. 
The impact assessment performed by the Group included a review of the classiﬁ cation and measurement of ﬁ nancial 
instruments; the impairment of ﬁ nancial assets and the group hedging policy which resulted in the following conclusions:
> The group reviewed the classiﬁ cation and measurement of each of its ﬁ nancial instruments. Although, the classiﬁ cation 
of instruments is altered under IFRS 9, this does not result in any changes to the measurement approach apart from the 
impairment of trade receivables which is addressed below.
> The new impairment model for ﬁ nancial assets requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected 
credit losses (“ECL ”) rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The Group will apply the simpliﬁ ed 
approach to its trade receivables as per the scope exception in IFRS 9 in which all loss allowances for trade receivables will 
be measured at initial recognition and throughout its life at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. This is consistent with the 
nature of the group’s trade receivables as they do not include a signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancing component. Based on the assessments 
undertaken to date, the group does not expect a material movement in the loss allowance for trade debtors.
> The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk 
management practices. The Group has conﬁ rmed that its current net investment hedge relationship will qualify as a 
continuing hedge upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
Based on our assessment of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group does not believe there will be a material impact on its Group 
Financial Statements. From 1 January 2018 onwards, the Group will amend its ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging accounting 
policies to reﬂ ect IFRS 9 terminology and prepare the appropriate disclosures regarding the classiﬁ cation and measurement 
of ﬁ nancial instruments; impairment of ﬁ nancial assets and hedging.
 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective after 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018) establishes a 
comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue 
recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 1 1 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. 
The Group will apply IFRS 15 from its effective date. 
The impact assessment performed by the Group included a review of revenue streams and customer contracts to 
identify distinct performance obligations and the appropriate method for allocating the transaction price. Based on our 
assessment of the adoption of IFRS 15, the Group does not believe there will be a material impact on its Group Financial 
Statements. During 2018, the Group will revise the revenue recognition policy to reﬂ ect IFRS 15 terminology, prepare the 
additional disclosures for the Group Financial Statements and continue to review contracts across all Segments. The Group 
will continue to disaggregate revenue over Steel and Foundry in the Segmental Analysis note.  13 7
Financial Statements
 IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases (effective after 1 January 2019, for the year ending 2019) replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 
16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease 
term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. The present value of the Group’s operating lease payments 
as deﬁ ned under the new standard will be shown as lease liabilities on the balance sheet and included in net debt. There are 
a number of differences between the two deﬁ nitions; for example, where there is an option to extend the lease, payments for 
the extension period will be included in the IFRS 16 liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option, 
but are not included as commitments under IAS 17 . 
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its Group Financial Statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16.
 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income T ax T reatments
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income T ax T reatments (effective from 1 January 2019, for the year ending 2019, not yet endorsed) 
clariﬁ es how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over 
tax treatment under IAS 12. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its Group Financial Statements resulting 
from the application of IFRIC 23. 
 IFRIC Interpretation - Interest and Penalties on T ax
The impact of the interpretation regarding the accounting treatment of interest and penalties on tax is set out in Note 10. 1.
3. Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates
Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events. 
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signiﬁ cant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below. All other accounting policies are included within the respective Notes to the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
3.1 Provisions
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of 
which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number 
of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Provisions are made for the expected amounts 
payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party 
claims, as described in Note 32. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or 
other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outﬂ ows are subject to some uncertainty. The Directors 
use their judgement and experience to make appropriate estimates of provisions in the ﬁ nancial statements for amounts 
relating to such matters.
3.2 Taxation
 (a) Current tax
Tax beneﬁ ts are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic beneﬁ ts to the Group. In assessing 
the amount of the beneﬁ t to be recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering 
the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement. 
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the Group is 
routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to 
conclude. Provisions are made for known issues based on all substantively enacted legislation, the Directors’ interpretation 
of country-speciﬁ c tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome, taking into consideration the Group’s experience in 
agreeing tax liabilities with tax authorities and appropriate external advice. As indicated in Note 10.5, these provisions 
amount to £23.2m (2016: £24.5m) at the end of 2017 . Further discussion of these provisions is contained in that Note. All 
income tax liabilities, provisions and assets are treated as income tax payable and recoverable in accordance with IAS 12. 
 (b) Deferred tax
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number 
of the Group’s businesses, further details of which are given in Note 10.4. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable 
proﬁ t in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised. If these forecast proﬁ ts do not materialise or change, or 
there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value 
of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period. 138

Annual Report and Accounts 201 7
3. Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates (continued)
 (b) Deferred tax (continued)
The Group also has losses and other timing differences, also analysed in Note 10.4, for which no deferred tax assets have 
been recognised in these ﬁ nancial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic beneﬁ t of 
the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain 
types of proﬁ t being earned, such as capital proﬁ ts. If trading or other appropriate proﬁ ts are earned in the future in these 
companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield beneﬁ t to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
As explained in Note 10.2, the US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘TCJA’) enacted in late December 2017 had a material impact on 
the Group’s deferred tax position. TCJA was introduced very rapidly, and consequently there is much uncertainty about how 
some of the provisions will operate. As explained in Note 10.6, Vesuvius currently understands that the Base Erosion and 
Anti-Abuse T ax (‘BEA T’) will impact its tax charge in the US in 2018 and beyond, in relation to certain payments made to 
non-US related parties. Further clariﬁ cation is awaited from US T reasury so the precise impact of BEA T cannot be 
determined with certainty at this point. 
Other reasonable estimations have been made in determining how US tax reform will impact on Vesuvius’ US 2017 deferred 
tax position in particular in relation to earnings and proﬁ ts of Vesuvius’ non-US investments to be included in the deemed 
repatriation tolling charge calculations included in its 2017 taxable income.
As guidance is given by the US T reasury Department on how these, and other provisions of TCJA, are to operate, Vesuvius’ tax 
position may be impacted. 
4. Alternative Performance Measures
The Company uses a number of alternative performance measures (APMs) in addition to those reported in accordance 
with IFRS. The Directors believe that these APMs, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying ﬁ nancial and 
operating performance of the Group and its divisions, providing management with key insights and metrics in support of the 
ongoing management of the Group’s performance and cash ﬂ ow. A number of these align with KPI’s and other key metrics 
used in the business and therefore are considered useful to also disclose to the users of the ﬁ nancial statements. The following 
APMs do not have standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similar 
measures presented by other companies.
4.1 Headline
Headline performance, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is from continuing operations and 
before items reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement.
4.2 Underlying revenue, underlying trading proﬁ t and underlying return on sales
Underlying revenue, underlying trading proﬁ t and underlying return on sales are the headline equivalents of these measures 
after adjustments to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates, business acquisitions and disposals. Reconciliations of 
underlying revenue and underlying trading proﬁ t can be found in the Financial Review. Underlying revenue growth is one of 
the Group’s key performance indicators and provides an important measure of organic growth of Group businesses between 
reporting periods, by eliminating the impact of exchange rates, acquisitions, disposals and signiﬁ cant business closures.
4.3 Return on sales (ROS)
ROS is calculated as trading proﬁ t divided by revenue. It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess 
the trading performance of Group businesses. A reconciliation of ROS is included in Note 5.3.
4.4 Trading proﬁ t
T rading proﬁ t, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is deﬁ ned as operating proﬁ t before 
separately reported items. It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the trading performance 
of Group businesses. It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured.
4.5 Headline proﬁ t before tax
Headline proﬁ t before tax, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is calculated as the net total of 
trading proﬁ t, plus the Group’s share of post-tax proﬁ t of joint ventures and total net ﬁ nance costs associated with headline 
performance. It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group 
as a whole. 
4.6 Effective tax rate (ETR)
The Group’s ETR is calculated on the income tax costs associated with headline performance, divided by headline proﬁ t 
before tax and before the Group’s share of post-tax proﬁ t of joint ventures. 
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 13 9
Financial Statements
4.7 Headline earnings per share 
Headline earnings per share is calculated by dividing headline proﬁ t before tax less associated income tax costs, attributable 
to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. It is one of the Group’s key 
performance indicators and is used to assess the underlying earnings performance of the Group as a whole. It is also used 
as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured. Headline earnings per share is 
disclosed in Note 1 1. 
4.8 Operating cash ﬂ ow
Operating cash ﬂ ow is cash generated from continuing operations before restructuring and net retirement beneﬁ t 
obligations but after deducting capital expenditure net of asset disposals. It is used in calculating the Group’s cash conversion. 
A reconciliation of cash generated from operations to operating cash ﬂ ow can be found in the Financial Review.
4.9 Cash conversion
Cash conversion is calculated as operating cash ﬂ ow from continuing operations divided by trading proﬁ t. It is useful for 
measuring the rate at which cash is generated from trading proﬁ t. It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual 
bonuses of certain employees are measured. The calculation of cash conversion is detailed in the Financial Review. 
4.10 Free cash ﬂ ow
Free cash ﬂ ow is deﬁ ned as net cash ﬂ ow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, 
plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional 
funding contributions to Group pension plans. It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the 
underlying cash generation of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Group’s capital. A reconciliation 
of free cash ﬂ ow is included underneath the Group Statement of Cash Flows. 
4. 11 Average trade working capital to sales ratio
The average trade working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average trade working capital balances 
to the total revenue for the year, at constant currency. Average trade working capital (comprising inventories, trade 
receivables and trade payables) is calculated as the average of the 12 previous month-end balances. It is one of the Group’s 
key performance indicators and is useful for measuring the level of working capital used in the business and is one of the 
measures used in monitoring the Group’s capital.
4. 12 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading proﬁ t before depreciation and amortisation of non-acquired intangible assets. 
It is used in the calculation of the Group’s interest cover and net debt to EBITDA ratios. A reconciliation of EBITDA is included 
in Note 12. 
4.13 Net interest
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item separately reported. 
It is used in the calculation of the Group’s interest cover ratio.
4.14 Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth. This measure is also a component of the Group’s covenant 
calculations. 
4.15 Net debt
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits. 
Net debt is a measure of the Group’s net indebtedness to banks and other external ﬁ nancial institutions. A reconciliation of 
the movement in net debt is included in Note 14 of the Group Financial Statements. 
4. 16 Net debt to EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year. It is one of the Group’s key performance 
indicators and is used to assess the ﬁ nancial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth and is one of the 
measures used in monitoring the Group’s capital.
4. 17 Return on net assets (RONA)
RONA is calculated as trading proﬁ t plus share of post-tax proﬁ t of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets, at 
constant currency (being the average over the previous 1 2 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and 
other operating receivables and payables). It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the ﬁ nancial 
performance and asset management of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Group’s capital.
4.18 Constant currency
Figures presented at constant currency represent 2016 amounts retranslated to average 2017 exchange rates. 140

5. Segment Information
The segment information contained in this Note makes reference to several alternative performance measures, deﬁ nitions 
of which can be found in Note 4.
5.1 Business segments 
 Operating segments for continuing operations
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Directors of 
the Board, who make the key operating decisions and are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments. Reﬂ ecting the Group’s management and internal reporting structure, segmental information is 
presented in respect of the two main business segments: Steel and Foundry. The Steel segment aggregates the Flow Control, 
Advanced Refractories and Digital Services divisions which are subject to a similar risk proﬁ le and return. The principal 
activities of each of these segments are described in the Strategic Report on pages 32 to 49.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material). T rading proﬁ t includes 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
5.2 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to 
customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement 
with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. A provision for anticipated returns is made based 
primarily on historical return rates. Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can 
be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with 
equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.

10. Income Tax
10.1 Accounting policy
T ax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in proﬁ t or loss 
except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income or Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised in those statements. 
In arriving at its current tax charge, the Group also makes careful assessment of the likely impact of tax law changes. 
In particular, it has considered the impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 in the US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act 
(‘TCJA’) and other recently announced tax reform, for example in Belgium.
 Current tax
Current tax is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. T axable proﬁ t differs from proﬁ t before tax as reported in the Group 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
A provision is recognised when the Group considers it has a present tax obligation as the result of a past event and it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions established for such uncertain tax positions are 
made using a best estimate of the tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of all relevant 
information. Such a provision is typically required where the underlying tax issue is subject to interpretation and remains to be 
agreed, and therefore is uncertain as to outcome. Principally the uncertain tax positions for which a provision is made relate 
to the interpretation of tax legislation and guidance regarding transfer pricing arrangements that have been entered into in 
the normal course of business. In accordance with IAS 12, tax provisions are included as income tax payable on the face of 
the Group Balance Sheet, and movements in tax provisions are included within income tax charges or credits in the Group 
Income Statement. 
In assessing any appropriate provision requirements for uncertain tax items, the Group considers progress made in 
discussions with the tax authorities, expert advice on the likely outcome and any recent developments in case law. Due to the 
uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that at a future date, on conclusion of the open matters, the ﬁ nal 
outcome may vary signiﬁ cantly. Any such variations will affect the ﬁ nancial results in the year in which such a determination 
is made. 
 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
 Change in accounting policy
Previously, the common understanding and interpretation of IAS 12 allowed a company to include in its tax charges, liabilities 
and provisions any associated delayed settlement interest and penalties. Vesuvius followed this approach. The recent 
clariﬁ cation by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (previously the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee, IFRIC), however, is that a company should include in its tax charges, liabilities and provisions only items meeting 
the strict deﬁ nition of taxes under IAS 12. It conﬁ rmed that items not meeting that deﬁ nition should be reported in accordance 
with IAS 37 .
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 14 5
Financial Statements
Vesuvius has accordingly changed its accounting policy to include interest and penalties on tax in trade and other payables in 
accordance with IAS 37 . This has resulted in a change to its Group Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 to reclassify £7 .0m 
from its liabilities and provisions previously reported as tax to trade and other payables. The effect of this change on its 2016 
performance statements is immaterial and no restatement is therefore required to be made.

The US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘TCJA’) enacted in the US in December 2017 has had a material impact on the value of the 
deferred tax asset the Group recognises in the US. It has reduced the asset by $33. 1m (£25.7m), of which $31.5m (£24.5m) 
is charged to the Group Income Statement and $1.6m (£1.2m) is charged to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
as it relates to the effect of the change in the US Federal rate of tax on the value of the deferred tax asset on pension deﬁ cits 
recognised in that statement.
The reduction was principally due to the change in Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the deemed repatriation tolling charge 
and the impact of other changes when measuring the value of the asset which is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet. 
However, no current tax liability has resulted from these provisions in 2017 , due to the availability of tax losses and foreign tax 
credits to offset the resultant additional taxable income. The impact of US tax reform, together with normal changes to the 
US deferred tax asset, resulted in the asset reducing from $81.3m (£65.9m) at the end of 2016 to $44.0m (£32.6m) at the end 
of 2017 .
In 2017 , Belgium reduced its tax rate to 29% in 2018 and 25% in 2020. This has had the impact of reducing the deferred tax 
asset in Belgium by £1.4m in 201 7 (2016: £nil). This impact is included in the total deferred tax charge on continuing operations. 146

10. Income T ax (continued)
10.2 Income tax charge (continued)
The net tax charge reﬂ ected in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year amounted to £3. 1m (2016: £0.7m), 
£2.4m of which related to tax on net actuarial gains and losses on the employee beneﬁ ts plan. In addition, £0.7m (2016: £nil)
related to UK tax in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on hedged positions. 
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these 
areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufﬁ ciency of taxable 
proﬁ t to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary, could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future as effective tax 
relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other signiﬁ cant factors affecting the tax charge are described in 
Notes 3.2, 10. 1 and 10.6.
In 2016, proﬁ t from discontinued operations (Note 22) included a tax credit of £9.0m relating to the release of a provision for 
possible China taxes arising during the demerger of the Alent business in 2012. After further consultation with advisers, and in 
light of the publication in 2015 by the Chinese tax authorities of additional guidance on the applicable taxes, it was decided 
this provision was no longer required. No similar credit has arisen in 2017 .

As discussed in Note 10.2, US tax reform enacted in TCJA has had a major impact on the Group’s US deferred tax position. 
Note 3.2 outlines the principal judgements and estimates taken in determining the impact of that reform on the valuation of 
this asset. 
Included in non-current deferred tax assets is £32.6m (2016: £65.9m) in respect of the partial recognition of temporary 
differences arising in the US computed in accordance with the policy set out in Note 10. 1 above. The Group remains conﬁ dent 
of the recovery of this asset. £69.2m (2016: £100.4m) remains unrecognised.
In view of its material size and nature, any tax credit reﬂ ected in the Group Income Statement arising from the recognition of 
this asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in 
Note 2.5. Subsequent increase, decrease and utilisation of the resultant deferred tax asset would similarly be expected to be 
presented in this manner, as the Directors consider that the separate identiﬁ cation of deferred tax for material temporary 
differences would assist both in a better understanding of the ﬁ nancial performance achieved, and in making projections 
of future results of the Group.
T ax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences with a tax value of £1m (2016: £1.4m) were recognised by subsidiaries 
reporting a loss. On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the Directors consider it probable that the tax 
loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable proﬁ ts. 
The total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 December 2017 were £219.9m (2016: £263. 1m), as analysed below. 
In accordance with the accounting policy in Note 10. 1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the 
basis that their future economic beneﬁ t is not probable. In total, there was a decrease of £43.2m (2016: £6.4m increase) in 
net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year, principally due to the impact of the change in the US Federal tax rate 
from 35% to 21%, enacted in TCJA.

There are no temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised. The aggregate temporary differences where the exemption not to provide 
for the deferred taxation liability has been taken is £197 . 1m (2016: £175.9m). 
UK corporation tax rate reductions to 17% from 1 April 2020 were enacted in 2016. Accordingly, the Group’s closing UK 
deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 17% except where the reversals are expected to arise prior to 
1 April 2020.

Provisions for uncertain tax provisions are calculated in accordance with the policy outlined in Note 10. 1, and are treated as

These provisions cover litigated tax matters as well as provisions for other risks where the Group believes it is more likely than 
not that there would be a successful challenge by a tax authority to positions it has taken in its tax ﬁ lings. By its nature, litigation 
can result in sharp ﬂ uctuations in cash ﬂ ow, both in and out, relating to taxes. Currently, management do not expect any 
material adjustments to these provisions in 2018. 
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 14 9
Financial Statements
10.6 Key factors impacting the sustainability of the effective tax rate are as follows:
 Material changes in the geographic mix of proﬁ ts
The Group’s effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in the geographic mix of proﬁ ts and level of proﬁ ts, and reﬂ ects a 
combination of higher rates in certain jurisdictions such as India, Mexico, Germany and Belgium, nil effective tax rates in 
the UK and the US due to the availability of unutilised tax losses, and rates that lie somewhere in between. 
 Changes in tax rates, tax reform and its interpretation
Changes in tax rates and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could have a material effect on the Group’s 
effective tax rate. As stated in Note 10. 1, the Group has taken into account the impact of US and other tax reform enacted 
in 2017 .
One of the new taxes introduced by the US T ax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘TCJA’) in the US in December 2017 is the Base Erosion and 
Anti-Abuse T ax (‘BEA T’) (see also Note 3.2(b)). This is intended to counter what US tax authorities regard as erosion of the US 
tax base of a US company caused by payments, other than for cost of goods sold, to its to non-US afﬁ liates. In its broadest 
sense, this would establish a base tax of 10% of a US company’s normal taxable income as grossed up by such payments. 
The rate of tax applied is 5% in 2018, increasing to 10% from 2019. Whilst this does not impact Vesuvius in 2017 , it is currently 
estimated to result in a US cash tax cost from 2018 onwards and thus increase the Group’s effective rate of tax on Headline 
performance (before its share of joint venture income) going forward by 0.7% in 2018, and 1.2% in 2019. The Group’s effective 
tax rate for 2018 onwards is expected to be between 27% and 28%, including the expected adverse impact of US tax reform, 
reﬂ ecting the beneﬁ t of initiatives being taken. 
TCJA is a major new piece of legislation, introduced very rapidly, consequently there is still much uncertainty about how some 
of the key provisions will operate. The international provisions in particular are extremely complex and, with little issued 
guidance from the US T reasury, are not yet fully understood by the business or adviser community. Vesuvius has taken advice 
on how TCJA is likely to impact on its tax position, but it is to be expected that, as guidance and interpretation clariﬁ es these 
new laws, then further changes to its tax charges and balances may need to be made.
 Availability of tax advantaged rates
Vesuvius in China qualiﬁ es for a tax advantaged rate of 15% (rather than the headline rate of 25%), on part of its proﬁ ts due 
to the high-technology nature of its business. Eligibility for this rate is reviewed on a regular basis by the Chinese tax authority, 
and was worth approximately £0.9m in 2017 (2016: £1.0m). Without that beneﬁ t, the Group’s effective tax rate on headline 
performance would have been 0.6% higher in 2017 (2016: 0.8%). 
 Resolution of tax judgements
At any one time, the Group can be subject to a number of challenges by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates. 
The outcome of these challenges is inherently uncertain, potentially resulting in a different tax charge from the amounts 
initially provided. 
 Recognition of tax beneﬁ ts arising from brought forward losses and other temporary differences in the US
In accordance with the criteria set out in Note 10. 1, movements in Vesuvius’ US deferred tax asset are recognised as separately 
reported items. Consequently, such movements have no impact on the Group’s effective tax rate on headline performance. 
Should, however, the 2017 proﬁ ts earned in the US have been fully subject to US Federal and State taxes, then the Group’s 
effective tax rate on headline performance (excluding the Group’s share of post-tax proﬁ t of joint ventures) would have been 
approximately 4.2% higher (2016: 3.4% higher).
 Impact of Brexit on Vesuvius’ tax position 
How Brexit impacts on Vesuvius will depend on the terms of Brexit, which are as yet unclear and therefore it is not possible at 
this stage to provide precise guidance on how it will impact on the Group. If the EU Parent Subsidiary and Interest and Royalty 
directives were no longer to apply to dividend, interest and other payments to Vesuvius in the UK, additional withholding taxes 
would become payable subject to reliefs available under applicable tax treaties.  150

15. Property, Plant and Equipment
15.1 Accounting policy
Freehold land and construction in progress are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, 
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs are 
capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic beneﬁ ts ﬂ owing to the Group and when they can be 
measured reliably. Costs are capitalised to construction in progress where an asset is being developed. This is then transferred 
and depreciated when the asset is ready for use. All other repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the Group 
Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 15 2

15. Property, Plant and Equipment (continued)
15. 1 Accounting policy (continued)
Freehold land is not depreciated, as it has an inﬁ nite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins 
when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the 
cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property between ten and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and equipment  — motor vehicles and information technology equipment between one and ﬁ ve years
 — other between three and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and changed, if appropriate. 
As described in Note 17 . 1, an asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing 
sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group Income Statement.

16. Intangible Assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
16.1 Accounting policy
 (a) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate 
of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired 
over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the 
excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in proﬁ t or loss. Goodwill is subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired. On disposal of a business, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
 (b) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from 
contractual or other legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably. They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to 
the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated 
impairment losses. Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment 
loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
 (c) Research and development costs
The Group’s research activity involves long-range, ‘blue sky’ investigation, the ﬁ ndings from which may be used in the future 
to develop new or substantially improved products. Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Group Income 
Statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Development is the application of research ﬁ ndings for the production of new or substantially improved products, processes 
and services before the start of commercial production. Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can 
be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic beneﬁ ts are probable 
and the Group intends to and has sufﬁ cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it 
is recognised in the Group Income Statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development 
expenditure, where there is any, is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
In determining whether development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset, management considers whether the 
strict intangible asset recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets, have been met at the time the expenditure is 
incurred. In making this determination, management recognise that a signiﬁ cant amount of the development expenditure 
undertaken by the Group is focused on dealing with local customer technical support issues and incremental developments 
to existing products as opposed to new or substantially improved products, and that at the time the feasibility of the project 
is determined a signiﬁ cant proportion of the development expenditure for that project has already been incurred. In 2017 
no projects met the criteria for IAS 38 capitalisation.

16.3 Analysis of goodwill by cash-generating unit (CGU)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to beneﬁ t from the synergies 
of the combination. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two CGUs: the Steel 
division and the Foundry division. These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.

1 7 . Impairment of T angible and Intangible Assets
17.1 Accounting policy
The Directors regularly review the performance of the business and the external business environment to determine whether 
there is any indication that the Group’s tangible and intangible assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication 
exists, the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell of the asset is estimated and compared with the carrying 
value in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. In 
addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to 
each of the Group’s CGUs expected to beneﬁ t from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual 
impairment testing of the carrying value of each CGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the 
associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs 
to sell and (ii) its value in use. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment 
loss is allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the 
CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period. An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may 
be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s recoverable amount since the 
impairment loss was recognised. 
17.2 Key assumptions
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are projected cash ﬂ ows, growth rates and discount rates. Projected 
cash ﬂ ow assumptions are based on historical ﬁ nancial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of 
restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 15 5
Financial Statements
The value in use calculations of the Group’s CGUs are based on three-year business plans and a terminal growth rate of 
2.5% (2016: 2.5%). The cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates, which represent each 
CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; 
external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s key end-markets of Steel and Foundry; and expected growth in 
output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates. A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% (2016: 2.5%) 
has been applied. The pre-tax discount rate is the WACC calculated for each CGU as at 31 December 2017 based on 
industry-speciﬁ c beta coefﬁ cients for the industries in which the CGUs operate, risk-free rates, and equity risk premiums 
related to the major countries in which the CGUs are located, selecting countries which contribute at least 80% of total 
CGU revenue. The pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel CGU was 1 1.0% (2016: 10.9%) and for the Foundry CGU was 
1 1.6% (2016: 13.2%). The decrease in Foundry’s pre-tax discount rate is driven by improved global economic performance 
which results in reduced market risk, and consequently, lower equity risk premiums; and the Foundry industry has performed 
well with limited volatility resulting in a reduced beta. In the Steel CGU, the impact of this decrease in equity risk premiums 
has been more than offset by increasing contributions from emerging markets, providing upward pressure on risk-free rates 
and equity risk premiums. 
A sensitivity analysis undertaken in respect of the 2017 impairment testing, assuming a 1.0% increase in each of the CGU 
discount rates and a 1.0% perpetuity growth rate, still resulted in headroom remaining in which the recoverable amount of 
each CGU exceeded its carrying value. A pre-tax discount rate of 16.0% would result in an impairment of Steel intangible 
assets and 22.7% for Foundry.
17.3 Goodwill impairment
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a 
value that will beneﬁ t the performance of the Group over future periods. T o assist in making this judgement, the Directors 
undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill and other intangible 
assets. The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of 
the Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could signiﬁ cantly alter 
the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
In assessing goodwill for impairment, management performed its annual test at 31 October 2017 which is consistent with 
the prior year. The Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Group’s CGUs as at 
31 October 2017 . Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts signiﬁ cantly higher than the carrying values of the 
Group’s CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised. A further assessment for triggers of goodwill 
impairment was made at the year end and the calculations were also checked against the carrying values of the Group’s 
CGUs as at 31 December 2017 . No impairment triggers were identiﬁ ed. 
18. T rade and Other Receivables

18. T rade and Other Receivables (continued)
18.2 Analysis of trade and other receivables (continued)
All the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers 
with whom they do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision 
is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. 
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or 
ﬁ nancial reorganisation proceedings. Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all signiﬁ cant 
outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience. Historical experience 
has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufﬁ cient to absorb actual bad debt 
write-offs, without being excessive. The Group considers the credit quality of ﬁ nancial assets that are neither past due nor 
impaired as good.

19.1 Accounting policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the ﬁ rst in, ﬁ rst out method) and net realisable value. Cost comprises 
expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the 
inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal 
activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to 
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is 
recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

20. Derivative Financial Instruments
20.1 Accounting policy
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments (‘derivatives’), in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest 
rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The way in which derivatives 
are used to manage the Group’s ﬁ nancial risk is detailed in Note 27 .
Derivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices 
at the balance sheet date. The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay 
to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the 
swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends upon whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Strict conditions have 
to be satisﬁ ed in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an 
ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂ ows 
attributable to the hedged risk. The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for 
hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement. No derivatives are held for speculative 
purposes.
 Net investment hedges
The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised 
in the Group Income Statement as part of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the 
gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading proﬁ t in the Group Income Statement.

21. Acquisition of Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, Net of Cash Acquired
The Group did not acquire any material interests in any companies during the year ended 31 December 2017 .
 Prior Year Acquisition
On 1 December 2016, the Group acquired a 100% ownership interest in Mastercodi Industrial Ltda, the mould and tundish 
ﬂ ux business of Carboox, for total consideration of £8.0m, of which £0.7m was deferred. The fair value of the net assets 
acquired was £4.9m and included identiﬁ ed intangible assets relating to customer relationships and trade names of £3.8m. 
The transaction resulted in the recognition of £3. 1m of goodwill attributable to the synergies which are expected from 
combining the business with the operations of the Group. 
During 2017 the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities were ﬁ nalised and resulted in a £0.3m adjustment to trade 
and other receivables. The ﬁ nal fair value of net assets acquired was £5.2m and the total goodwill recognised was £3.4m. 
22. Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations income during 2017 of £1.7m related to a release of provisions no longer required. 
Discontinued operations income during 2016 of £10.2m comprised a £9.0m tax credit relating to the release of a provision 
for possible China taxes (Note 10.2) and a £1.2m release of provisions no longer required.

27 . Financial Risk Management
27.1 Accounting policy
 (a) Non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition 
they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
 (b) Foreign currencies
The individual ﬁ nancial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
the results and ﬁ nancial position of each entity are translated into pound sterling, which is the presentational currency of 
the Group.
 Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
T ransactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i)   Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group Income Statement
(ii)  Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated
 T ranslation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pound sterling), its results 
and ﬁ nancial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i)  Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date
(ii)  Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average 
rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a speciﬁ c transaction, in which case the transaction rate 
is used
(iii)  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve 
in equity and are reclassiﬁ ed to proﬁ t or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of
 Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation 
are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassiﬁ ed to 
proﬁ t or loss on disposal of the net investment.
27 .2 Financial risk factors
The Group’s T reasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for 
managing the ﬁ nancial risks faced by the Group. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks, the most 
signiﬁ cant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
 (a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash ﬂ ows of the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments may ﬂ uctuate because 
of changes in market prices. The Group is principally exposed to market risk through ﬂ uctuations in exchange rates (‘currency 
risk’) and interest rates (‘interest rate risk’).
  Financial Statements

 Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and ﬁ nancial assets (being cash and short-term deposits) that are 
denominated in currencies other than pound sterling. The Group’s general policy is proportionally to match the currency 
proﬁ le of its core borrowings with the currency proﬁ le of its earnings and net assets. This is achieved, where necessary, by the 
use of forward foreign exchange contracts (‘FX swaps’). The currency proﬁ le of the Group’s borrowings and ﬁ nancial assets, 
reﬂ ecting the effect of the FX swaps, is shown in the table below.

from a 10% strengthening of sterling would increase reported equity by £13.0m (2016: £16.5m) and a corresponding 10% 
weakening of sterling would reduce equity by £15.9m (2016: £20.2m).

 (a) Market risk (continued)
 Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings. Where borrowings are held at ﬂ oating rates of 
interest, ﬂ uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash ﬂ ows associated with its interest payments, 
and where borrowings are held at ﬁ xed rates of interest, ﬂ uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the 
fair value of its borrowings. The Group’s policy is to maintain a mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate borrowings, within certain 
parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group had $200.0m and €130.0m (£26 1.3m in total) of US Private Placement Loan Notes 
(USPP) outstanding, which carry a ﬁ xed rate of interest, representing two-thirds of the Group’s total borrowings outstanding 
at that date. The interest rate proﬁ le of the Group’s borrowings and net debt is detailed in the tables below.

The ﬂ oating rate ﬁ nancial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate 
currency, plus a margin. The ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial liabilities of £26 1.3m (2016: £275.2m) have a weighted average interest rate 
of 3.8% (2016: 4.6%) and a weighted average period for which the rate is ﬁ xed of 6.9 years (2016: 4.2 years). The ﬁ nancial 
assets attract ﬂ oating rate interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Based upon the interest rate proﬁ le of the Group’s ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in 
market interest rates would increase both the net ﬁ nance costs charged in the Group Income Statement and the net interest 
paid in the Group Statement of Cash Flows by £0. 1m (2016: £0.5m), and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would 
decrease both the net ﬁ nance costs charged in the Group Income Statement and the net interest paid in the Group Statement 
of Cash Flows by £0. 1m (2016: £0.5m). Similarly , a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of £1 5.9m 
(2016: £10.7m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase 
of £17 .2m (2016: £1 1.4m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt. Financial Statements

 (b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difﬁ culties in meeting its ﬁ nancial obligations. The Group manages this risk 
by ensuring that it maintains sufﬁ cient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it 
can meet its operational cash ﬂ ow requirements and any maturing ﬁ nancial liabilities, whilst at all times operating within its 
ﬁ nancial covenants. The level of operational headroom provided by the Group’s committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at 
least annually as part of the Group’s three-year planning process. Where this process indicates a need for additional ﬁ nance, 
this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising 
ﬁ nance in the capital markets.
In December 2017 the US dollar portion of the US Private Placement (‘USPP’) debt of $1 10m matured. This debt was replaced 
with a Euro-denominated USPP comprising two €50m tranches. These were issued with maturity dates of 2027 and 2029 
respectively. 
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £563.4m (2016: £576.9m), of which £153.7m 
(2016: £158.3m) were undrawn. These undrawn facilities are due to expire in June 2022. The Group’s borrowing requirements 
are met by USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of £300.0m (2016: £300.0m). The USPP facility 
was fully drawn as at 31 December 2017 and amounted to £263.4m ($200.0m and €130.0m), of which $140.0m is repayable 
in 2020, €15.0m in 2021, $30.0m in 2023, €15.0m in 2025, €50.0m in 2027 , $30.0m in 2028 and €50.0m in 2029 . During 2017 , 
an option was exercised to extend the maturity date of £300m syndicated bank facility from June 2020 to June 2022.

27.3 Capital management
The Company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. It monitors its capital using a number 
of KPIs, including free cash ﬂ ow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and RONA (Note 4). 
The Group’s objectives when managing its capital are:
 > T o ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates 
within the ﬁ nancial covenants contained within its debt facilities
 > T o have available the necessary ﬁ nancial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future 
returns to investors
 > T o maintain sufﬁ cient ﬁ nancial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events
 > T o maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt
The Group operated within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has sufﬁ cient liquidity headroom 
within its committed debt facilities. Details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found 
in the Strategic Report on page 29.
27 .4 Cash pooling arrangements
The Group enters into notional cash pooling arrangements as part of its ongoing T reasury management activities. Certain 
cash pooling arrangements meet the criteria for offsetting as clariﬁ ed in amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments, as 
regards a legally enforceable right of set-off both in the ordinary course of business and in the event of default. The following

28. Employee Beneﬁ ts
28.1 Accounting policy
The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group Balance Sheet for the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans is the present 
value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms 
of the related pension liability. Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the asset 
ceiling, where this is the present value of any economic beneﬁ ts available in the form of refunds or reductions in future 
contributions in respect of the plans.
The expense for the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans is recognised in the Group Income Statement as shown in Note 28.8. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income; and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as 
a component of operating proﬁ t. Financial Statements

28.2 Group post-retirement plans
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution type, 
and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
The Group’s principal deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans are in the UK and the US, the beneﬁ ts of which are based upon the ﬁ nal 
pensionable salaries of plan members. The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered 
funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneﬁ ciaries. The principal risks faced by these plans 
comprise: (i) the risk that the value of the plan assets is not sufﬁ cient to meet all plan liabilities as they fall due; (ii) the risk that 
plan beneﬁ ciaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan assets; and (iii) the risk that the 
market-based factors used to value plan liabilities and assets change materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the 
value of available plan assets. The Group also has deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of 
those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
 (a) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans – UK
The Group’s main deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plan in the UK (‘the UK Plan’) is closed to new members and to future beneﬁ t 
accrual. The existing plan was established under a trust deed and is subject to the Pensions Act 2004 and guidance issued 
by the UK Pensions Regulator.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan T rustee in 
line with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2015. At that 
date, the market value of plan assets was £536.7m and this represented a funding level of 102% of the accrued plan beneﬁ ts 
at the time of £526.4m. Calculated on a ‘buy-out’ basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan beneﬁ ts with 
an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £687 .5m, representing a funding level of 78%. 
There is a “long-term scheme-speciﬁ c funding standard” in Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004. In terms of Part 3, the UK plan is 
subject to a requirement (“the statutory funding objective”) that it must have sufﬁ cient and appropriate assets to cover its 
technical provisions.  Such technical provisions are determined as part of the triennial valuation. Under the rules of the UK 
Plan, the T rustees, after consultation with the company, have the power to set the funding contributions taking into account 
the results of the triennial valuation, and the Pension Act 2004 legislation. Notwithstanding the latest funding valuation 
surplus, the Company agreed to make voluntary contributions of £2.0m in 2017 . Thereafter, the Company will fund the 
administration cost relating to the management of the UK Plan. 
The value of the UK Plan liabilities as at 31 December 2017 decreased to £490.8m (2016: £527 .4m). The decrease in the 
liabilities was driven mainly by beneﬁ ts paid from the scheme of £46.8m (2016: £28. 1m) in line with the trust deed and relevant 
legislation requirements. Correspondingly, the UK Plan assets decreased to £580.3m (2016: £601.4m) as assets were 
liquidated to fund the beneﬁ ts paid resulting in decreases in the values of the annuity insurance contract of £13.5m and the 
ﬁ xed income holdings of £33. 1m. 
Proposed amendments to IFRIC 14, The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
interaction, address how the powers of other parties, such as the trustees of the plan, affect an entity’s right of refund of a 
surplus from the plan. The Group has assessed the likely impact of the application of the interaction and concluded that it 
would not impact its ability to continue to recognise a pension surplus.
 (b) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans – US
The Group has a number of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans in the US, providing retirement beneﬁ ts based on ﬁ nal salary or a 
ﬁ xed beneﬁ t. The Group’s principal US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans are closed to new members and also to future beneﬁ t 
accrual for existing members. Actuarial valuations of the US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans are carried out every year and 
the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2016. At that date the market value of the plan assets was £49.2m, 
representing a funding level of 66.0% of funded accrued plan beneﬁ ts at that date (using the projected unit method of 
valuation) of £74.3m. Funding levels for the Group’s US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans are based upon annual valuations 
carried out by independent qualiﬁ ed actuaries and are governed by US Government regulations. The value of US plan 
liabilities decreased to £82.0m (2016: £86.8m) in 2017 , which was mainly attributable to beneﬁ ts paid of £4.0m in line with 
scheme rules and exchange gains of £7 .6m due to US dollar weakness. This signiﬁ cant decrease was partially offset by an 
interest accrual of £3. 1m and a loss of £3.8m due to the lower discount rate. The loss arising from changes in ﬁ nancial 
assumptions is solely attributable to the decrease in the discount rates to 3.4% (2016: 3.8%).
The Group’s US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans are subject to the minimum contribution requirements of Internal Revenue 
Code Sections 412 and 430. Contributions are determined by trustees, in consultation with the Company, based on the annual 
valuations which are submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. For the plan year beginning 1 January 2017 , the minimum 
required contribution was £nil as signiﬁ cant company contributions of $6m were made in 2016. However, under these funding 
laws and based on the plan deﬁ cit, minimum contributions in the period 2018-2020 are likely to be required and are expected 
to be in the $3m to $4m range. Voluntary contributions of $4m were made during 2017 .  Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

28.2 Group post-retirement plans (continued) 
 (c) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans – Germany
The Group has a number of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice 
in that country. The main plan was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2016 and replaced by a deﬁ ned contribution plan 
for new joiners. The net liability of the German plans at 31 December 2017 was £49.4m (2016: £45.3m). The increase was 
driven by the decrease in discount rate which resulted in an increase in the liability of £1.6m (2016: £5.8m); increased current 
service costs of £1.5m (2016: £1.2m); and exchange losses incurred of £1.9m (2016: £5.8m) due to the strengthening of the 
euro against the pound. 
 (d) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans – ROW
The Group has a number of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements across the rest of the world, the majority of which are 
located in Belgium. The net liability of the ROW plans at 31 December 2017 was £17 .9m (2016: £16.2m). The increase was 
mainly attributable to exchange losses of £0.5m (2016: £2. 1m) due to the weakening of the pound post-Brexit and signiﬁ cant 
services costs of £2.0m (2016: £2.3m) recognised in respect of the Belgian plans. These losses are offset by the contribution of 
£1.5m that was paid out during 2017 , thereby decreasing the liability. 
 (e) Deﬁ ned contribution pension plans
The total expense for the Group’s deﬁ ned contribution plans in the Group Income Statement amounted to £1 2.6m (2016: £10.8m 
continuing operations) and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
 (f) Multi-employer plans
Due to collective agreements, Vesuvius in the US participates together with other enterprises in union-run multi-employer 
pension plans for temporary workers hired on sites. Some of these plans are underfunded and all participating employers are 
ultimately liable for any deﬁ cit. If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan, it is required to make a withdrawal 
payment to the plan to cover its share of the total deﬁ cit in the plan. No reliable basis exists for allocation of the plans’ 
obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. Deﬁ cits in the plans may necessitate increased contributions 
in the future but the expectation is that this will remain relatively consistent based upon historical trends. These are currently 
accounted for as deﬁ ned contribution plans. In 2017 Vesuvius contributed £1.4m (2016: £1.2m) to these plans. 
28.3 Post-retirement liability valuation
The main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans, as detailed 
below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualiﬁ ed actuaries and include those used 
to determine regular service costs and the ﬁ nancing elements related to the plans’ assets and liabilities.  It is the Directors’ 
responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. 
Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used could affect the 
Group’s proﬁ t and ﬁ nancial position.
 (a) Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK, US and German deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reﬂ ect the characteristics and experience of the 
membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) All table, 
with future longevity improvements in line with the ‘core’ mortality improvement tables published in 2016 by the Continuous 
Mortality Investigation (CMI), with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum. For the Group’s US plans, the 
assumptions used have been based on the standard RP-2016 fully generational tables with projection scale BB, and the 
MP-2017 mortality improvement scale. The Group’s major plans in Germany have been valued using the modiﬁ ed Heubeck 
Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables. In respect of the life expectancy tables below, current pensioners are assumed to be 
65 years old, while future pensioners are assumed to be 45 years old.

Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3. 10 n/a 1.65 3. 15 n/a 1.55
The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the UK Plan for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be determined 
by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the Aon 
Hewitt AA-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash ﬂ ow data relating to the UK Plan 
liabilities; the US discount rate is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve; and the Germany discount rate is based on 
the yield on the iBoxx over ten-year euro corporates AA index.
The assumptions for UK price inﬂ ation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional 
government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 
1. 1 points lower (2016: 1. 1 points lower) than RPI-based inﬂ ation.
 (c) Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in signiﬁ cant IAS 19 actuarial assumptions
The following table analyses, for the Group’s main UK, US and Germany pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact 
on plan liabilities and assets resulting from changes to the most signiﬁ cant actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation 
purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Following the arrangement of buy-in agreements for the UK Plan pensioner liabilities in 2012,and the fact that US pensions 
are not inﬂ ation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment is not signiﬁ cant to 
the valuation of the Group’s overall pension liabilities.
As stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the inﬂ ation, 
interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements. The policy and 
the associated valuation are updated annually. Please refer to Note 28.7 (a) for further detail.  In respect of the liabilities so 
covered, which currently represent some 56.5% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions 
which impact on the value of those liabilities, also impact on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, 
thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk. This is also reﬂ ected in the following table which includes the sensitivity of the group’s 
material deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations and plan assets, where applicable, to changes in the weighted principal assumptions 
as follows:

 (a) UK Plan asset allocation
As at 31 December 2017 , of the UK Plan’s total assets, 47 .6% were represented by the annuity insurance contracts covering 
the UK Plan’s pension liabilities; 1 1.9% were allocated to equities; 33.0% to ﬁ xed income securities; 5. 1% to cash; and 2.4% to 
other assets. The ﬁ xed income asset class of the UK Plan includes a liability-driven investment portfolio of ﬁ nancial derivative 
contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plan’s assets would fall materially, relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
The UK Plan T rustee has entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with the Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC), 
whereby the UK Plan T rustee has paid insurance premiums to PIC to insure a signiﬁ cant portion of the UK Plan’s liabilities. 
Under this arrangement, the value of the PIC insurance contract matches the value of the liabilities because the inﬂ ation, 
interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities are eliminated. As at 31 December 201 7, 
the IAS 19 valuation of the PIC insurance contract value associated with the bought-in liabilities was £276. 1m (2016: £289.6m). 
The buy-in agreement ensures that the UK pension plan obligations in respect of all its retired members and their approved 
dependants are insured. The policy and the associated valuation are updated annually to reﬂ ect retirements and mortality. 
In the current year, the agreement based on speciﬁ c membership data covers 56.5% of UK pension plan obligations, 
removing all ﬁ nancial risks associated with this tranche of the liability.
 (b) Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t contributions in 2018
In 2018, the Group is expected to make contributions into its deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts 
plans of around £5.3m with speciﬁ c contributions of approximately £3.0m and £0.8m anticipated for the US Plan and 
UK Plan respectively.  Financial Statements

29. Share-based Payments
29.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangement for its employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the 
effect of market-based conditions, such as total shareholder return target upon which vesting for some awards is conditional, 
and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense 
recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non-market-based 
conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of 
grant. For grants with market-based conditions attached to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option 
pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

pricing model. The fair value of options with market-related performance conditions has been measured using the Monte 
Carlo model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the 
2.8 years (2016: 2.75 years) prior to the grant date. The risk-free rate of return was assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK 
ﬁ xed gilt with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option. At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, 
award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period between grant 
and vesting. Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends foregone during the vesting period. Financial Statements

30. T rade and Other Payables
30.1 Accounting policy
T rade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest method.

There is no signiﬁ cant difference between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other payables balances and the amount at 
which they are reported in the Group Balance Sheet.
Included within trade payables in the table above is £1.8m (2016: £nil) subject to a supplier ﬁ nancing agreement. Under the 
terms of this agreement, which the Group entered into as one of a series of measures aimed at improving control over its 
working capital, invoices received by the Group from approved suppliers are assigned to a third-party ﬁ nance company, 
which assumes legal responsibility for settling the amount owing directly with the supplier. The Group subsequently settles 
the amount owing to the ﬁ nance company. There is no cost to the Group from this arrangement. 
31. Leases
31.1 Accounting policy
Leases are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Beneﬁ ts received and receivable 
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
31.2 Operating lease commitments
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows:

Not later than one year 8.3 9.0

Later than ﬁ ve years 7. 9 7.0
T otal operating lease commitments 29.6 31.8
The Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. Where the 
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised 
in the Group Balance Sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a ﬁ nance lease obligation. Where all 
the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classiﬁ ed as an operating lease and neither 
the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group Balance Sheet. The net book value of the 
Group’s property, plant and equipment assets held under ﬁ nance lease contracts at 31 December 2017 was £4.6m 
(2016: £4.7m).
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within 
trading proﬁ t, amounted to £18.6m (2016: £17 .3m). Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

32. Provisions
32.1 Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the 
speciﬁ c risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
is recognised as a ﬁ nance cost.

* Restated to more appropriately reﬂ ect a provision for which an associated insurance asset exists. 
Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2017 of £64.2m (2016: £66.5m), £34.4m (2016: £39.9m) is recognised in the 
Group Balance Sheet within non-current liabilities and £29.8m (2016: £26.6m) within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in 
the fulﬁ lment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, 
together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in 
respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, 
including claims relating to product liability. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject 
to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outﬂ ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority 
of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly 
updated to reﬂ ect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. The opening balance has been restated by 
£7 .9m to present a provision for which an associated insurance asset exists. There was no material impact on the 2016 
performance statements and no restatement is required. 
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group Balance 
Sheet only when its value can be reliably measured by management. As at 31 December 2017 , £21.6m (2016: £22.8m) was 
recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which £20.7m (2016: £21.9m) is non-current. 
In assessing the probable costs and realisation certainty of provisions, or related assets, reasonable assumptions are made. 
Changes to the assumptions used could signiﬁ cantly alter the Director’s assessment of the value, timing or certainty of the 
costs or related amounts. 
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Group’s recognised initiatives to rationalise its operating 
activities. The balance of £22.9m as at 31 December 2017 comprises £2.7m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect 
of leases terminating between one and six years, and £20.2m in relation to expenditure on restructuring initiatives that have 
been announced which is expected to be paid out over the next year.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other 
regulatory requirements, workers’ compensation and medical claims, and from third-party claims. As the settlement of many 
of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to reasonable assumptions, legal or other regulatory process, the 
timing of the associated outﬂ ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be 
utilised over the next ﬁ ve years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reﬂ ect changed circumstances 
with regard to individual matters. During 2017 the Group recognised net charges of £1 1.7m (2016: £10.2m) in the Group 
Income Statement to provide for various litigation settlements and other claims.  Financial Statements

33. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of 
business are not reported in the Group Balance Sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are 
future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases (Note 31 ).
34. Contingent Liabilities
Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to £1. 1m (2016: £1.6m). Details 
of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in Note 10 to the Company Financial Statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Several of Vesuvius’ subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of 
which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware 
of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Provisions are made for the expected 
amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, and 
from third-party claims. 
Certain of Vesuvius’ subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products 
containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius. These suits usually also name 
many other product manufacturers. T o date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these 
subsidiaries. A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation 
to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius’ ﬁ nancial position or results of operations.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the 
timing and amount of the associated outﬂ ows is subject to some uncertainty (see Note 32 for further information).
35. Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates
35. 1 Investment in subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The subsidiaries , joint ventures and associates of Vesuvius plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are set out 
below. With the exception of Vesuvius Holdings Limited, whose ordinary share capital was directly held by Vesuvius plc, the 
ordinary capital of the companies listed below was wholly owned by a Vesuvius plc subsidiary as at 31 December 2017 .

35.2 Investment in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the 
net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement, which exists only 
when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. An associate is an entity 
over which the Group has signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence. Signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence is the power to participate in the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policy decisions of an entity, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
35. Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates (continued)
35. 1 Investment in subsidiaries (continued) Financial Statements

The Group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence/joint control is deemed to arise until the date on which signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence/joint control ceases to exist or 
when the interest becomes classiﬁ ed as an asset held for sale. The Consolidated Income Statement reﬂ ects the Group’s share 
of proﬁ t after tax of the related associates and joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost adjusted in respect of post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets, less any 
impairment in value.

under the historical cost convention.

following disclosures:
 >A cash ﬂ ow statement and related notes
 > Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
 > Disclosures in respect of capital management

2.2 Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of these accounts. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group and the Company.
2.3 Accounting policy
 Taxation
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted,

Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect 
of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred 
taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future proﬁ ts from which 
the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance 
of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been 
accrued as receivable.

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
8.2 Analysis of issued share capital
The issued and fully paid ordinary share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2017 was 278.5 million shares of

The Company only has one class of shares in issue, ordinary shares. All shareholders enjoy the same rights in relation to 
these shares, including rights in relation to voting at General Meetings of the Company, distribution of dividends and 
repayment of capital. 
9. Share-based Payments
9.1 Accounting policy
The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the 
effect of market-based conditions, such as the total shareholder return target upon which vesting for some of the awards 
is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect 
of other non-market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the 
fair value determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured 
using a form of stochastic option pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model.
9.2 Proﬁ t and loss account recognition
The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed 
between pages 99 to 105 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. A total of £0.7m was charged to the proﬁ t and loss account 
in the year with regard to share-based payments (2016: £0.5m).

Monte Carlo model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over 
the 2.8 years (2016: 2.75 years) prior to the grant date. The risk-free rate of return was assumed to be the yield to maturity 
on a UK ﬁ xed gilt with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option. At the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period 
between grant and vesting. Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends foregone during the vesting period.
10. Contingent Liabilities
Where the Company enters into ﬁ nancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company 
will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2017 
in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £563.4m (2016: £569.4m), which includes guarantees of 
$200.0m and €130.0m (2016: $310.0m and €30.0m) in respect of US Private Placement Loan Notes and £146.3m (2016: 
£141.7m) in respect of drawings under the syndicated bank facility; together with £150.8m (2016: £150.8m) in relation to a 
guarantee provided to the Company’s UK subsidiary which acts as T rustee for the Group’s UK pension plan. The guarantee 
is over all present and future pension liabilities of the plan and the contingent liability amount represents the net deﬁ cit on a 
buy-out basis as shown in the most recent triennial valuation.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain 
of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a 
number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Whilst the outcome of litigation and other 
disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of 
the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, 
have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations. 187

Share Fraud – Spot the Warning Signs
Investment scams are designed to look like genuine investments.
Have you been…
 > Contacted out of the blue 
 > Promised tempting returns and told the investment is safe 
 >Called repeatedly 
 > T old the offer is only available for a limited time? 
If so, you might have been contacted by fraudsters. 
How to Avoid Share Fraud 
1. Reject cold calls
If you have been contacted by telephone, email or post, or via 
a third party or at a seminar or exhibition, with an offer to buy 
or sell shares, the chances are that it’s a high-risk investment 
or a scam. Y ou should treat any offer with extreme caution. 
The safest thing to do is to ignore the approach and if you 
were contacted by phone to hang up on the call.
2. Check if the ﬁ rm is authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and recorded on the Financial Services register 
at www.fca.org.uk/register  
The Financial Services Register is a public record of all the ﬁ rms 
and individuals in the ﬁ nancial services industry that are, or 
have been, regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority 
and/or the FCA.  
3. Get impartial advice 
Think about getting impartial ﬁ nancial advice before you hand 
over any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the 
ﬁ rm that has approached you.  
Reporting a Scam 
If you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters 
please tell the FCA by contacting them on 0800 1 1 1 6768 (or 
+44 20 7066 1000 from outside the UK) or by using the share 
fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you 
can ﬁ nd out more about investment scams. 
If you have lost money to investment fraud, you should 
report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at 
www.actionfraud.police.uk.
