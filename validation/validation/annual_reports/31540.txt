Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
Overview
Last year saw the 30th anniversary of the start-up of Synectics. 
This landmark provided the occasion not only to celebrate the 
achievements of all those who have helped to build Synectics 
into a successful technology business, from the founders to our 
current apprentices, but also to reflect on what has changed 
and what endures.
I am pleased to say that during my engagement across the 
various parts of the business in 2017 I found a high degree of 
alignment around the enduring purpose and values of Synectics; 
I won’t repeat these, since they are set out in detail elsewhere, 
suffice it to say here that the core elements are, and have been 
for 30 years, value to customers and innovation. I believe these 
will remain the foundation for a sustainable and prosperous 
future for the Company.
During the 2016/17 financial year the Group’s results continued to 
reflect the impact of the 2015 collapse in global oil & gas prices on 
one of our largest customer sectors. Management has taken action 
to maintain profitability in that area by reducing costs, and delivered a 
very creditable increase in operating margin in our oil & gas activities 
last year. The Board remains convinced that the right course is to 
preserve the critical capability that underlies our leading market 
position in the sector, and indeed to focus on positioning the business 
to gain market share once the recovery is underway. We believe the 
right balance has been struck in the interests of long-term value.
Other underlying factors that influenced our results include a 
global gaming market that remained buoyant, increased demand 
from infrastructure customers, such as utilities, data centres and 
transport hubs, and a sharp decline in new bus deliveries in the UK.
Against that background, the Board is pleased with the performance 
of the Company for 2016/17, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the trend of growing profitability of our business 
operations to continue in the current financial year. In addition, 
opportunities have been identified for innovative development 
of our core product set, using emerging technology applications 
being introduced in other fields to expand Synectics’ offerings 
to its current markets. Consistent with our growth strategy, 
the Board has authorised a significant increase in research 
& development expense to capitalise on those opportunities. 
The increased expense for this investment means that the 
Board’s current expectations are for reported profits in 2017/18 
to be broadly flat compared to last year. Further detail is set 
out in the Outlook section below.
Results
For the year to 30 November 2017, Synectics’ consolidated 
revenue was £70.1 million (2016: £70.9 million). This reflected 
a reduction in gaming sector revenue following the exceptionally 
high level achieved in 2016, lower than expected revenues in 
UK transport, offset with progress in infrastructure projects 
and integrated systems.
An improvement in operating margins across both of the Group’s 
divisions led to a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax
1
 to 
£3.0 million (2016: £2.6 million). There were no material non-underlying 
costs in the year, so statutory profit before tax was also £3.0 million 
(2016: £2.0 million). Underlying diluted earnings per share were 15.2p 
(2016: 12.4p) and diluted earnings per share were 15.1p (2016: 8.8p). 
On a constant currency basis
2
, these results benefited directly by 
around £0.2 million from the impact of the depreciation of sterling 
across the year on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, 
this translation benefit was partially offset by corresponding increases 
in the sterling costs of US dollar-denominated components used 
in our systems sold in the UK.
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen, with net 
cash at 30 November 2017 of £3.8 million (2016: £2.2 million). 
The consolidated firm order book at year end was £24.4 million 
(2016: £26.2 million).
Dividend
The Board is recommending payment of an increased final 
dividend of 3.0p per share (2016: 2.0p), payable on 4 May 2018 
to shareholders registered on 3 April 2018, for approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 26 April 2018.
For 30 years, the core elements of Synectics’ 
purpose and values have been value to customers 
and innovation. I believe these will remain the 
foundation for a sustainable and prosperous 
future for the Company.”

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Introduction
People
I would like once again to pass on the Board’s sincere thanks to 
Synectics’ employees at all levels. This is an organisation with a culture 
of high expectations for commitment and performance, especially in 
delivering on our promises to customers. As such, the pressures on 
employees are often considerable and are consistently borne with 
fortitude and good humour. We recognise and are deeply grateful 
for their continuing contributions to the business.
Our annual employee opinion survey last summer demonstrated 
high and upward-trending results across most areas of the business. 
This reflected substantial efforts by management to increase 
communication and engagement throughout the Group. This 
effort, which is strongly supported by the Board, will continue. 
Strategy
Synectics’ strategy remains to create leadership positions within 
specialised sectors of the electronic security and surveillance industry, 
through the combination of expert, sector-specific market knowledge 
and, where appropriate, our own proprietary technologies. These 
proprietary technologies are based on open systems and built around 
Synectics’ core command and control integration software; they 
are developed specifically for our chosen specialist market sectors 
and provide fundamental differentiation from the offerings of 
mainstream suppliers in the wider electronic security market.
As the volume of digital data generated by high-end, video-centric 
security systems continues to grow exponentially, the complexity 
of extracting meaningful and actionable intelligence from that data is 
opening up many opportunities for innovation. Throughout its 30-year 
history, Synectics has consistently demonstrated the combination 
of deep technical capability and practical, expertise-based sales 
approach needed to benefit from such opportunities. This is 
essentially an entrepreneurial skill.
A core element of our strategy is to ensure that the business 
keeps building the culture and processes necessary to maintain 
that entrepreneurial essence at larger scale as we continue to grow.
Outlook
The 2018 financial year has begun in line with the Board’s expectations. 
The year will be marked by a number of positive and short-term 
negative countercurrents in our largest market sectors, and also 
by clear opportunities to invest organically in solidifying Synectics’ 
position as a market leader in specialist high-end surveillance. 
The Integration & Managed Services division continues to perform 
well, and we expect further growth in profits this year.
Within the larger Systems division, Synectics’ revenue and profit 
trends over the remainder of this year are likely to be different in 
our three major end-user segments:
• The gaming sector, which has performed exceptionally well in the 
last two years and where Synectics continues to gain market share, 
will see a respite in major new resort developments coming on 
stream in the Far East and a likely slowdown in surveillance upgrade 
programmes in the United States. Despite entering the current 
financial year with an order book and qualified pipeline of new 
business 50% higher than at the same time last year, we anticipate 
at this stage that the profit contribution from the sector in 2017/18, 
although still strong, is likely to be lower than last year’s.
• The global oil & gas surveillance sector should continue to 
generate a stable positive contribution to profits in the current 
year. There is evidence of a recent pick-up in market activity, 
and Synectics is well placed to benefit as soon as new projects 
come on line. However, the normal gestation period of upstream 
oil & gas projects means that the upturn in our revenues in that 
sector should not be expected before 2019.
• Following further investment in sales resources, revenues from 
the transport & infrastructure sector, outside the UK bus market, 
are expected to grow at an increased rate in 2017/18. 
Finally, after close evaluation the Board has authorised an increase 
of approximately £500,000 in this year’s research & development 
expense to accelerate Synectics’ development of our core software 
product base. We see an opportunity to provide sophisticated 
end users with real improvements in the capability, breadth and 
cost-effectiveness of their security systems. With its established 
customer base and trusted reputation for successful technical 
innovation, Synectics is ideally positioned to benefit from the 
increasing pace of developments in the wider information technology 
sphere, which we believe can now be profitably applied to our markets. 
Although this increased research & development is in one sense 
discretionary expenditure, the Board’s judgement is that the long-term 
interests of the Company will best be served by ensuring that we 
invest sufficient resources now to capitalise fully on the capabilities 
and market positions that Synectics has successfully established 
and built over recent years. 
Taken together, the above factors lead the Board to conclude that 
the Group’s consolidated underlying profit before tax in our 2018 
financial year is most likely to be broadly flat compared to last year, 
as the impact of growth in underlying current business is offset by 
increased investment in strengthening our position for the future.
We believe that Synectics continues to make good progress 
towards its objectives. The improvements made to management 
and operational structures over the past couple of years are working 
well, the Group is starting to behave much more like a single focussed 
business, and there is an apparent growing sense of confidence in 
most parts of our operations. The Board has recently reviewed the 
Group’s latest medium-term plans. It remains our belief that, given 
normal economic conditions, Synectics is capable within its current 
business base of achieving its targets of significant revenue growth 
from current levels, and an operating profit margin of 8–10%.

Chief Executive’s statement
Strategic review
These results are pleasing in their own right, and 
especially satisfying because they are the outcome 
of the applied skills and enormous dedication of 
our people, and of our continuing ability to meet 
new challenges while remaining true to the 
values which inspired our Company’s creation.”
 Paul Webb
 Chief Executive
We are immensely proud of the Company’s heritage, and the 
journey we have undertaken over the last 30 years.
The Company’s origins lie in a piece of innovative research & 
development work designed to tackle a major customer challenge 
at that time: the need to find a more efficient way of controlling 
and switching images in large CCTV systems. The problem was 
solved, the original customer bought the solution, another client 
quickly followed, and Synectics was born.
In many ways, the Company has changed beyond all recognition 
from that initial, experimental breakthrough, but in other, very 
important respects, it has remained constant.
Synectics’ first wave of success came primarily in the UK public 
sector, as we supported the government’s implementation of 
systems to increase the safety of public spaces throughout the 
country. However, we increasingly discovered that there were 
other sectors and other geographical markets where customers 
were seeking the sophisticated and high-quality, but easy to use, 
solutions which were becoming our stock in trade.
Our strategy has always been to focus on a limited number of 
specific industry verticals for which security, surveillance, and 
control systems are absolutely critical, organisations where often 
the stakes could not be higher. We build deep specialist knowledge 
of each of these industries, and deploy our expert teams around 
the world in the places where they are most needed and can 
deliver the greatest value to those particular customers.
Today, we serve leading organisations in the transport, oil & gas, 
gaming, critical infrastructure, and retail sectors. We have major 
regional centres in the US, Singapore, the UAE, and Germany, 
as well as in our original homeland, the UK, and from these hubs 
we serve customers in dozens of countries. We are designing 
and deploying the security systems for the new Jakarta airport; 
we provide the command and control solutions deployed across 
Berlin’s integrated transport network; we monitor over 5,000 video 
channels for one of the largest casinos in Las Vegas; we serve vast 
energy facilities in the Middle East; and we continue to protect 
many of the most important buildings and facilities in the UK, 
from nuclear power stations to national heritage sites.
However, while the scale and geographical scope of our operations 
has expanded dramatically, the core values which underpin our 
business have remained exactly the same. Right from the start, we 
have always been an innovative, problem-solving, customer-driven 
company. As we have achieved the scale required to serve some 
of the world’s largest organisations, and developed industry-leading 
technology such as our Synergy 3 platform, we have always retained 
the emphasis on technical expertise, high-quality solutions, customer 
service, and sheer human commitment which we believe make 
us distinctive.
The challenge for any business of course, and Synectics is no 
exception, is to continue to translate its inherent strengths and 
core values into products and services which meet the needs 
of a changing world.
In the security and surveillance business, change brings its 
own specific challenges. The priorities are the protection of people 
and assets, and in turn the people those assets serve. This is not 
an environment where it pays to take undue risks. The systems 
and solutions we provide must be absolutely robust, and rigorously 
proven to work under the most extreme conditions – and they are. 
However, technology is now advancing at such speed, on so 
many fronts, that it is provoking us and our customers to rethink 
the way we tackle problems, and offering us many ways to do 
things better. At the same time, technology alters or expands 
the nature of the risks against which we protect. Our customers 
are constantly having to adapt to new types of potential threat. 07
Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic review
The sheer breadth and pace of technological change is 
unprecedented. Artificial intelligence, driverless vehicles, 
the internet of things, cyber security, 3D printing, the platform 
economy, the cloud, and many other strands have become an 
increasing part not just of the technical dictionary but of everyday 
vocabulary, to say nothing of the potential of vast databases 
which still remain largely underutilised.
While the potential of new technologies is often identified quite 
early in their evolution, the way in which people adopt, combine, 
and apply them can be less easy to foresee. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that when we talk to our customers about how their 
world is changing and what they will need from us in the future, 
one word which keeps coming up is ‘agility’. Our clients expect 
change to be rapid, dramatic and, above all, unpredictable, both 
in terms of new risks against which they may need to protect, 
and the opportunities to harness capabilities in innovative 
and practical ways to provide better solutions.
Another theme which comes through repeatedly is intuitiveness, 
the requirement for specialist systems to be easy and instinctive 
to use. Integration of data and openness of systems are also high 
on the list of requirements. Pre-emption, too, is another strong 
theme as our clients assess the potential applications of artificial 
intelligence for anticipating threats and responding proactively.
At Synectics, we see that the qualities our customers are seeking 
in this dynamic, unpredictable future are exactly those which 
characterised the birth of our Company 30 years ago. 
These include the agility that comes when world-class technical 
expertise is combined with passionate human commitment; the 
ability to innovate in practical ways and apply emerging technologies 
to solve new problems; the willingness above all to see our customers 
and their customers as people, and to do our utmost to make them 
safer and enable them to prosper and enjoy their lives.
Our business has made further strides over the past year. As 
you will find documented elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are 
pleased to report a substantially improved profit performance and 
a solid balance sheet. These results are pleasing in their own right, 
and especially satisfying because they are the outcome of the 
applied skills and enormous dedication of our people, and of 
our continuing ability to meet new challenges while remaining 
true to the values which inspired our Company’s creation.
We and our customers will face many new demands in the coming 
years as we seek to harness the potential of exciting technologies 
to provide new solutions in a profoundly uncertain world. I am 
confident that we have the capabilities, the expertise, and the 
culture to rise to these challenges.

Chief Executive’s statement continued
We serve our customers through two business models.
Our Systems businesses, marketed under the Synectics brand, 
secure major contracts for the design, development, and deployment 
of security and surveillance solutions founded on our Synergy 3 
platform. We identify future opportunities at an early stage, and work 
closely with customers to create solutions tailored to their needs.
Our Integration & Managed Services (‘IMS’) business, trading under 
the Quadrant Security Group (‘Quadrant’) and SSS Management 
Services (‘SSS’) brands, serves customers by designing security, 
surveillance, and facilities management solutions, and then 
implementing, maintaining, and supporting them over time.
By adhering closely to our principles, we benefit from high levels 
of contract renewal and recommendations to new clients.
We have already highlighted the technological changes impacting 
our customers and our own business. The transformations we are 
witnessing on many fronts will inevitably influence the way that we, 
and other players in our industry, operate in the future.
For example, hardware costs will continue to fall over time, as even 
the most specialist equipment benefits from new technologies and 
efficiencies. In our view, the real value differentiators in our industry 
already reside in the expertise to design and deliver lasting solutions 
to complex problems and in the delivery of consistently excellent 
service. These will continue to grow in importance in all areas 
of our business.
Offering two complementary service models allows us the 
flexibility to work with each of our customers in the way that best 
suits them. It also creates benefits from a commercial standpoint. 
Although the Systems business is built around long-term client 
relationships, much of the activity itself is project based, affording 
the opportunity to secure large new streams of work and drive 
growth. The IMS business includes a significant proportion of 
continuous contractual commitments, with the advantages 
these bring for resource planning and financial forecasting.
This combination of commercial stability and excellent growth 
potential makes Synectics plc an attractive proposition for investors. 
It also represents a powerful proposition for our customers, who 
value the agility and problem solving we provide alongside our 
reputation for consistency and durability. It allows us to offer our 
employees exciting opportunities, short and long term, within 
a culture which values and rewards their commitment.
Our business model 09

In both models, our emphasis is on building deep and lasting relationships with 
customers. This is integral to every aspect of the way we go about our business, 
and is founded on some simple principles.

Our solutions must deliver exactly what the customer needs.
EASE
The systems must be easy to use.
RELIABILITY
Our products and services must guarantee absolute reliability, even under the most testing circumstances.

Oil & Gas
Monitoring onshore and offshore 
sites across the globe
Synectics is a major global player in the 
oil & gas sector, and in the marine markets, 
which share many of the same needs. We 
have built deep specialist knowledge of the 
industry, and of the particular challenges 
associated with protecting its infrastructure 
and people, often in remote locations 
under extreme conditions.
In this most global of industries, Synectics 
has built an enviable worldwide reputation. 
We work with customers and partners 
throughout Europe and the Middle East. 
In the APAC region, we have been active 
in Australia, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Thailand for many years, 
and we are continuing to expand in South 
Korea, Japan, and China. To the west, 
we are undertaking major projects 
in the US and Mexico.
The industry itself is in transition and 
we are successfully navigating our way 
through what continues to be an extremely 
tough market. It is not clear how quickly 
trading conditions will improve, although 
we are starting to see some initial signs 
of a return to investment in long-term 
projects. This is encouraging, but it is 
too early to be sure that this marks the 
beginning of a sustained recovery.
The agility at the heart of Synectics’ DNA 
gives us a significant competitive advantage 
in the oil & gas market. We restructured our 
operations last year and this has given us 
an excellent platform from which to serve 
the needs our customers are likely to have 
in the immediate future. Alongside this, 
we are investing to ensure that we keep 
our product range at the cutting edge 
of the industry and anticipate our clients’ 
ambitions when the market returns.
Our customers face extraordinarily complex 
challenges in ensuring the security of their 
sites: safeguarding on-site personnel; 
protecting offshore and onshore pipeline 
locations; and monitoring hazardous and 
explosive areas. Consequently, they demand 
solutions that are rigorously proven under 
these circumstances, and which also satisfy 
the constantly changing requirements of 
compliance legislation. 
The Synectics proposition is based around 
turnkey solutions, long-standing industry 
expertise, and a specialist product range 
(COEX and Synergy) with an exceptional 
track record of reliability in the uniquely 
demanding conditions our customers face.
By definition, many of the facilities we 
protect are in remote locations. The systems 
and products we deploy must be faultless. 
They must also facilitate remote monitoring 
and analysis, often thousands of miles away 
from the site itself. Conditions are often 
extreme. One site we protect experiences 
temperatures which oscillate between 
40ºC in summer and -40ºC in winter. 
We have demonstrated time and again 
that we can enable our clients to meet 
the exceptional challenges they face.
The oil & gas industry is founded on 
team work, with many different sources of 
specialist expertise combining to overcome 
some of the most fearsome challenges on 
Earth. Our projects frequently involve working 
in partnership not only with our end clients, 
the companies which own and operate the 
oil & gas installations, but with the engineers, 
construction firms, telecommunications 
providers, and other specialist security and 
surveillance firms with whom our customers 
also have relationships. We succeed by 
building strong, enduring relationships 
at every level. The collective and individual 
reputations of our people create a foundation 
of trust and mutual commitment which 
allows us to interact successfully with 
other stakeholders throughout every 
stage of a project.

environments of all, those hosting offshore oil & gas installations.
Our COEX camera stations are widely used in the industry to 
ensure continuous, reliable image capture in all lighting, weather, 
and operational conditions.
In the past year, we have delivered a series of high-profile offshore 
oil & gas projects, including a solution for a major US deep-water 
floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
The system incorporates full HD Class 1, Division 1 COEX™ C3000 
camera stations to monitor both hazardous and safe area zones.
Explosion proof and certified to the highest international standards, 
the camera stations deployed on the floating platform will utilise 
Synectics’ recently launched integrated power base technology.
This technology is particularly suited to offshore and marine 
applications where cost-efficient, practical use of space is essential. 
The self-contained base can house fibre optics and provides integral 
power conversion, allowing mains connectivity and eliminating any 
need for a separate junction box.
Darren Alder, Synectics’ Divisional Director for Oil & Gas, says:  
“To suggest it has been a challenging few years for the oil & gas 
industry would be an understatement, yet during this time we 
have continued to secure key contracts by offering tailored 
end-to-end solutions which meet precise needs, based 
upon our specialist technology.
“The uniquely demanding requirements of offshore security and 
surveillance have always played to our strengths. This particular 
project provides an excellent demonstration of our ability to add 
distinctive value for our customers in areas like security, safety, 
and situational awareness.”
In oil & gas, taking the long-term view is 
crucial. We engage with our end customers 
and their partners from the very earliest 
stages of a new installation or upgrade, 
providing input and advice from the start. 
This personal commitment, an understanding 
second to none of every nuance of the 
industry’s complexities, and a technology 
platform and product perfectly suited to 
our customers’ needs lie at the heart 
of our success.
• We monitor the world’s largest 
gas-to-liquids plant, Shell Pearl in Qatar, 
with over 340 cameras across the site.
• We have delivered over 10,000 COEX 
camera stations in the last ten years 
to oil & gas and marine installations 
across the globe.
• We protect the largest, most expensive 
floating structure ever built (Shell Prelude 
Floating Liquefied Natural Gas Facility).
Their people are well versed; 
they’re very familiar with our 
business and our operating 
environment.”

Gaming
Enterprise-class recording 
and monitoring
Synectics is a global leader in the gaming 
sector, with a strong presence in both 
North America and APAC. We have enjoyed 
great success in this industry in recent 
years, successfully delivering a series of 
large-scale projects and expanding what 
was originally a North American-based 
business into a truly worldwide operation.
The underlying dynamics of the gaming 
sector remain strong. We anticipate that 
investment in large new casino builds in 
Asia and the US may slow in 2018, but 
will rebound thereafter. This should create 
further growth opportunities in the many 
Asian markets we already serve, including 
Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Korea, Vietnam and, potentially, Taiwan, 
Japan, and Thailand. We continue to be 
a major player in the US market and we 
are also active in Canada and Europe, 
and with global cruise lines.
In many respects, the need for security 
and surveillance in the gaming industry is 
very different from that in other sectors. 
Safeguarding people is always the first 
priority, but our customers here also 
face other challenges. They must be 
able to monitor activity within each casino 
constantly, analyse suspicious behaviour 
in real time, and respond appropriately 
and swiftly when necessary. 
First and foremost, an effective gaming 
surveillance solution empowers users to 
work smarter, giving them the information 
they need to mitigate the risk of player scams, 
fraudulent claims, staff collusion, and other 
security infringements. Meeting the industry’s 
demanding regulatory requirements is a 
‘must have’ – no casino can operate without 
fulfilling these responsibilities. However, 
the solutions we design and deliver go far 
beyond this to give our customers access 
to high-quality video with a speed and 
flexibility which enables a real-time 
response to any challenge.
We place great emphasis on customising the 
user experience we provide for staff within 
each of our clients. Our systems create the 
ability to combine data events from multiple 
sources, for example alarm, transactional, 
and analytical systems, to facilitate rapid 
evaluation of an evolving situation.
Casino operators value Synectics for 
our ability to deliver ultra-reliable, scalable, 
end-to-end solutions, backed up by proven 
experience, industry knowledge, and 
technically expert staff who respond fast. 
Today, we offer a turnkey approach that 
includes hardware, software, cameras and 
the integration of all these into one solution. 
Our solutions are built using the unique 
features and capabilities of the Synergy 3 
software platform, and offer the flexibility 
to work with customers’ existing hardware 
and their preferred integrator partners as 
required. Our software continues to evolve, 
embracing command and control platforms, 
integration of multiple applications into one 
user interface, and more sophisticated 
reporting and data analytics.
While the gaming industry has many unique 
characteristics, the fundamentals of our 
business here have much in common with 
other sectors. Our success is founded on 
deep specialist knowledge of the sector, 
and the ability of our expert technical 
and service teams to tailor our systems 
to meet the specific challenges these 
customers face.

Supporting the largest 
resorts in the world
Synectics has established an enviable position as a leading global 
specialist in providing solutions for the unique requirements of the 
gaming and leisure industries. 
The multi-phase project we are undertaking with a major Korean 
mega resort is our third major casino project in South Korea and 
offers further evidence of our capabilities for supporting the world’s 
largest mega resorts.
The first phase of the programme will see our Synergy 3 platform 
deployed to allow centralised control and management of 2,300 
third-party and proprietary cameras spread across the casino, 
the nearby theme park, and one of the resort’s five-star hotels. 
The end-to-end solution designed and deployed by Synectics will also 
integrate with key security and management systems, including access 
control, point of sale, and the resort’s radio frequency identification 
solution. This gives operatives in the central control room complete 
visual and data-driven situational awareness of people, assets, 
and movements across the resort. 
The solution also includes a customised training package for the 
company, enabling the organisation to upskill its operators and to 
ensure that the potential of Synergy 3’s extensive range of powerful 
features is fully realised. 
Adam Heisler, Sales Director for International Gaming, said: 
“This latest Asian project again demonstrates our continued success 
and our reputation as the leader in the region for delivering complex 
surveillance solutions for large-scale mega resorts. The challenges 
that these specific types of estate face in terms of regulations, 
channel count, and redundancy and resilience are unparalleled.” 14

Integrated solutions for transportation 
and infrastructure
T ransport & 
Infrastructure
Synectics works extensively across the 
mass transportation sectors – buses, trams, 
subway/underground networks, and trains. 
Our customers include the operators of many 
different forms of transport, as well as the 
manufacturers of the vehicles themselves. 
We also have deep experience of working 
with the organisations which create and run 
the transport infrastructure – the stations, 
city transport systems, airports, and ports.
Each of these diverse clients has its own 
specific needs; running a city bus company 
presents very different challenges to operating 
an international airport. Our approach, 
as always, is to work closely with each 
individual customer, and where relevant 
their other partners, and tailor our underlying 
technologies and capabilities to address 
their particular requirements.
However, in broader terms, we are 
increasingly witnessing some convergence 
in the overarching issues these organisations 
are seeking to tackle. To a significant degree, 
this is being driven by the rapid advances in 
technological possibilities and the resulting 
step changes in the service that transport 
organisations are able to offer their 
own customers.
When we first worked with bus, tram, 
and train operators, the main priority was 
to provide effective onboard surveillance 
systems which could protect staff and 
passengers and deliver regulatory compliance. 
Now, this is a given. Many customers are 
now looking for integrated systems and 
sophisticated applications whose capabilities 
go way beyond the minimum requirements. 
Organisations responsible for transport 
infrastructures, whether urban mass transit 
networks or international airports, are 
engaging with many of the same issues.
The solutions are expanding to deliver 
far-reaching benefits, from up-to-the-minute 
information for customers through to powerful 
control systems which allow operators and 
transport authorities to respond to incidents 
in real time, or even anticipate them.
These developments play to our strengths. 
We know from our conversations with 
customers that they are looking more 
than ever for suppliers and partners who 
can provide the integration of systems, 
intuitiveness of applications, pre-emptive 
solutions, and agility of service response 
which will deliver the control they seek. 
However, not all customers require complex 
solutions. We are able to offer great flexibility, 
addressing the entry level needs efficiently 
whilst anticipating and delivering against 
the more ambitious requirements.
Underpinning all this are the decades of 
experience we have built up across the full 
spectrum of transport operations – from 
London buses to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport.
Synectics plays a unique role. We offer smart, 
flexible, user-friendly solutions, founded on 
our Synergy 3 software, to customers who 
have complex needs and face challenges 
which justify serious investment. We have 
the scale and experience to deliver large-scale 
projects, but retain the agility of a high-value 
challenger brand, where expertise, flexibility, 
desire, and a strong personal service ethic 
can be brought to bear.
We deploy our solutions around the world, 
including Europe, the Middle East, and 
Southeast Asia.

Deploying integrated 
systems to provide 
better customer service 
and improve safety
‘Integration’ is a word which is constantly on the lips of our 
transport clients. They are looking to connect much wider functionality 
into conventional security and surveillance systems in order to provide a 
better service to their customers. They also want to be able to integrate 
information seamlessly between their vehicles – trains, trams, and 
buses – and their control centres, so that they can address evolving 
situations in real time.
The flexibility and openness of our systems and our ability to 
solve multi-dimensional problems make Synectics a natural partner for 
transport operators. In Germany, for example, Synectics is developing 
and implementing a new train-to-ground solution that will enable 
a major rapid transit operator to respond more effectively to 
passenger requests for assistance. 
Following a year-long competitive tender process, which identified 
Synectics as the most suitable provider to deliver against the complex 
technical requirements involved, we were chosen to design and deploy 
the tailored solution across 680 trains servicing the capital every day.
Synectics has developed an audio gateway hardware solution 
which interfaces with the passenger help system onboard the trains. 
Using Synectics’ Synergy command and control platform to integrate 
the communications data, authorised personnel based at a central 
command centre will be alerted when an on-vehicle help button is 
triggered. The operative can talk directly with the passenger and take 
the appropriate action to address a problem or provide urgent help. 
The new solution will replace the client’s previous system, which 
required all passenger help requests to be directed via the driver.
David Aindow, Synectics’ Business Strategy Director, explains: “This 
new system will ensure passengers who need help are immediately 
connected with someone who has an overarching view of the network. 
This provides a better service for the customer, and avoids distracting 
the drivers from their ultimate responsibility, which is to ensure 
that passengers arrive at their destination safely.” Strategic review

Integrated, turnkey solutions 
for urban environments
Our very first clients, 30 years ago, came 
from these sectors. We quickly established 
a strong track record of delivering turnkey, 
end-to-end solutions, and have maintained 
and extended our reputation ever since.
Synectics’ Systems division serves these 
customers globally, while our IMS teams 
at Quadrant and SSS operate primarily in the 
UK market. Our strength in solution design, 
integration, outsourced management, 
and processes has allowed us to take 
an ever-widening role in the protection 
of critical and high-security sites, 
infrastructure, and employees.
Within this overall marketplace, Synectics 
and Quadrant support a series of more 
specific customer groups, each with 
distinct needs.
• In commercial high security, organisations 
such as major utilities providers and 
financial institutions seek sophisticated, 
value-added solutions from partners with 
the credentials and proven track record 
to support their high-profile operations. 
There is a growing demand for greater 
integration of security systems with other 
operational and building management 
systems, and we are exceptionally 
well placed to deliver this.
• In the public sector, our involvement 
is centred primarily on clients who have 
both the requirement for more complex, 
value-adding solutions and the wherewithal 
to fund major projects. These are more 
prevalent in sectors such as energy 
(including nuclear), defence, borders, 
custodial, heritage buildings, 
and universities.
In both the public and private sectors, 
customers are being impacted by some 
of the wider trends we refer to elsewhere 
in this year’s Annual Report. We are at the 
forefront of helping our clients to harness 
smart analytics which can anticipate and 
pre-empt potential threats, utilise large-scale 
databases to help protect stadia, shopping 
centres and other public spaces, and develop 
and deploy the integrated solutions enabled 
by new generations of IP networks and 
a secure cloud. 
Our SSS business excels in providing 
security and facilities management services 
to UK clients with complex multi-site estates, 
particularly in the retail and leisure sectors. 
We help these customers protect and 
maintain their facilities around the clock, 
while managing the 24/7 on-call support 
this entails in the most cost-efficient way.
We have remained at the forefront of 
developing new generation computer 
aided facilities management systems 
which provide tailored reporting to 
allow our clients to monitor activity 
and ensure they achieve their goals. 
One of the factors in SSS’s success 
is that, like our business as a whole, 
it combines the scale, resources, and 
experience required to handle large, 
continuous programmes, with the 
kind of dedicated and tailored customer 
service more commonly associated 
with a smaller firm. 
The FM market remains buoyant, 
sustained by the ongoing need among 
many types of businesses to outsource 
facilities management services and to 
integrate these with robust security 
and surveillance capabilities.

Enabling real-time 
response across a vast 
estate of critical assets
Synectics has been closely associated with protecting critical 
infrastructure since the inception of the Company, but the scale 
and sophistication of our solutions is constantly evolving.
We are currently working with one of Europe’s largest utilities 
operators to boost the reach and capability of its alarm receiving 
centre (‘ARC’). The customer is using Synergy 3 command and 
control software to enable centralised security monitoring and 
management of its national network of sites and assets. 
The integrated solution developed and deployed by Synectics 
will allow the organisation to monitor and control security and 
safety systems at over 60 sites. These will include manned facilities, 
unmanned substations, and sites critical to national infrastructure 
and requiring the highest levels of protection.
Utilising Synergy 3’s open architecture, the advanced solution 
will integrate data inputs from emergency alarms, sensors, analytics, 
perimeter detection and audio call points, and access control with 
video footage – from Synectics’ COEX and third-party cameras – 
and GIS mapping. All of this will provide operatives with a real-time 
view of any anomalous event and its precise location, the means with 
which to investigate immediately, and the ability to take rapid action. 
The system also enables staff in the control centre to speak directly 
with colleagues at the site via audio point systems. 
Greg Alcorn, Synectics’ Divisional Director for Transport & Infrastructure, 
emphasises that the whole solution has been designed with both efficiency 
and operator support in mind: “For any customer of this scale, providing 
immediate understanding of an incident is essential, but this solution 
goes much further to give operators at the ARC the support they 
need to protect such a vast number of sites.” 18

Our proprietary technology
It all started with three people working after hours in a research 
& development lab. They were trying to crack a problem which had 
defeated the rest of the industry and was causing great frustration 
to customers who were looking to deploy CCTV systems more 
flexibly and on a much larger scale than previously. A solution 
was found, customers signed up, and Synectics was born.
Our Company was founded, then, on applying human ingenuity 
and emerging technologies to create practical solutions. Crucially, 
they were solutions built by security and surveillance professionals 
for security and surveillance professionals.
It has been that way ever since. We understand intimately the world 
in which our clients operate; the small details which can make the 
difference between success and failure; and the design touches 
which make an interface easier to use.
We have stayed focussed. As the Company evolved, we identified 
industries where we believed we could add the most value and 
where security challenges are mission critical and have a scale 
and complexity which leverage the full value of the capabilities 
we provide.
Today, our core technologies are applied primarily in four main 
sectors: oil & gas, gaming, transport & infrastructure, and high 
security & public space. Offshore oil rigs, casinos, buses and 
power stations – the working environments really could not 
be more different. In each case, our specialists have decades 
of experience in adapting and tailoring our capabilities to meet 
the needs of professionals in each of these industries, down 
to the finest detail.
We have constantly developed and refreshed our own core 
technology, especially our software. Today, the heartbeat of our 
solutions is Synergy 3, an innovative, highly flexible platform which 
marks us as a technical leader in our industry. The first generation 
of Synergy was launched in 2001 as a revolutionary command and 
control system. Successive waves of innovation have consistently 
kept us ahead of the curve.
Today’s Synergy 3 is extraordinarily powerful. It provides the 
foundations for solutions which can be configured specifically 
for each customer. We can design applications to follow the 
workflow of each user, so that it feels like ‘my’ system and 
does what ‘I’ need it to do.
Smart graphical interfaces and all round user-friendliness are critical 
to this experience. Our view has always been that security experts 
deserve technologies which mould easily and intuitively around 
their requirements. So that is what we provide.
The technological advances all around us will have a profound 
impact on our industry. Artificial intelligence will play a major role 
in making surveillance systems smarter, better able to anticipate 
and pre-empt threats, and hence more effective in protecting us 
all. ‘Big data’ can be harnessed to deliver not only smarter control 
systems but a better experience for the customers of the clients 
we serve. The flexibility and interoperability of systems, always 
central to our thinking, is improving all the time.
New capabilities also bring new threats. We, and our clients, 
need to ensure that we are prepared to address new challenges 
and to respond rapidly and with great agility in a fast-changing 
and unpredictable world.
We are already investing in the next generation of solutions. 
Synectics will always be an innovator. Even more importantly, 
we are constantly exploring with our customers how their 
requirements are evolving so that our innovation is focussed, 
as it always has been, on solving practical problems.
Our technical development is targeted at the areas where 
real specialism pays dividends, especially in the software tools 
and underlying platform which are fundamental to creating the 
applications and user experience we offer. We also develop the 
proprietary specialist hardware needed in environments for which 
generic products are simply not sufficient, for example in the oil 
& gas and marine industries where our COEX camera stations 
are widely deployed.

Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic review
However, many of the individual components in a security and 
surveillance solution are relatively generic. Much of the hardware 
can often be obtained on the open market at highly competitive 
prices. Where industry standard components are perfectly suited 
to the job in hand, we use what is already available and integrate 
it into our systems.
Integration and interoperability – multiple systems truly working 
together – are becoming more and more important for our customers. 
When organisations upgrade their capabilities, they often want to 
be able to build on what they already have and enhance it. Increasingly, 
customers want to be able to connect multiple systems together. 
For example, in the transport industry, security and surveillance 
tools can form part of wider command and control systems which 
support a wide range of functionality, from fast response to any 
incident to improved information and service for the passenger.
We are at the forefront of these developments. We build open 
systems, and apply technology with an agility of mind and practicality 
of purpose which have characterised our work from the start, and 
which will be crucial to our future success, and that of our clients.

In today’s world of big data, obtaining the relevant 
information to inform or drive actions at the right 
time, along with presenting the results in an easy 
to understand format, is a highly time-consuming 
task for system managers.
Synergy 3’s business intelligence engine, Dataveillance, 
extrapolates data from multiple sources to deliver real-time 
or historical statistics and trend analysis. Using selectable 
filters and rules, dynamic management dashboards can 
be easily created and consist of multiple display formats 
which can be tailored to present specifically selected data 
sets or real-time statistical analysis. The ability to access 
and review relevant data at a glance is crucial in times of 
pressure, delivering comprehensive situational awareness 
to enable informed operational or commercial decisions.
Agility of business decisions is crucial, 
particularly as incidents develop, to ensure 
consistent and cohesive responses. Our

Our people and values
As Synectics has grown from our humble beginnings into a truly 
global force, we have always sought to remain true to the human 
values we have held from the very start.
As with any successful formula, the principles are simple:
• Everything we do is founded on a deep understanding of our 
customers, the environments they work in, and the challenges 
they need to solve.
• We innovate constantly, finding new answers to tough, 
previously unresolved problems.
• Our relationships, inside the Company and beyond, are built 
upon mutual respect for the expertise we each bring to the 
team in order to create solutions.
• And above all, we care, passionately, about doing the right thing, 
and about delivering the very best for our customers, and for 
the people they serve and protect.
We have always understood that our business is about more than 
technology. Paradoxically perhaps, in an era of unprecedented 
technical change our people are more important than ever.
Our success in retaining our ‘human touch’, even though the scale 
of our operations has expanded greatly, is one of the achievements 
of which we are most proud. In our regular customer surveys, our 
clients consistently rate us highly for our “excellent understanding 
of their needs” and “really caring about doing a great job”. There 
are frequent references in their feedback to our people “going the 
extra mile” and being a pleasure to work with.
Of course commitment can only take you so far unless it is backed 
up by world-class expertise. A vital aspect of our Company is that 
we are, and have always been, security and surveillance specialists, 
not technology generalists.
Our teams have decades of experience of working in the industry. 
We understand intuitively what our customers need, from the big 
picture – the sheer scale and complexity of what has to be accomplished 
– to the minute detail of how a user interface must be designed to 
make the operator’s job as straightforward as possible and save 
vital seconds at a crucial moment.
To safeguard these deep-rooted cultural strengths, and ensure they 
are passed on to new generations of experts, we invest heavily in 
training, at all levels and in all the disciplines which are relevant to 
our business, from technical skills to leadership capabilities. 
We place great emphasis on recruiting the right people. We have 
strengthened our team significantly by hiring experienced professionals 
who share our values, and by building an excellent group of talented 
young professionals who bring the technical skills and passion for 
innovation we need to constantly refresh our gene pool.
Retaining and developing our best people is critical to our success. We 
are delighted that we have been able to fill a series of senior positions 
in recent years through internal succession planning, including the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director, and three key leadership roles.
Our reputation is built on trust, reliability, and lasting client relationships. 
We are in this for the long haul – we always have been – and we 
are immensely proud of the people, young and less young, who 
sustain the principles upon which our business was founded.
In 2017, Synectics supported over 20 local and national charities 
with corporate donations to the British Heart Foundation and UNICEF, 
and support of individual staff members’ personal charity challenges.

a very talented colleague and a tremendous professional 
who contributed enormously to the growth and success of 
the Company. Above all, he was a lovely man, universally

In Nigel’s honour, we created the Nigel Poultney Memorial 
Award. This is presented annually to an employee, at any level

The recipient of the inaugural award in 2017 was Greg Rogan, 
Engineering Manager of our gaming team in Asia.
In presenting Greg with the award, Synectics plc Vice 
President of Global Gaming, John Katnic, highlighted some 
of the qualities which made him such a deserving winner.
“ Greg oversees a nine-person engineering team in Asia and

Group financial results
The Group continued to perform well in 2017 
with total profit from operations of £3.1 million.”

Keeping track of Group performance
Group results for the year
The Group continued to perform well in 2017.
Total revenue for the year decreased marginally by 1% from 
£70.9 million to £70.1 million, generating an improved underlying 
operating profit of £3.1 million compared to a profit of £2.8 million 
in 2016. Total profit from operations was also £3.1 million (2016: 
£2.1 million) as no restructuring costs were incurred during the year.
Despite the slight reduction in revenue, close control of the cost base, 
together with improvements in the sales mix and operational efficiency, 
have contributed to the Group’s continued profitable performance.
Our revenues in the higher-margin gaming surveillance sector enjoyed 
another very strong year, ahead of expectations as increasing inroads 
were made with major casino customers in the US.
As expected, the oil & gas sector remained subdued and, despite 
an encouraging first half of the year, demand for surveillance systems 
from the UK bus market declined in the second half on the back 
of a reduction in new bus registrations.
Overall cash inflow in the period was £0.4 million. The Group finished 
the year with net cash of £3.8 million compared with net cash at 
30 November 2016 of £2.2 million. The net movement of £1.6 million 
comprised an increase in cash and cash equivalents of £0.4 million 
and a £1.2 million reduction in term debt. 
Other key performance indicators are discussed in more detail 
on the following pages.
Income Statement
Overall Group revenue for the year to 30 November 2017 amounted 
to £70.1 million compared with £70.9 million in the previous year, 
a decrease of £0.8 million (1.1%).
Revenue split between our two business segments was as follows:
2017 2016 Inc/(dec)

Systems 46,062 48,281 (2,219) (4.6)%

Intra-Group sales (1,099) (658) (441)
Total revenue 70,102 70,913 (811) (1.1)%
Revenues in the Systems division decreased by £2.2 million (4.6%) 
to £46.1 million. Although revenues from the gaming sector continued 
to be strong, as expected these were lower than those of the previous 
year where sales were exceptional and included two major new 
casino projects in the Far East. Revenues from the oil & gas sector 
were broadly flat but activity in our core UK bus and coach market 
was impacted by an unexpected decline in new registrations.
Revenues in the IMS division increased by £1.8 million (7.9%) to 
£25.1 million. The majority of this growth was seen in the UK integration 
business, which continues to make encouraging progress.
Recurring revenue decreased slightly year on year to £15.7 million 
(2016: £15.9 million), representing approximately 22% of sales 
(2016: 22%).
The proportion of sales arising outside the UK (measured by the 
geographical location of the contract) decreased slightly during 
the year to 40%, compared with 45% in the previous year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Performance review
Consolidated gross margins for 2017 increased by 0.5% overall. 
Tight cost control, improved operational efficiencies and a favourable 
sales mix saw increases in margins of 0.9% across the Systems 
division and 0.3% across the IMS division.
The full segmental analysis is as follows:
Gross margin % 2017 2016 Inc/(dec) 
Systems 39.8% 38.9% 0.9%
Integration & Managed Services 22.3% 22.0% 0.3%
Total Group 34.2% 33.7% 0.5%
Underlying operating expenses in the year decreased by 1.6% to 
£20.8 million due largely to increased capitalisation of development 
costs, reduced amortisation charges of those development costs 
previously capitalised, and the non-recurrence of the prior year 
provision for the future costs of a Group property vacated 
during 2016.

Total operating

Non-underlying operating expenses amounted to £23,000 
(2016: £0.7 million) and comprised a charge for the amortisation of 
intangible assets acquired in previous years. The prior year included 
restructuring costs of £0.6 million as we further integrated our 
product portfolio, development and sales activities across our 
Transportation & Infrastructure businesses, and reduced 
capacity in Oil & Gas to reflect market conditions.
Net finance costs in 2017 reduced by £6,000 to £130,000 as the 
cost and utilisation of borrowing facilities was broadly consistent 
between years.

Consolidated underlying profit before tax was £3.0 million in 2017 
compared with a profit of £2.6 million in the year to 30 November 2016. 
Similarly profit before tax increased to £3.0 million (2016: £2.0 million) 
as no non-underlying restructuring costs were incurred during the year.
Despite a reduction in revenue, underlying profits from the Systems 
division remained constant at £4.2 million as a result of an improved 
mix of higher-margin work and increased efficiencies from a right-sized 
cost base. On a constant currency basis these results benefited 
by around £0.2 million from the impact of the depreciation of 
sterling across the year on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, 
although this was partially offset by increases in the sterling costs 
of US dollar-denominated components used in our systems sold in the 
UK. In IMS, the growth in revenue together with improved operational 
efficiencies generated a significant increase in underlying profit to 
£1.0 million. Central costs increased by £0.1 million to £2.1 million.

Research & development costs are charged to the division benefiting 
from the service provided by the Synectics Technology Centre, 
principally the Systems division. In 2017 £2.6 million was spent 
on research & development with £2.1 million charged to the Income 
Statement after capitalisation of £0.5 million of development 
costs. This compares with total expenditure of £2.2 million 
in 2016, of which £0.3 million was capitalised.
Due to improved profitability across both divisions the Group underlying 
operating margin was 4.5% compared with 3.9% in 2016.

The tax charge for 2017 was £0.4 million compared with £0.5 million 
in 2016. The underlying tax rate (being the percentage ratio of the 
tax charge for the period to underlying profit before tax, after adding 
back the tax effect of non-underlying items) was 15%. The favourable 
impact of lower tax rates applicable to the Group’s subsidiaries 
in Singapore and Macau was offset by tax losses elsewhere, 
the benefit of which has not yet been recognised.

At 30 November 2017 the Group recognised a deferred tax asset 
of £0.3 million (2016: £0.4 million) in relation to tax losses which 
are expected to be offset against future taxable profits. Further tax 
losses of £4.8 million (30 November 2016: £4.0 million) exist and 
may be capable of offset against the future taxable profits of certain 
Group companies, but have not yet been recognised in the financial 
statements due to uncertainty of recoverability at this point.
Diluted earnings per share for 2017 were 15.1p compared with 
8.8p in the year ended 30 November 2016. However, the Directors 
believe that a better measure of performance is the underlying 
diluted earnings per share, which are calculated on the underlying 
profit before tax as defined above. Underlying diluted earnings 
per share were 15.2p compared with 12.4p in 2016.

Statement of Financial Position
The net assets of the Group amounted to £40.8 million at 30 November

 Net assets 40,754 39,581
Non-current assets (excluding deferred tax assets) at 30 November 2017 
were £24.8 million compared with £25.9 million at 30 November 2016.
Total capital expenditure in the year increased to £1.0 million compared to 
£0.7 million in 2016. During 2017 £0.5 million was capitalised in respect 
of technology development projects. The Group continues to invest 
significant amounts in the development and enhancement of its product 
portfolio. However, accounting rules for capitalisation of development 
spend dictate that it is not appropriate to capitalise ongoing work on 
enhancements for products which have been launched in the market. 
In addition £0.3 million and £0.2 million was spent on property, 
plant and equipment, and software respectively. Exchange rate 
movements in the year increased the retranslated value of 
goodwill on overseas acquisitions by £0.1 million.

Statement of Financial Position continued
This capital expenditure of £1.0 million (2016: £0.7 million) compares 
with depreciation and amortisation charges of £1.7 million in the 
year (2016: £2.0 million).
The surplus on the Group’s closed defined benefit pension 
scheme was £0.3 million at 30 November 2017 compared to 
£0.7 million at 30 November 2016. This reduction is due largely 
to the truing up of accounting estimates to the latest triennial 
valuation of the scheme. Substantially all of this experience 
movement has been posted to reserves through the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
Working capital levels were broadly in line with the prior year 
at £12.7 million at 30 November 2017 and increased slightly as a 
percentage of annual revenues from 17.9% in 2016 to 18.1% at 
30 November 2017, within the normal range we expect to see.
Net tax liabilities at 30 November 2017 amounted to £0.3 million 
(2016: £0.5 million) and comprised a current tax asset of £16,000 
(2016: £72,000), a current tax liability of £0.3 million (2016: £0.6 million), 
deferred tax assets of £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million) and deferred 
tax liabilities of £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million). 
Provisions at 30 November 2017 amounted to £0.3 million 
(2016: £0.7 million). This is held to cover future property costs, 
largely for a building vacated during 2016.
Cash
The Group ended the year with net cash of £3.8 million at 
30 November 2017 (2016: £2.2 million). This included a term 
loan of £0.9 million (2016: £1.1 million) to purchase the property 
in Scunthorpe in 2013. This is fully repayable in 2018. A term loan 
drawn to finance the acquisition of Synectic Systems GmbH 
(formerly Indanet GmbH) was fully repaid during the year 
(2016: €1.3 million).

Use of non-GAAP financial performance measures
Certain disclosures and analyses set out in this Annual Report 
and Accounts include measures which are not defined by generally 
accepted accounting principles (‘GAAP’) such as IFRS. We believe 
this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, 
is useful to investors. Management uses these financial measures, 
along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, 
in evaluating our operating performance. Non-GAAP measures 
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, 
financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. The 
primary non-GAAP financial measure we use is underlying profit. 
In the following table we provide a reconciliation of this and other 
non-GAAP measures, as defined in the Performance Review on 
pages 28 to 31, to relevant GAAP measures:

Underlying operating profit
Reported operating profit 994 449
Restructuring costs – 73
Underlying operating profit 994 522
Underlying diluted EPS
The Group monitors underlying diluted EPS. In calculating earnings 
for underlying diluted EPS, net profit is adjusted to eliminate the 
post-tax impact of non-underlying items. Note 12 includes a 
reconciliation of earnings used for underlying EPS.
Underlying return on capital employed
Underlying return on capital employed is based on underlying 
operating profit (see reconciliation of underlying operating profit 
in the previous table).
Free cash flow
The Group measures free cash flow in considering the underlying 
cash generated from its operations. A reconciliation of reported 
cash generated from operations to free cash flow is as follows:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Free cash flow
Reported cash generated from operations 4,331 2,596
Capital expenditure (964) (731)
Payments in respect of restructuring costs 275 365
Free cash flow 3,642 2,230
Net cash
Net cash is considered to be a non-GAAP measure as it is not 
defined in IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure is 
the aggregate of loans and other borrowings (current and non-current) 
and cash and cash equivalents. This is the calculation used by the 
Group to measure net cash.

Synectics’ Systems division provides 
specialist electronic surveillance systems, 
based on its own proprietary technology, 
to global end customers with large-scale 
highly complex security requirements, 
particularly for oil & gas operations, gaming,

Synectics’ business is to provide integrated electronic security 
systems and services to specialist high-end markets. Our systems 
are based on core proprietary technology, in particular systems 
integration and command and control software. This technology 
is adapted for the specific needs of our target customer sectors, 
and provides fundamental differentiation from mainstream 
suppliers in the wider electronic security market.
Gaming
After exceptionally strong results in 2016, the Group’s gaming 
activities recorded another very good performance in 2017. 
During this period, Synectics’ Synergy 3 command and control 
system consolidated its leadership position in both of the major 
global market regions: the Far East and North America.
Important new systems and upgrades were delivered in the 
Philippines, Macau, Singapore, Korea, Las Vegas and other casino 
locations in North America and Europe, as well as substantial sales 
to several major cruise lines for shipboard gaming. Much of this 
was repeat business for established customers, in either existing 
or new locations.
Gaming premises operate in sensitive regulatory environments, 
where quality and performance standards for surveillance technology 
are extremely demanding, and where failure can be not only costly, 
but potentially threatening to the customer’s business itself. They are 
also environments where surveillance technology can be adapted and 
developed to bring meaningful business benefits as well as satisfying 
security requirements. These characteristics continue to play to 
Synectics’ strengths in reliability, technical innovation and 
dedicated customer support.
The global market for casino-based gaming continues to grow, 
especially for integrated resorts that combine casinos with other 
attractions, such as theme parks. The size of individual new projects 
means that revenue can be lumpy in given years, but the long-term 
trend remains positive, and the barriers to entry for general market 
competitors are quite considerable.
  Project highlight: Philippines casino
A major gaming and leisure resort in the Philippines chose 
Synectics to upgrade its incumbent surveillance solution 
to Synergy 3. As well as enabling centralised and local/remote 
monitoring and control of 5,450 cameras, the system will 
integrate with the operator’s proprietary casino management 
system, point of sale system and access control solution.
Oil & Gas 
Revenue from Synectics’ oil & gas activities stabilised and 
produced an improved profit contribution last year, in a period of 
continuing difficult conditions in the underlying market. Oil prices 
have now roughly doubled from their lows of 2015/16 and early-cycle 
businesses in the sector are already experiencing significantly 
increased activity. Nevertheless, a proportion of Synectics’ 
revenue has traditionally derived from large-scale upstream 
projects, and these will take longer to ramp up.

Research & development
Continued investment in our proprietary technology base remains 
an important priority for Synectics. During 2017, the Group spent a 
total of £2.6 million on technology development (2016: £2.2 million). 
Of this total, £0.5 million was capitalised and the remainder expensed 
to the Income Statement. £0.8 million of previously capitalised 
development costs were amortised in the year.
The year saw significant work developing functionality for 
specific customer projects, which in turn has allowed Synectics 
to add features to the core capabilities of our Synergy 3 command 
and control software platform. A large amount of effort was also 
expended in unifying and developing our transport solutions, 
where we see an increasing appetite from customers for more 
technically complex solutions. We will be investing further in 
this area this year.

Particular successes during last year included a large involvement 
in Petronas’ RAPID project in Malaysia, and new customer wins 
in offshore infrastructure being built in the Far East. The Group also 
received an initial major order for its new design of explosion-rated 
camera stations adapted for the US market – in this case, for a 
significant new field in the Gulf of Mexico being developed by 
a major international oil company.
Transport & Infrastructure
The market for sophisticated surveillance systems in transport 
& infrastructure is growing, and is an area of increased focus 
for the Group.
Synectics’ presence in protecting the UK’s national and public 
infrastructure was further strengthened during the year. We won 
major new business from established and new clients operating a 
nationwide utility network, power stations, financial services data 
and cash centres, universities and large-scale shopping and leisure 
malls. One such new contract provided the opportunity for the 
first deployment of our Synergy 3 surveillance in a cloud-based 
environment, an area in which we will be making substantial 
investment in the future.
During last year, Synectics won and delivered a significant 
expansion to its integrated surveillance management system 
at Jakarta’s main international airport, the busiest in the 
Southern Hemisphere, as it continues to grow.
The Group continues to expand its operations in Europe, through 
co-operation between our German and UK-based teams, establishing 
partnerships with major transport system operators and suppliers, 
including BVG (the government operator of Europe’s largest integrated 
transport hub, in Berlin), Deutsche Bahn and Siemens Mobility. 
We continue to expect growth from our European transport 
activities over coming years.
Our UK mobile systems business won a further three-year 
extension of its long-term partnership with Stagecoach, the UK’s 
largest bus operator, for surveillance systems on its nationwide 
fleet. The UK bus and coach market itself, as noted above, was 
characterised in 2017 by an unexpectedly large fall in new bus 
deliveries, which was mirrored by a decline in Synectics’ revenues 
from that sector. By contrast, light rail and tram services grew in 
the UK last year, and Synectics was pleased to win significant 
orders from London and North East train operators.
  Project highlight: Irish 
transport authority
Synectics has been awarded the contract to develop 
and install surveillance solutions on over 100 vehicles for 
Ireland’s largest public transport provider based in Dublin. 
The system specified incorporated Synectics’ proprietary 
technology (the T1600 DVR) and cameras for each of the 
single deck and double-decker buses and will be rolled 
out during 2018.

Integrated Systems
The IMS division as a whole produced solid gains in revenue and 
profit during 2017, driven particularly by operational improvements, 
and consequent higher margins, in our high-security systems 
support activities.
Among notable new business wins in 2017 were surveillance 
systems and support for Newcastle and York mainline rail stations; 
Goldsmiths University of London; the Royal National Orthopaedic 
Hospital; the British Museum; Westminster Abbey; and the 
Highways Agency.
Our position as one of the leading accredited high-security 
providers in the UK means that we continue to win significant 
ongoing work for government agencies.
The UK market for sophisticated, high-quality security systems 
integration and support is growing. Technology is advancing at an 
increasing pace and Synectics’ activities in this area are increasingly 
focussed on customers who need and value expertise, and are 
prepared to invest in a longer-term relationship rather than rely on 
one-off lowest-price tenders. Given that, having access to the 
resources of a parent company at the forefront of surveillance 
technology development is a clear advantage. 31

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s introduction to governance
For some time now Synectics has been 
including in its Annual Reports a specific 
section collating the Board’s reports on the 
various elements of corporate governance. 
The formal reports on these matters are 
contained in the following pages. The purpose 
of this regular introduction is to provide a 
more detailed narrative account of particular 
aspects of Synectics’ governance.
Over each of the past five years I have provided an annual progress 
report on the Board’s evolving collective view on governance in 
general, as well as a detailed explanation of the rationale behind our 
approach at Synectics to a now quite extensive list of relevant issues:
• values and leadership;
• the composition, independence and effectiveness of the Board;
• the Group’s share-based long-term remuneration plans; 
• diversity;
• risk management;
• corporate culture;
• employee training and development; and
• the Board’s role in setting Synectics’ strategic direction.
Those comments remain largely up to date and represent an 
accurate reflection of core aspects of Synectics’ governance. 
Anyone wanting a full picture will find the detail in the Company’s 
2012–2016 Annual Reports, available on our corporate website.
This year’s introduction will be slightly different, set as it is 
against the backdrop of recently published proposals for a substantial 
revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The 
changes proposed by the Financial Reporting Council are focussed on 
supporting long-term sustainability (i) through alignment of a company’s 
purpose, values and culture; and (ii) through engagement with a wider 
group of stakeholders. These are not new issues but their profile and 
ambit have clearly risen in recent years, for reasons we all understand.
In the interests of looking forward as best practice moves on, 
here is where Synectics and its Board sit today in relation to these 
increasingly critical matters.
(i) Alignment of purpose, values and culture
I last wrote specifically about the important role of culture at 
Synectics in this section of our Annual Report three years ago. At 
that time, the Company was reviewing the salutary experience of 
its only loss-making financial year since taking its current form and 
coming on to AIM in 2002. In that report of our 2014 results, I outlined 
the steps that the Board had taken to reinforce the Company’s strong 
historical culture, after the dilution it had suffered in certain areas 
that we felt had contributed to the poor result. To quote, these were:
I have no doubt the efforts by management 
and the Board to reinforce the Company’s culture 
are having an increasingly positive impact on 
financial performance and on our goal of building 
a truly sustainable business.”
 David Coghlan
 Chairman 35
Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Financial statements
• the maintenance of our culture throughout the organisation 
is now an explicit personal objective for the Chief Executive;
• the Board has input into, and reviews the results of, an annual 
independently administered and anonymous employee survey;
• from now on corporate culture will form part of the risk review 
agenda item at each Board meeting;
• the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have been given 
the task of explicitly promoting and testing Synectics’ culture 
in contact with staff at all levels; and
• employee recognition awards will be linked more closely to 
achievements that demonstrate the Company’s culture in action.
These steps have since been consistently and enthusiastically acted 
on, led by our Chief Executive, and have become part of the regular 
fabric of life at Synectics. Our core values were set down in 2015 in a 
concise and memorable formula that appears regularly in all relevant 
communications across and about the Group (for example in this 
Annual Report on page 20). Regular employee recognition awards 
are made twice a year and the citations circulated to the whole 
Company, in each case tied in to the demonstration of Synectics’ 
culture and values in action. A new annual award was instituted in 2017, 
in memory of our late former Finance Director, to the single outstanding 
employee chosen by senior management as most exemplifying 
Synectics’ core values. As another example, the central theme of 
the Chairman’s 30th anniversary address to Synectics’ Systems staff 
last year was precisely the Company’s enduring purpose and values.
I am completely confident that each employee in the Group is 
now aware of what Synectics’ values are and what behaviours the 
organisation expects from its people to fit in with them. This is not 
to say we are trying to produce clones, quite the contrary – individuality, 
and quirkiness are valued, as are diversity of personalities and of 
every other sort, provided the Company’s core values are respected.
At the Board level, we can monitor the effectiveness of this 
consistent and cumulative emphasis on the Company’s culture by 
the measure of employee engagement from the annual employee 
opinion survey, on which there is more below.
The positive impact from the efforts applied in these areas over 
recent years is quite apparent in discussions with employees 
around the Group, in commendations from customers and, more 
quantitatively, from significant improvement in the Group’s overall 
measure of customer satisfaction. I have no doubt the efforts by 
management and the Board to reinforce the Company’s culture are 
having an increasingly positive impact on financial performance 
and on our goal of building a truly sustainable business.
(ii) Engagement with a wider group of stakeholders
The wider group of stakeholders the FRC is referring to includes 
shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the wider community.
Synectics has always maintained regular communication with 
shareholders through our Annual Report and Accounts, investor 
website, market updates, Annual General Meeting and biannual 
meetings with large holders. 
Non-Executive Board members engage with employees on an ad hoc 
basis through site visits and more comprehensively via the annual 
employee opinion survey, which is anonymous and independently 
administered. Whistleblower policies and protections are in place 
and well publicised. The Board pays significant attention to output 
from the opinion survey, not just the tabulated data but also the 
more nuanced information coming from specific comments given 
in answer to many of the questions. The information allows the 
Board to monitor both emerging trends and also particular areas 
or locations where issues may need further probing.
Although by no means universally glowing, the results from the most 
recent surveys show a marked improving trend in levels of engagement 
and work satisfaction. With its emphasis on high levels of commitment 
and an ethos of never letting customers down, the work environment 
in the Group is demanding, and can be sometimes unwittingly harsh 
on very good, uncomplaining people who always want to help. 
One of the issues the Board looks for is the balance between high 
commitment and systematic undue stress – and we probe the 
Executives on how well that issue is managed down through 
the organisation.
Synectics also engages independent experts to conduct an annual 
survey of our customers, named or anonymous at their option. 
This is a rich source of data and anecdote on how well the Company 
is doing. The attention paid to the results within each business 
area also helps to reinforce the employees’ focus on customers, 
which is at the heart of what Synectics does well. The customer 
survey also produces a regular single metric, the net promoter 
score, which provides a yardstick for the Board to judge our 
progress in that area. We were pleased that the 2017 survey 
showed results on that measure that were both significantly 
improved on the prior year and very positive in absolute terms.
So far as suppliers are concerned, the Board has established the 
principles that we should deal fairly and honour our commitments, 
and that we should avoid single point of failure dependencies wherever 
possible. In a number of cases there are advantages in creating a 
higher-level partnership-type arrangement with particular critical 
suppliers. We see the importance of those sorts of relationships 
increasing and are willing to invest in creating them and making 
them work. To monitor compliance, data is collected, and regularly 
looked at by the Board, on the average days Synectics takes to 
pay its supplier invoices.
Synectics also encourages and supports its employees in participating 
in local community and charity projects. Examples of such activities 
are shown on page 20 of this report.
To return to the proposed changes to the Code, the FRC is now 
emphasising a new primary concept: sustainability. This is in fact a 
word that has appeared for some time in our articulation of Synectics’ 
enduring purpose. It drives the Board’s thinking on a number of issues, 
including maintaining a conservative balance sheet, being prepared 
to invest for the long term and making sure common sense has a 
key role in our decision-making processes.
As previously, I confirm that the Board continues to support 
wholeheartedly the letter and spirit of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, including the proposals for a revised Code issued last December, 
and it remains our intent to follow Code provisions wherever we 
sensibly can within the constraints of the Group’s size and resources.

The Board
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, four Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. The Group believes the 
size and composition of the Board give it sufficient independence, 
balance and broad experience to provide effective oversight of 
Synectics’ strategy, performance, resources and standards of 
conduct. The strong representation of Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board demonstrates its independence, provides a greater 
depth of experience and facilitates challenge. 
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are undertaken 
by separate individuals. The Chairman, David Coghlan, is responsible 
for leadership of the Board and ensuring that there is effective 
communication with shareholders. The day-to-day leadership and 
management of the business are undertaken by the Chief Executive, 
Paul Webb, assisted by senior management.
Peter Rae fulfils the role of the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director of the Group. He was appointed based on his ability to 
perform the role and his deep knowledge and experience of the 
Group. He supports and deputises for the Chairman on matters 
relating to Directors and engagement with shareholders.
The Company Secretary, in conjunction with the Chairman, 
ensures that accurate, timely and clear information is provided 
to the Board in order for informed decisions and discussions to 
take place. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising 
the Board on governance matters and regulatory requirements. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are 
matters reserved for the Board. All Directors have direct access 
to the Company Secretary and to independent professional advice 
at the Group’s expense as required.
The Group purchases and maintains Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance in respect of the Group, the Company and its 
Directors throughout each financial year.
Role of the Board
Great importance is placed on a well informed and decisive Board. 
Board meetings are held regularly throughout the year. In the 2017 
financial year, six scheduled Board meetings and nine Board 
Committee meetings were held. In addition, as it does each year, 
the Board convened and participated in a separate two-day session 
on the Group’s strategy and three-year plan.
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its 
consideration and those delegated to Board Committees. The Board’s 
responsibilities include setting the Group’s overall business and 
commercial strategy; setting and monitoring business objectives 
to achieve the strategy; setting and monitoring annual budgets and 
financial and capital plans; and considering Group policies and any 
major investments or organisational changes.
Agenda items scheduled for every Board meeting include strategy, 
business performance, operations, human resources, finance and 
governance. The agenda is reviewed and agreed by the Chairman 
to ensure that the Board addresses the right issues at the right 
times and that sufficient time is allowed for appropriate 
consideration and debate.
Following Board Committee meetings, the Board receives copies 
of the Committees’ minutes at the next Board meeting and can 
raise any queries or concerns with the Committee Chairmen.
Board meetings
Board meetings are scheduled in different Group offices to give 
the Board the opportunity to meet local management and employees, 
and to develop greater business knowledge and depth of awareness 
of business-specific opportunities and threats. All Directors receive 
papers sufficiently in advance of meetings to enable due consideration.
During the 2017 financial year, matters dealt with by the Board included:
• review and monitoring of Group strategy and progress against 
business objectives;
• operational and financial performance of the Group;
• Group budgets and three-year plan;
• approval of financial statements and dividend policy;
• risk management oversight, review of internal controls and 
monitoring of the Group’s risk registers;
• Board and senior management succession planning;

Directors’ conflicts of interest
A Conflicts Register is maintained by the Company Secretary 
to monitor and manage any potential conflicts of interest. Training 
on the Companies Act 2006 has been given to all Directors on the 
provisions within, and Directors are reminded of their duties at 
each Board meeting. Any conflicts are declared at the first Board 
meeting at which the Director becomes aware of a potential conflict 
and then recorded in the Conflicts Register. The Board considers 
all conflicts in line with the provisions set out in the Articles and 
non-conflicted Directors can authorise conflicts with or without 
limits and conditions. The Directors are required to review their 
interests recorded in the Conflicts Register on an annual basis.
Board Committees
The Group has two standing Board Committees: an Audit Committee 
and a Remuneration Committee. The roles and activities of those 
Committees are included in the respective Committee reports on 
pages 39 to 45. 
The functions of a nominations committee are undertaken by 
the Group Board as a whole. Where necessary and appropriate, 
a nominations sub-committee is appointed temporarily to fulfil 
specific tasks. Given the size of the Group, and the size and 
composition of its Board, the Directors believe it is both practical 
and beneficial for matters of Board composition and recruitment, 
Board performance evaluation, Executive and Non-Executive succession 
planning, and training and development to be undertaken by the 
Board as a whole. All such matters are regularly scheduled on the 
Board’s agenda and are discussed thoroughly and robustly, incorporating 
the detailed perspectives and experience of all Directors.
Board appointments
All Non-Executive Directors are provided with a letter of 
appointment on acceptance of the appointment, which includes 
the terms and conditions of their role. The letters of appointment 
are updated as appropriate from time to time and are available on 
request from the Company Secretary.
Diversity
The Group recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board, 
senior management team and workforce in general and seeks to 
recruit and develop the best-qualified candidates to support and 
achieve the Group’s long-term strategic and business objectives. 
The Group monitors and encourages diversity across the whole 
workforce in terms of gender, skills, culture, disability and ethnicity 
and believes such diversity contributes to the success of the Group. Governance

Board performance and effectiveness
Induction
The Group’s policy is for all new Directors to undertake a formal 
and comprehensive induction to the Group upon joining the Board. 
The induction process is undertaken by the Company Secretarial 
department. On acceptance of appointment all Directors are provided 
with an induction pack, which includes: their appointment letter 
and terms; latest accounts and constitutional documents; the 
business plan; investor presentations; protocol for conflicts of 
interest; Directors’ duties; Group Share Dealing Code and Group 
policies; Board meeting procedures and matters reserved; Board 
minutes and papers from previous meetings; and meeting dates 
and contact details. Substantive induction to the Group’s businesses 
is provided through meetings with senior management and site 
visits to the Group’s operations. 
Performance evaluation
The Board carries out an annual self-assessment of its performance. 
This includes evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of 
the Board, of its Committees and of each Director. The process 
is led by the Chairman and involves detailed questionnaires and 
one-to-one reviews of the collective and individual performance of 
Directors. The results of the Board and Committee evaluations are 
the subject of a full, robust and open debate in a Board meeting 
and actions for improvements are agreed. Progress against these 
actions arising from performance evaluations is then monitored 
and reported on throughout the following year. 
As a result of the evaluation process during 2017, the Board 
identified and agreed five action steps for 2017/18 focussed on:
• widening the scope of the annual Board strategy review to 
include a more in-depth review of potential future industry 
scenarios based on emerging technology applications;
• extending the Board’s access to expert views on technology 
developments in the wider industry;
• building on the recent progress in Board-level risk assessment 
and management processes;
• further refining the content and use of the template developed 
for effective monitoring of progress against the Company’s 
strategic objectives across all business areas; and
• increasing the number and frequency of attendance of senior 
managers at Board meetings.
Independence
As part of the appraisal of each Director, the independence of 
all Non-Executive Board members is reviewed and evaluated 
annually. Peter Rae, Steve Coggins and Dennis Bate have served 
on the Board for 20, 13 and twelve years respectively and 
Michael Butler has served for two years. Each brings different 
and complementary high-level experience relevant to the current 
business and future development of the Group. During 2017, and 
at all times previously, each has addressed all issues facing the 
Board with a high level of candour, robustness and insight. Their 
in-depth knowledge of the Group and the electronic surveillance 
industry, gained from their tenure, combined with their different 
and complementary skills and knowledge developed from other 
directorships, provide valuable independent perspectives that 
contribute to the success of the Group and to the performance 
and effectiveness of the Board. For these reasons, each of 
these four Non-Executive Directors is considered by the Board 
to be independent.
Shareholder engagement
The Board welcomes dialogue with shareholders and actively 
engages with them through face-to-face meetings and written 
queries, and at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. Individual 
meetings are conducted with those substantial shareholders who 
so request following the announcement of final and half-year results. 
The Group’s brokers are requested to collate all responses from 
such investor meetings and to pass these to the Board. In addition, 
the Chairman apprises all Board members of any other significant 
shareholder feedback or discussions. As part of the continued 
review of the Group’s governance reporting, the Annual Report 
and Accounts includes expanded narrative governance disclosures 
that take into account the views of shareholders expressed 
through the engagement process. 39

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee comprises:
• Steve Coggins, Chairman of the Committee, Independent 
Non-Executive Director;
• Dennis Bate, Independent Non-Executive Director;
• Michael Butler, Independent Non-Executive Director; and
• Peter Rae, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
All of the Committee members are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and have no personal or financial interests, other than 
as shareholders, in the matters considered by the Committee.
The Audit Committee has formal terms of reference which set out 
its duties delegated by the Board. A copy of the terms of reference 
can be obtained from the Company Secretary or from the Governance 
section of the Company’s website (www.synecticsplc.com). 
During the last financial year the Committee met three times. 
Neither the Executive Directors nor the Chairman attend meetings 
other than by invitation of the Committee members. The Committee 
invites the auditor to attend certain meetings.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to obtain external 
professional advice at the Group’s expense in order to perform 
its duties. 
The main function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for the integrity of the Company’s 
financial statements and matters relating to the Group’s system of 
internal controls and risk management. Its principal duties are to:
• make recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of the external auditor and the 
amount of its remuneration;
• discuss and agree the scope of the audit and review the 
auditor’s management letter and the Group’s response;
• review and agree the scope and work of the Group’s internal 
audit activities;
• review half-year and annual financial statements and formal 
announcements relating to financial performance;
• review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls, and internal control and risk management systems;
• consider compliance with relevant laws and regulations;
• consider findings of internal investigations and management’s 
response; and
• review the Committee’s terms of reference and recommend 
any proposed changes to the Board for approval.
During the financial year the Audit Committee considered the 
following matters:
• the suitability of the Group’s accounting policies and practices;
• the half-year and full-year financial results;
• the scope and cost of the external audit;
• the auditor’s full-year report for 2016;
• the evaluation of the performance and independence of KPMG LLP 
as the Group’s external auditor;
• the implementation of the approved process and action plan for 
the tender of the external audit and tax compliance services 
(explained in more detail below);
• the review and approval of the external auditor’s plan for 2017, 
which detailed the proposed audit scope and risk and 
governance assessment;
• the review and approval of the external auditor’s fees for 2017;
• the internal control environment across the Group;
• the arrangements in respect of internal audit, including its resourcing 
and the scope of the annual internal audit plan for 2017/18;
• reports on the internal audit activity carried out during the year, 
including: the audit of internal control questionnaires from across 
the Group; an audit of the Group’s transfer pricing process; and 
an audit of the Group’s working capital management;
• detailed reviews of strategic and operational risks facing the Group, 
the risk registers and the mitigating actions to minimise risk;
• the annual review of the whistleblowing policy;
• the review of the Audit Committee terms of reference and 
recommendation of the updated terms of reference to the 
Board for approval;
• the assessment of the internal finance organisation;
• the results of the internally conducted assessment of the Audit 
Committee’s performance and effectiveness in 2017;
• the approval of the Audit Committee plan for 2017;
• the review of a cyber security report, prepared by the provider 
of the Company’s outsourced IT services, which reviewed the 
Group’s IT security and resilience;
• the review of the current status and future roadmap of the 
Company’s IT infrastructure;
• the training requirements of the Audit Committee members; and
• a technical update detailing accounting standards that would 
impact the Group over the next few years.

Significant financial statement reporting issues 
The Audit Committee looks carefully at those aspects of the financial statements which require significant accounting judgements or where 
there is estimation uncertainty. The Audit Committee also reviews the draft of the external Auditor’s Report on the financial statements, 
with particular reference to those matters reported as carrying risks of material misstatement. The Audit Committee discusses the range 
of possible treatments both with management and with the external auditor and satisfies itself that the judgements made by management 
are robust and should be supported. The significant issues that the Audit Committee considered in the year were:
Issue How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee 
Revenue recognition and contract accounting The Audit Committee reviewed the controls in place to ensure the 
appropriateness of the estimates used in assessing contract stage 
of completion, anticipated profitability and the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements. 
Carrying value of goodwill The Audit Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the 
assumptions used in the value-in-use model to support the carrying 
value of goodwill. It also considered the impact of reasonably 
possible changes in the key assumptions on which the recoverable 
amounts are based.
Recoverability of Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries The Audit Committee reviewed the assessment of the carrying 
value of the Parent Company’s investment in subsidiaries using 
the value-in-use model used in supporting the carrying value 
of goodwill.
For all the matters described above the Audit Committee 
concluded that the treatment adopted in the Group’s financial 
statements was appropriate.
Internal controls
The Board of Directors, advised by the Audit Committee, has 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. Details of the system of internal 
control, the principal risks facing the Group, and the strategies 
put in place to mitigate them, are set out in the Risk and Risk 
Management section on pages 50 and 51.
Auditor tender
Following the completion of the audit for the year ended 
30 November 2016, KPMG LLP had provided external audit and 
tax compliance services to the Group for ten years. Having regard 
to the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant 
regulations regarding the tendering of external audit services, the 
Board, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, tendered 
external audit and tax compliance services during 2017. It was 
considered appropriate to tender audit and tax compliance services 
as two separate parts of the process. The Audit Committee approved 
the objectives and process for the audit tender, which was designed 
to be efficient, open, transparent, fair and effective.
Five firms responded to the invitation to tender, including 
the incumbent auditor, KPMG LLP, which was first appointed as 
auditor for the year ended 31 May 2007. Each of the firms attended 
background meetings with key finance personnel and site visits. 
Presentations were made to a panel comprising the Finance Director 
and Head of Finance. Two firms were then selected to present to 
the Audit Committee’s tender sub-committee, which comprised the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and also the Chairman of the 
Company, who then made a recommendation to the Audit Committee. 
The proposals received were assessed against predetermined 
criteria including audit quality, cultural fit and experience. Following 
careful consideration, the Audit Committee agreed that, across the 
criteria as a whole, KPMG LLP had delivered the best proposal and 
therefore the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that 
KPMG LLP be re-appointed as auditor. The Board is proposing 
a Resolution to the Annual General Meeting to re-appoint 
KPMG LLP as auditor.
As stated above, the tender process extended to consideration 
of the award of tax compliance services. The evaluation process 
was similarly comprehensive to the audit tender process. It was 
concluded that the Audit Committee recommend to the Board that 
Deloitte LLP provide tax compliance services for the year ended 
30 November 2017. 41

Audit independence
The Audit Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the 
objectivity of the external auditor in its reporting to shareholders.
The Audit Director is present at Audit Committee meetings as 
required to ensure full communication of matters relating to the 
audit. The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually by 
the Audit Committee, taking into account the views of management, 
and feedback is provided when necessary to senior members of 
the audit firm unrelated to the audit. The Audit Committee also 
has discussions with the auditor, without management being present, 
on the adequacy of controls and on any judgemental areas. The 
scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in advance by the 
Audit Committee. Audit fees are approved by the Audit Committee.
In accordance with best practice and professional standards, 
external auditors are required to adhere to a rotation policy whereby 
the Audit Director is rotated after five years. The most recent Audit 
Director rotation was in 2017 when the Audit Director rotated off 
the Group audit following the completion of the 2016 audit.
Assignments of non-audit work have been and are subject to 
controls by management that have been agreed by the Audit 
Committee so that audit independence is not compromised. 
Other than the audit, the Audit Committee is required to give prior 
approval of work carried out by the auditor and its associates with 
a value in excess of £50,000. Part of this review is to determine 
that other potential providers of the services have been adequately 
considered. These controls provide the Audit Committee with 
confidence in the independence of the auditor in its reporting on the 
audit of the Group.
Non-audit services
KPMG LLP provides non-audit services to the Group, which are 
governed, so as to safeguard its independence and objectivity, by 
the Group’s non-audit services policy. Compliance with the policy 
is actively managed and an analysis of non-audit services is reviewed 
throughout the year. During the year ended 30 November 2017 
10% of services provided to the Group were non-audit services 
and related predominantly to corporate tax compliance (see note 5 
to the financial statements).

Remuneration Committee, the remuneration 
policies approved and applied by the Board, 
and the actual remuneration of Directors for 
the year ended 30 November 2017. This 
report does not constitute a directors’ 
remuneration report in compliance with the 
requirements of the Code, as the Group is 
exempt from such requirements.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Group’s Remuneration Committee comprises:
• Peter Rae, Chairman of the Committee, Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director;
• Dennis Bate, Independent Non-Executive Director; 
• Michael Butler, Independent Non-Executive Director; and
• Steve Coggins, Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Committee members are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and have no personal or financial interests, other than as shareholders, 
in the matters considered by the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee operates within the remit delegated 
by the Board, which is set out in formal terms of reference. The 
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman

Neither the Executive Directors nor the Chairman attend other 
than by invitation of the Remuneration Committee and are not 
present at any discussion of their own remuneration.
The principal duties of the Remuneration Committee are to:
• recommend to the Board for approval overall Group remuneration 
policies, and the specific remuneration each year for all Directors 
and senior management, including bonuses, incentive payments 
and share options and awards;
• ensure Executive Directors and senior executive management 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance in a fair and reasonable manner;
• approve the design of, and determine targets for, any 
performance-related pay schemes;
• review the design of all share incentive plans for approval 
by the Board and, where appropriate, shareholders;
• determine whether awards will be made under any share incentive 
plans, including the size of the award and the performance 
targets to be used;
• determine the policy for pension arrangements for Executive 
Directors and certain senior managers;
• ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments 
made are fair, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to 
mitigate loss is fully recognised;
• consider applicable legislation, regulation, best practice guidance 
and recommendations, and developments on remuneration 
policy and remuneration reporting;
• review remuneration trends at individual subsidiaries and the 
Group as a whole, and oversee any major changes in employee 
benefit structures across the Group;
• select and appoint any remuneration consultants to advise the 
Committee, if required; and 
• review the Committee’s performance, constitution and terms of 
reference to ensure it operates effectively and to recommend 
any changes to the Board for approval.
The Committee Chairman reports formally to the Board on the 
Committee’s proceedings after each meeting; ensures that an 
annual report of the Group’s remuneration policy and practices is 
published in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts; and ensures 
each year that the Remuneration Committee Report, which contains 
the Directors’ remuneration, is put to shareholders for approval at 
the Annual General Meeting.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to seek any information it 
requires from any employee of the Group in order to perform its duties 
and to obtain external professional advice at the Group’s expense.

During the year the Remuneration Committee met six times. 
Matters dealt with by the Remuneration Committee included the:
• approval of the 2016 bonus awards and salary increases for the 
Executive Directors and certain senior managers;
• approval of the discretionary executive bonus scheme to take effect 
in the financial year 2017 for Executive Directors. For the 2017

• approval of an award of options under the Performance Share 
Plan on 1 March 2017 for the Executive Directors and certain 
senior managers; 
• approval of exercises of options over shares, and sales of shares, 
in respect of the Group’s various incentive plans during the year; 
• determination of the appropriate treatment of Performance Share 
Plan and Executive Shared Ownership Plan awards held by 
participants who had left the Group; 
• review of the outturn of the 2014 Performance Share Plan awards 
and the determination that no proportion of the awards had vested 
and therefore that the awards had lapsed;
• approval of a gift of shares by the Company’s employee benefit 
trust to recognise the exceptional performance of John Katnic, 
Vice President of Global Gaming, during the year ended 
30 November 2016; and
• approval of changes to Synectics’ policy for the provision 
of company cars and cash alternatives and to Paul Webb’s 
remuneration to replace his entitlement to a company-supplied 
car with an annual allowance of £12,000.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
Executive Directors are employed by the Group and are required 
to devote substantially the whole of their time to its affairs. The 
policy of the Board is to provide competitive packages reflective 
of the industry in which it operates to attract, retain and motivate 
high-calibre individuals as Executive Directors and to ensure 
that their remuneration packages (consisting of basic salary, 
performance-related bonuses, pension arrangements and 
other benefits including interests in share schemes) reflect their 
responsibilities, performance and experience, and encourage and 
reward superior performance. The policy also seeks to ensure 
that Executive Directors are rewarded fairly for their individual 
contributions to the Group’s performance and to encourage 
appropriate behaviours in line with the Group’s attitude to risk.
The principal elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages are as follows:
• Basic salary – the Group aims to pay competitive market salaries 
and to recognise individual development and progression through 
the annual salary and personal review processes. Salaries are 
reviewed annually.
• Annual performance-related bonuses – in line with the scheme 
covering other senior members of staff, performance-related 
bonuses for the Executive Directors are based on the achievement 
of specific financial targets for the Group and agreed 
personal objectives.
• Pension arrangements – the Group makes contributions into 
money purchase schemes on behalf of the Executive Directors. 
Pension payments are based only on basic salary.
• Other benefits – these principally comprise car benefits, life 
assurance and membership of the Group’s healthcare scheme.
• Long-term incentive arrangements – the Group operates various 
share plans in which the Executive Directors participate. Details 
of the share plans are given in note 22 to the financial statements. 
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Group are detailed in the 
shareholdings disclosure on page 47.
Executive Directors are not automatically entitled to compensation 
payments for loss of office, other than payment in lieu of their 
contractual notice period, if legally required.
Executive Directors do not hold directorships in other companies 
unrelated to the Group and, accordingly, no remuneration is due 
to the Group.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are independent of the Group and are 
expected to spend an average of approximately two days a month 
on the Group’s business. They are not restricted from undertaking 
additional directorships, subject to avoiding any conflicts of interest.
After considering recommendations from the Chairman, the Board 
determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
excluding the Chairman. The remuneration of the Chairman is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee. Non-Executive 
Directors receive fees which are reviewed annually in light of their 
responsibilities, experience and contribution to the Group’s affairs, 
as well as market rates. Non-Executive Directors do not receive 
any performance-related pay or rewards, and the Group does not 
deduct for, or contribute to, a pension. Governance

b) Share schemes
The Directors’ interests in the Company’s share schemes are

by, any Director between 1 December 2017 and 20 February 2018.
Performance Share Plan
The following Executive Directors held an interest in the Company’s 
shares at 30 November 2017 through awards made under the 
Synectics Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which was established 
on 9 October 2012, as set out below and in note 22.
Under the rules of the PSP, selected employees are awarded an 
interest over a certain number of Company shares which only vest 
after a three-year period, at nil cost to the employees. The number 
of shares that vest at the end of the three-year period is dependent 
on the Company meeting certain performance thresholds linked 
to the FTSE AIM All Share Total Return Index. The performance 
conditions are identical to those that applied under the Executive 
Shared Ownership Plan, details of which are presented below.
No rights under this scheme were exercised by Directors during 
the year.

Executive Shared Ownership Plan
The following Directors held an interest in the Company’s shares 
at 30 November 2017 through participation in the Quadnetics 
Executive Shared Ownership Plan (‘ExSOP’), which was established 
on 7 July 2009, having superseded an earlier scheme established 
in 2005, as set out in note 22. The last awards under the ExSOP 
were made in March 2011.
Under the provisions of the ExSOP, shares are jointly owned by 
nominated senior employees and by an employees’ share trust 
on terms, similar to a share option scheme, whereby the value of 
appreciation in the Company’s share price over a minimum three-year 
period accrues to the relevant employee, provided the Company 
meets certain performance thresholds linked to the FTSE AIM 
All Share Total Return Index. No rights under this scheme were 
exercised by Directors during the year.

Employees’ Share Acquisition Plan
The Executive Directors also participate in the Quadnetics 
Employees’ Share Acquisition Plan (‘ESAP’), which was adopted 
on 23 April 2010. Deductions from salary are used to buy partnership 
shares in Synectics plc at the end of each six-month accumulation 
period. The Trustee of the ESAP will use any dividend income paid 
on these shares to buy further shares to be held in the scheme as 
dividend shares.
Partnership shares can be withdrawn from the scheme by the 
employee at any time, but withdrawals before the fifth anniversary 
after purchase are subject to income tax; withdrawals after the 
fifth anniversary of their purchase date can be made in full and are 
not subject to income tax. Dividend shares are required to be held 
in trust for a period of three years following the purchase date. 
Employees who leave the Group are required to withdraw all of 
their shares in the scheme and are subject to the same rules.

the following financial indicators (as reflected in this Annual Report):
• revenue;
• gross margin %;
• underlying operating profit and underlying profit before tax;
• underlying operating margin %, being the ratio of underlying 
operating profit to revenue;
• operating profit;

delivered over a future time period and revenues are recognised 
in the relevant future accounting period);
• recurring revenue as a % of total revenue;
• net cash balance;

Principal risks and uncertainties
Details of the principal risks and uncertainties considered by the 
Board to affect the Group, and the related risk mitigation actions, 
are given on pages 50 and 51.
Group results and dividends
The consolidated profit after tax for the year was £2,553,000 
(2016: £1,471,000).
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 
3.0p per share (2016: 2.0p per share), totalling around £506,000. 
Subject to approval, this is expected to be paid on 4 May 2018 to 
shareholders registered on 3 April 2018. An interim dividend of 
1.0p per share was paid during the year (2016: nil per share).
Financial instruments
Details of financial instruments to which the Group is a party 
are shown in note 29 to the financial statements.
Fixed assets
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no material difference 
between the book value and the current open market value 
of the Group’s interest in land and buildings.
Research & development expenditure
The Group has continued to invest in research & development of 
both software and hardware products for surveillance applications 
during the year incurring total costs of £2.6 million (2016: £2.2 million), 
of which £2.1 million (2016: £1.9 million) has been written off 
to the income statement.

Company. All issued shares are fully paid up and carry no additional 
obligations or special rights. There are no restrictions on transfers 
of shares in the Company, or on the exercise of voting rights attached 
to them, other than those which may from time to time be applicable 
under existing laws and regulations.

Board of Directors
All Directors were in office throughout the financial year ended 
30 November 2017. Details and biographies of the current Directors 
are shown on pages 32 and 33.
The powers of the Company’s Directors and rules that apply to 
changes in the Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association (the ‘Articles’). Any changes to the Articles would 
require the consent of the Company’s shareholders.
In accordance with the Articles, one-third of the Directors are 
required to retire by rotation at each Annual General Meeting. 
The Directors retiring by rotation at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting are Dennis Bate and Paul Webb.
Directors’ indemnity
As permitted by the Articles, each of the Directors has the benefit 
of an indemnity which is a qualifying third-party indemnity as 
defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity 
was in force throughout the financial year and is currently in force. 
No indemnity is provided for the Group’s auditor.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may 
possibly conflict, with the interests of the Group (‘Situational 
Conflicts’). The Board operates an effective formal system for 
Directors to declare Situational Conflicts and for them to be 
authorised by the non-conflicted Directors if thought appropriate 
and subject to limits or conditions.
Related party transactions
Internal controls are in place to ensure that any related party 
transactions involving Directors or their connected persons are 
carried out on an arm’s length basis and are properly recorded. 
Details of any related party transactions are given in note 25 
to the financial statements.
Essential contracts or arrangements
The Group has a number of contractual agreements with suppliers 
in support of its business activities. Whilst the loss of certain of 
these arrangements may cause temporary disruption, there are 
none, for which mitigation plans have not been put in place, which 
are individually considered to be essential to the Group’s business.
Change of control provisions
There are no significant agreements which contain provisions 
entitling other parties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control of the Group, and no provisions in the 
Directors’ service agreements or employees’ contracts that provide 
for compensation for loss of office or employment occurring 
because of a takeover. Governance

Employment policies
The Group employed an average of 465 people in 2017 (2016: 517).
The Group has established employment policies that comply 
with current legislation and codes of practice, including in the 
areas of health and safety and equal opportunities. The Group 
consults employees on developments and changes to take 
account of their views when making decisions that may impact 
their interests.
The Group has in place a Diversity and Equality Policy which 
sets out Synectics’ approach to equal opportunities and avoidance 
of discrimination at work. This policy confirms the Group’s 
commitment to treating employees fairly and inclusively, ensuring 
that all decisions on recruitment, selection, training, promotion, 
career opportunities, pay and other terms and conditions are 
based solely on objective and job-related criteria. The Group is 
committed to offering employment to suitably qualified people 
with disabilities and making reasonable adjustments to the 
working environment to accommodate their needs. Where a role 
has an intrinsic occupational characteristic which may prevent the 
employment of a disabled applicant Synectics will make this clear 
during the recruitment process. The Group also makes every effort 
to continue the employment, training and promotion of disabled 
employees who develop disabilities during the course of their 
employment by making reasonable adjustments and providing 
appropriate support.
Employee engagement
The Group engages with its employees regularly through various 
media: email alerts, focus groups, monthly bulletins, team briefings, 
a biannual senior management conference and an annual staff 
survey. Details of the performance of the Group are shared with 
all employees at the appropriate time using the methods above.
The Group operates an HMRC-approved share incentive plan 
to encourage employees to take a greater interest in the Group’s 
performance through share ownership. Details are set out in the 
Remuneration Committee Report on pages 42 to 45.
Policy on payment of suppliers
The Group’s policy during the year was to pay suppliers in accordance 
with agreed terms. At 30 November 2017 the Group had 52 days’ 
purchases outstanding in trade payables (2016: 61 days’).
Charitable donations and activity
The Group made donations amounting to £1,764 (2016: £3,057) 
to charitable causes during the year.
Political donations
The Group made no political donations during the year. Its policy 
is not to make such donations. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. The Directors have reviewed the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, financial risk management, 
financial instruments, exposure to credit and liquidity risk, and 
financial forecasts. As a result of this review the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. Further details regarding 
the adoption of the going concern basis can be found in note 1 
to the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting is distributed 
separately to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. Separate Resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate issue. The poll results from the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting will be made available on the Company’s website after 
the meeting.
Auditor
As detailed in the Audit Committee Report, a tender of the external 
audit services contract was completed during the year and KPMG LLP 
was re-appointed by the Board, upon the recommendation of the 
Audit Committee. Accordingly, a Resolution for the re-appointment 
of KPMG LLP as auditor of the Company is to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Post-balance sheet events
There are no post-balance sheet events to report.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Having made the required enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) 
of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and each Director has taken all steps that ought to have 
been taken to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK  49
Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Financial statements
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 
reliable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; 
• assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or Parent Company or cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report and a Directors’ 
Report that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.
Forward-looking statements
This report may contain certain statements about the future outlook 
for Synectics plc. Although the Directors believe their expectations 
are based on reasonable assumptions, any statements about future 
outlook may be influenced by factors that could cause actual 
outcomes and results to be materially different.
The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
approved by the Board.

Risks and risk management
Risk
Factors that may impact the business
Mitigation 
What we are doing to minimise the risk
Expansion into the international 
transport & infrastructure sector
With the oil & gas market still depressed, expansion into the international 
transport & infrastructure sector is the key growth opportunity for the 
Group. There is a risk that the Group may fail to take full advantage of 
the opportunity presented by this sector due to a poor understanding 
of the markets or poor delivery of Synectics’ proposition.
The Group has in place a transport & infrastructure sector lead to develop 
and deliver the strategy for these markets and drive the business forward. 
Synectics has a proven and current track record of delivering large-scale, 
integrated solutions for transport & infrastructure environments and the 
core Synectics infrastructure offer, which combines smart technology 
and human capability, is readily deployable in these growing markets.
In addition, the allocation of development resource is kept under review 
to ensure the Group’s technical thinking is sufficiently agile and forward 
looking to successfully serve these markets.
People skills and dependency
As with most businesses, particularly those operating in a technical 
field, we are dependent on our employees with key managerial, 
engineering and technical skills.
The Group aims to offer appropriate remuneration packages and incentive 
arrangements, together with an agile environment which encourages and 
rewards excellent performance, in order to mitigate this risk. In addition the 
Group actively reviews its succession planning objectives and, in recent years, 
has increased its focus on personal development reviews and the provision 
of relevant training for all members of staff. 
Reputational risk
The nature of the Group’s business and its customer base means that 
Synectics is dependent for future business on its reputation in the 
marketplace, particularly for the quality and reliability of its products and 
services, and the overall integrity of its people.
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining Synectics’ strong culture and 
promoting its core values. The Board, and all levels of management, consistently 
emphasise the need to embed these attributes in the culture of the Group, and 
test this by regularly seeking feedback from customers and employees.
Project delivery risk and 
contractual liabilities
Where the Group’s service offering fails to meet agreed standards or 
timescales there is a risk that the Group will be exposed to cost 
overruns and claims for contractual liabilities as a result of this failure.
Project and service delivery are closely monitored and reviewed across Synectics 
on a regular and frequent basis. The Group maintains rigorous quality standards 
in all its operations, undertakes comprehensive risk assessments and carefully 
assesses the terms on which it agrees to enter into contractual relationships 
at appropriate levels of responsibility.
T echnological risk
As the industry becomes increasingly technical and transitions to digital 
technology, there is a risk that products become obsolete or irrelevant.
Synectics seeks to counter this risk through its investment in research & 
development resources and a continued focus on customer-led development 
to ensure that the most appropriate product development paths are followed. 
Product failure risk
Where the Group’s product offering fails to meet agreed standards 
there is a risk that the Group will be exposed to replacement or rework 
costs as a result of this failure, and the associated reputational impact 
on new business.
Product quality is closely monitored and reviewed across Synectics with 
comprehensive product testing and customer support in place. The Group 
maintains rigorous quality standards in all its operations and expects the 
same standards of its supplier base. Where possible product liability is 
mitigated through contractual arrangements within the supply chain.
Bad debt and non-recovery of costs risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of non-payment for work performed. 
This may be due to the inability of the customer to pay as a result of 
financial difficulty, or unwillingness to pay due to dissatisfaction with 
the work performed or dispute over the obligation to pay, particularly 
where extension of time and contract variations are claimed.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit using information 
supplied by independent rating agencies where available. The Group also uses other 
publicly available information and its own trading records to rate major customers.
Where possible credit risk is mitigated through deposit and milestone payment 
requirements which at least cover the cost of work performed. In addition financial 
instruments such as letters of credit are utilised where appropriate.
Robust reporting of outstanding positions, customer payment issues and 
projects experiencing delays is in place to the monthly business review 
meetings with the Executive Directors and exceptionally to the Board.
Price and margin pressure
The electronic security industry in general is competitive with continued 
pressure on sales and margins.
Synectics will continue to focus on customer sectors where electronic security 
systems have a critical cost of failure, or an extreme environmental requirement, 
rather than the mass volume markets. In addition Synectics will maintain a core 
of increasingly software-based proprietary technology giving higher-margin 
opportunities, and focus on developing recurring revenues.
Declining global energy prices impacting 
project awards and timescales
Declining returns for companies investing in large energy-related 
infrastructure ventures may lead to projects being delayed or cancelled 
altogether. This could reduce demand for the Group’s specialist products 
designed predominantly for the oil & gas sector, and hence negatively 
impact performance. These delays could also detrimentally impact the 
Group’s working capital position.
The Group mitigates this risk by addressing a number of sectors, other 
than oil & gas, which are less heavily influenced by oil prices, in particular 
by seeking to secure opportunities in the transport & infrastructure sector. 
In addition, overhead costs are kept under constant review to ensure that 
they are appropriate to activity levels within the business.
Exchange rate risk and Brexit
The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group manages this risk through the matching of foreign currency receipts 
and payments, where possible, or alternatively through forward exchange contracts. 
The Board is closely monitoring any risks or opportunities that may emerge as a 
result of any potential change in the UK’s relationship with the EU. We do not currently 
see any direct risks to the Group as a result of any change, although, as noted 
in the Chairman’s Statement, the Group’s results this year benefited again from 
favourable exchange rate movements in the translation of profits earned overseas.
Understanding and 
managing key risks 
to the Group
Synectics plc seeks to understand and manage 
the various risks that arise from its operations. 
The Group is subject to a variety of risks which 
may have an adverse impact on the business, 
results of operations, cash flow, turnover, 
profitability, assets, liquidity and capital reserves.
The principal risks facing the Group, and the strategies put in place 
to mitigate them, are described here.
The Board of Directors, advised by the Audit Committee, has 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. Responsibility for implementing 
sound and effective systems of internal control has been delegated 
by the Board to senior management. The purpose of the system of 
internal control is to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Directors have established an organisational structure with clear 
operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
In particular there are clear procedures for capital investment appraisal 
and approval, contract risk appraisal and financial reporting within 
a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework. 
The Directors believe the internal control environment is adequate 
and appropriate given the size and complexity of the Group. 
A robust risk reporting framework has been adopted by the Board. 
As part of this framework, the divisional management teams submit 
a report to monthly business review meetings setting out their 
top five business risks, mitigation plans and associated timescales. 
The Executive Directors review and challenge this risk analysis 
with the divisional management teams at each business review 
meeting. The Executive Directors then review the individual divisional 
submissions, consider the broader strategic threats facing the Group 
and present their assessment of the most significant risks facing the 
Group to the Audit Committee and then the Board twice a year for 
detailed review and discussion. The Audit Committee and Board 
also receive the detailed risk reviews prepared by the divisional 
teams and these business risk registers are used when setting 
the Group’s internal audit strategy.
In order to give additional assurance on controls, and to supplement 
the work undertaken by the external auditor, the Group uses the 
experience of its central accounting team to undertake a programme 
of internal audit approved by the Group’s Audit Committee.
Read more about how the Group manages risk in the Corporate 
Governance Statement from page 36.
The Audit Committee advises the Board of Directors on matters 
of risk management. It has its own report, which can be read 
on pages 39 to 41. 51

comprehensive product testing and customer support in place. The Group 
maintains rigorous quality standards in all its operations and expects the 
same standards of its supplier base. Where possible product liability is 
mitigated through contractual arrangements within the supply chain.
Bad debt and non-recovery of costs risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of non-payment for work performed. 
This may be due to the inability of the customer to pay as a result of 
financial difficulty, or unwillingness to pay due to dissatisfaction with 
the work performed or dispute over the obligation to pay, particularly 
where extension of time and contract variations are claimed.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit using information 
supplied by independent rating agencies where available. The Group also uses other 
publicly available information and its own trading records to rate major customers.
Where possible credit risk is mitigated through deposit and milestone payment 
requirements which at least cover the cost of work performed. In addition financial 
instruments such as letters of credit are utilised where appropriate.
Robust reporting of outstanding positions, customer payment issues and 
projects experiencing delays is in place to the monthly business review 
meetings with the Executive Directors and exceptionally to the Board.
Price and margin pressure
The electronic security industry in general is competitive with continued 
pressure on sales and margins.
Synectics will continue to focus on customer sectors where electronic security 
systems have a critical cost of failure, or an extreme environmental requirement, 
rather than the mass volume markets. In addition Synectics will maintain a core 
of increasingly software-based proprietary technology giving higher-margin 
opportunities, and focus on developing recurring revenues.
Declining global energy prices impacting 
project awards and timescales
Declining returns for companies investing in large energy-related 
infrastructure ventures may lead to projects being delayed or cancelled 
altogether. This could reduce demand for the Group’s specialist products 
designed predominantly for the oil & gas sector, and hence negatively 
impact performance. These delays could also detrimentally impact the 
Group’s working capital position.
The Group mitigates this risk by addressing a number of sectors, other 
than oil & gas, which are less heavily influenced by oil prices, in particular 
by seeking to secure opportunities in the transport & infrastructure sector. 
In addition, overhead costs are kept under constant review to ensure that 
they are appropriate to activity levels within the business.
Exchange rate risk and Brexit
The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group manages this risk through the matching of foreign currency receipts 
and payments, where possible, or alternatively through forward exchange contracts. 
The Board is closely monitoring any risks or opportunities that may emerge as a 
result of any potential change in the UK’s relationship with the EU. We do not currently 
see any direct risks to the Group as a result of any change, although, as noted 
in the Chairman’s Statement, the Group’s results this year benefited again from 
favourable exchange rate movements in the translation of profits earned overseas. 52

Independent auditor’s report
To the members of Synectics plc
1 Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Synectics plc (‘the 
Company’) for the year ended 30 November 2017 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Company Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Company Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Company Statement of Financial Position and the 
related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 November 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group in accordance with, 
UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed entities. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion 
above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition
(£70.1 million; 2016: £70.9 million)
Refer to page 40 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 62 (accounting policy) 
and page 67 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate
The Group recognises a majority of its revenue 
and profit based on the stage of completion 
either by reference to the proportion of contract 
costs incurred to the statement of financial position 
date compared with the estimated final costs of 
the contract at completion or by reference to the 
physical stage of completion of the contract.
The recognition of revenue and profit relies on 
estimates in relation to the forecast total costs 
or stage of physical completion of each contract. 
Changes to these estimates could give rise to 
material variances in the amount of revenue 
and profit recognised. 
The revenue on contracts may also include 
variations and claims which are recognised on 
a contract-by-contract basis where the Group 
believes the rights and obligations exist and 
amounts can be measured reliably.
Our procedures included:
• Control design: we evaluated the controls 
designed and implemented by the Group in 
assessing the forecast total costs or stage of 
completion of each contract by testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls.
• Test of detail: using a variety of quantitative 
and qualitative criteria we selected a sample 
of contracts to assess and challenge the most 
complex contract estimates.
• Test of detail: we evaluated the 
appropriateness of manual adjustments to 
revenue through discussion with the Group 
and corroboration to supporting documentation.
• Historical comparisons: we considered the 
financial performance of the selected sample 
of contracts against budget and historical trends 
by assessing the historical accuracy of judgement 
of the forecast total costs or final out-turn on 
contracts made in previous financial years. 53

The risk Our response
Revenue recognition continued Therefore there is a high degree of risk 
and associated management judgement 
in estimating the amount of revenue and 
associated profit to be recognised by the 
Group up to the year end and changes 
to these estimates could give rise to 
material variances.
• Test of detail: we inspected the contracts 
for key clauses, identifying relevant contractual 
mechanisms and assessing whether these key 
clauses have been appropriately reflected in the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
• Customer correspondence scrutiny: we 
assessed correspondence with customers 
around variations and claims and considered 
whether this information was consistent with 
the estimates made by the Group.
• Test of detail: we assessed the profile of 
accrued income with a focus on the likely 
recoverability of that balance and agreed 
the above to correspondence and meeting 
minutes with customers around variations, 
corroborating with assessments of these 
positions from the Group’s legal or technical 
experts, if applicable.
Carrying value of goodwill
(£20.0 million; 2016: £19.9 million)
Refer to page 40 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 61 (accounting policy) 
and page 74 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The Group’s Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position includes goodwill, 
principally arising from historical acquisitions in 
the UK. The risk is that the goodwill allocated to 
cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) is not recoverable 
and should be impaired. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows, which are the basis of the 
assessment of recoverability, this is one of the 
key judgemental areas for our audit.
The Group annually carries out an impairment 
assessment of goodwill using a value-in-use 
model which is based on the net present 
value of the forecast earnings of the CGU. 
This is calculated using certain assumptions 
around discount rates, growth rates and 
cash flow forecasts. 
Our procedures included:
• Critical assessment of key assumptions:  
We critically assessed the key assumptions 
applied by the Group in determining the 
recoverable amounts of each CGU. 
In particular, we:
• considered the consistency and 
appropriateness of the allocation of 
businesses and related goodwill balances 
into CGUs in light of our knowledge of 
the Group;
• considered the underlying assumptions 
in determining the cash flows and growth 
assumptions applied with reference to 
historical forecasting accuracy and wider 
macro environment conditions;
• challenged the assumptions used in the 
calculation of the discount rates used by the 
Group, including comparisons with external 
data sources; and
• performed our own sensitivity analysis, 
including a reasonably possible reduction 
in assumed growth rates and cash flows to 
identify areas to focus our procedures on, 
and sensitised the total discounted cash 
flows of the Group against the notional 
enterprise value of the Group.
• Assessing transparency:  
We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions appropriately reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill.

The risk Our response
Recoverability of Parent 
Company’s investment 
in subsidiaries
(£19.6 million; 2016: £19.5 million)
Refer to page 40 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 89 (accounting policy) 
and page 91 (financial disclosures).
High value
The carrying amount of the Parent Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries represents 38% 
(2016: 38%) of the Company’s total assets. 
Their recoverability is not at a high risk 
of significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement. However, due to 
their materiality in the context of the 
Parent Company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area that 
had the greatest effect on our overall 
Parent Company audit.
Our procedures included: 
• Carrying value comparison:  
We compared the carrying amount of the total 
investment balance for all subsidiaries with 
the relevant subsidiaries’ draft statements of 
financial position to identify whether their net 
assets, being an approximation of their minimum 
recoverable amount, were in excess of their 
carrying amount.
• Consideration of subsidiary audit findings:  
We critically assessed the work performed by 
the subsidiary audit teams on that sample of 
those subsidiaries and considered the results 
of that work on those subsidiaries’ profits 
and net assets.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £650,000 (2016: £650,000), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of revenue of £70.1 million (2016: £70.9 million), of which it represents 0.9% (2016: 0.9%). Revenue was deemed to be 
an appropriate benchmark because using a profit based benchmark would result in an inappropriately low benchmark that would not 
be a useful basis for determining materiality.
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £460,000 (2016: £460,000), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of total assets, of which it represents 0.9% (2016: 0.9%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £32,500 (2016: £32,500), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Audit scoping covered 100% of Group revenue and profit before tax (2016: 100%). 
Of the Group’s nine reporting components, we subjected six components (2016: six) to full scope audits for Group purposes and three 
non-significant components (2016: three) to reviews of financial information (including enquiry).
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated below.

3 Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit continued
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and 
the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materiality of £487,500 (2016: £487,500), having regard 
to the mix of size and risk profile of the components across the Group.
The work on the overseas components was performed by 
component auditors (as in prior year) and the rest, including the 
audit of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team. 
Telephone conference meetings were held with these component 
auditors as they were not physically visited. At these meetings, 
the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more 
detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then 
performed by the component auditor.
4 We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there 
is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt 
over the use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements. We have 
nothing to report in these respects. 
5 We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the 
Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information 
and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as 
explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work 
we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
6 We have nothing to report on the other matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on pages 
48 and 49, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the 
Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion 
in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
applied consistently to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU (‘adopted IFRS’), and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under adopted IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; these are presented 
on pages 86 to 95. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 November 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries.
These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except where the measurement of balances at fair 
value is required as set out below. The following policies are those that the Group considers to be its principal accounting policies in respect 
of its consolidated results.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
As at 30 November 2017 there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations in issue (some of which have not yet been 
adopted by the EU) with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and which have not been 
early adopted by the Group. 
Effective for periods 
Endorsed beginning on or after:
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows 1 January 2017
Disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 7
IAS 12 Income Taxes 1 January 2017
Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses – amendments to IAS 12
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments 1 January 2018
Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions – 
amendments to IFRS 2
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Directors anticipate that all of the above standards, interpretations and amendments will be adopted in the Group’s financial statements 
for the accounting periods commencing on or after 1 December 2017 as appropriate. 
IFRS 15 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and is therefore applicable to the Group’s 
financial statements for the accounting period commencing on 1 December 2018. The standard should be applied in full for the year of 
adoption, including retrospective application to all contracts that were not yet complete at the beginning of that period. During the year 
the Group has continued to assess the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 with the key commercial and accounting issues being identified. 
An implementation plan is well advanced and communicated to senior management. 
IFRS 16 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. It can be adopted earlier, as long as IFRS 15 
has also been adopted. The standard can be applied with full retrospective effect or the cumulative impact of initially applying IFRS 16 
can be adjusted into opening equity at the date of initial application. During the year the Group commenced an impact assessment.
The Group is presently unable to quantify any potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 on the financial statements. 
Any impact will be calculated during the year ended 30 November 2018.
All other new standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, and information 
on the financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position, are described in the reports which together make up the 
Strategic Report on pages 4 to 31 and on pages 50 and 51.
As detailed in note 19, the Group has secured banking facilities in place which are used to meet the day-to-day working capital requirements. 
There are various covenants attached to these facilities. The Directors have considered the financial position of the Group at 30 November 2017 
and the projected cash flows and financial performance of the Group for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these 
financial statements.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group would 
be able to operate within the terms of its current facilities.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and have adequate 
resources to continue in operation as a going concern for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group 
takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred 
to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
Change in subsidiary ownership and loss of control
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest 
and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is 
measured at fair value when control is lost.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded at cost, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value at the date of acquisition of the Group’s share 
of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, less accumulated impairment losses. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill would not be 
reversed in a subsequent period.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Financial statements

Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value-added tax, is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced 
for rebates and other similar allowances. 
Installation contract income
Revenue and profits attributable to contracts are included in the Consolidated Income Statement as the contracts proceed in proportions 
relevant to their stage of completion. This is either based on costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total contract costs or physical 
proportion of contract work completed in relation to the total, less amounts recognised in previous years.
Contract balances
When contract costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed payments on account, the surplus is shown 
as amounts recoverable on contracts. For contracts where payments on account exceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognised 
profits less recognised losses, the surplus is shown as the amounts due to customers for contract work. Amounts received before the related 
work is performed are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as a liability. Amounts billed for work performed but not yet 
paid by the customer are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under trade and other receivables.
The Group sells certain products bundled with maintenance or other services to be delivered over a predetermined period of time. Where 
the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other such that each component represents a 
separable good or service that can be provided to customers, either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra or, alternatively, where 
one or more of the components may be capable of being provided by another supplier, these are considered as identifiable and separate 
components to which general revenue recognition criteria can be applied separately. Once the separate components have been 
identified, the amount received or receivable from the customer is allocated based on the individual component’s fair value.
Maintenance contracts
Income receivable from maintenance contracts is recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Income from 
maintenance contracts which relates to periods subsequent to the year end is included in current liabilities as deferred income.
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the goods, which primarily takes place on delivery of the goods. 
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease. 
Benefits received as an incentive to sign a lease, whatever form they may take, are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group entity are expressed in sterling (‘£’), which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial 
position date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the prevailing rates. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither 
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised 
directly in equity in the translation reserve. Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a hedge of a net investment in a 
foreign operation are recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged 
part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is recycled to profit or loss as an adjustment to the 
profit or loss on disposal.

Foreign currency continued
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are expressed 
in sterling using exchange rates prevailing at the statement of financial position date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and recognised in the Group’s foreign 
currency translation reserve. Such exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the 
foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the rates prevailing at the statement of financial position date.
Retirement benefit costs
Group employees are members of various pension schemes, all of which operate on a money purchase basis. Contributions to these schemes 
are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
The Group also operates a retirement benefit scheme, which has deferred defined benefit members. The expected return on the scheme’s 
assets and the expected increase in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities during the period are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement as other finance income and charges as appropriate. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. Pension scheme liabilities and, to the extent that they are recoverable, pension scheme assets are recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and represent the difference between the market value of the scheme’s assets and 
the present value of the scheme’s liabilities.
Pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and are discounted at a rate using 
the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability. Past service cost is recognised 
immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period 
until the benefits become vested.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is recognised 
as an employee expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest. The fair value of the options granted is calculated using an option pricing model which is based on the Black-Scholes 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Executive Shared Ownership Plan are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore 
reflected in the Parent Company and Group financial statements. In particular the scheme’s purchases of shares in the Company are 
debited directly to equity, within ‘Other reserves’.
Taxation
The income tax expense is the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the Consolidated Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences 
and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Financial statements

Taxation continued
Deferred tax continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled 
or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial 
position date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner 
in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off tax assets against tax liabilities and when they relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and the Group intends to settle its tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the period
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when they relate to 
items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial 
accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill 
or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities over the cost of the business combination.
Non-underlying items
The Group discloses certain financial information both including and excluding non-underlying items. The presentation of information 
excluding non-underlying items allows a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group and provides consistency 
with the Group’s internal management reporting. Non-underlying items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence and the 
Directors consider that these items should be separately identified.
Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Directors and unpaid at the end of the year are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been 
approved by shareholders at a general meeting of the Company. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land which is not depreciated, 
less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, commencing on the first day of the month after 
being brought into use. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Freehold buildings   – 2%
• Short leasehold improvements – over the term of the lease
• Plant, equipment and motor vehicles  – 10% to 33%
Residual values, remaining useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains or losses on disposal are included in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Research & development costs
Research costs are written off to the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Development costs are capitalised and held as ‘Intangible assets’ in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the costs 
relate to a clearly defined project; the costs are separately identifiable; the outcome of such a project has been assessed with reasonable 
certainty as to its technical feasibility and its ultimate commercial viability; the aggregate of the deferred costs plus all future expected 
costs in bringing the product to market is exceeded by the future expected sales revenue; and adequate resources are expected to exist 
to enable the project to be completed. Amortisation is charged over the useful life of the product, from the commencement of commercial 
sales, which is usually over a period of three to five years.
Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
This policy includes judgements regarding the initial recognition of the asset based upon market research and expected future net 
revenues. It also includes estimations regarding the period of amortisation.
Development costs that do not meet these criteria are written off to the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.

Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, such as purchased computer software, are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis from the date the assets are available for use over 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset. The useful life of purchased software is three to five years.
Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill 
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets, other than 
goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible 
to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset 
belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual CGUs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in income. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in income.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in first out basis. In the case of finished goods, cost includes 
all direct expenditure and production overheads based on the normal level of activity. Where necessary, an appropriate allowance is made 
for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the statement 
of financial position date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Deferred consideration relating to business combinations
Deferred consideration relating to business combinations is initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and at subsequent 
reporting dates measured in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised 
in profit or loss.
Restructuring
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will be carried out.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to 
exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it. Financial statements

Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an 
equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Hedge accounting is undertaken by the Group in 
respect of a balance sheet hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits and bank current accounts. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost less any 
impairment loss.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost.
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings comprise bank term loans and bank overdrafts.
Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. To meet these criteria, the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event 
and must be legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances: the normal course of business, the event of default and the event 
of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. We continually evaluate our 
estimates, judgements and associated assumptions based on available information, experience and any other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. As the use of estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. To date there has been no 
material impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities from such estimates.
Management has discussed its significant estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit Committee. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity are described below:
Revenue recognition
When the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the statement of financial position date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for 
work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. 
Variations in contract work are included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable.
Judgement is required in assessing the nature of the contracts to determine if long-term contract accounting should be applied. Where 
the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is 
probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Judgement is also required in assessing whether a contract becomes onerous. When it is considered probable that total contract costs 
will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where products and maintenance are bundled in a contract some judgement may be required to identify the separate components which 
are recognised in accordance with general revenue recognition criteria.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Goodwill
Goodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. As a 
result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a CGU level. The determination of the CGU is judgemental and for 
goodwill impairment purposes represents the lowest level within the business at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes, and cannot be larger than an operating segment. The relevant CGUs are deemed to be Systems and Integration & Managed 
Services which match the segments identified in the Group’s segmental reporting.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated. The 
value-in-use calculation includes estimates about future financial performance and long-term growth rates and requires management to 
select a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The key assumptions used in the impairment 
review are disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements.
The future cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations are based on the latest three-year financial plans approved by the Board. 
Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets in which the CGU operates. The discount rate is 
derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital, which is assessed each year. The discount rate used in each CGU 
is adjusted for the risk specific to that CGU. The Directors perform sensitivity analysis to determine whether any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts are based would cause the CGUs’ carrying amounts to exceed the 
recoverable amounts. 
2 Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’). The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive as he is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to the 
segments and the assessment of the performance of each of the segments. Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s 
strategic operating segments. The operating segment reporting format reflects the differing economic characteristics and nature of the 
services provided by the Group and is the basis on which strategic and operating decisions are made by the CODM.
The management of the Group’s operations, excluding Central functions, is organised within two strategic operating segments: Systems 
and Integration & Managed Services. The Systems segment develops, integrates and delivers resilient, flexible electronic surveillance solutions 
based around its proprietary hardware and software, and operates globally across all sectors. The Integration & Managed Services segment 
focusses on the design, delivery, maintenance and management of end-to-end security and surveillance systems for high security & public 
space applications, and operates principally in the UK. These, together with Central functions, comprise the Group’s three reportable segments. 
No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable segments. 
The CODM uses underlying operating profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments’ 
results as it reflects the segments’ underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation. Underlying operating profit is a 
consistent measure used within the Group.

Reconciliation of tax charge for the year
The corporation tax assessed for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.33% (2016: 20%). 
The differences are explained below:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 2,996 1,955
Tax on profit on ordinary activities before tax at standard rate of 19.33% (2016: 20%) 579 391

Restatement of deferred tax balances for change in UK tax rate (14) 23
Adjustment in respect of prior periods (222) (97)
Total tax charge for the year 443 484
The Group’s tax rate is sensitive to a geographic mix of profits and reflects a combination of higher rates in certain jurisdictions, such as 
the US and the UK, and lower rates in Singapore and Macau. The Group’s effective tax rate in 2017 has been impacted by the truing up 
of prudent tax provisions booked in the prior year. Over the medium term, the effective tax rate is expected to increase as the business 
continues to be profitable going forward.

Deferred tax continued
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The UK government announced its intention to reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% effective by 1 April 2020. This was substantively 
enacted during the prior year. Accordingly deferred tax has been provided for at the rate at which it is expected to be settled.
Deferred tax assets of £0.3 million (2016: £0.4 million) have been recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss 
in the preceding periods. The assets are recognised based upon future taxable profit forecasts for the entities concerned.
The Group has further tax losses which may be available to be carried forward for offset against the future taxable profits of certain Group 
companies amounting to approximately £4.8 million (2016: £4.0 million). No deferred tax asset (2016: £nil) in respect of these losses has 
been recognised at the year end as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits. 
In addition to the above, the Group has capital losses of approximately £17.8 million (2016: £17.8 million) available for offset against future 
taxable gains. No deferred tax asset in respect of these losses, which would amount to £3.0 million, has been recognised in these financial 
statements as there is insufficient certainty that the asset will be recovered against future capital gains.

Proposed final dividend for the year ended 30 November 3.0 506 2.0 340
The proposed final dividend for the year ended 30 November 2017 has not yet been approved by shareholders and as such has not been 
included as a liability as at 30 November 2017. Subject to approval, this is expected to be paid on 4 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 3 April 2018. This will give a total dividend for the year of 4.0p per share (2016: 2.0p per share).

Annual test for impairment of goodwill
The Group has assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill by comparing it to the value in use of the CGUs to which it relates. Goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the CGUs as follows:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Systems 15,399 15,341
Integration & Managed Services 4,580 4,580
19,979 19,921
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined based on a value-in-use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets and business plans approved by the Directors covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond that period have been 
extrapolated using a steady 2.25% per annum growth rate, which the Directors consider to be specific to the business and does not 
exceed the UK long-term average growth rate, and is therefore considered appropriate to apply to each of the CGUs.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows:
• terminal value applied after ten years assuming a nine (2016: nine) times multiple; and
• pre-tax discount rates as follows:
2017 2016
% %
Systems 13.1 12.6
Integration & Managed Services 12.9 12.8

14 Intangible assets continued
Annual test for impairment of goodwill continued
The discount rates used are based on the Group weighted average cost of capital, which has been risk adjusted to reflect divisional 
specific risks such as the nature of the market served, cost profiles and the barriers to entry into each market segment, as well as other 
macro-economic factors. 
The other key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations 
of the future performance of the CGUs. 
The Directors believe that, based on sensitivity analysis performed, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the 
recoverable amounts are based would not cause the CGUs’ carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts. There is no impairment 
to goodwill in the period (2016: no impairment).

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at shareholder meetings. The 1,263,351 shares (2016: 1,331,750) held under the Group Executive Shared Ownership Plan (‘ExSOP’) 
at 30 November 2017 are treated as treasury shares and are therefore excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation.
The merger reserve has been created in accordance with sections 612 and 613 of the Companies Act 2006 whereby the premium on 
ordinary shares in the Company issued to acquire shares has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account.
The cost of own shares held within the ExSOP of £2,908,332 (2016: £3,064,139) has been deducted from other reserves. The nominal 
value of these shares is £252,670 (2016: £266,350).  Financial statements

22 Options over shares of Synectics plc
The Group operated three share schemes in the year: the Quadnetics Employees’ Share Acquisition Plan, the Quadnetics Executive 
Shared Ownership Plan and the Synectics Performance Share Plan.
Quadnetics Employees’ Share Acquisition Plan
The Quadnetics Employees’ Share Acquisition Plan (‘ESAP’) was adopted on 23 April 2010. Deductions from salary are used to buy 
partnership shares in Synectics plc at the end of each six-month accumulation period. The Trustee will use any dividend income paid on 
these shares to buy further shares to be held in the scheme as dividend shares. 
Partnership shares can be withdrawn from the scheme by the employee at any time, but withdrawals before the fifth anniversary after 
purchase are subject to income tax; withdrawals after the fifth anniversary of their purchase date can be made in full and are not subject 
to income tax. Dividend shares are required to be held in trust for a period of three years following the purchase date. Employees who 
leave the Group are required to withdraw all of their shares in the scheme and are subject to the same rules.
The scheme holds 76,625 (2016: 73,744) ordinary shares at 30 November 2017, which were acquired by the Scheme Trustee as follows:

Quadnetics Executive Shared Ownership Plan
The Quadnetics Executive Shared Ownership Plan (‘ExSOP’) was formed in July 2009. Under the provisions of the ExSOP, shares 
(‘ExSOP shares’) are jointly owned by nominated senior employees and by an employees’ share trust on terms, similar to a share option 
scheme, whereby the value of appreciation in the Company’s share price over a minimum three-year period accrues to the relevant 
employee, provided the Company meets certain performance thresholds. 
In summary, none of the awarded ExSOP shares will vest unless the total return (dividends plus share price appreciation) on the 
Company’s shares is better than the performance of the FTSE AIM All Share Total Return Index (‘Index’) over the three-year period from 
award. The shares will vest fully if the Company’s performance beats the Index by more than 5% over that period. If the Company’s 
share performance matches the Index, then 25% of the awarded shares will vest and between these points vesting will be pro-rata.
ExSOP shares outstanding at 30 November 2017 are exercisable as follows:

Dividends have been waived in respect of the 929,208 (2016: 784,607) shares not specifically allocated to employees.
Synectics Performance Share Plan
The Synectics Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) was formed on 9 October 2012.
Under the PSP, selected employees are entitled to exercise an option to receive a certain number of Synectics plc shares at any time 
after a three-year vesting period, at no cost to themselves. The number of shares that are awarded at the end of the three-year period is 
dependent on the achievement of certain performance criteria.
The performance criteria are identical to those that apply under the existing ExSOP. Provided that the total return on Synectics plc shares 
has outperformed the Index by 5% or more in the three years following the award, beneficiaries will be entitled to receive the full number 
of shares awarded. If Synectics plc’s share performance matches the Index, then 25% of the awarded shares will vest and between these 
points vesting will be pro-rata. If the total return on Synectics plc shares underperforms the Index, then no entitlement will vest. The limit 
on the number of shares over which interests may be awarded also remains unchanged.
It is intended that if the performance criteria are met in full or part, the appropriate number of shares will be transferred to the employees 
from unallocated Synectics plc shares already held within the employee benefit trust established for the existing ExSOP.

23 Share-based payment charge
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted or awards made under the Group’s share schemes is measured 
by reference to the fair value of the share options granted or share scheme shares awarded.
For the equity-settled share scheme awards, the estimate of the fair value of the services received for accounting purposes is measured 
based on an adjusted Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions:
March 2014 March 2015 March 2016 March 2017
Synectics PSP awards awards awards awards
Number of share options awarded 25,500 335,000 155,000 88,500

Risk-free interest rate 3.1% 1.8% 1.8% 1.4%
Vesting period 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years
Expected life of option 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2017 is £1.94 (2016: £1.01).
The expected volatility is based wholly on the historical volatility.
Share options and share scheme awards are granted under a service condition and also for grants to employees under the ExSOP 
and PSP, a performance measure based around the Company’s share price relative to the Index.
The total charge recognised for the year arising from share-based payments is as follows:

The Group’s lease commitments primarily relate to land and buildings and vehicles.
28 Pension commitments 
The Group operates a closed defined benefit pension scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes.
a) Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates the Quadrant Group plc Retirement Benefit Scheme. This scheme includes a defined benefit section and a defined 
contribution section both in respect of past employees. The accrual of benefits in the defined benefit section ceased in 1996 and the 
liabilities relate only to members with preserved benefits or pensions in payment. A full actuarial valuation was carried out by a qualified 
independent actuary, independent of the scheme’s sponsoring employer, as at 30 June 2016. These results have been updated to 
30 November 2017. The major assumptions used by the actuary are shown below.
The Group has paid contributions of £1,000 (2016: £8,000) in the year.
The disclosures below relate to the defined benefit section, with the contributions to the defined contribution section being disclosed 
in section b) on page 83.

Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation
The sensitivities shown are approximate and each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation sensitivity includes the 
impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 
30 November 2017 is 12 years (2016: 12 years).
Change in assumption Change in liability
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% pa Increase by 3.0%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% pa No change
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of one year Increase by 4.1%
The Company estimates that no additional contributions will be paid to the plan during the year ending 30 November 2018.
b) Defined contribution schemes
Contributions made by the Company to the defined contribution section of the Quadrant Group plc Retirement Benefit Scheme amounted 
to £nil in the year (2016: £5,000).
There are also a number of other defined contribution pension schemes operated by various companies within the Group. The Group’s 
total expense for these other schemes in the year was £635,000 (2016: £521,000). 
29 Financial instruments 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held in interest-bearing current accounts (note 17), loans and borrowings on fixed terms 
(note 19), bank overdrafts (note 19) and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital (note 21), 
reserves and retained earnings. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s dividend policy 
depends on both the earnings profile and investment opportunities together with wider macro-economic factors.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates. At 1 December 2016 the functional 
currency of the Singaporean subsidiary was changed from Singapore dollars to US dollars. The main foreign currencies in which the 
Group currently operates are the US dollar and the euro.
The Group’s policy is to manage transaction exposure in respect of the Group’s UK subsidiaries where appropriate through the use of 
forward exchange contracts, which are entered into in respect of forecast foreign currency transactions when the amount and timing of 
such forecast transactions becomes reasonably certain. The Group had no commitments in respect of forward exchange contracts at 
either 30 November 2017 or 30 November 2016.
At 30 November 2017, certain subsidiaries within the Group had the following forecast foreign currency transactions during the next two 
years which have not been hedged, principally due to either natural hedges being available of receipts against payments or to significant 
uncertainty over the timing of the transactions:

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its overseas subsidiaries. These profits are 
translated at average exchange rates for the year which is an approximation to rates at the date of transaction. The Group’s overseas 
subsidiaries account for approximately -0.6% (2016: 10.2%) of the Group’s net assets as follows:
2017 2016
Functional currency of entity % %
United States dollars 9.0 6.0
Euros (9.6) (7.9)
Singapore dollars – 12.1
Total (0.6) 10.2
Translation exposure in respect of these assets is not hedged.
At 30 November 2017 the Group held foreign currency cash balances of $2,818,000 (2016: $2,881,000) and S$161,000 (2016: S$756,000), 
and was overdrawn by €5,810,000 (2016: €3,307,000).
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% fall in the relevant foreign currencies:
USD impact Euro impact SGD impact

The table below shows the extent to which the Group had significant monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the local 
currency of the company in which they are recorded. Foreign exchange differences on the retranslation of these assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting in 
financial loss to the Group, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and interest-bearing current accounts. 
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed 
on all customers requiring credit using information supplied by independent rating agencies where available. The Group also uses other 
publicly available information and its own trading records to rate major customers. The credit risk on current accounts is limited because 
the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At the statement of financial position date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient cash to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group ensures 
that sufficient cash and undrawn facilities are available to fund ongoing operations and to meet its medium-term capital and funding 
obligations, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
At the year end, the Group had net funds of:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Current accounts (note 17) 4,721 5,848
Loans and borrowings (note 19) (900) (3,678)
3,821 2,170
The level of the Group’s bank overdraft facilities is reviewed annually, and at 30 November 2017 the Group had undrawn overdraft facilities 
of up to £8.0 million, on which interest would be payable at the rate of bank base rate +2.0%.
Financial liabilities of the Group principally comprise trade creditors falling due for payment within twelve months of the statement of 
financial position date (2016: twelve months), bank overdraft repayable on demand and a term loan which falls due for final repayment 
within one year of the statement of financial position date.
Interest risk 
Interest-bearing assets comprise cash held in current accounts, earning interest at bank base rate. During the year these bank deposits 
bore interest at base rate of 0.25% from 1 December 2016 to 2 November 2017 and 0.5% from 2 November 2017 to the end of the year 
(2016: 0.5% to 4 August 2016 and 0.25% from 4 August 2016 to the end of the year). The Group benchmarks the rates being obtained in 
order to maximise its returns within the credit risk framework referred to above.
Interest rates charged for the bank overdraft and term loan are set out in note 19.
The Group’s funding position did not carry any significant interest rate risk at 30 November 2017 or 30 November 2016.
A 0.5% rise or fall in interest rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
30 Subsidiaries
The Group consists of a Parent Company, Synectics plc, incorporated in the UK and a number of subsidiaries held directly and indirectly 
by Synectics plc, which operate and are incorporated around the world. Note 7 to the Company’s financial statements lists details 
of all subsidiaries.
One subsidiary, Synectic Systems (Macau) Limited, has an accounting reference date of 31 December, which is different to that of the 
consolidated financial statements of 30 November. This is to more closely align the accounting period with the tax reporting requirements 
in Macau and thereby reduce administrative costs.  Financial statements

Going concern
The Directors have assessed, in light of current and anticipated economic conditions, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Parent Company financial 
statements. For further consideration of the going concern position of the Group see page 48 of the Directors’ Report.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.
Notes to the Company financial statements
For the year ended 30 November 2017 89
Synectics plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
1 Company accounting policies continued
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost plus deemed capital contributions arising from share-based payment transactions less any 
provision for impairment. The Company records an increase in its investments in subsidiaries equal to the share-based payments charge 
recognised by its subsidiaries with a corresponding credit to equity. Details of the Group’s share-based payment charge are set out in 
note 23 of the Group financial statements.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted 
for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned, commencing on the first day of the month after being brought into use. 
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are 10%–33%.
Intangible assets
Purchased computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis from the date the assets are available for use over the estimated 
useful lives of the intangible asset. The useful life of purchased software is three to five years.
Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the statement of financial position date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
At each statement of financial position date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the prevailing rates. 
Employee share schemes
Transactions of the Company-sponsored ExSOP are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Parent 
Company financial statements. In particular, the scheme’s purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Other significant accounting policies
Other significant accounting policies are consistent with the Group accounts and the table below references where they are disclosed:

Significant estimates
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
Management has discussed its significant estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit Committee. An area involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity is the recoverability of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries. The Company assesses the carrying 
value of its investments in subsidiaries using the value-in-use model. The value-in-use calculation includes estimates about future financial 
performance and long-term growth rates and requires management to select a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value 
of those cash flows. The key assumptions used in the impairment review are disclosed in note 14 of the Group financial statements. The 
future cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations are based on the latest three-year financial plans approved by the Board. 
2 Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Company’s annual accounts are £37,000 (2016: £39,000).
3 Directors and employees
The remuneration of the Directors is set out below:
2017 2016
Directors’ emoluments £000 £000

Pension benefits under defined contribution plans 22 33

Detailed information on the emoluments, pensions, option holdings and shareholdings for each Director is shown in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 42 to 45.
The average number of persons (including Executive Directors) employed by the Company during the year was 13 (2016: 13).

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 30 November 2017 has not yet been approved by shareholders and as such has not been 
included as a liability as at 30 November 2017. Subject to approval, this is expected to be paid on 4 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 3 April 2018. This will give a total dividend for the year of 4.0p per share (2016: 2.0p per share).
