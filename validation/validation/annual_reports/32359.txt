Chairman’s statement
Financial results
The Group’s reported revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2017 was £141.6 million, in line with that reported 
in the previous year. The reported profit before tax improved 
to £8.8 million, compared with a loss of £0.3 million in the 
previous year and a loss of £6.1 million in the year before 
that. The positive direction of travel is clear, as is the success 
of our programme of cost control. 
Funds under Management and Administration stood at 
£24.0 billion at the year-end, compared with £20.5 billion  
the year before, an increase of 17.1%. This mirrors the 
improvement in the market index that we track, though 
the increase in Discretionary funds was significantly ahead 
of this over the 12-month period, up from £9.4 billion to 
£11.4 billion, or 21.3%. 
Our cash position remains strong, at £58.4 million compared 
with £48.4 million at the previous year-end (both years are 
inclusive of cash balances held within assets held for sale). 
Remuneration structures
It is pleasing to report that by the year-end we had 
substantially completed our major project of restructuring 
the remuneration arrangements of our investment managers. 
The Board has been closely involved in the remuneration 
project, as I described in my statement last year, and I 
should like to thank all of our investment managers for their 
help and support in bringing this exercise to a successful 
completion. As a consequence we have greater alignment 
with the strategy of the business and better regulatory 
outcomes – for example the incentive structures in 
Investment Management Services and Financial Planning 
are no longer purely financial but are also linked directly 
to standards of conduct. Throughout, the interests of our 
clients have always been, and remain, uppermost. The high 
score of 93% overall client satisfaction achieved in this year’s 
surveys are testament to this.
On page 4 of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Paul Abberley, addresses in greater detail our strategic 
development and implementation. 
Governance review
During the year, considerable work has been carried out 
reviewing our corporate governance framework. We have 
restructured the relationship between our two principal 
boards – Charles Stanley Group PLC (the holding company, 
or CSG) and Charles Stanley & Co. Limited (the principal 
regulated entity, or CSC) – and reorganised the committee 
arrangements. More senior managers have joined the 
Executive Committee, chaired by Paul Abberley, which not 
only develops and implements strategy as agreed by the 
CSG Board, but also manages the business on a day-to-day 
basis. More detail of the new governance framework is set 
out in the Governance section on pages 46 to 97. 
Sir David Howard
Chairman
2017 has been another year of 
significant transformation for the 
Group and we have made good 
progress against our articulated 
strategy. It is pleasing to announce 
that the transformation programme 
is bearing fruit, with sustained 
revenues despite the disposal of 
non-core activities last year, and 
a welcome return to profitability.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Board changes
David Pusinelli has decided not to put his name forward for 
re-election as a Non-executive Director at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. David has been a highly valued 
member of the team, and has managed his roles as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and as Senior Independent Director 
with skill and effectiveness. David joined the Board in 2012 
and has contributed significantly to the progress of the 
Group. The Board thanks him sincerely for his help and 
advice, and wishes him good health and a long retirement. 
A search is well advanced for additional Non-executive 
Directors, with the guidance of professional external 
consultants, and we hope to make an announcement 
to shareholders in the near future. 
Turning to our Executive Directors, it was to our regret that 
Michael Lilwall advised us in the autumn of his wish to step 
down from the Board for personal reasons. Michael joined 
Charles Stanley in 1997 and has played a significant role in 
many of our developments since that time. We are delighted 
that, though no longer a Director, he remains with the Group 
and will continue to look after a number of valued clients.
In last year’s report I referred to the resignation, just after 
the year-end, of Anthony Scott. Anthony was a Director 
and the co-head of the Investment Management Services 
division, which represents the great majority of our business. 
To both Michael and Anthony I express the warmest thanks 
on behalf of the Group for their substantial contribution.
Our team
Throughout a very busy year our staff have worked tirelessly 
to look after our clients, demonstrating our core values of 
being Caring, Fair and Progressive. So it gives me great 
pleasure to announce that the annual staff engagement 
survey carried out in November 2016 showed a sharp 11% 
increase in the overall engagement score to 67%. This 
illustrates that our staff are taking an active and engaged 
approach to our significant programme of improvement.
I would also like to pay tribute on behalf of the Board to the 
considerable achievements of our CEO, Paul Abberley, in 
masterminding the transformation process that is under 
way. He has led from the front and carried us all with him, 
embodying our theme of ‘One Charles Stanley’. He has been 
ably supported by Ben Money-Coutts, our Chief Financial 
Officer, and Gary Teper, the Head of our Investment 
Management Services division. Our Non-executive Directors 
have also had a very busy and challenging year and have 
contributed greatly. I also thank our shareholders for their 
continuous support. 
Dividend
I have previously outlined our policy to return to a pattern 
of steadily increasing dividends once profitability starts to 
improve significantly. The Board is therefore recommending 
a final dividend of 4.5 pence per share. Taken together with 
the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share, this results in a 
total dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share, an increase 
of 20% compared to 5.0 pence per share paid in the prior year.
Outlook
The two principal external drivers of our growth – the level of 
markets and the volume of investment trading – both surged 
after the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016 and have remained 
buoyant ever since. Much of the uncertainty which I spoke 
of last year has now dissipated with the EU referendum 
result and the election of President Trump, but we now have 
further uncertainty over the shape of the UK government 
following the UK election on 8 June 2017. 
Looking further ahead, the macro uncertainties remain as 
great as ever. There is a lot of focus on what the UK’s exit 
from the EU will mean for the UK financial services industry. 
Our business, being predominantly UK-based and serving 
UK-based clients, is, we believe, relatively well placed to ride 
out any storm that might arise for the financial services 
sector from the Brexit negotiations. 
Despite these longer term uncertainties, market conditions 
are more settled, and more favourable, than they were at 
this time last year. This provides a favourable backdrop for 
our transformation programme and should bring growth in 
revenues, profits and margins, which in turn will support our 
progressive dividend policy and thus generate long-term 
shareholder value.

The positive direction of travel 
is clear, as is the success of our 
programme of cost control.  Strategic report / Chief Executive Officer’s report
Chief Executive Officer’s report
Financial performance
The Group made a healthy return to profitability with a 
reported profit before tax of £8.8 million compared to a loss 
of £0.3 million in the previous year. This was aided by strong 
financial markets but driven primarily by the transformation 
implemented over the past two years. The Group is streamlined, 
focused and positioned to deliver profitably the wealth 
management services and products sought and needed 
by UK clients. This has been delivered without recourse to 
a restructuring charge and the precautionary capital raised 
from shareholders in April 2015 remains intact.
As planned, the financial improvements were broad-based. 
A strong cost control culture was evident across all units 
and each of our four client-facing divisions delivered 
positive underlying momentum. Profits from the Core 
Business increased from £4.2 million in 2016 to £9.8 million 
this year reflecting an improvement in operating margin 
from 3.1% to 7.1%, paving the way towards our medium-term 
target of a 15% operating margin. 
Strategy implementation
The strategy determined in early 2015 required considerable 
preparatory work but I am pleased to be able to report that 
this is now largely in place and the benefits to both clients 
and shareholders are materialising. Our four client-facing 
divisions provide a full service, holistic wealth management 
offering, from discretionary fund management to simple 
execution, with financial planning advice as needed. 
We remain an investment-led firm and the delivery of 
discretionary fund management by empowered investment 
professionals is at the heart of our offering. Indeed, we are 
experiencing a steady trend in previously self-directed 
clients seeking a discretionary service instead.
Paul Abberley
Chief Executive Officer
Charles Stanley’s transformation 
programme is on track. As previously 
communicated, our aim is to push 
our business into the first quartile for 
client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and stock market rating by 2020. 
We have made good progress during 
the 2017 financial year and I am 
confident that we will hit our targets 
and become the UK’s leading wealth 
manager within three years.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
The year ahead
The benefits of the strategy have started to crystallise and 
we remain confident that this momentum will be maintained. 
Indeed, with a renewed focus on reaching new clients and 
serving our existing clients more comprehensively, we expect 
an acceleration in new business revenues. The underlying 
commercial models in each of our four client-facing divisions 
have been re-engineered to ensure profitable delivery and to 
underpin the operational gearing which, over time, will 
support margin growth. Growing revenues and building 
operational efficiency will now be the central focus.
Recourse to technology in divisions such as Charles Stanley 
Direct allows the Group to serve a broader range of client 
needs, often at an earlier stage in our clients’ lifetime 
financial journeys. While profound digital disruption is not 
yet on the horizon, it is important to ensure that our technology 
platforms permit a timely and flexible response to evolving 
client needs. We intend to foster such preparedness whilst 
continuing to provide first-class advice to our clients.
Our Chairman, Sir David Howard, referred to the new 
governance framework and this will become a vital enabler, 
particularly given the new wave of regulatory requirements 
for which implementation is under way. We are well prepared.
Continuing successful delivery of our strategy moves 
the Group closer to the 2020 vision of becoming the UK’s 
leading wealth manager as measured by the quantitative 
scores for relative client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and stock market rating. Delivery will ensure that all our 
stakeholders are appropriately served and we look forward 
to the new financial year with growing confidence.

How we do it – four operating divisions
Asset Management
Investment Management Services
Investment Management Services offers a comprehensive 
personalised service to direct private clients: managing 
discretionary portfolios, providing investment advice and 
offering execution-only services covering a wide range of 
financial instruments. Increasingly the division is working 
with financial planners, both internal and external, to offer 
a comprehensive wealth management service, particularly 
around pension planning and inheritance tax planning.  
The division also looks after significant assets on behalf 
of charities and foundations.
Financial Planning
The Financial Planning division provides holistic financial 
planning advice and works with clients to ensure that their 
financial arrangements and plans are optimised to address 
their current and future needs and circumstances. It can be 
delivered standalone or in conjunction with the Investment 
Management Services division.
Charles Stanley Direct provides a direct-to-client investment 
service, created to meet the needs of the modern self-directed 
investor. Investments can be made online or with telephone 
support, in a wide range of funds, shares, gilts and bonds.
The Asset Management division provides pooled solutions, 
model portfolios and inheritance tax solutions for a range 
of clients. It also provides investment solutions for 
institutional investors.
Charles Stanley Direct
Three strategic measures
The delivery of our strategy will be independently measured against 
targets over three strategic measures: client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and equity market rating.
Our client satisfaction surveys are being 
remodelled to allow benchmarking 
within the wealth management industry 
and to ensure clients’ feedback is 
adequately captured and monitored.
We hold annual staff engagement 
surveys benchmarked within the wealth 
management sector and ensure staff 
feedback is actively acted upon.
We compare the Group’s three-year 
total shareholder return to a basket 
of peer group listed companies.

Strategic measures
Our objective 
Staff engagement is viewed as being 
fundamental to our success. In November 
2016 we carried out our second annual staff 
engagement survey. There was a
73%
response rate and a  
67%
overall engagement score, up from 56% 
in 2016.
Charles Stanley is in the upper quartile when 
benchmarked against the CIPD’s annual data 
(scoring 28 percentage points above the UK 
average). We also scored above average within 
the Financial Services industry according to 
the Hay Group Employee Engagement Index 
benchmark, which is at 61% – Charles Stanley’s 
rating is 6 percentage points above this 
benchmark and only 4 points below the high 
performing benchmark. 
Staff engagement will continue to be assessed 
on an annual basis.
Staff engagement
Moreover,
86%
of participants praised Charles Stanley 
for being a friendly place to work.
 
This represents an
Upper quartile 
rating within the Financial Services industry.
 
Our objective 
We are committed to improving our relations 
with our clients and ensuring that our services 
meet and exceed their expectations.
We conduct client surveys to help monitor

Our business
Asset Management
Working arm-in-arm with the Investment Management 
Services division is our Asset Management division. This 
division provides bespoke and pooled solutions to a range 
of clients, from institutional investors with multi-million 
pound portfolios to managing the assets of valued retail 
clients. We believe Asset Management provides both an 
excellent growth opportunity in itself and in partnership 
with our Investment Management Services division. 
Financial Planning 
With each Government budget making the savings 
landscape more complex, our clients increasingly need 
high-quality advice to best deal with their wealth for 
retirement and for future generations. Our Financial 
Planning division is well positioned to grow and capture 
market share including supporting the clients of our 
Investment Management Services division. 
Charles Stanley Direct
For investors who want to manage their own money, 
we have enabled them to utilise our dealing, settlement 
and custody services through our digital execution platform, 
Charles Stanley Direct. While the wealth management 
industry is often divided between discretionary or execution 
services, Charles Stanley Direct can help provide a bridge 
between the two. The division helps customers, often 
younger, to manage their own investments online or over 
the phone in a wide range of funds, shares, gilts and bonds.
Over time, as their needs evolve and they require advice 
or help in managing their wealth, they can easily access 
Charles Stanley’s Discretionary services. This will open 
up new growth opportunities for both our Investment 
Management Services and Financial Planning divisions.
In summary, our four divisions each have the capacity 
to grow revenues in their respective markets. Moreover, 
together they offer a set of complementary services which 
will support our vision to become the UK’s leading wealth 
manager by 2020.
Charles Stanley is one of the UK’s 
leading wealth managers, managing 
and administering £24.0 billion on 
behalf of our clients. Over the last 
225 years we have constantly refined 
our proposition to meet the changing 
needs of our clients. This has led to 
high levels of trust with client 
satisfaction scores of 93%.

Personal service and dependable stewardship of clients’ 
money will always be the chief virtues of our firm. We have 
built on our stockbroking heritage and are now structured 
to allow us to bring that culture to four complementary 
divisions – Investment Management Services, Asset 
Management, Financial Planning and Charles Stanley Direct.
Investment Management Services
Our Investment Management Services division offers 
discretionary, advisory and execution-only services to 
private clients, trusts, charities and companies. Around 
68,000 client accounts are supported through a network 
of 24 offices around the UK. Our operating model empowers 
high-quality investment managers to look after clients’ 
money in a tailored manner, either directly or in partnership 
with a financial planner.
This premium service creates deep bonds of trust with 
clients and typically leads to discretionary mandates 
generating strong revenue yields. Furthermore, the 
empowered model has led to near-consistent asset 
growth since 2010.

Strategic report / Our markets
Our markets
The wealth management market 
in the UK is evolving in four ways. 
This section explains each 
change and the opportunities 
for Charles Stanley.
New customer segments
Wealth management firms are finding fresh and innovative 
ways to grow revenues including tailoring products to target 
customers who had not traditionally used these companies. 
New technology and digital channels mean firms can target 
customers more efficiently and open up new revenue streams. 
The biggest growth area is in direct-to-client marketing, 
in particular to three segments – women, millennials 
and retirees – whose concentration of wealth is growing. 
Charles Stanley is working hard to segment better its 
customers to help it tailor its offering to meet their specific 
needs. Currently, few wealth management firms segment 
their clients in a manner that allows them to tailor their 
offerings. Charles Stanley’s Distribution department has 
already started a segmentation project and, once complete, 
a refreshed website will follow shortly thereafter. Designed 
to showcase our broad offering in a more targeted manner, 
these initiatives will improve our market share in the most 
fertile areas of the market.
Intermediary sales
The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 has meant many 
independent financial advisers are now semi-tied to an 
investment manager. This creates an opportunity for 
Charles Stanley to leverage its 225 year old trusted name 
and network of 24 offices to forge strategic alliances with 
groups of independent financial advisers. To that end, 
we have expanded our Intermediary Sales Team to grow 
our relationships in this market. 
Financial planning 
Traditionally many wealth management firms focused 
on purely discretionary investment management but it is 
clear that there is a growing demand for financial planning 
as customers have increasingly complex needs. To meet 
this demand, Charles Stanley has adopted a vertically 
integrated model so we are better placed to offer financial 
planning services to our Investment Management Services 
division’s 68,000 client accounts and to cement further our 
position as trusted adviser to our customers.
New technology
There has been a flurry of fintech start-ups launching 
highly-scalable automated-advice solutions, with established 
wealth management players also beginning to enter 
the market. So far, few offerings have gained traction.  
Charles Stanley has the opportunity to expand in this market. 
We can capitalise on our asset management expertise, 
distribution capability and technology platform to provide 
a high-quality investment management range for clients 
with smaller portfolios. Our recently launched Personal 
Portfolio Service will allow us to grow our assets in an open 
market, segment our customers more efficiently and grow 
capacity in our Investment Management Services division. 
Together, these four themes illustrate that the wealth 
management market is evolving quickly. Opportunities 
exist and Charles Stanley is looking to capitalise on them.

Strategy progressing
To achieve the ambition, we have made two 
fundamental decisions:
• The first is to maintain the empowered investment 
manager model. By trusting our front line advisers to 
make investment decisions, service existing clients and 
attract new business, we are differentiating ourselves as 
a service provider in an increasingly product-driven market. 
We believe that offering clients access to the person who 
manages their portfolio is increasingly a unique selling 
point as many of our peers are favouring a centralised 
approach with relationship managers. We believe that 
many investment managers will want to join Charles 
Stanley in order to service their clients in this way. We also 
believe the effect of our differentiated proposition will be 
a faster growth in funds versus other firms. This should in 
turn mean, that because we have a predominantly fixed 
cost base, our margins will increase. 
• The second key decision is to build a holistic wealth 
offering around our core investment management business. 
Alongside Investment Management Services we now offer 
clients advice from our Financial Planning division, pooled 
solutions from our Asset Management division and online 
execution-only services from Charles Stanley Direct. 
Combined, these decisions mean we have a unique 
proposition within the wealth sector: a full-service holistic 
offering but with the discretionary fund management 
component delivered through the traditional empowered 
investment manager model.
Our vision at Charles Stanley is to 
become the UK’s leading wealth 
manager by 2020. Progress will be 
assessed by three measures: client 
satisfaction, staff engagement and 
stock market rating. These will be 
benchmarked annually to the UK 
wealth sector, with the aim of 
delivering first quartile results in 
three years.

Implementation milestones achieved
With the pillars in place, over the last 12 months we have 
made significant progress in terms of implementing our 
strategy across each of our divisions.
Investment Management Services
We have delivered on our promise to revise the remuneration 
arrangements of our investment managers. This has been 
achieved in three ways. Firstly, our remuneration model has 
changed from one that was mostly revenue-based to be 
more centred on profit. This better aligns the interests 
of investment managers and shareholders. Secondly, 
the incentive schemes for our employed and associate 
investment managers have also been harmonised while 
recognising the differences between them. Finally, the ratio 
of compensation to revenue has been lowered while 
simultaneously providing the potential for investment 
managers to increase their total compensation subject 
to profit contribution. The overwhelming majority of staff 
signed up – amounting to in excess of 96% of FuMA with 
the new profit-orientated scheme coming into effect from 
1 April 2017.
Alongside remuneration changes we have delivered growth 
initiatives in the Investment Management Services division. 
Following our rebrand, we reinvigorated our intermediary 
distribution network, with the top-down strategy of 
concentrating on nationals and networks. We have also 
significantly improved our client onboarding process. Finally, 
we have integrated a Client Relationship Management system 
which allows us to analyse the success of our sales campaigns 
and allocate shareholder capital more effectively.
Over the year, FuMA have grown by 17.1% to £24.0 billion. 
Crucially, this growth comes with an increasing return on 
assets. Higher-yielding discretionary FuM are up 21.3% to 
£11.4 billion, with the discretionary element of the business 
mix rising by 1.7% to 47.5%. Meanwhile, we have implemented 
a new rate card. While it already applies to new clients, 
existing clients are being phased on to the new rates, 
with a significant proportion expected to move in financial 
year 2018.

Asset Management
We have refreshed the asset management product offering. 
A range of multi-asset portfolios have been developed to 
provide IFAs with tailored, segregated portfolios for their 
larger clients. Moreover, an OEIC range has been launched 
to capitalise on IFA outsourcing. They are a logical home for 
clients with lower value portfolios for whom the bespoke 
solution is not cost-effective.
Financial Planning
In Financial Planning, our focus is on internal and external 
business development and the adoption of a streamlined 
operating process. We have revamped our customer 
proposition, pricing and literature, and now that we have 
the fundamentals of our holistic Financial Planning in place, 
we will focus on offering these services to our clients. 
Moreover, we have introduced a new variable reward 
scheme which incentivises revenue growth.
Charles Stanley Direct
This year, we have released an all-new mobile-optimised 
website with enhanced registration. The new website is 
delivering 350-400 accounts to the business per week with 
an average client age of 42. We are feeding the outlet 
through a scientific approach to digital marketing which 
has given us a much lower cost-per-acquisition than the 
industry-quoted levels. Simultaneously, we amended our 
pricing in October 2016 to attract frequent traders and 
pension clients. Complementing that, we have made it 
easier for Investment Management Services to transfer 
Execution-only clients to Charles Stanley Direct.
Support Functions
We have made efficiencies to support the changes in 
the front line divisions. We have consolidated our London 
footprint into a single building at 55 Bishopsgate, lowering 
costs while improving efficiency. We have also invested in 
systems to ensure that our links to external custodians, 
as well as to existing and new fund platforms, are more 
efficient. Finally, we have refreshed our Business Change 
department, drawing on experience learnt from other 
companies to ensure that we deliver the right projects 
in the right manner.
Implementation milestones in prospect
With the foundations now in place, we have further 
initiatives planned for the financial year 2018. In headline 
terms, the Group is sharply focused on two goals: revenue 
growth and operational effectiveness. 
Investment Management Services
In Investment Management Services, numerous initiatives 
are under way, including repricing, encouraging greater 
access to holistic wealth management, improving the way 
we work with intermediaries, recruiting talented investment 
management professionals and undertaking more business 
development and sales initiatives. To aid overall growth, we 
need to create efficiencies and improvements so we have 
more time to focus on servicing our clients and undertaking 
business-enhancing activities. While the Support Functions 
will lead a number of projects, a number of initiatives will be 
progressed by Investment Management Services in order to 
improve service. Examples of developments in this area 
include refreshing client reporting, refining the systems 
around our investment management process and 
redesigning our digital interface with clients. At the 
same time we continue to refine and improve the control 
and oversight environment with initiatives that will protect 
and future-proof our business model. While many of these 
developments go unseen by clients, they are vital to ensure 
we continue to offer top-quality investment services. 
Asset Management
In Asset Management, we will optimise our operating model 
in such a manner that provides efficiencies and capacity for 
further revenue-generating activities.

Financial Planning
In Financial Planning, we will focus on three key areas. 
First, we will look to increase revenues and profitability. 
Our proposition will be rolled out and actively offered 
to existing Charles Stanley clients and the wider marketplace. 
The proposition will be supported by our new pricing model 
which is in place for all new clients and will be passed on, 
where appropriate, to existing clients as part of our normal 
client reviews. We expect a meaningful uptick of our revenues 
as a result. Secondly, having reduced our client-facing staff 
numbers by 28% to ensure we have the right quality individuals, 
we will look to materially grow our number of financial planners. 
It is intended that these new hires will make a contribution in 
the year, but, of course the full benefit from these hires will be 
seen in years to come. Finally, we will focus on implementing 
our streamlined business processing system, with the hope 
that significant productivity gains will be captured.
Charles Stanley Direct
In Charles Stanley Direct, we will expand the offering by 
introducing our new Personal Portfolio Service. To improve 
client service, we will implement a new Corporate Actions 
service to streamline processes. We will also reinforce our 
security features via an extension of our existing mobile 
text messaging applications. Finally, we will launch a 
tablet-friendly mobile application. This will be built on 
the existing architecture of the current iPhone application 
to address the current trend that 40% of our clients now 
access the website via mobile devices.
Support Functions
In the Support Functions, we will develop the Group’s 
operating model to support the more focused strategies 
of the front office business units. With increasing 
standardisation of processes, we will ensure that the 
systems and back office deliver with minimal manual 
intervention. Key areas that will be targeted during this 
year will be transfers and payments. Both of these will be 
supported by a greater online functionality where our clients 
want it. The strategic changes will be achieved against the 
backdrop of the significant regulatory changes for MiFID II 
and PRIIPs and the increasing focus on ensuring resilience 
against cyber attacks.
Summary
All the elements are in place to be the UK’s leading 
wealth manager by 2020. We have a fully engaged 
workforce in place, structured in the right manner, 
and working towards one clear objective. 
After formalising the structures and cultures 
needed, Charles Stanley is primed for growth. Strategic report / Review of the year
Review of the year
Overview of 2017 full year results
The Group’s overall revenues for 2017 were at the same level 
as 2016 at £141.6 million. This is due to the fact that the 3.8% 
increase in revenues of our Core Business (comprising the 
Investment Management Services, Asset Management, 
Financial Planning and Charles Stanley Direct divisions), 
was offset by the elimination of revenues associated with 
our held for sale activities disposed of during the previous year.
Overall expenditure decreased by 3.7% to £136.8 million 
(2016: £142.1 million), mainly due to tight cost control.
Various aspects of our reorganisation programme 
gave rise to an exceptional level of net finance income 
of £3.8 million (2016: £0.1 million). The main contributor 
was the profit on disposal of a long leasehold office in 
Luke Street, London which helped finance the rationalisation 
of all our London offices into a single office at 55 Bishopsgate. 
Details of this and other one-off adjusting items are set out 
on page 31.
As a result of the above factors, the adjusted profit before 
tax from the Core Business (excluding held for sale 
activities) for 2017 improved by 133.3% to £9.8 million 
(2016: £4.2 million) and overall the Group achieved 
a reported profit before tax of £8.8 million compared 
to a loss of £0.3 million in the prior year.
Funds under Management and Administration
The Group’s revenue is substantially driven by the level 
of its FuMA. These increased by a very healthy 17.1% to 
£24.0 billion at 31 March 2017 (2016: £20.5 billion). 
The increase was ahead of the benchmark WMA 
Balanced Index which rose 15.9% over the same period.
Ben Money-Coutts 
Chief Financial Officer
Financial year 2017 was the second 
year of our five-year turnaround 
programme. Whereas the focus for 
2016 had been to reduce losses, 
dispose of non-core activities, 
strengthen the balance sheet and 
formulate a detailed plan to achieve 
the Group’s strategy, that for 2017 was 
to return to profitability and to lay 
down the foundations for long-term 
growth. Whilst we still have a long way 
to travel in terms of improving top line 
growth, productivity and operating 
efficiency, good progress has been 
achieved during 2017 across all 
divisions. We remain on track to 
deliver on the Group’s strategic 
targets by 2020.

of which £0.4 billion was accounted for by clients of departing investment managers.

Core Business revenues
Revenues from the Core Business increased by 3.8% from £133.5 million in 2016 to £138.6 million in 2017. The anticipated 
reduction in trail commissions and interest earned on client cash balances was more than offset by higher investment 
management fees largely arising from the uplift in markets seen during the year.

Core Business expenditure
Expenditure within the Core Business has remained relatively flat on prior year at £129.1 million (2016: £129.5 million).  
The Group’s single largest cost is staff costs and these rose £0.4 million as the variable element increased by £3.2 million 
and the fixed element reduced by £2.8 million. The increase in the variable compensation amount was to be expected 
given the improved operating performance while the reduction in the fixed element followed a lower average headcount, 
excluding employees included within held for sale activities, of 778 (2016: 831). Other significant changes in expenditure 
included increases in IT and marketing spend of £0.5 million each and a £1.6 million reduction in external professional fees.

Core Business pre-tax profit 
The Core Business pre-tax profit increased from £4.2 million to £9.8 million, reflecting a margin improvement from 3.1% to 
7.1%. This was in line with our expectations but still a long way from our stated medium-term target of 15%. To achieve this 
we need to continue along the path of increasing FuMA and revenues, achieving greater productivity in the front office and 
improving operating efficiency in the back office.
Divisional review
The table below shows the Core Business results broken into the Group’s four main operating divisions: Investment

Investment Management Services
Trading review
The financial performance of the Investment Management Services division is largely driven by the value and mix of FuMA, 
the revenue margin earned on these assets (expressed as a basis point return) and the operating costs associated with 
managing them comprising both fixed and variable costs.

The division’s FuMA increased by 16.0% overall in line with markets. Discretionary assets grew by 22.4% and now represent 
51.2% of the division’s overall FuMA. The level of average managed funds per regulated investment manager (CF30), 
which is a key productivity measure, improved 26.5% to £51.6 million (2016: £40.8 million). One of Management’s key 
objectives is to increase this further with a medium-term target set of £70.0 million per CF30.

Although FuMA grew, overall revenue margins decreased from 66bps to 65bps, largely as a result of a halving of interest 
turn to 1bp. Whilst this particular element of revenue is likely to decline further, it is anticipated that the revenue margin 
will begin to increase again as we continue to grow the Discretionary book as a proportion of the whole and phase in 
a repricing programme across the book. The combined effect of increased FuMA but lower revenue margins led to the 
division’s overall revenues increasing 4.7% to £122.7m (2016: £117.2m).
Total costs for the division were relatively flat on last year at £109.0 million (2016: £109.6 million). Staff costs as a proportion 
of revenues reduced significantly from 47.8% to 45.1%, largely as a result of the staged implementation of the revised 
investment manager remuneration model and reduced headcount of 411 (2016: 435).
Overall, the Investment Management Services division reported a 78.2% improvement in its operating profit from 
£7.8 million in 2016 to £13.9 million in 2017 and its operating margin grew from 6.7% to 11.3%.
Outlook
The twin challenges faced by the division are to increase revenues through FuMA inflows, repricing and service upselling, 
whilst improving overall productivity levels which are below top industry standards, most notably in relation to FuMA per 
CF30 and staff costs ratios. As has been covered in the Strategy progressing section on page 6, we have a wide number 
of specific initiatives in train to help deliver on these key metrics and remain confident that, subject to stable or improving 
market conditions, we can continue to deliver progress on the division’s overall performance. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk

Asset Management

The division’s total FuM have grown steadily by 30.0% during the year to £1.3 billion (2016: £1.0 billion). This was due to 
both investment performance and strong inflows, notably into the Inheritance Tax Portfolio service and the pension 
and institutional business. These latter accounts are typically of a larger average size and so attract a lower revenue 
margin which explains the division’s slight overall revenue margin reduction from 60bps to 59bps. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017

During the year, the division underwent a restructuring to rationalise its product offering to make it fit both for the 
intermediary and institutional market, as well as to provide a scalable range of services for internal and external clients. 
This enabled the division to reduce its direct costs by 21.7% to £3.6 million (2016: £4.6 million) and overall costs, including 
Support Functions allocations, by 6.2% to £6.1 million (2016: £6.5 million). Consequently, the division moved from an 
operating loss in 2016 of £1.0 million to a profit for 2017 of £0.5 million.
Outlook
After a year of restructuring and reorganisation, the focus for the Asset Management division is now to grow its FuM. 
Its most scalable business, provision of discretionary model portfolios to the adviser industry, will be a key focus for 
financial year 2018, taking advantage of a streamlined product suite and an enlarged and retrained Intermediary Sales 
Team. It also plans to extend its institutional marketing plan to include larger charities, academic institutions and other 
institutional funds, while continuing to grow the fiduciary management service for defined benefit pension schemes. 
New literature is being produced to support this marketing effort. 
For the firm’s smaller clients, we soft-launched our Personal Portfolio Service (PPS) in April. This comprises a range of 
risk-rated multi-asset model portfolios managed by the division. In the first instance the PPS is being marketed to existing 
smaller clients of the Investment Management Services division for whom a bespoke solution is likely to be over-engineered 
and costly. We plan to extend the service to new clients and also to make a non-advised version of PPS available via Charles 
Stanley Direct. We will look to market the funds more widely as they gain in scale and traction. The Inheritance Tax Portfolio 
service continues to attract good inflows and there is potential to develop this area further over the coming years. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk

Financial planning
Trading review
The principal driver of the Financial Planning division’s performance is now its revenue per financial planner. Historically the 
division also included some investment management activities which were transferred to the Investment Management 
Services division at the start of the year.

Revenue per financial planner £268k £197k
Operating margin (56.0%) (21.7%)
The 2017 financial performance of the Financial Planning division reflected the restructuring the department underwent 
during the year. Firstly, a number of investment managers who had previously been part of the division and had accounted 
for £0.7 million of revenues in 2016 transferred to Investment Management Services. Secondly, there were a number of 
planned departures for under-performing financial planners. These changes led to the division’s revenues declining to 
£5.0 million (2016: £6.0 million) and to an overall increase in its operating loss to £2.8 million (2016: £1.3 million). Underlying 
these figures, the revenue per financial planner, which is a key productivity metric, rose 36% from £197 thousand in 2016 to 
£268 thousand in 2017. This was as a result of the measures taken and improved focus. The medium-term target is to 
achieve £300 thousand per financial planner. 
Outlook
Financial year 2018 is expected to see further investment in the Financial Planning division. It is intended to increase materially 
the number of financial planners by hiring good quality, experienced practitioners and to improve the productivity of the 
division by replacing the current business processing system. This investment, coupled with the roll-out of the new Financial 
Planning value proposition and pricing model, will see the division making an enhanced contribution to the Group and to its 
commitment to be the leading wealth manager by 2020. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017

As anticipated, the division’s revenues declined in 2017 by comparison to the prior year owing to the conclusion in February 
2016 of white label trading services provided to the Fidelity network which accounted for £0.9 million of revenue in that year. 
This also accounted for the decline in the division’s overall revenue margin to 22bps. Excluding Fidelity, underlying revenues 
increased by 11% and revenue margins were steady. Overall costs have been kept stable on prior year at £6.2 million. As a 
result of the reduction in revenues, the division has reported an increase in its operating loss to £1.9 million (2016: £1.3 million).
Outlook
During the year the division completed a number of initiatives which are expected to help improve performance further 
during the coming financial year. These have included changes to the pricing tariffs which took effect from November 2016; 
the mobile optimisation of the website; and changes to processes that make it easier for existing voice-broked Execution-only 
clients of Charles Stanley to switch to the Charles Stanley Direct platform. Although the charges for the online service are 
less than for the traditional voice-broked service and may therefore lead to a reduction in the overall revenue generated 
for the Group from this source, we believe it is often in the clients’ best interests to make the switch and it enables the Group 
to provide the service through a scalable delivery platform. It is also the intention shortly to launch the Group’s Personal 
Portfolio Service via Charles Stanley Direct, which will provide guided but non-advised access to the Group’s range of 
risk-rated multi-asset model portfolios.
Having rebranded our fund broking business as Charles Stanley Investment Choices during the course of the year and 
relaunched its website, this business is set to grow again in the coming year. This is being supported both by a significant 
paper-based marketing exercise, proactive engagement with existing clients and greater internal marketing within the 
rest of the Charles Stanley Group. Costs have also been addressed so this activity’s contribution is expected to increase 
significantly in the coming financial year. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017
Strategic report / Review of the year

Support Functions
The costs incurred by the Group’s support functions are either charged directly to the four main operating divisions, 
for example market data costs, or recharged as an allocated cost. However, it is worthy of note that an important contribution 
to the Group’s improved profitability is coming about through savings and process efficiencies being achieved in support 
areas. Examples include changes to automate the transfers process, the dematerialisation of paper holdings using 
Allfunds as custodian and the streamlining of the client amendment process. Moreover, the London office rationalisation 
has allowed us to move some support teams to our Chelmsford site and outsource the provision of certain services which 
will bring further savings on occupancy costs in the coming financial year.
Ongoing costs for all Support Functions for 2017 were £48.8 million, reflecting a 4.5% reduction on the prior year of 
£51.1 million. The key area of reduction was in fixed employment costs, down by £1.4 million, primarily driven from a 
4.4% decrease in headcount. The increased spend in IT and Marketing costs was more than offset by savings on 
external professional fees (net decrease of £0.6 million on 2016).
As noted above, the Group has achieved a number of operational efficiencies across its Support Functions during the year. 
Looking forward, we see further opportunity to reduce Support Functions operating costs by reviewing process flows and 
increasing straight through processing. The extent and pace with which we will be able to do this will in part be dependent 
on the harmonisation of front office processes. Conversely, we expect to see continued cost pressure in a number of areas 
including Market data, IT and regulation. 
Held for sale activities – EBS Management PLC (EBS)
Following the announcement on 11 April 2017 that the Group had exchanged contracts for the sale of EBS, the Group’s 
pension administrator, to Embark Group Limited, its results have been presented as held for sale for both 2017 and 2016. 
During 2017, EBS grew the number of pension schemes under administration by 18.3% to 15,068 (2016: 12,737) and revenues 
by 3.5% to £3.0 million (2016: £2.9 million).
The decision to sell EBS was taken because significant investment was required in its operating systems and because 
pension administration was not a core area of focus for the Group’s Management. The disposal, which completed on 
31 May 2017, was in the best interest of all stakeholders of the EBS business, and most importantly the underlying consumers. 
Under Embark’s ownership, EBS will continue to provide white label SIPP services to Charles Stanley so we look forward to a 
long commercial partnership with them. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk

These adjusting items are included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated income statement on page 99. 
London office rationalisation
A number of the adjusting items relate to the rationalisation of the Group’s London office footprint. The Group 
historically occupied five buildings in the City of London and has now consolidated into one building at 55 Bishopsgate. 
This has enabled the Group to sell the remainder of its long lease at 35 Luke Street to realise a profit but has also resulted 
in double running costs of the new office whilst it was fitted out prior to occupancy. The specific one-off income and 
expenditure comprised:
1. Net gain on surrender of long-term lease: (£3.2 million credit)
On 8 September 2016, the Group surrendered the remaining term of its long-term lease at 35 Luke Street for proceeds 
of £5.6 million. This gain was partially offset by the acquisition costs of the new lease at 55 Bishopsgate of £0.2 million, 
and a loss incurred on decommissioning the fixed assets held in the vacant London offices at their carrying value of 
£2.2 million, resulting in a net gain of £3.2 million.
2. Overlapping rent and occupancy costs: (£3.1 million expense)
During the year, the Group incurred double running costs in respect of rent, rates and other occupancy costs of £3.1 million 
covering both the vacating sites, primarily 131 Finsbury Pavement, and the new offices at 55 Bishopsgate. Since the move of 
the Group’s London employees to 55 Bishopsgate had fully completed by the end of the financial year, no further double 
running costs are expected.
3. Dilapidations: (£0.1 million credit)
A leasehold dilapidations provision was set up in March 2016 in respect of obligations applicable under the lease agreements 
of the Group’s vacating London sites. The current year credit of £0.1 million represents a release to the income statement of 
unutilised amounts following the settlement of these obligations. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017
Strategic report / Review of the year
32
Amortisation of client relationships: (£1.6 million expense)
Payments made for the introduction of customer relationships that are deemed to be intangible assets are capitalised and 
amortised over their useful life, which has been assessed to be 10 years. This amortisation charge has been excluded from 
the Core Business profit since it is a significant non-cash item.
Impairment of intangible assets: (£0.7 million expense)
During the year, the Group recognised an impairment charge in respect of goodwill held in connection with a departing 
investment management team based in one of the regional offices for £0.7 million.
Profit on part-disposal of investment in Runpath Group Limited: (£0.4 million credit)
In June 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to convert loan notes held in Runpath Group Limited into equity and 
subsequently disposed of 25% of its enlarged equity holding in the company, resulting in a an overall gain of £0.4 million.
Refund of under-recovered VAT in prior years: (£0.7 million credit)
During the year, the Group recognised a credit of £0.7 million in respect of under-recovered VAT in prior years.
Taxation
The corporation tax charge for the year was £2.5 million (2016: £0.05 million credit) representing an effective tax rate of 
28.4%. A detailed reconciliation between the standard and effective rate of corporation tax is provided in note 12 of the 
Consolidated financial statements.
Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic earnings per share for the year were 12.35 pence (2016: loss of 0.61 pence). The Core Business 
basic earnings per share increased significantly to 15.33 pence from 6.90 pence in 2016.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 4.5 pence per share (2016: 3.5 pence per share). Taking into account the interim 
dividend of 1.5 pence per share, this results in a total dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share (2016: 5.0 pence per share), 
an increase of 20%. The proposed total dividend is 2.1 times covered by basic reported earnings and 2.6 times covered by 
basic Core Business earnings. The recommended final dividend is subject to shareholders’ approval, which will be sought 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2017.
Financial position
The Group maintained its strong financial position with total net assets at 31 March 2017 of £89.1 million (2016: £85.4 million) 
including £58.4 million of cash resources.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to new members in 1998 and also closed to further 
accruals for the remaining 25 active members at 31 March 2016. The most recent actuarial assessment of the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme’s liabilities shows a deficit at 31 March 2017 of £10.5 million (31 March 2016: £10.1 million).
During the second half of the year, the Scheme’s Trustees changed the investment management strategy of the scheme’s 
assets. The long-term investment objective is now to achieve self-sufficiency which means achieving a funding level 
whereby scheme assets grow to the same level as their liabilities. A five stage derisking flight plan has been adopted to 
reduce risk gradually over life of the plan as the scheme nears its objective. Stage 1 of the flight plan, which has involved 
restructuring the underlying portfolio to increase asset class diversification and building an initial liability hedge of 70% 
of assets, is substantially complete. Further details on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme and the assumptions 
underpinning the valuation are provided in note 11 of the Consolidated financial statements. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk

Regulatory capital resources
Charles Stanley & Co. Limited, the Group’s main operating subsidiary, is an IFPRU 125k Limited License Firm regulated by the 
FCA. In view of this, the Group is classified as a regulated group and subject to the same regime.

The Group monitors a range of capital and liquidity statistics on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
As required under FCA rules, the Group maintains an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which includes 
performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group 
needs to hold. The last review of the ICAAP conducted and signed off by the Board was in October 2016. Regulatory capital 
forecasts are performed monthly and take into account expected dividends and intangible asset acquisitions and disposals 
as well as budgeted and forecast trading results.
The Group’s Pillar III disclosures are published annually on the Group’s website (charles-stanley.co.uk) and provide further 
details about the Group’s regulatory capital resources and requirements. Risk management and principal risks
Charles Stanley’s approach to risk management is 
documented in the Group Risk Policy and the Risk 
Appetite Statement (RAS), which is reviewed, challenged 
and approved by the Board on an annual basis. The RAS 
takes into consideration the Group’s strategic objectives, 
strategy and business plans, and underpins the implementation 
of robust risk monitoring and risk reporting processes which 
continue to evolve.
The RAS sets out the Group’s tolerance to various types 
of risks and includes both quantitative and qualitative 
measures against which Management and the Board 
monitor risk on a periodic basis.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks of the Group including those that may 
threaten its business model, performance, solvency 
and liquidity. These are listed out pages 36 to 39.
Set out below is the Director’s Viability statement covering 
the three years to 31 March 2020, which is then followed with 
an assessment of the principal risks relevant to the Group’s 
long-term performance.
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Group over the three-year period from 31 March 2017 to 
31 March 2020. The assessment of the Group’s viability 
over a three-year time period is in alignment with the 
Group’s strategy, budgeting process and the scenarios 
set out in the ICAAP. 
The Directors consider a three-year time horizon appropriate 
as it is most meaningful in planning the Group’s new 
long-term strategy; a five-year horizon stretches forecasting 
inputs and assumptions beyond a realistic threshold. 
In assessing the future viability of the overall business, 
the Directors have considered the corporate strategy 
(see Strategy progressing) and the changes within the 
business executed in the last two years, including the 
significant business divisional restructuring and changes 
to reward arrangements. They have also considered the 
business environment of the Group and the potential threats 
to its business model arising from progressive technological, 
sectorial, demographic and regulatory changes.

is accountable for the Group’s risk management by:
• Overseeing the processes and procedures to monitor 
and mitigate the principal risks
• Reviewing high level management information from 
key departments which monitor whether the Group 
is operating within the parameters set out in the RAS 
linked to the principal risks 
• Deciding the appropriate actions if any of the Group’s 
risk appetites are breached. 
On a detailed level, extensive management information 
is analysed by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) which 
meets monthly and oversees operational risk across the 
Group by:
• Monitoring quantitative and qualitative management 
information across the Group to highlight areas of risk 
which require enhanced or additional controls
• Delegating to the appropriate committees any issues 
raised as part of the management information which 
require further action
• Carrying out annual ‘deep dive’ risk analysis of key 
departments which are discussed by the Committee 
and department heads
• Reviewing the reports of the internal and external auditors 
concerning systems and controls, reviewing the resolution 
of proposed control enhancements and monitoring any 
remaining open issues.
The Risk Committee has oversight of the above processes, 
ensuring the monitoring and escalation procedures are 
operating effectively and completed in a timely manner 
(see Risk Committee report on page 86 for details). 
The Board reviews and challenges the Group’s three-year 
strategic plan against the principal risks at least annually, 
stress testing the base case projections by applying multiple 
shock events. These stresses have been derived from workshops 
attended by Senior Management, with the use of external 
events to substantiate the Board’s comfort level that the 
shock events are sufficiently severe and appropriate.
The Group undertakes an ICAAP which is a detailed process 
owned and overseen by the Board and regularly assesses:
• The Group’s processes, strategies and systems
• The major sources of risks faced by the Group that may 
impact its ability to meet its obligations
• The results of internal stress testing of these risks
• The amounts and types of financial resources and internal 
capital, including own funds and liquidity resources, 
and whether these are adequate both as to amount 
and quality to ensure that there is not significant risk 
that its liabilities cannot be met as they fall due.
Scenario analysis and stress testing are performed as part 
of the ICAAP to assess the Group’s exposure to a range of 
extreme but plausible situations, as well as an assessment 
of the Group’s wind-down scenarios and a review of the 
reverse stress tests which would cause the Group’s business 
model to become unviable.
Based on the results of the latest ICAAP, the Board believes 
that, by taking the projected actions to reduce expenditure 
and, if required, dividends, the Group’s business model is 
resilient and holds sufficient capital to survive a range of 
severe but plausible scenarios.
Given the extensive controls and procedures in place, 
the Directors are of the opinion that it is reasonable to 
conclude that the Group has sufficient resources to meet 
its obligations and continue business operations over the 
assessed three-year period.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017

Business Model and Strategy Risk 
The risk that the business model and strategy do 
not respond in an optimal manner to changing 
market conditions such that sustainable growth, 
market share or profitability is adversely impacted.
The Group Chief Risk Officer participates in the setting of Group 
strategic plans from the beginning and has a voice in the early 
stage of strategy development, as well as providing a formal 
report on the strategy and on key business decisions.
As part of the strategy setting process, a review is undertaken of 
the risks to the business model which includes an analysis of 
internal and external pressures on the Group strategy and the 
potential threats to its business model. 
The report is presented to the Executive Committee and the 
Board alongside the proposed business plan to support the 
decision making.
➡
Financial Strength Risk  
Failing to maintain financial strength in order to 
support business objectives, meet regulatory 
capital requirements, and provide shareholders 
with an acceptable return. 
To achieve our financial goals, a series of risk appetite limits have 
been set around operating margin, cash balances, regulatory 
capital and dividend cover.
These are monitored by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements directly through 
its variable rate assets and liabilities. This is tracked by reporting 
on exposure levels at the Treasury Committee.
➡
Credit and Counterparty Risk  
The potential failure of clients or counterparties to 
fulfil their contractual obligations. 
Charles Stanley does not offer any formal lines of credit to clients. 
The Group however has an exposure to counterparty failures and 
late payment and settlement. It therefore establishes clear risk 
appetite limits for client and Group cash placed and maintained 
with authorised institutions and for trading purposes which must 
be adhered to by the business.
The Group’s Treasury Committee is responsible for the initial 
assessment and ongoing monitoring of deposit-taking 
counterparties. The following criteria govern how the 
Group’s credit and counterparty risk is managed:
• Assets will only be placed and maintained with counterparties 
deemed to be financially sound
• Client and Group cash held at any individual counterparty should 
not exceed its respective limit set by the Treasury Committee 
unless written approval has been provided
• Counterparty limits for the purpose of trading are set by the 
Market Exposure Committee (MEC)
• Counterparties with no set trading limits should be assessed on 
an individual basis on the day of the trade by the MEC
• Breaches of any counterparty trading limits without approval 
must be escalated immediately to the MEC.

Market Risk 
The risk of losses arising as a result of exposure to 
market movements, including foreign exchange 
and interest rates.
Charles Stanley does not undertake any proprietary trading other 
than that arising from incidental dealing errors and therefore 
takes minimal market risks. Dealing losses are captured as 
operational losses.
The majority of the Group’s cash is kept in GBP across a number 
of banks. Limited foreign currency is held only to facilitate 
settlement and dealing activity on behalf of clients. The Treasury 
Committee manages the Group’s account balances both in GBP 
and foreign currencies to our requirements and limits exposures 
to the Group’s operational needs.
➡
Liquidity Risk 
The risk that the Group, although solvent, either 
does not have available sufficient financial 
resources to enable it to meet its obligations 
as they fall due, or can only secure such resources 
at excessive cost.
Charles Stanley’s liquidity risk is overwhelmingly short-term in 
nature and arises predominantly from the settlement of trades 
within its investment management and execution-only broking 
business. The Treasury Committee operates within strict policies 
and procedures approved by the Board to manage the Group’s 
liquidity risk. These include:
• The Group ensuring that all legal entities have sufficient funds 
to meet their liabilities as they fall due, with surplus cash 
transferred on a monthly basis to Charles Stanley & Co. Limited. 
The Group will ensure that it has overdraft facilities if the 
Committee considers them necessary to meet liabilities
• Utilising financial instruments, which include borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources, and various items including 
trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from 
its operations. The credit quality of counterparties is reviewed 
frequently and we limit aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group has, for many years, not used overdraft facilities for 
working capital purpose as it has not required such a facility. 
➡
Pension Risk 
The risk that the cost of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension scheme increases, or its valuation affects 
dividends, reserves and capital. This would 
materialise when the pension obligations exceed 
the assets set aside to cover them.
Charles Stanley continues to support a defined benefit pension 
scheme which is closed to new members and ceased accruing 
for existing members in April 2016 and which is reviewed regularly 
for viability and to remain within an agreed deficit level. 
Bond yields continued to fall globally during 2016 which has 
been reflected in the Group’s pension deficit levels, which are 
monitored regularly and stand at £10.5 million at 31 March 2017. 
The Group is working closely with the trustees of the scheme to 
reduce the deficit and, where possible, match investments with 
future liabilities.

Operational and IT Infrastructure Risk 
A material failure of business processes or IT 
infrastructure may result in unanticipated financial 
loss or reputational damage.
Charles Stanley has constructed its framework of internal controls 
to minimise the risk of unanticipated financial loss or damage 
to its reputation. However, no system of internal control can 
completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent 
actions or reputational damage. The Group records and monitors 
operational losses and near misses which are reviewed at the 
Enterprise Risk Committee, with reporting to the Joint Risk 
Committee and the Board, where required.
Management is required to notify the Board of all individual 
losses exceeding £10,000 and to provide regular reports to the 
Board on dealing and trading losses. These should not exceed 
£100,000 in any 12-month rolling period.
Insurance cover is in place and reviewed on an annual basis to 
ensure that there is an appropriate amount of cover to manage 
the impact of operational losses against our capital reserves.
The continuing incidence of low level technical issues are driving 
the technology risk up. Charles Stanley’s strategic change 
programme and its plans to continue growing the business also 
inherently lead to an increase to the operational risk profile of the 
Group, which will continue to invest in its system capabilities and 
business processes to ensure that it meets the expectations of its 
customers, complies with regulatory, legal and financial reporting 
requirements, and mitigates the risk of loss or reputational 
damage from operational risk events and external threats.
➡
IT Security and Cyber Security Risk 
The risk that Charles Stanley’s system infrastructure 
is breached by external counterparties with or 
without malicious intention. Possible breaches 
could involve data theft, ransomware or a 
shutdown of systems.
Charles Stanley has limited appetite for unauthorised or 
inappropriate access to its IT systems due to the potential 
disruption to its business operations, adverse customer impacts 
and damage to its reputation. Similarly, the Group wishes to 
minimise the threat to its business activities from third party 
actions such as denial of service attacks. 
Alongside setting a framework to prevent and detect unauthorised 
access attempts to its business systems, Charles Stanley seeks to 
ensure that the systems are resilient to current and emerging 
threats and maintains a rolling programme of activity which is 
informed by the day-to-day experience, threat intelligence and 
any emerging vulnerabilities identified.
Although Charles Stanley has not experienced any significant 
issues in relation to its own cyber security arrangements, 
the cyber security risk has increased due to the number of 
high profile attacks suffered by other firms in recent months.

People and Conduct Risk 
The risk that clients or the wider market, 
as opposed to the Group, suffer detriment 
as a result of the Group’s services, products 
or activities.
The Group recognises that its reputation and financial success is 
dependent on the performance and conduct of its staff. Charles 
Stanley’s client-centric culture is founded on the Group’s core 
values of being Caring, Fair and Progressive. It is committed to 
delivering good outcomes for clients by communicating 
effectively and providing products and services that meet their 
needs throughout the customer journey. It acts with integrity in 
the market, and operates in line with the agreed strategy and 
within the risk appetite.
Eighteen Conduct Outcomes have been identified and will be 
monitored and reported via various metrics through to the 
Conduct dashboards. A Conduct and Culture Committee has 
been instituted in May 2017 to provide enhanced oversight.
All clients are risk profiled to ensure that we clearly define, 
agree and manage our clients’ portfolios in accordance with 
these risk profiles, investment objectives and capacity for loss. 
Suitability is a major focus which has quality assurance processes 
in place to assess suitability reviews performed by our staff. 
Careful monitoring of investment decision-making against the 
risk profile helps ensure that we achieve appropriate and suitable 
outcomes for our clients.
➡
Legal & Regulatory Risk 
The risk of breaching, or non-compliance with, 
regulations and restrictions enforced on the 
industry and the Group, resulting in regulatory 
censure and/or fines.
The Group has built a reputation as a high-quality provider 
of wealth management services. This has been carefully developed 
over many years and as such there is an emphasis on maintaining 
this status. The risk is monitored and managed by emphasis on 
compliance with all aspects of relevant regulation, including 
those of the FCA.
There remains a significant regulatory change agenda with the 
Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), the Markets 
in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II), the Packaged Retail 
Investment and Insurance-based Products (PRIIPS) and the 
General Data Protection Regulation. While in the longer term,  
the UK exit from the EU will potentially lead to a rewriting of some 
legislation, until the UK formally leaves and the UK government 
legislate otherwise, EU-derived legislation will remain in force. 
The FCA continues to focus on its approach to consumer regulation, 
with the inherent risk that thematic reviews of historic industry 
practices lead to unanticipated additional costs. 
Charles Stanley monitors the changes in the regulatory and legal 
agenda and has formal projects for major changes to ensure 
their successful implementation.

Corporate social responsibility report
Being an established and trusted wealth manager, our 
primary responsibility is the stewardship and preservation 
of our clients’ assets. Each year we report on our aim and 
activities to further our CSR Policy and practices in our four 
key areas: business integrity, our people, the community 
and the environment. Following a governance review that 
the Group undertook in early 2017, it was agreed that the 
CSR Committee, which has overseen our CSR initiatives, 
should be incorporated into the Conduct and Culture 
Committee, chaired by the CEO. The implementation and 
management of the CSR Policy continues to be viewed as 
a Group-wide responsibility, championed from the top, and 
this report evidences our commitment to reporting openly 
and honestly on our efforts at all levels across the business.
We recognise the fundamental importance of good 
corporate citizenship and sensitivity towards the people 
around us and the areas and communities in which 
we operate. We appreciate that our business has an 
environmental and social impact on society through our 
actions, donations and contribution to the wider economy. 
We believe in being both responsible and caring.
Business integrity
The Group is committed to ensuring appropriate client 
outcomes. Our primary responsibility is to preserve our 
clients’ wealth and maximise investment returns in 
accordance with our contractual responsibilities, in an 
appropriate manner and in line with regulatory requirements.
In this, our eleventh year of reporting 
corporate social responsibility (CSR), 
we are pleased to share the initiatives 
and actions that the Group has taken 
over the past year. Our Group Values 
of being Caring, Fair and Progressive 
provide a framework within which we 
operate, and support our approach 
to doing the right things for our clients, 
colleagues, the environment, 
marketplace and the wider 
communities within which we work.

Corporate governance
The Group undertook a governance review at the start 
of 2017 to ensure that Charles Stanley has clear direction, 
plans, structure, controls and resources, all of which are 
necessary for financial success and to ensure suitable client 
outcomes. The Group appreciates that companies which 
demonstrate a commitment to improving their corporate 
culture and the conduct of staff, and acknowledge their 
responsibilities within the local community and markets, 
are more likely to enjoy a superior reputation. The Group is 
headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success of the business. The Board 
provides leadership within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and 
managed. The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims and 
ensures that necessary financial and human resources are 
in place for the business to meet its objectives and review 
management performance. The Board supports the Group’s 
Values, and sets the culture and standards expected of the 
business, and ensures that obligations to shareholders and 
others are understood and met.
We follow the corporate governance guidelines contained in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council and annexed to the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. We ensure that, where 
practical, the Group complies with the Code. We compete 
fairly in the markets in which we operate and believe in the 
concept of business transparency and ethical behaviour. 
More details can be found in the Corporate governance 
report on page 52.
Client care
We are committed to the highest standards of client care 
and support the regulatory framework, Treating Customers 
Fairly, from the FCA.
We work with our clients to ensure our relationships 
deliver investment performance, protection from 
inappropriate risk and communications that are caring, 
clear, fair and not misleading.
Disclosure
At Charles Stanley all individuals are expected to conduct 
business in such a way as to ensure that appropriate client 
outcomes are achieved and that business is conducted in 
a manner that will enhance the Group’s reputation and to 
safeguard against unfair or unethical business practices. 
Our disclosure policy (concerning instances of whistleblowing 
and data protection) is monitored and enforced where 
necessary. Conscious of our obligations under the Bribery 
Act 2010 and other related rules and regulations, we take 
a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 
We carry out regular risk assessments to determine 
exposure and possibility of risks, including potential new 
risks arising within a changing environment, and update our 
policies, procedures and systems to mitigate them. We have 
strict Anti-Bribery and Gifts and Hospitality policies in place, 
and provide regular training to staff to ensure understanding 
and compliance. We review our approaches on a regular 
basis and adhere to high level principles for procurement.

 People
Charles Stanley is a people-driven business specialising 
in the provision of advice and appropriate wealth 
management to private clients and institutions such 
as charities and trusts.
We believe that all people should be treated in a fair 
manner, with due care and consideration, and be given 
opportunities to progress both for their own benefit and 
for those with whom they interact. People are and should 
be at the centre of all we do.
Employee involvement
Charles Stanley recognises the importance of communication. 
Over the past year we have significantly enhanced our 
ability to communicate with staff and to establish two-way 
channels of dialogue so that people’s opinions can be heard 
and suggestions made. The Company now publishes a 
regular magazine highlighting staff achievements and 
news. We also recognise individual actions; for example, 
employees who had gone beyond what was expected of 
them were publicly acknowledged at an award ceremony 
at the Group conference in January 2017. Internal 
communications have been enhanced to such a high 
degree that the Group’s Head of Communications has 
been short-listed as a Rising Star of the Year in the inaugural 
Women in Finance Awards 2017, which is supported by 
HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter.
In 2015 the Group launched its first staff engagement survey, 
recording an overall engagement score of 56%. The results 
of our second survey, held in November 2016, resulted in 
an 11% enhancement, raising the score to 67%. This uplift 
reflects the work that has been done over the past year 
to enhance the working environment. Many successful 
initiatives were proposed, designed and then achieved by 
staff working together in self-nominated, cross-divisional 
and departmental workstreams.
Training
The Group believes in having a highly trained and 
professional workforce, well equipped to provide 
the service that our clients require and deserve.
We launched the Group Leadership Development 
Programme in November 2016 to enhance the skills 
of our leaders during this period of change. In addition 
the first cohort delivered a project sponsored by the CEO, 
to improve the working environment and our position 
within the wider community via a range of actions. We have 
a dedicated Learning and Development team who work 
with staff at all levels across the organisation to ensure that 
they have the right skills and approach to do their work as 
expected and in an appropriate manner.
Benefits
In addition to base salary and the potential for earning 
a performance-related, discretionary bonus, the Group 
provides a range of benefits to attract, motivate and retain 
suitable, high-calibre individuals. All employees are able to 
benefit from life assurance, permanent health insurance and 
an above-market employer contribution towards their pension. 
In addition people can choose from a comprehensive 
selection of flexible benefits, namely childcare vouchers; Kids 
Pass (family discounts at a range of child-friendly venues); 
Babylon (private doctor or specialist consultation); cancer 
screening; dental insurance; health screening; the opportunity 
to purchase up to five days’ holiday; fitness and leisure club 
membership; will writing; access to an approved cycle to 
work scheme; season ticket loans; Gourmet Society 
(dining discounts); phone and laptop purchase with the 
opportunity to pay in instalments through salary deductions; 
charitable giving in a tax-efficient manner; and access to 
shares via a Save As You Earn plan that provides shares at 
a discounted rate, as well as a Share Incentive Plan for the 
tax-efficient purchasing of Charles Stanley shares. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 43

Diversity
Diversity and inclusion are important issues for Charles 
Stanley. The Innovation Through Inclusion Group was 
founded in January 2016 to foster a supportive, diverse and 
inclusive culture across the Group and to propose initiatives 
to enhance the business, for example by broadening 
sources for recruitment, introducing a mentoring programme, 
encouraging flexible working, inviting external speakers, 
participating in networking groups and attending external 
events. We believe in recognising, accepting and valuing 
differences and, where appropriate, capitalising on them 
to accelerate the Group’s growth. A diverse workforce adds 
value to our business. It helps us understand clients and 
counterparties from all walks of life and creates compelling 
wealth management services that are appropriate for our 
clients. An inclusive workplace culture helps us attract the 
most talented people from all backgrounds.
We are committed to challenging discrimination in all its forms 
and ensuring that equality lies at the heart of everything 
we do. We want to be a fair and unbiased organisation, 
one where everyone accepts difference between individuals 
and values the benefits that diversity brings. 
As a provider of services to private clients we need to be 
proactive, so that we can meet the changing needs of 
diverse communities and provide an environment where 
dignity and individuality is respected and promoted. 
As an employer we strive to build on our culture in which 
diversity is valued and staff can promote equality and are 
comfortable to challenge when appropriate. Specific questions 
relating to diversity and inclusion were included in the 2016 
Engagement Survey with follow-up focus groups to discuss 
matters raised. We are committed to responding swiftly and 
appropriately whenever action is required.
The Group has a clearly defined diversity policy which is 
reflected in our recruitment processes, support of flexible 
working and our equal opportunities policy.
The Group is aware of the Government’s recommendations 
on gender diversity and HM Treasury’s Women in Finance 
Charter. At 31 March 2017, women represented 38% of all 
Charles Stanley employees and 25% of the Non-executive 
Directors are female.

Community
Charles Stanley has a tradition of fostering strong 
relationships with the people and communities in the 
areas in which it operates. We have links with local businesses, 
schools, colleges, charities and clubs. We believe in being 
socially responsible and wish to make a positive contribution 
and build a sustainable legacy, both locally and nationally, 
as a responsible business leader. We believe that we should 
seek to support an environment in which people and 
organisations can survive and thrive.
Part of the rationale for opting for the catering specialists, 
CH&Co, who work onsite through their subsidiary, Lusso, 
in the Charles Stanley Head Office at 55 Bishopsgate, was 
due to their excellent approach towards the environment 
and their impact on local communities, including sponsoring 
sustainable farming and fishing and providing training for 
children and students at an inner-city farm. 
This year Charles Stanley has become a supporter of the 
Marylebone Cricket Club Foundation (MCCF) initiative to 
promote cricket, and thereby the health and wellbeing of 
young people. The MCCF has established 41 ‘Hubs’ across 
the UK to identify talented athletes in state schools between 
the ages of 11-15 and provide them with professional coaching. 
Charles Stanley is proud to be supporting the Hub in Tower 
Hamlets and is actively involved in supporting young people 
in the area.
In February the annual Charlotteville Jubilee Trust Guildford 
Pancake Race took place on the picturesque, cobbled 
streets of Guildford. Our Guildford Branch Manager, 
Charles Turton, is a Director of the Trust, and in conjunction 
with the local radio station, Charles Stanley sponsors this event. 
The race, together with its various events, has become a 
tradition and is much valued by the local community. 
Schools
The Group has for many years provided support to Lawdale 
Primary School via the Tower Hamlets Business Education 
Partnership. Each week a group of London-based employees 
assists pupils at the school, by helping them with their 
reading. All parties involved benefit from the experience.
Charities
The Head & Neck Cancer Foundation was chosen by a 
staff vote to be the Charles Stanley Charity of the Year. 
This charity was founded by doctors and supports ground 
breaking research into the treatment of head and neck 
cancer: ‘A brush with cancer is perhaps something that will 
always, internally, leave a deep mark, but, via the specialist 
skills provided by the charity, patients can have treatment 
that does not require them to be openly scarred for life.’
Through the hard work and generosity of Charles Stanley’s 
staff, £41,000 was raised (£6,000 of which was a direct 
donation from the Company). The money will be used to 
help introduce Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) which will 
revolutionise the management of mouth cancer in the UK. 
Currently, without SNB, all patients with mouth cancer 
undergo a complex 3-hour neck dissection operation, in 
order to protect the 30% of patients in whom the disease 
has spread. This means that 70% of patients have a major 
and avoidable operation.
Environment
In 2016 the Group consolidated its London estate which 
comprised five properties into a single Head Office providing 
many opportunities to reduce environmental impact.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to providing a workplace that 
not just meets but exceeds the required health and 
safety standards.
Greenhouse gas emissions report
The report details the Group’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions for the 12 months ended 31 March 2017. 
Charles Stanley is mindful of its impact on the environment 
and has taken action over the past year to significantly 
reduce emissions, for example by vacating less energy-efficient 
buildings in Finsbury Pavement and Luke Street in London, 
and consolidating into a single London site at 55 Bishopsgate. 
Other offices such as Cirencester and Bath have been 
amalgamated, in this case, into the existing premises in 
Bath. The new London office benefits from an innovative 
fit-out that includes energy-efficient measures such as 
LED lighting. The Group is pleased to share information 
relating to the Group’s energy consumption and resultant 
emissions. This data has been verified and the emissions 
calculated by the independent energy reduction specialists 
EnStrat (UK) Limited. 
Through the hard work and generosity 
of Charles Stanley’s staff, £41,000 
was raised for the Head & Neck 
Cancer Foundation. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 45
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
The majority of emissions generated are associated with the 
cooling and power for data rooms, together with heating, 
cooling and lighting for the Group’s various business 
premises around the UK. Over the past year Charles Stanley 
has succeeded in noticeably reducing its carbon footprint. 
The Group is required to report on the annual quantity of 
GHG emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO²e). This report is split into two aspects:
• Scope 1, relating to direct emissions that are from sources directly controlled by the Group:

Total 3,830,413 kWh 1,578.3 3,897,148 kWH 1,801.0
The year-on-year reduction was primarily due to the closure 
of coal fired power stations in the UK and the increased 
usage of renewable energy sources, combined with the 
vacation of less efficient buildings in London.
The Group continues to procure all of its electricity from 
‘green’ renewable energy sources and remains committed 
to reviewing and, where possible, acting upon opportunities 
identified to reduce emissions.
Environmental initiatives
• Recycling – In 2016 Charles Stanley recycled 60,940 kg at 
25 and 35 Luke Street, 10,960 kg at 131 Finsbury Pavement 
and 2,370 kg at 55 Bishopsgate. This is equivalent to a 
total of 102,870 kg of CO
2
 or 663 trees.
• Stationery – 51% of stationery purchased during 
2016 was in category 3 or above, defined as ‘easy 
to recycle or from sustainable sources’ or with better 
environmental accreditation.
• Relocation – Recycling and re-use were paramount in the 
process of the consolidation of the five London buildings 
into one. More than half of the desks in the new building 
were re-used. All the filing storage was existing stock. 
Chairs were re-used, and where it was necessary to 
replace non-compliant chairs, they were replaced 
with recycled and refurbished stock. All the furniture 
that was surplus to requirements was removed by a 
company that specialises in recycling and refurbishing 
second hand furniture.
Investment
While the overall investment policy of the Group is 
concerned solely with obtaining the best return for clients, 
in addition to the financial analysis that occurs as part of 
normal investment procedures, we also offer our clients a 
completely personal, socially responsible investment service 
that takes into account their personal preferences in relation 
to environmental and ethical matters. The phrase ‘focusing 
on you’ reflects the way that we operate. We understand 
that people are individuals and hence are committed to 
providing a bespoke wealth management service. Governance / Chairman’s introduction
Chairman’s introduction Chairman’s introduction 
Under the new structure, the CSG Board will meet quarterly 
and the CSC Board 6-8 times each year.
Our CEO, Paul Abberley, has been charged with implementing 
the strategy set by the CSG and CSC Boards; with the 
day-to-day decision-making and running of the business; 
and for fulfilment of regulatory obligations. To assist him 
with the discharge of these duties, the CEO has formed an 
Executive Committee comprising senior managers from 
across the Group, though responsibility rests with the CEO 
rather than with the Executive Committee. This clarity of 
individual responsibility is reflected throughout the executive 
chain of command in preparation for the Senior Managers 
and Certification Regime which, for the Group, is expected 
to come into effect from May 2018.
The Group’s committee structure remains unchanged, 
except that:
• The Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees now 
operate as joint committees of both Boards
• CSC has now established a separate Nomination 
Committee; I chair the CSG Nomination Committee 
and Andrew Didham chairs that of CSC.
While this and the Corporate governance reports have 
been prepared during the transitional period to the new 
governance structure, the period on which they are 
reporting was largely under the previous structure, 
during which each Board committee’s duties were in 
respect of the whole Group. 
At 31 March 2017, the CSG Board comprised seven directors: 
the Chairman, three independent Non-executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors. Anthony Scott and Mike 
Lilwall resigned as Directors of CSG on 18 April 2016 and 
23 November 2016 respectively.
The structure and representation of the various Board 
committees is shown on the right. The roles, main 
responsibilities and achievements during the year are 
set out in their respective reports on pages 48 to 51.
The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by Paul Abberley, 
and the underlying management teams have delivered 
further progress towards the Group’s strategic objectives.
The biographies of the Board of Directors and Executive 
Committee members are set out on pages 48 to 51.
Charles Stanley operates in a highly and constantly 
developing regulatory environment. Therefore a great 
deal of time has been dedicated by the Board and 
committees to regulatory matters to ensure that a robust 
compliance framework is appropriately embedded within 
the Group’s day-to-day activities. Our values revolve at all 
times around the best interests of our clients and the Board 
proactively seeks to promote and embed that in our culture.
Sir David Howard 
Chairman 
During the year we have restructured 
the Group’s governance framework 
to differentiate clearly the Board 
responsibilities of Charles Stanley Group 
PLC (CSG), the listed holding company, 
from those of Charles Stanley & Co. 
Limited (CSC), our principal regulated 
operating subsidiary. 
Governance 
pages 46 – 97
Under the new framework, which came into effect in 
March 2017:
• The CSG Board has been charged with the responsibility 
to set strategy for the Group and to monitor the 
performance of the operating subsidiaries
• The CSC Board has been charged with the responsibility 
to oversee, govern and direct the operation of CSC and 
the Group’s other regulated subsidiaries in line with the 
Group strategy. 
Consequently, the bulk of the regulated activity and focus 
now rests with the CSC Board. The composition of the CSC 
Board has also changed; Gary Teper and myself have stepped 
down as Directors of CSC and Andrew Didham has been 
appointed as Chairman. I remain Chairman of CSG and 
Gary Teper also remains a Director of CSG.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 47

Compliance with the code
The Directors recognise the benefits of good corporate 
governance and this report, together with the Directors’ 
report (pages 89 to 91), and the Strategic report 
(pages 4 to 45), describes how the Group has applied 
the Main Principles and complied with the Provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the Code). 
The Code is available on the FRC website https://www.frc.
org.uk/Our-Work/Corporate-Governance-Reporting/
Corporate-governance.aspx . The Directors ensure that 
the Group keeps up to date with all corporate governance 
developments and best practice wherever practical. 
The Chairman’s introduction referred to the governance 
review undertaken during the year, within which a number 
of the Code’s provisions have been addressed. These are set 
out in the relevant sections of the governance disclosures. 
The Board has carried out a review of its compliance with 
the relevant provisions of the Code throughout the year 
and confirms that the Group has complied with all relevant 
provisions of the Code during the year, though, the Chairman 
was not independent on appointment in 1999; A.3.1 of the 
Code refers.
Leadership
The Board of the Parent Company, Charles Stanley Group 
PLC, has provided leadership to and is responsible for the 
long-term success of the Group. The Board has determined 
the Group’s strategy and has overseen its implementation 
and the operations of the Group. The Executive Committee 
has managed the day-to-day running of the Company. 
Those responsibilities were adjusted in the governance review, 
as set out in the Chairman’s introduction to this section, but 
the Board continues to retain ultimate responsibility.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and clearly defined and have been approved by the Board. 
Sir David Howard, the Group’s Non-executive Chairman, 
is responsible for the leadership of the Board and for ensuring 
its effectiveness in all aspects of the role. The Chief Executive, 
Paul Abberley, has responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Group. 
As at 31 March 2017 the Board comprised seven Directors: 
the Chairman, three independent Non-executive Directors 
(NEDs) and three Executive Directors. No individual or group 
of individuals therefore has unfettered powers of decision. 
The NEDs provide challenge in respect of all matters before 
the Board, and contribute to the development of strategy at 
both the annual strategy forum and during the year.
Independence
Andrew Didham, Bridget Guerin and David Pusinelli 
have been determined by the Board to be independent. 
The NEDs provide a robust, independent element on the 
Board and they constructively challenge and examine the 
performance of Management. They bring well-considered 
and constructive opinions, skill and knowledge to Board 
discussions. Sir David Howard, because of his previous 
role as Chief Executive and his shareholding in the 
Company, is not considered to be independent.
Board operation and delegation of authority
The Board met 16 times during the year to review financial 
performance and strategy and to follow a schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board. The Board held strategy 
meetings in May 2016 and February 2017 at which members 
of the Executive Committee presented their proposals for 
the strategy as set out in the Strategic report on pages 4 
to 45. The Board attendance of the Directors during the 
year is shown in the table on the next page. The number 
of meetings attended is shown first, followed by the number 
of meetings that the Director was eligible to attend as a 
member of the Board if different to the total. Typically, 
papers are circulated to the Directors a week in advance 
of each meeting. The Company has for many years used 
a portal system to support the Board and Board committee 
meetings which is believed to improve the efficacy and 
security of the supply of information to Directors.

Effectiveness
Information regarding the Directors and their experience 
is given in their biographies on pages 48 and 49, which is 
offered to shareholders in support of the re-election of all 
directors at the AGM. 
David Pusinelli, the Senior Independent Director, has 
decided not to offer himself for re-election as a 
Non-executive Director at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Board has established a Nomination Committee to 
consider the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge available to ensure the Board and Board 
committees are enabled to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively. So as to further strengthen 
the effectiveness of the Board and in view of David Pusinelli’s 
decision to step down in the coming year, the Board is in 
advanced stages in seeking additional NEDs with wealth 
management experience and also a strong understanding 
of operational matters within the wealth management sector, 
with the hope of making appointments in the near future. 
Wealth management industry experience was confirmed as 
an area for focus for recruitment or development when the 
Board members assessed their own experience and that of 
their peers via a skills matrix during the governance review. 
As a consequence, both the matrix results and the redefined 
Role Description for a NED were taken into account for the 
purpose of the recruitment of a new independent NED. 
Further details of the responsibilities and activities of the 
Nomination Committee throughout the year are detailed 
on page 60 of this report.
None of the Executive Directors have any external 
directorships. The NEDs’ service contracts include 
an expectation of their time commitment and their 
allocation of time to the Group is reviewed annually. 
Taking into account any previous experience they may 
already have as directors of a public limited company, 
appropriate training and induction is provided to all 
new Directors. The induction process includes meeting 
with Executive Directors, the members of the Executive 
Committee, relevant business heads and other senior 
executives. New Directors will also receive information 
from past meetings. To assist with continuing professional 
development needs, all Directors are collectively provided 
with updates on matters relevant to the business and the 
environment in which it operates. 
Following the self and peer scoring of all Executive 
and Non-executive Directors, utilising a skills matrix, 
the Chairman reviewed the results and used them to 
support him when considering the training and 
development needs of both the Board as a whole 
and of individual directors. Appropriate development 
and training initiatives have been commenced. 
During late 2016 and early 2017, with support from external 
consultants, the Group underwent a review of its governance 
framework; this included an evaluation of the performance 
of the Boards, Committees and the Directors. Changes to 
enhance performance, where appropriate, have been 
approved by the Board and introduced.
The Group is committed to extending the proportion of 
female employment and representation; 14% of the Board 
is female. Further details about diversity in the Company 
are contained in the Corporate social responsibility report 
on page 40.

Accountability
This Annual report includes a number of disclosures 
which set out the Company’s position and prospects. 
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities confirms 
that the Directors believe those disclosures to be a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment and it is the 
Auditor’s opinion that the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the Group’s affairs.
The Board has established a Risk Committee to consider the 
nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives, which is closely supported 
by the CRO and reports to the Board. Separately, the Board 
considers a report from the CRO at each of its Board meetings. 
Disclosures regarding provisions C.2.1 and C.2.3 of the Code 
are contained in the Risk management and principal risks 
section on page 34. Further details of the responsibilities 
and activities of the Risk Committee throughout the year 
are detailed on page 86 of this report.
The Board has established an Audit Committee to consider 
corporate reporting, internal controls and to manage the 
relationship with the external auditor. Further details of 
the responsibilities and activities of the Audit Committee 
throughout the year are detailed on page 56 of this report.
Remuneration 
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee to 
consider and approve the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements and to ensure that those arrangements are 
designed to promote the long-term success of the Company 
and that any performance-related elements are transparent, 
stretching and rigorously applied. Further details of the 
responsibilities and activities of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out on pages 62 to 85 of this report.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, David Pusinelli, 
the Non-executive Directors also met without the Chairman 
present to discuss the evaluation of his performance, 
having taken into consideration separate consultation 
with the Chief Executive Officer. The effectiveness of the 
Chairman was confirmed and feedback on the appraisal 
was given to the Chairman.
Relationship with shareholders
The Company places great importance on communication 
with shareholders and aims to keep shareholders informed 
by regular communication. Directors meet regularly with 
the Company’s institutional investors, analysts and 
financial press. The Company’s website is kept up to date 
with investor relations material, including annual and 
interim reports, and these are also distributed to anyone 
expressing an interest in the Company. The channel of 
communication between the Board and shareholders is 
open and active. Executive Directors meet with shareholders 
and analysts after the annual and half-yearly results are 
announced. David Pusinelli, as Senior Independent Director, 
contacts the institutional shareholders to arrange a meeting 
or confirm that the shareholders have no matters to raise. 
The Company welcomes all shareholders to its AGM, with 
the opportunity to ask questions formally at the meeting or 
more informally with all members of the Board afterwards. 
The Board is provided with regular feedback following

Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s responsibilities fall largely into three areas:
1.  To monitor the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting 
and content of narrative reporting in all published 
accounts and public statements regarding the Group’s 
financial performance
2.  To review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management framework and internal control systems 
in conjunction with the Risk Committee. This includes 
oversight of the internal audit function
3.  To own the relationship with the Group’s external auditor, 
including monitoring of their performance and approval 
of fees.
The role and responsibilities of the Committee are set 
out in terms of reference which were reviewed as part 
of the governance review and approved by the Board 
in February 2017. For more information and the Committee’s 
terms of reference please visit the Group’s website: 
www.charles-stanley.co.uk
Membership and meetings
All members of the Committee are independent 
Non-executive Directors, the majority of whom have 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, the internal audit partner and the external audit 
partner attend most meetings by invitation. The Chief Risk 
Officer, who oversees the Compliance and Risk departments, 
also attends when required and under the Committee’s new 
terms will be invited to attend all meetings.
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year
The Committee has established an annual cycle of work 
to ensure all responsibilities are met over a calendar year. 
The agenda items covered in the Committee’s meetings 
include standing items, plus additional agenda items 
including, for example, all reports issued by the external 
and internal auditors since the previous meeting of 
the Committee.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance
The work we have undertaken within the Committee 
during the last year principally fell into three main areas:
1. Accounting, tax and financial reporting
• Reviewed the 2017 interim and annual financial statements 
and recommended their approval by the Board, together 
with supporting documents and dividend payments
• Considered all significant financial reporting judgements 
in respect of those financial statements (see below for 
further detail), and reviewed the related principal disclosures
• Considered the appropriateness of preparing the 2017 
interim and annual financial statements on a going 
concern basis.
2. Internal controls
• Reviewed and agreed the scope of the risk-based audit 
plan as proposed by internal audit
• Considered reports from the internal auditor and its 
assessment of relevant mitigating controls
• Monitored progress in resolving audit issues raised in 
audit reports
• Reviewed the resources of the internal audit function 
and agreed the costs
• Reviewed policies relevant to the Committee 
responsibilities including whistleblowing.
3. External audit
• Considered and approved the audit approach and scope 
of the audit work
• Reviewed reports on audit findings
• Reviewed and approved the policy on the independence 
of the external auditor
• Considered the independence of the auditor, with 
particular focus on the nature of non-audit work as 
well as the mix of audit and non-audit fees
• Considered the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code regarding external audit
• Considered letters of representation given to the external 
auditor by Management
• Considered the effectiveness of the external audit.
Internal audit
The provision of internal audit activities has been 
outsourced to Grant Thornton. Grant Thornton has 
a deep pool of resources with substantial experience 
and qualifications in the activity of internal audit within 
the financial services sector. This means that they are able 
to bring in specialists relevant to the areas being reviewed 
and also that they possess up-to-date experience of industry 
best practice which acts as a useful benchmark for the Group. 
The internal audit function reports directly to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
The audit plan for the upcoming year is approved in 
advance by the Committee on an annual basis. A rolling 
three-year plan is maintained to ensure all critical areas of 
the business are covered over this period. We then overlay 
a risk assessment to determine the prioritisation of the 
internal audit plan for the coming year.
The annual budget for internal audit activities is agreed 
between the Chairman of the Committee and the Chief 
Financial Officer, having regard to the planned scope 
of work of the internal audit function during the period. 
The cost of any ad hoc or additional work required over 
the course of the year is also reviewed and agreed by the 
Committee and the Chief Financial Officer as it arises.
The Committee reviews all internal audit reports in order 
to assess the effectiveness of mitigating controls and 
proposed actions by management to address any issues 
found. The Committee ensures that all management 
actions arising are tracked to completion on a timely basis. 
Exceptionally, operational and line management may be 
required to attend the Committee to report on progress.
During this financial year a total of 19 reviews were undertaken 
by internal audit and reviewed by the Committee. Internal 
audit fees incurred for this work amounted to £352,000 
(2016: £324,000).
External auditor
Performance and effectiveness of our external auditor
During the year we reviewed the effectiveness of KPMG, 
the Group’s external auditor. Perception remained high 
of both performance and effectiveness of the external 
audit services received. Matters pertaining to the Client 
Assets Sourcebook (CASS) were the only area of contention; 
differing views of regulatory interpretation have since 
been resolved.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 58
Governance / Audit Committee report
Non-audit services
We have reviewed the independence and the nature of 
non-audit services supplied by KPMG and non-audit fee 
levels relative to the audit fee. The Committee’s prior 
approval is required where the fee for an individual 
non-audit service is expected to exceed £50,000 
(excluding VAT). Fees for non-audit services paid to 
the auditors should not, in aggregate, exceed 70% 
or more of the average audit fees paid to the audit firm 
in the last three consecutive years without the Committee’s 
prior written approval.
It is recognised that, given their knowledge of the business, 
there are often advantages in using KPMG to provide certain 
non-audit services. Fees other than for audit or assurance 
payable to the auditors during the year ended 31 March 2017 
were £50,000 (2016: £80,000).
We have reviewed the safeguards to independence 
that have been put in place by KPMG in undertaking 
the non-audit engagements throughout the year and 
are satisfied that these are appropriate. The safeguards 
and terms of engagement were reviewed and approved 
by us prior to KPMG commencing their work.
We agreed the external audit fees and reviewed the audit 
engagement letter. We also had discussions with the 
external auditor with no Management present to provide 
an opportunity for any concerns to be aired.
Audit tender
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that 
audits should be subject to tender at least once every 
ten years. KPMG was appointed as the Group’s auditor for 
the 2011 year-end following a competitive tender process. 
The Committee intends to conduct an audit tender process 
again before the tenth anniversary of their appointment.
Significant accounting issues considered by the 
Audit Committee
Following discussions with both Management and KPMG, 
the Committee has determined that the following areas 
form the key areas of judgement in the preparation of the 
2017 consolidated financial statements:
• Impairment of goodwill
• Impairment of other intangible and non-financial assets
• Available-for-sale financial assets
• Corporate transactions
• Pension scheme deficit
• Assets held for sale and post balance sheet events.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill has arisen in prior years principally from the 
acquisition of subsidiaries and typically represents 
the difference between the total cost of acquisition 
and the fair values of the assets of the acquired business.
Goodwill is shown at a value of £14.1 million (31 March 2016: 
£16.0 million) on the balance sheet and is detailed in note 14.
We have considered the review of goodwill which is 
performed by Management at each reporting date or 
earlier if an erosion of goodwill is suspected. The review 
requires that an impairment charge is recognised if the 
recoverable amount is less than its carrying value. The 
approach adopted is first to calculate fair value less costs 
to sell, and to consider value in use only if the carrying value 
fails this first test. The majority of the goodwill, £8.8 million 
(31 March 2016: £10.7 million), relates to the businesses 
acquired. Impairment charges in the year related to the 
departure in summer 2016 of the Southampton investment 
management team (£0.7m). In addition, goodwill of 
£1.3 million in relation to EBS Management PLC was 
transferred to held for sale assets. 
Charles Stanley Direct represents £5.2 million (31 March 2016: 
£5.2 million) of the total goodwill balance. This business 
comprises our online execution-only platform and the direct 
execution-only service, Charles Stanley Investment Choices 
Limited, together considered a cash generating unit (CGU).
Management assessed the carrying value of goodwill 
attributable to Charles Stanley Direct by reference to 
recent market transactions involving similar businesses. 
This valuation approach continues to support the carrying 
value of goodwill and consequently, while still regarding it 
as an area of judgement, the Committee concludes that this 
CGU is not impaired. 
Impairment of other intangible and non-financial assets
The Committee considers that client lists provide the 
principal area for review for impairment. These were 
valued at £4.7 million as at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: 
£6.3 million). The hiring of individual or teams of senior 
investment managers requires a value to be attributed to 
the client lists that they bring to the Group. These intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful life, generally a period 
of ten years, which the Committee considers appropriate. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 59
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
The Committee has looked for evidence of impairment 
arising from the loss of any senior investment managers 
during the year that may indicate the risk of outflow of 
clients and associated Funds under Management. 
The Committee has also reviewed analysis of the underlying 
rate of loss of clients to look for any other cause of possible 
outflows. During the year, the closure of client accounts 
stayed low and the main cause of lost clients remained 
death which the Committee recognises tends to claim 
3% to 4% of the client base each year. The Committee 
has not found reason for Management to reflect any 
impairment in the carrying value of these intangible assets. 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Management has appraised its investment in Euroclear PLC 
by reference to a recent tender process from Euroclear PLC’s 
share buyback scheme, in which the Group participated 
and was successful in redeeming around 60% of its holding 
post the balance sheet date. The Committee has noted 
the results of the valuation exercise and concludes that its 
carrying value is appropriate.
During the year, the Group converted in full the loan to 
Runpath Group Limited (previously known as Masterlist 
Limited) into 119,154 ordinary shares and sold 25% of 
its enlarged equity holding. The value of the loan had 
previously been written down by 50% and that discount 
was applied to the June 2016 sale price for the remaining 
shares held. This Committee considers that this valuation 
approach is appropriate.
Corporate transactions
On 1 April 2016, the Group sold its pensions consultancy 
business, CSFS, for £1.5 million in cash and deferred 
consideration in the form of loan notes totalling £0.5 million. 
Consequent to the default by CSFS of its loan repayment 
obligations, an impairment charge of £0.5 million, 
representing the full carrying value of the capital and 
interest due, has been recognised in the Income Statement 
in 2017. Agreement in principle has been reached to 
reschedule the loan repayment and a review will be 
undertaken at each future reporting date to assess 
the recoverability of this loan.
Assets held for sale and post balance sheet events
On 11 April 2017, the Group announced that it had exchanged 
contracts for the sale of EBS to Embark Group Limited 
for up to £4.0m. As the transaction was completed on 
31 May 2017, post the balance sheet date, the Committee 
considers it appropriate for the assets and liabilities 
attributable to EBS to be presented as held for sale in 
the Consolidated statement of financial position. 
Pension scheme deficit
The Group’s defined benefit scheme was closed to future 
service accruals as at 31 March 2016. The latest full triennial 
valuation was carried out in May 2014. Based on the latest 
International Accounting Standard 19 (IAS 19) actuarial 
valuation, the pension fund shows a deficit position of 
£10.5 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: £10.1 million) 
and this is further detailed in note 11. The next full triennial 
actuarial valuation as at 13 May 2017 is currently being 
undertaken. This is due to be completed in early 2018 and 
is expected to be reflected in the financial statements for 
the year ending 31 March 2018.
The Committee has reviewed the actuarial valuation report 
and noted the conclusions of KPMG on the nature of the 
assumptions used by the actuaries and is in agreement 
with the year-end deficit position.

Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
 Remuneration policy and principles
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that our 
Executive Directors’ remuneration is aligned with the 
interests of shareholders, with a significant proportion 
of their remuneration being performance-related. 
Executive Directors’ reward comprises a cash-based 
salary with benefits including pension, an annual bonus 
scheme and a share-based Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
Our Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders 
at the AGM on 31 July 2015, directly links the pay of our 
Executive Directors to the achievement of stretching 
financial and operating performance targets. 
Our remuneration policy aims to:
• Attract, retain and motivate highly capable Directors and 
Senior Management, with the skills and experience to 
manage the business
• Maintain appropriate levels of fixed pay, with a ratio of 
variable to fixed pay that is relevant and competitive
• Foster and support conduct and behaviours which are in 
line with our client-centric and regulatory-compliant culture
• Ensure that remuneration does not encourage inappropriate 
risk taking that would sit outside the Board’s risk appetite
• Set Directors’ targets, linked to reward, which demonstrate 
a clear correlation to the business strategy via the 
performance metrics for the annual bonus scheme 
and the long-term incentive plan
• Achieve consistency with the remuneration philosophy 
applied to the Group’s employees as a whole.
Decisions made during the year
The Remuneration Committee has carried out significant 
work this year to assist the Executive Committee to standardise 
and amend the compensation of the investment managers, 
with the intention of ensuring that their remuneration 
promotes good customer outcomes and is in line with 
shareholders’ interests. The Remuneration Committee 
has had an oversight role during the process of consultation 
and implementation. I would like to thank a number of 
major shareholders and their representatives, whose views 
were sought during the period of negotiations and whose 
observations have assisted us in our deliberations and in 
securing a satisfactory conclusion. 
Directors’ remuneration report
Bridget Guerin 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 March 2017. This report 
complies with the UK Directors’ 
Remuneration Reporting Regulations 
2013 and covers the Group’s 
approach towards remuneration, 
the Remuneration Committee’s 
principal activities during the year 
and specific information relating to 
the treatment of Directors. Further 
detailed information, as required by 
the Regulations, is set out immediately 
following this annual statement.
The attendance of the Remuneration Committee was

Financial statements Strategic report Governance
The Remuneration Committee undertook a review of 
Executive Directors’ salaries during the year, noting that  
no Executive Director had received an increase in their base 
pay since July 2012 or since being appointed to the Board, 
despite some taking on greater responsibilities. Market- 
related benchmark data was considered, as was the 
size and complexity of the business in relation to peer 
organisations. The current business performance and the 
achievement of both financial and non-financial objectives 
(including adherence to the principles of treating customers 
fairly, conduct risk, compliance and regulatory rules) were 
taken into account when determining the revised salaries. 
Increases were approved for all Directors and these took 
effect from 1 April 2017. The resulting salaries are Paul 
Abberley £350,000, Ben Money-Coutts £250,000 and 
Gary Teper £250,000, representing increases of 16.7%, 
11.1% and 8.7% respectively. When determining the increases 
the Committee took into account that none of the Executives 
had received an increase since being appointed to the Board. 
These increases therefore represent, on an annualised basis, 
increases of between 7% and 2%. 
While these increases are significant, both in absolute terms 
and when compared to the general workforce increase of 
2.3%, the Committee determined that the increases were 
appropriate in light of the above factors. When approving 
the revised salaries the Committee was conscious of the fact 
that bonus and PSP awards are not directly linked to salary 
and therefore there is no multiplier effect on the overall 
quantum of remuneration. The salaries will next be reviewed 
in October 2017.
Remuneration outcomes
You will have read elsewhere in the Annual report that there 
has been a steady improvement in overall performance over 
the year as the Group returned to profit. The size of the 
annual bonus pool is based on a percentage of adjusted 
profit which resulted in a total bonus pool of £455,000 to 
be allocated to the Executive Directors.
Despite the improvement in performance there will be no 
vesting from the January 201 5 PSP award, which is based 
on performance to 31 March 2017, as the performance levels 
are below the respective earnings per share (EPS) and 
margin targets.
Notable events
• As announced on 24 November 2016, Mike Lilwall decided 
to step down from the Board, after many years as an 
Executive Director, to enable him to focus on private client 
investment management. We are grateful to him for his 
work over the years and continued support and dedication. 
• Although, as notified in the 2016 Annual report and accounts, 
Anthony Scott stepped down from the Board on 18 April 2016, 
he was a Director at the start of this financial year and 
hence he has been included and accounted for in this Report.
Activity in the coming year
The Remuneration Committee has been involved 
in the governance review that commenced in 2016, 
with external support from PwC. As a consequence 
of the separation of the PLC and regulated Boards, 
a new position of Chairman of Charles Stanley & Co. 
Limited has been created. Andrew Didham has accepted 
the role, as well as the position of Chairman of the supporting 
Nomination Committee, which he will undertake in addition 
to his existing responsibilities as a Non-executive Director. 
His remuneration has been adjusted to reflect these increased 
responsibilities. These changes took effect from March 2017.
The regulatory environment remains demanding, with the 
SMCR and MiFID II due to occur during the coming year, and 
we regularly monitor our policy to ensure it remains compliant, 
continues to support the interests of our shareholders and to 
reward our Executive Directors appropriately.
I trust that the above provides you with a summary of 
the main events in the past 12 months. Further detailed 
information is provided on pages 64 to 77 of the 
Remuneration policy report. If you have any questions 
or comments I would be delighted to hear from you or 
to discuss matters at the AGM on 27 July 2017.

Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
We have presented this report to reflect the reporting 
requirements on remuneration matters for companies, 
particularly Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Report also describes how the 
Board has complied with the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code relating to remuneration matters.
At our 2017 AGM, o n 27 July, we will be holding a vote on the 
Implementation report within this report. The auditors have 
reported on certain parts of this report and stated whether, 
in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Those sections of the report which have been subject to 
audit are clearly indicated.
Directors’ remuneration policy
Key features of the policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy as summarised in this 
section of the report took effect for all payments made to 
Directors from the date of the 2015 AGM. For information 
and ease of reference the remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors is summarised in the table on pages 66 to 69, 
along with the policy regarding Non-executive Directors’ 
fees. Please note that the section ‘Implementation of policy’ 
has been written to reflect current salaries and other 
relevant changes.
How the Committee takes account of wider pay issues 
when setting the policy
When setting Executive Director remuneration, 
the Committee takes into account Group-wide pay 
and employment conditions, along with market and 
commercial factors (although, reflecting prevailing 
commercial practice, the Committee does not consult with 
employees in preparing the policy or its implementation). 
For example, when determining any base salary increases 
for Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the average 
Group-wide increase, as well as remuneration within similar 
organisations (with specific note taken of businesses of 
similar size or complexity), using benchmark data provided 
by professional remuneration experts. The annual bonus 
opportunity of the Executive Directors is similar in a number 
of respects to the ‘discretionary’ bonus opportunity of a 
significant number of other Group staff, in that both 
personal performance and overall Group profitability help 
determine amounts paid out. Although there are 
conduct-related sanctions within the approved investment 
managers’ scheme, and limited share deferrals as part of 
the variable reward available to certain successful financial 
planners, only the Executive Directors’ bonuses are subject 
to individual caps, mandatory share deferral and clawback/
malus. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
full range of Group benefits offered to employees.
In addition, they are eligible for certain remuneration to 
which other employees are not eligible. For example, 
Executive Directors may receive a salary supplement in 
lieu of pension. Also, Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in the PSP, participation in which is not intended 
to be extended widely. However, all employees are eligible 
to participate in the all-employee share schemes described 
in the table on pages 68 and 69.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 65
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
How shareholders’ views are taken into account when 
setting the policy
Each year the Committee will take into account the approval 
levels of remuneration-related resolutions at the previous 
AGM when reviewing the current policy. More generally, 
the Committee will also seek to build an active and 
productive dialogue with shareholders on developments 
in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance 
and any changes to the Group’s executive pay arrangements. 
In addition, in line with the Investment Association’s 
Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure, 
the Committee is comfortable that the incentive structure 
for Executive Directors does not raise any environmental, 
social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
The Policy and the FCA Remuneration Code
The Committee regularly reviews its remuneration policies 
to ensure compliance with the principles of the Remuneration 
Code of the UK financial services regulator, the FCA, as 
applicable to Charles Stanley. The remuneration policy is 
designed to be consistent with conservative management 
of risk, to encourage appropriate conduct and to support 
the sustained long-term performance of the Group. 
The Committee believes that the remuneration policies 
neither encourage, nor reward, inappropriate risk-taking. Governance / Directors’ remuneration report

Element and purpose Policy and operation Opportunity Performance measures Implementation of policy
Base salary
This is the core element of pay and 
reflects the individual’s role and 
position within the Group, with 
some adjustment to reflect their 
capability and contribution.
Base salaries are considered with account taken of 
levels paid by companies of similar size, complexity 
and challenge. However, the Committee does not 
strictly follow benchmark data but instead uses it 
as a reference point in considering, in its judgement, 
the appropriate level having regard to other relevant 
factors including corporate and individual performance 
and any changes in an individual’s role and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
Base salary levels will be formally reviewed 
at such time as the Committee considers 
appropriate. If any increases are made, 
except in exceptional circumstances, it is 
expected that they will be in line with general 
workforce increases (save where a higher 
increase is necessary to reflect a significant 
change in role and/or responsibilities). Any 
base salary increases will normally take 
effect at the time of general workforce 
amendments, this is typically from 1 October.
n/a No increases to base salaries were made in 2016. However, following a formal review, 
uplifts were approved for all Executive Directors, to take effect from 1 April 2017. 
2017 base salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Benefits

by recipient.
Provide market competitive benefits in kind. Details of the current benefits provided 
can be found to the right. The Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that it is in the interests 
of the Group to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to market 
practice. The Committee will monitor 
overall benefit costs and will ensure that 
they do not increase by more than the 
Committee considers to be appropriate 
in all circumstances.
n/a The benefits received by the Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, private medical cover, 
private health insurance and Death in Service benefits and a mobile and/or iPad. No changes were 
made to this element of remuneration in 2017 and none are proposed for 2018.
Pension
To aid retention and remain 
competitive within the market place.
Provide a competitive level of post-retirement benefits.
The Executive Directors participate in money purchase 
arrangements. Contributions are taken as a salary 
supplement by all Directors.
Contributions to the pension arrangements 
may be reviewed when considered 
appropriate by the Committee.
n/a No changes were made to pension arrangements in 2017 and none are anticipated for 2018.
The Executive Directors receive the following payments:
Paul Abberley – 20% of base salary
Ben Money-Coutts – 20% of base salary 
Gary Teper – 20% of base salary
Annual bonus
To incentivise Executive Directors 
to deliver against annual 
performance targets.
Annual bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures 
are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to support 
the Group’s strategic goals.
Bonus outcomes are paid in one tranche (less any 
deferred share award) following the year-end.
Any bonus earned in excess of 50% of salary under 
the main bonus plan is to be deferred into shares 
for a period of three years.
During the period until vesting of deferred share awards, 
the numbers of shares awarded are increased by the 
value of dividends notionally payable in respect of the 
vesting shares.
Malus/clawback provisions apply to amounts deferred 
which can be reduced in later years in exceptional 
circumstances such as: 
(i) material misstatement of accounts
(ii)  action that causes material reputational damage 
to the Group
(iii) in the event of material regulatory censure.
To reflect the Group’s strategic objective 
of driving growth and improved quality 
of profits, the core annual bonus plan is 
structured as a ‘profit pool’ under which 
an agreed percentage of adjusted profit 
before tax (PBT) can be distributed to the 
Executive Directors, with a portion of this 
distribution based on performance against 
individual targets. There is a cap of 6% of 
adjusted PBT that can be allocated to the 
pool. In addition, no Executive Director may 
receive a bonus in excess of 100% of their 
salary under this plan.
Due to the profit pool nature of the bonus, 
there is no prescribed amount of bonus 
that is payable for any particular level 
of performance.
Adjusted PBT is defined as PBT adding back 
bonus pool accrual, the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) or similar levy 
and, in exceptional circumstances, any other 
items the Committee consider appropriate 
to reflect the underlying financial 
performance of the Group.
The performance measures applied 
may be financial or non-financial and 
corporate, divisional or individual.
The annual bonus remains a 
discretionary arrangement and the 
Committee reserves discretion to 
adjust the outturn should it consider 
that to be appropriate (albeit within 
the limits set out in this policy table).
2017 Annual Bonus
When reviewing the performance of the 2017 financial year, the Remuneration Committee determined 
that the bonus pool under this plan, for distribution to the Executive Directors, would be approximately 
5% of adjusted PBT.
50% of this bonus pool was allocated across all the Executive Directors on an equal basis, which in the 
case of Mike Lilwall was pro-rata to the time that he served as an Executive Director. The remaining 
50% of the bonus pool was allocated to each Executive Director based upon their performance 
against pre-set individual performance objectives. 
Paul Abberley was set objectives which included delivering the financial plan, ensuring that the Company 
was managed in a risk-aware manner, ensuring that all stakeholder interests and outcomes were 
appropriately managed and providing a Company voice to shareholders and clients. 
Ben Money-Coutts was set objectives which included managing the Finance function with due regard 
for conduct risk and risk management and for ensuring that all internal audit points were addressed. 
He was also responsible for encouraging and supporting the adoption of the Company’s budget and 
for delivering the efficient financial operation of the Investment Management Services division’s new 
remuneration arrangements.
Gary Teper was set a key objective to deliver new contracts and remuneration arrangements for the 
investment managers. He was also mandated to set up effective management structures for the 
Investment Management Services division and for the HR and Legal teams. He also had objectives 
to ensure that the business areas for which he was responsible were managed with due regard for 
conduct risk and with effective risk management infrastructure.
Each of the Executive Directors were judged to have achieved their key objectives. 
The Bonus payments are set out in the table on page 78.
2018 Annual Bonus
The bonus will be operated in a similar manner to 2017 (that is a profit pool will be created worth up 
to 6% of adjusted profit, which will be distributed based, in part, on performance against individual 
objectives). Given the nature of the individual objectives, they are considered commercially sensitive 
and are accordingly not disclosed in this report (although they relate to their contributions to delivering 
the targeted further improvement in profitability and the delivery of the detailed plans built to guide 
the implementation of the corporate strategy). Further information regarding these targets will be 
included in next year’s report. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 67

Base salary
This is the core element of pay and 
reflects the individual’s role and 
position within the Group, with 
some adjustment to reflect their 
capability and contribution.
Base salaries are considered with account taken of 
levels paid by companies of similar size, complexity 
and challenge. However, the Committee does not 
strictly follow benchmark data but instead uses it 
as a reference point in considering, in its judgement, 
the appropriate level having regard to other relevant 
factors including corporate and individual performance 
and any changes in an individual’s role and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
Base salary levels will be formally reviewed 
at such time as the Committee considers 
appropriate. If any increases are made, 
except in exceptional circumstances, it is 
expected that they will be in line with general 
workforce increases (save where a higher 
increase is necessary to reflect a significant 
change in role and/or responsibilities). Any 
base salary increases will normally take 
effect at the time of general workforce 
amendments, this is typically from 1 October.
n/a No increases to base salaries were made in 2016. However, following a formal review, 
uplifts were approved for all Executive Directors, to take effect from 1 April 2017. 
2017 base salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Benefits
To provide other benefits valued 
by recipient.
Provide market competitive benefits in kind. Details of the current benefits provided 
can be found to the right. The Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that it is in the interests 
of the Group to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to market 
practice. The Committee will monitor 
overall benefit costs and will ensure that 
they do not increase by more than the 
Committee considers to be appropriate 
in all circumstances.
n/a The benefits received by the Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, private medical cover,

Long-term incentives
To incentivise delivery of sustained 
performance over the long term, 
the Company operates the Charles 
Stanley Performance Share Plan (PSP).
Awards under the PSP may be in the form of nil-cost 
options, conditional awards (rights to receive shares  
for nil-cost) or cash-based ‘phantom’ awards.
During the period until vesting of awards, the numbers 
of shares awarded are increased by the value of 
dividends notionally payable in respect of the 
vesting shares.
Awards previously granted but not yet vested, and 
shares received following vesting, can be reduced/
reclaimed in exceptional circumstances such as: 
(i) material misstatement of accounts
(ii)  actions that cause material reputational damage 
to the Group
(iii) in the event of material regulatory censure.
The formal limit under the PSP is 100% of 
salary (and 200% in exceptional cases).
The Committee expressly reserves discretion 
to make such awards as it considers 
appropriate within these limits. Actual grant 
levels may be determined by reference to 
individual performance in the prior year, 
with vesting then based upon performance 
against three-year targets.
At a threshold level of performance against 
these three-year targets, 20% of an award is 
capable of vesting.
The Committee will set performance 
conditions for each annual PSP award 
which may relate to financial and/or 
share price performance and which will 
have the underlying aim of encouraging 
and rewarding the generation of 
sustainable returns to shareholders.
July 2016 Awards
Awards were made under the PSP in July 2016 over shares worth up to 80% of salary to Paul Abberley, 
and between 64% and 69% of salary to Ben Money-Coutts and Gary Teper.
50% of each award will vest subject to adjusted EPS targets, with 50% subject to operating margin 
targets, each measured over a three-year period to 31 March 2019.
Further details of the targets that applied to the awards are set out in the Implementation report.
July 2017 Awards
The Remuneration Committee has determined that awards be made over 40,000 shares to each of 
the Executive Directors. Further details of the targets that will apply to the awards are set out in the 
Implementation report section of this Directors’ remuneration report.
Shareholding guidelines
To encourage share ownership by the 
Executive Directors and ensure their 
interests are aligned with investors. 
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of shares 
(net of tax), which vest under the PSP or bonus deferral, 
until such time that they hold a specified value of shares 
as shown in the Opportunity column. These restrictions 
do not apply to other Charles Stanley shares that they 
may own.
Once the shareholding guideline has been met, 
individuals are expected to retain these levels as a 
minimum. The Committee will review shareholdings 
annually in this context.

Executive Directors are able to participate in all- 
employee share plans on the same terms as other 
Group employees.
Sharesave – individuals may save up to a 
maximum of £250 (or such amount permitted 
by the HMRC approved limit) each month for 
a fixed period of three or five years. At the end 
of this period, they may use their savings to 
buy shares in the Company at a discount 
currently capped at 15% (although the rules 
permit 20%) of the market price set at the 
launch of each scheme.
Share Incentive Plan – individuals may 
purchase, out of their pre-tax salary, 
shares in the Company up to a value of 
£150 per month (or such amount permitted 
by the HMRC approved limit). Free shares 
worth up to £3,000 (or such amount 
permitted by the HMRC approved limit) 
can also be granted each year. Also, the 
rules of the Plan allow matching shares to 
be granted based on the number of shares 
purchased (although the Company does not 
currently operate the free share and 
matching elements of the Plan).
Consistent with normal practice, 
these awards are not subject to 
performance conditions.

to pay positioning and exercises judgement as to what 
it considers to be reasonable in all the circumstances as 
regards quantum.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors 
who chair a Board committee or who have other 
additional responsibilities (such as being Senior 
Independent Director).
Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual

account of additional time commitments 
and responsibilities.
The annual limit on benefits is £25,000.
The cap on fees payable to Non-executive 
Directors for their services is £0.45 million 
per annum. This will accommodate the 
appointment of additional Non-executive 
Directors to strengthen the balance of

Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
How the policy shapes actual Executive Directors’ pay
Our remuneration policy results in a significant portion of the Executive Directors’ pay being dependent on performance. 
The charts below demonstrate this, showing how their 2018 pay will vary based on different levels of performance 
(with increases in share price and dividend reinvestment ignored for these purposes):
• ‘Minimum performance’ – this assumes that performance is such that no annual bonus is warranted (due to no profit 
being generated in a particular year) and no PSP awards vest (due to the minimum performance threshold not being 
reached). Therefore, Executive Directors only receive their fixed pay (salary, benefits and pension)
• ‘On target performance’ – this assumes a ‘target’ level of performance, resulting in threshold vesting of PSP awards 
(20% of the proposed 2018 award level). As the annual bonus is based on a profit pool and, therefore, has no prescribed 
‘on target’ opportunity, to reflect the approach adopted previously we have valued the bonus based on 
the actual award under the plan for the prior year. Fixed pay remains unchanged.
• ‘Maximum performance’ – this assumes a very strong level of performance, resulting in full vesting of PSP awards at the 
proposed 2018 level and a maximum bonus payout of 100% of salary. Fixed pay also remains unchanged.

Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and subject to the limits/
other provisions set out in the policy table above. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, 
in a limited number of respects, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans. These discretions include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
• The selection of participants
• The timing of grant of an award/bonus opportunity
• The size of an award/bonus opportunity (subject to the overall plan limits set out in the policy table)
• The setting of PSP and bonus performance targets and the determination of performance against such targets and 
resultant vesting/bonus pay-outs
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plans and the appropriate treatment chosen 
(as summarised in the table on page 73)
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (for example, rights issues, corporate restructuring events and 
special dividends).
Under the rules of both the PSP and annual bonus plan and reflecting general market practice, the Committee retains the 
ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures if events occur (for example, material acquisition, share issue and/
or divestment of a Group business) which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the 
amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially more or less difficult 
to satisfy. Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual report on remuneration and 
may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The Directors’ service contracts
Executive Directors
Paul Abberley, Ben Money-Coutts and Gary Teper have service contracts containing a notice period of six months and a 
payment in lieu of notice clause limited to base salary only. There are no other special provisions in these contracts relating 
to compensation for loss of office nor are there any clauses in contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a 
change of control.
In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Committee will pay due regard to (i) best 
practice (ii) the circumstances surrounding the termination and (iii) the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate his/her loss, 
while also adhering to the relevant contractual terms.
All Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election. Executive Directors may take on external appointments, subject to 
prior approval by the Board. The fees from such appointments (where relevant) are retained by the Director concerned.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but instead have detailed job descriptions covering each aspect 
of their role (for example, Committee Chairmanships or specific roles or duties) and Letters of Appointment for an initial 
three-year term, subject to annual re-election by the Company’s shareholders. Either party can terminate the Letter of 
Appointment on giving three months’ written notice. There are no special provisions in the Letters of Appointment for 
compensation in the event of loss of office. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 72
Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the relevant 
report going forward as required by Regulations.
Travel and hospitality
While the Remuneration Committee does not consider these form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, we have 
been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) and business travel for Directors 
(and occasionally their families) may technically come within the applicable rules, and so the Committee expressly reserves 
the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
Our approach to remuneration on recruitment
The Group’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment 
and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets required to deliver 
our strategic aims.
The following represents guidelines considered reasonable by the Committee in relation to securing an appropriate 
candidate whose appointment would be in shareholders’ best interests:
• In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be 
to look to the general policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table on page 66 and structure a package in 
accordance with that policy
• Base salaries will be set based on the individual’s role and experience, with consideration given to internal relativities
• Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other employees at the similar level. In the case of new Executive 
Directors, individuals will be given a choice of either participation in a defined contribution pension or a cash allowance 
in lieu of pension
• Ignoring any special recruitment buy-out arrangements which may prove to be necessary, the annual bonus or long-term 
incentive arrangements will operate (including the maximum award levels) as detailed in the policy table in relation to any 
newly appointed Director
• For an internal appointment, any variable pay element or arrangement that exists in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate. For external and internal 
appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers 
appropriate and/or make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms
• A new Executive Director will not, save in exceptional circumstances, be offered a service contract with a notice period in 
excess of one year
• Where it is necessary to make a special recruitment-related buy-out award to an external candidate, the Company will 
not pay more than is, in the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver 
any such buy-out awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure as outlined in the policy table. It may, 
however, be necessary in some cases to make such special buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the 
existing incentive plans in order to secure a candidate, which may require reliance upon Listing Rule 9.4.2. All such special 
buy-out awards will be appropriately disclosed and will take account of all relevant factors. For example, the commercial 
value of the buy-out award will reflect the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer, with the 
performance conditions and the potential timing of vesting also taken into account
• For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amounts for incentive pay as stated in the policy will not apply to special 
buy-out awards. The Committee has not placed a maximum limit on any such buy-out awards as it is not considered 
to be in shareholders’ interests to set any expectations for prospective candidates regarding such awards. However, 
as stated above, the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer will be reflected in the 
quantum of such award. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 73

Our policy on Executive Directors leaving Charles Stanley
In practice, the facts surrounding any termination do not always fit neatly into defined categories for ‘good’ or ‘bad’ leavers. 
Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable treatment on a termination having regard to all of 
the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice 
periods on a termination and any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to 
it under the terms of any incentive plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised below.
Incentives Good leaver Bad leaver Exceptional events
Definitions
If a leaver is deemed to be a 
‘good leaver’, such as leaving 
through redundancy, serious ill 
health or death or otherwise at 
the discretion of the Committee.
If a leaver is deemed to be a 
‘bad leaver’, typically voluntary 
resignation or leaving for 
disciplinary reasons.
Such as a change in control.
Annual bonus
Prorated bonus, with any 
deferred shares vesting.
No awards made, with deferred 
shares lapsing (unless the 
Committee determines 
otherwise).
Prorated bonus, with any 
deferred shares vesting.
PSP

subject to the application of the 
performance conditions at the

of post-cessation obligations.
All awards will normally lapse. Will receive a prorated award 
subject to the application of the

discretion to disapply prorating.
 
The Group has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential 
legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice on termination of an Executive Director’s employment, 
the Group may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of 
a negotiated settlement. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. Should 
it become necessary to make additional payments in respect of such professional fees that were not ascertained at the 
time of reporting, the Company may do so up to a level of a further £10,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does 
not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 74

The Remuneration Committee’s main responsibilities during the year
The Committee is a Joint Committee reporting to the Boards of both Charles Stanley Group PLC and Charles Stanley & Co. 
Limited. The Committee comprises three independent Non-executive Directors and is governed by formal terms of reference, 
which are reviewed and agreed annually by the Board. The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Group’s website. During 2017 the Committee’s main responsibilities were to:
• Monitor the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors
• Monitor Executive Directors’ performance and to recommend PSP awards based on this performance to the Board
• Determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy and the approval of all elements of pay for the 
Chairman of the Board and the other Executive Directors
• Be responsible for the Charles Stanley Group remuneration policy as documented and proposed by the 
Executive Committee 
• Prepare this Directors’ remuneration report.
The Committee meets formally twice a year but more frequently if required. During 2017, five Committee meetings 
were held and details on attendance at meetings are set out in the Corporate governance report on page 53. None of 
the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising 
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations 
to both Boards. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own specific remuneration.
How the Remuneration Committee sought advice
The Committee received independent remuneration advice during the year from its appointed advisers, FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP (FIT). FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for such consultants) 
and adheres to its code of conduct. FIT provided no other services to the Group and accordingly the Committee was 
satisfied that the advice provided by FIT was objective and independent. FIT’s fees in respect of 2017 were £19,750 
(2016: £13,200). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided. 
The Committee also considered data provided by recognised benchmarking specialists, Compeer and McLagan; 
and consulted with PwC as part of the Group’s governance review and with Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley 
(save in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration) and the Group’s HR function. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 75

The table below shows the total remuneration figure for Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley over the same eight-year 
period. The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus paid in each of these years. The new Regulations require 
this table to state the proportion of annual bonus paid and long-term incentive vesting in each relevant year as a percentage 
of the maximum available. However, the Group did not operate with a maximum bonus opportunity until 2015.
Consequently, we have simply included the total remuneration in each of the relevant years, while also setting out details 
of the bonus each actually received based on performance in these years.

These amounts are calculated using the same methodology as that used to produce the single figure table. This includes a

the variance across the six-year period for Sir David Howard.

In accordance with the new regulations, we must disclose the percentage change in the certain elements of the Chief

Benefits
An explanation of the benefits received by the Executive Directors can be found in the policy table on pages 66 to 67. 
In summary, the benefits received by Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, private medical cover and a mobile 
and/or iPad.
For the Non-executive Directors amounts reported relate to expenses such as travel and accommodation expenditure 
incurred on Group business. While these payments are the reimbursement of expenses and not benefits per se, they are 
included as being a payment which is subject to tax. Sir David Howard also received benefits relating to contributions 
towards the provision of a car for business travel. This arrangement came to an end as of 31 March 2017.
Annual bonus outcomes for 2017
The return to profit has resulted in bonuses being awarded to the Executive Directors for the 2017 period. When assessing 
the performance for the year the Remuneration Committee determined that the overall size of the bonus pool available for 
distribution to the Executive Directors to be approximately 5% of adjusted PBT (compared with a maximum permitted under 
the policy of 6%).
50% of this bonus pool was allocated across all the Executive Directors on an equal basis, with the remaining 50% of 
the bonus pool being allocated to each Executive Director based upon their performance against pre-set individual 
performance objectives. Further information regarding these targets are specified in the ‘Implementation of policy’ 
part of the table on page 67.
The resulting bonus awards are Paul Abberley £180,000, Ben Money-Coutts £120,000, Gary Teper £120,000 and 
Michael Lilwall £35,000. These awards will be paid in cash apart from £30,000 payable to Paul Abberley, £7,500 
to Ben Money-Coutts and £5,000 to Gary Teper that will be deferred into shares for a period of three years.
No annual bonuses were paid to Executive Directors in 2016 under the main plan as there was no reported profit.
Pensions
The current Executive Directors participate in money purchase arrangements. Details of the levels of pension arrangements 
can be found in the summary policy table on page 66.
Sir David Howard is a member of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme which provides for a pension equal to 1/60th 
of final salary (as defined) for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40/60ths. The scheme has a normal 
retirement age of 65.
Sir David has now passed the age of 65 but is not drawing a pension from it. Instead his pension entitlement is 
accumulating by a figure determined according to advice and calculations provided by the scheme’s actuaries. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 80

a)  The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would have been paid annually on retirement based upon 
pensionable service to the end of the financial year (or date of leaving the pension scheme if earlier), excluding any 
future statutory entitlement to increases prior to retirement which would be due after the financial year-end.
b)  Sir David Howard is over his normal retirement date. The increase in his accrued pension entitlement over the period is 
due to the application of late retirement factors. The reduced cash equivalent transfer value of his deferred pension 
benefits as at 31 March 2017 was due to the application of the Trustees’ current transfer value assumption setting process 
(which was updated in September 2016) to the financial market conditions at the year-end.
Share awards
Save As You Earn
In 2017, the Company operated three Save As You Earn schemes, which were open to all employees and Executive Directors 
once they met the necessary service requirements. Options were offered at a discount of 15% to the average of the 
mid-market closing price for the three days prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing 
three years after the saving contract commencement date. In common with similar schemes, the exercise of options under 
this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions.

The remaining awards are all unvested. During the year ended 31 March 2017, the highest mid-market price of the 
Company’s shares was 328.0p (on 22 September 2016) and the lowest mid-market price was 251.38p (on 4 November 2016).

Directors’ interests
As explained in the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Executive Directors are subject to Share Ownership Guidelines and 
they are required to retain 50% of shares (net of tax) which vest under the PSP or bonus deferral arrangement until such 
time as they hold shares worth 100% of salary. There is no requirement for Non-executive Directors to hold shares in the 
Company. The shareholdings of each Director, together with whether they would have achieved the guideline requirements 
by 31 March 2017 (only including shares beneficially owned, that is excluding unvested share awards and shares ‘otherwise 
held’), are as follows:

Payments to former Directors
As disclosed in last year’s Directors’ remuneration report, Anthony Scott resigned as a Director on 18 April 2016 and 
continued in the Company’s employment until 15 October 2016.
The following approach was adopted in relation to Anthony Scott’s departure:
• Anthony received salary, pension and benefits totalling £174,680 until his departure date of 15 October 2016, at which point 
all such payments ceased
• Anthony also received the last payment under a legacy profit sharing arrangement relating to his previous role as an 
active investment manager prior to joining the Board
• Anthony has not received a bonus under the 2017 Annual Bonus 
• Anthony was provided with outplacement support to the value of £5,600
• The PSP awards held by Anthony will vest on a prorated basis on the normal vesting dates based on performance against 
the EPS and margin targets.
Mike Lilwall decided to step down from the Board on 23 November 2016. He remains an employee of the Group and received 
no compensation for loss of office. However, as per the treatment agreed for Executive Directors who are deemed good

Committee activities over the past year
Over the course of the year, the Committee has undertaken 
a number of key activities:
• Reviewed and approved risk and compliance-related policies
• Reviewed and approved the risk framework including the 
risk governance structure
• Reviewed and approved the annual Risk and 
Compliance plans
• Reviewed the ICAAP for recommendation to the CSC 
and CSG Boards
• Considered the risks arising from the Strategic Plan and 
associated corporate objectives and the processes in 
place to manage them
• Received updates on a number of matters including:
 – the Group’s cyber security strategy
 – the CASS monitoring programme
 – the activities of the Enterprise Risk and 
Compliance Committees
 – the regulatory environment and actions taken 
to ensure the firm meets the requirements.
Risk management framework
The Group has undertaken a review of its risk framework 
to ensure a consistent and effective approach to risk 
management across the Group. The key components 
of the framework are outlined below and we will continue 
to strengthen the framework and embed it in the fabric of 
the organisation over the coming year.
Risk governance and culture
The arrangement of the Board and the Board committees 
has been considered as part of the governance review, 
mentioned earlier. This review has resulted in revisions to 
the Board and Committee arrangements, including the 
respective responsibilities of the various committees which 
oversee the different types of risks.
The Board committees are as follows:
• Executive Committee
• Audit Committee
• Nomination Committee
• Remuneration Committee
• Risk Committee.
The Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day 
running of the business and is supported by a number of 
control committees – the Enterprise Risk Committee, the 
Conduct & Culture Committee and the Product & Services 
Committee – which have contributed to continued 
enhancements to the Group’s risk oversight arrangements.
Charles Stanley has implemented a ‘three lines of defence’ 
model to manage risk and provide assurance to 
Management and the Board with regards to the 
effectiveness of the Group’s control environment: 
• Level 1 – Business line Management and staff are 
responsible for the identification, ownership and 
management of risk on a day-to-day basis
• Level 2 – The Risk function is responsible for the 
implementation and oversight of the framework, 
reporting to the Board and Group-level Committees, 
and for overseeing and challenging the management 
of risk. The Compliance function is responsible for the 
oversight of regulatory compliance
• Level 3 – Internal Audit provides independent assurance 
that risks are effectively managed and that there is 
appropriate oversight. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 88
Governance / Risk Committee report
Risk strategy and business plans
The Group Chief Risk Officer provides input in the setting 
and ongoing review of the Group’s strategy and business 
plan. This includes reporting on the key risks and threats 
to the strategy and plan as well as the impact on the Group 
risk profile and appetite.
Future plans to improve the risk and control arrangements 
and to embed them across the business are defined in the 
Risk and Compliance annual plans which are approved by 
the Risk Committee. 
Risk appetite
The Risk Appetite Statement, which is reviewed at least 
annually by the Board, sets out the Group’s attitude to risk 
and the ranges and limits of acceptable risk-taking based 
on the Group’s strategy and objectives. 
Risk policies
The risk policies define the Group’s approach to monitoring 
and controlling risk, so as to ensure it is only exposed to risks 
that are within the Board’s risk appetite. There are two 
layers to the risk policies:
• The Group Risk Policy – sets out the overarching policy in 
relation to risk management and the risk governance 
framework for the Group
• Group Level Risk Policies – set out the risk management 
strategy and framework for the management and 
oversight of specific risk types.
Risk identification and assessment
All staff are responsible for identifying and assessing the 
risks in their respective areas. There are a number of tools 
available to aid them in this task including risk event 
reporting, deep dive business reviews and scenario 
workshops, as well as raising issues with the Risk team. 
Risk management, monitoring and reporting
The business and support functions are responsible for 
managing the risks within their areas as well as developing 
management information to monitor their exposure to 
those risks.
The Risk function consolidates management information 
received from across the Group into reports for the 
Enterprise Risk Committee, the Board Risk Committee 
and the Charles Stanley Group Board. 
Audit findings concerning the risk arrangements are 
reviewed regularly at the Enterprise Risk Committee 
which leads to continuous improvements to the Group’s 
control environment.
Risk and capital management
The approach to calculating a risk-based capital requirement 
for the different types of risks that the Group may be exposed 
to is defined within the Group’s ICAAP.
The financial year ended 31 March 2017 has seen considerable 
progress in putting in place the building blocks for the 
continued strength of the Charles Stanley risk and governance 
arrangements. In the upcoming financial year, these will 
continue to be developed in line with our annual risk 
strategy and plan.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and Regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under the law the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and appropriate
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and Regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate 
governance report that comply with that law and 
those Regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and responsibilities 
are listed in the Corporate governance report, confirm that, 
to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole
• The annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy
• The Strategic report and financial statements include 
a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Charles Stanley 
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2017 set out on 
pages 99 to 154. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU)
• the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. 
Overview
Materiality: 
Group financial statements 
as a whole
£0.65m (2016: £0.7m)
0.5% (2016: 0.5%) of gross 
Group revenue

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: 
 
The risk Our response
Recoverability of goodwill
£14.1 million (2016: £16.0 million)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), 
page 108 (accounting policy) and pages 
127 to 128 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation:
The consolidated statement of financial 
position includes a significant goodwill 
balance. The carrying amount of goodwill 
could be materially misstated if inappropriate 
judgements and estimates were used by 
the Directors in calculating the recoverable 
amount for each CGU as part of their 
impairment assessment. The Charles 
Stanley Direct CGU represents the most 
significant singular element of the 
goodwill balance, while goodwill 
associated with different investment 
management teams accounts for the 
majority of the remaining balance.
The Directors have considered the carrying 
amount of the goodwill of £5.2 million 
allocated to the Charles Stanley Direct CGU 
by calculating fair value less costs to sell 
based on the recent market transactions 
involving similar businesses and by 
applying industry-specific valuation 
techniques. Charles Stanley Direct is a 
young business and the inputs to the 
valuation model are inherently judgemental. 
Accordingly, there is an increased risk that 
there could be a material difference 
between the goodwill carrying value 
and the fair value. 
Our procedures included: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: 
Comparing the Group’s assumptions 
to externally-derived data in relation 
to key inputs such as details of market 
transactions and ratios of FuM
• Sensitivity analysis: Performing stress 
testing on the assumptions noted above
• Comparing valuations (Charles 
Stanley Direct): Comparing the sum 
of the discounted cash flows to the fair 
value less costs to sell to assess the 
reasonableness of the carrying amount 
of the goodwill
• Assessing transparency: Assessing 
whether the Group’s disclosures about 
the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill.
Valuation of actuarial liability 
£32.2 million (2016: £36.7 million)
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee report), 
page 107 (accounting policy) and pages 121 
to 125 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate:
Significant estimates are made in 
determining the Group’s defined benefit 
scheme actuarial valuation, and changes 
in assumptions and estimates used to 
value the Group’s actuarial liability can 
have a significant effect on the results 
and financial position of the Group. 
Any changes in the obligation of the 
scheme to its members may also materially 
impact the amount of the defined benefit 
scheme liability, and therefore the net deficit 
of the scheme to be recognised on the Group 
balance sheet.
Our procedures included: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: 
Challenging, with the support 
of our own actuarial specialists, 
the key assumptions applied, 
being the discount rate, inflation 
rate and mortality/life expectancy
• Assessing transparency: Considering 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of the sensitivity of the deficit 
to these assumptions.
Governance /  Independent auditor’s report to the members of Charles Stanley Group PLC only Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 95
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
In the prior year we included within our audit report that 
we performed procedures over the accrual of transition 
bonuses which formed part of the Group’s remuneration 
arrangements with its front office investment management 
professionals. As part of a transition to revised remuneration 
and fee-sharing arrangements it had been agreed with 
certain investment professionals that fee-sharing 
arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2016 would 
be amended. The calculation of this one-off transitional 
arrangement could have had a significant effect on the 
results and financial position of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2016. However, as this risk was concerned 
about the calculation of a one-off transitional arrangement 
only for that year, it is not one of the risks that had the greatest 
effect on our audit for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £650,000 (2016: £700,000) determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group revenue of which 
it represents approximately 0.5% (2016: 0.5%). As the 
Group has returned to a profit position, we retained 
our planning materiality at year-end to take account 
of the overall Group results. 
We consider Group revenue to be a more appropriate 
benchmark as the Group incurred losses in the prior year 
and revenue is the principal consideration of members 
of the Company in assessing the financial performance 
of the Group. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £32,500 
(2016: £35,000) in addition to other audit misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group 
as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. 
The audit was performed using the materiality levels set 
out above, covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group 
profit before taxation and total Group assets, and was 
all performed at the Group’s head office in London.

4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006
• the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in 
those reports
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006
• in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement has 
been prepared in accordance with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3, 7.2.5, 
7.2.6 and 7.2.7 of the Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
5.  We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the Directors’ statement of longer-term viability on 
page 34 and 35, concerning the principal risks, 
their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Company’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 March 2020; or
• the disclosures in note 2.6 of the financial 
statements concerning the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting.
6.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been 
prepared by the Company.
Under the Listing rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 34 and 35, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability 
• the part of the Corporate governance statement on 
page 52 relating to the Group’s compliance with the 
11 provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2017
1. General information
Charles Stanley Group PLC (the Company) is the Parent Company of the Charles Stanley group of companies (the Group). 
The principal activities of the Group are set out in the Directors’ report.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. The Company is registered in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is 55 Bishopsgate, London, 
UK, EC2N 3AS.
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit and loss account is presented for the Parent Company. 
The notes and information for the Parent Company are presented on pages 146 to 153.
2.2 Functional and presentation currency
The Group and Parent Company financial statements are presented in GBP, which is the Group’s functional currency. 
All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.
2.3 Comparative figures
Certain comparative figures have been amended to reflect presentational changes in the current year financial statements. 
These changes have had no impact on prior year reported earnings or net assets.
2.4 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items, 
which are measured on an alternative basis at each reporting date:
Item Measurement basis
Freehold premises Revalued amount
Available-for-sale financial assets Fair value
Assets and liabilities held for sale Lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell
Non-derivative financial instruments held at 
fair value through profit or loss
Fair value
Liabilities for share-based payment arrangements Fair value
Net defined benefit asset or liability Fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation
2.5 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated 
from the date that control ceases. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 106
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of 
an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed 
at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
2.6 Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors assessed the going 
concern of the Group in light of its current trading performance. The Directors looked at the forecasts covering the 18-month 
period from 31 March 2017 to 30 September 2018 and applied stress tests for adverse scenarios, which were determined as 
part of the Group’s ICAAP. As a result it was determined that the Group has sufficient liquidity to cover all anticipated 
payments during that period. The Directors also considered the regulatory capital of the Group and determined that, 
based on the latest approved forecasts, the Group will have sufficient regulatory capital for the same 18-month period.
At the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2.7 Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into GBP using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.
2.8 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of the Parent Company.
Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-maker include items directly attributable to a segment 
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
2.9 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group, and which:
• Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations
• Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
2.10 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary course 
of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of VAT, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 107
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity, and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described 
below. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of 
transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
2.10.1 Commission
Commission income and expenses are recognised on a trade date basis.
2.10.2 Fees
Investment management, administration and corporate finance retainer fees are recognised evenly over the period in 
which the service is provided. Corporate finance success fees are recognised when earned.
2.10.3 Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
2.10.4 Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
2.11 Share-based payments
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based payments schemes under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the share options or share awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the grant date fair value of the share options or share awards granted:
• Including market performance conditions
• Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (such as profitability targets, 
sales growth targets or remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period)
• Including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (such as the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share options or share awards that are 
ultimately expected to vest.
The total employee expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share 
options or share awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact 
of any revision to original estimates in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the share options are exercised or share awards made, the Parent Company issues new ordinary shares. 
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium.
2.12 Employee benefits
2.12.1 Pension obligations
The Group operates two pension schemes – a defined benefit and a defined contribution scheme. The defined benefit 
scheme defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or 
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The defined contribution scheme is a pension plan under 
which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay employees the benefits relating to employee service 
in the current and prior periods. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 108
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The net charge to the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme mainly comprises the service cost and the 
net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability and is presented in operating expenses. The liability recognised in the 
statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA credit-rated corporate bonds that have terms 
of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit obligation arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
2.12.2 Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. Payments made in advance of services being provided are treated as prepayments.
2.13 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity. In this case the associated tax is 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the UK.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is not provided on temporary timing differences arising on goodwill as the temporary timing difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
2.14 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
2.15 Intangible assets
2.15.1 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is included under 
intangible assets and goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the end of each reporting period and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an 
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 109
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of 
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to 
operating segment.
2.15.2 Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer 
relationships acquired outside of a business combination are initially recognised at cost. The customer relationships have 
a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method over their useful lives, estimated at ten years.
2.15.3 Internally generated software
Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware or has been developed internally by the Group is 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are 
reliably measurable. Computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their 
useful lives (three years).
2.16 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold premises are measured at fair value, based on periodic valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent 
depreciation for buildings. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying 
amount of the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property, plant and 
equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and 
the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of a replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of freehold premises are credited to other reserves in shareholders’ 
equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against other reserves directly in equity; 
all other decreases are charged to the income statement.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or 
revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold and leasehold properties 3 to 50 years
Vehicles 3 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in 
the income statement.
When revalued assets are sold, any revaluation amounts included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
2.17 Financial instruments
The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables.
The Group classifies its non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial liabilities.
2.17.1 Non-derivative financial instruments – recognition and derecognition
The Group recognises loans and receivables on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities 
are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 110
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the associated contractual obligations are discharged, or expire.
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and presented on a net basis if the Group has a legally enforceable right of 
set-off and intends to settle them on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs if they are not classified 
as fair value through profit or loss. Financial instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially 
at fair value, with associated transaction costs being expensed immediately to the income statement.
2.17.2 Non-derivative financial assets – measurement
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in 
this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Assets in this category are classified 
as current assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the consolidated income statement in the period 
in which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of 
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or Management intends to 
dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
available-for-sale financial assets are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period 
in which they arise. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale financial assets is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as part of finance income. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which 
are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and 
cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the interest 
would be immaterial.
2.17.3 Non-derivative financial liabilities – measurement
Non-derivative financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
2.18 Impairment
2.18.1 Impairment of non-derivative financial assets
The Group assesses all financial assets for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period, except those 
held at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence 
that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future 
cash flows of the investment have been affected. The carrying value of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 111
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value 
of the security below its cost is considered objective evidence of impairment. 
When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period. If the impairment loss reduces in subsequent periods, 
impairment losses previously recognised in profit and loss are not reversed through profit and loss. Increases in fair value 
subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
2.18.2 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets, such as goodwill, are regarded as having an indefinite useful life when there is no foreseeable limit 
to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. These assets are not amortised 
and are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Assets with a determinable useful life are amortised over the useful 
life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (CGUs).
The Group determines a CGU’s recoverable amount initially by estimating fair value less costs to sell, based on recent public 
transactions for similar businesses. If the carrying amount relating to any CGU exceeds the fair value less costs to sell, value 
in use is also calculated using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of the CGU also exceeds the value in 
use, an impairment charge is recognised. Non-financial assets other than goodwill, which have previously suffered an 
impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
2.19 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from clients and other counterparties for services performed in the ordinary course of 
business. If collection is expected within one year they are classified as current assets. Receivables due after one year are 
presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
2.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held on call with banks.
2.21 Segregated funds
Segregated funds are held in trust by the Group on behalf of clients in accordance with the FCA’s Client Asset Rules. 
The corresponding liability to clients is not shown within the Group’s statement of financial position.
2.22 Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Parent Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Parent Company’s shareholders.
2.23 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• The Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event
• The obligation can be measured reliably
• It is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. 
Provisions are measured based on the estimated consideration required to settle the obligation at the date of the 
consolidated statement of financial position and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount 
receivable can be measured reliably. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 112
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
2.24 Trade payables
Trade payables consist of amounts payable to clients and other counterparties and obligations to pay suppliers for goods 
or services in the ordinary course of business. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one 
year. Payables due after one year are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.25 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Leases are classified as finance leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement date at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included as a liability in the 
statement of financial position. Property, plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is depreciated over the 
shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
2.26 Investments in subsidiaries
In the Parent Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
2.27 Application of new and revised IFRSs and changes in accounting policy
The Group has consistently followed the same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation in these 
consolidated financial statements as applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2016.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 April 2017. The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements but are expected to have 
an impact when they become effective. The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting period in which they 
become effective.
2.27.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. It includes new guidance on the classification, 
measurement and impairment of financial instruments. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2018. 
2.27.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 outlines a single comprehensive model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes existing 
revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty 
Programmes. IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. 
2.27.3 IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases. It eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. Any leases 
with more than 12 months’ term are to be recognised as a lease asset in the Statement of Financial Position and the related 
future lease obligations shown as a liability. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. 
At the date of publication of these financial statements, the Directors were still assessing the impact of each of these new 
standards on the Group. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 113
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
3. Use of judgements and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions to determine the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on the Group’s historical experience and other relevant factors. Actual results may differ from 
the estimates applied.
Estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following critical judgements have been made by the Directors in applying the Group’s accounting policies:
3.1.1 Intangible assets and goodwill
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Parent Company and the Group assess goodwill and client relationships 
based on the recoverable amount of individual units making up the relevant intangible asset, in accordance with the 
accounting policy set out in note 2. The recoverable amount is calculated based on assumptions which are set out in 
more detail in note 14.
Impairment charges in the year were allocated fully to goodwill and included in impairment of intangible assets and 
investments in the consolidated income statement. See note 14 for further details on the impairment charge.
It was concluded that no other impairments to the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets are required.
3.1.2 Retirement benefit obligations 
In consultation with an independent actuary, the Parent Company and the Group make estimates about a number 
of long-term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit of its defined benefit pension scheme. 
These long-term forecasts and estimates are highly judgemental and subject to the risk that actual events may be 
significantly different from those forecast.
The valuation performed as at 31 March 2017 resulted in an increase in the actuarial deficit of £0.4 million which has been 
reflected in these financial statements.
3.1.3 Available-for-sale assets
Unlisted available-for-sale financial assets include an investment in Euroclear PLC. The Directors have estimated the fair 
value of this investment based on a recent share buyback process undertaken by Euroclear PLC in which the Group sold 
part of its shareholding. 
During the year, the value of the investment in Runpath Group Limited was reviewed based on the partial sale of the 
Group’s holding. 
Further information on the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets is included in note 17. No new information has become 
available that would require a change in the valuation of any further unlisted investments.

10. Share-based payment arrangements
10.1 Description of share-based payment arrangements
The Group had the following share-based payment arrangements during the year:
Save As You Earn (equity-settled)
The Save As You Earn scheme is open to all employees. Options are granted under the scheme at a 15% discount to the 
mid-market closing price for the three days preceding the grant date and have a three-year vesting period. The options 
are exercisable for a period of six months after vesting and are not subject to any performance conditions.
Performance Share Plan (equity-settled)
The Performance Share Plan is only open to Executive Directors and senior managers. Options are awarded annually under 
the plan and vest over a period of three years based on specific performance targets. The contractual life of the options is 
five years.
Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan is open to all employees, enabling them to purchase shares in the Parent Company out of their 
pre-tax salary. 
Further information on the Group’s equity-settled share-based arrangements, including details on individual limits and 
vesting conditions, can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 120
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
10. Share-based payment arrangements (continued)
10.2 Measurement of fair values
The fair value of the options issued under equity-settled share-based payment arrangements is calculated using the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the options are not 
taken into account in measuring fair value. Expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility.
During the year, the inputs used in the measurement of fair values at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payment 
schemes were as follows:
2017 2016
Share price at grant date £2.89 £3.30
Exercise price £2.40 £2.87
Expected volatility 35.75% 22.19%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Expected dividend yield 1.73% 1.51%
Risk-free interest rate 0.24% 0.57%

average contractual life of 3.1 years (2016: 3.4 years).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in 2017 was £3.12 (2016: £3.09).

11.1 Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of 
the Group in independently-administered funds.
11.2 Defined benefit scheme
The Group also sponsors the Charles Stanley & Co. Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme (the Plan), which is a funded defined 
benefit arrangement. This is a separate, trustee-administered fund holding the Plan assets to meet long-term pension 
liabilities of its scheme members.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 13 May 2014 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements of the 
Pensions Act 2004. The next full actuarial valuation as at 13 May 2017 is currently being undertaken. This is due to be 
completed in early 2018 and will be reflected in the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2018. 
The funding of the Plan is agreed between the Group and the trustees in line with those requirements. There is a particular 
requirement to calculate the pension surplus/deficit using prudence, as opposed to best estimate actuarial assumptions.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuation as at 13 May 2014, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, 
has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2017. Apart from a slight change in the mortality assumptions used, 
the valuation methodology adopted for this year’s disclosures are the same as those used in the prior year.

The Plan’s assets include Charles Stanley Group shares amounting to £0.9 million (2016: £0.7 million). The Plan does not own 
any other direct investments in Charles Stanley Group or any property occupied by, or other assets used by Charles Stanley 
Group. Alternatives include hedge funds, infrastructure and renewable energy investments. All of the scheme assets have a 
quoted market price in an active market with the exception of the trustees’ bank account balance.
It is the policy of the trustees and the Group to review the investment strategy at the time of each funding valuation. 
The trustees’ investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the 
planned investment strategy are documented in the Plan’s Statement of Investment Principles. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 124
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
11. Employee benefits (continued)
During the second half of the year, the Plan’s Trustees changed the investment management strategy of the scheme’s 
assets. The long-term investment objective is now to achieve self-sufficiency which means achieving a funding level 
whereby scheme assets grow to the same level as their liabilities. A five stage de-risking flight plan has been adopted to 
reduce risk gradually over life of the Plan as the scheme nears its objective. Stage 1 of the flight plan, which has involved 
restructuring the underlying portfolio to increase asset class diversification and building an initial liability hedge of 70% 
of assets, is substantially complete.

The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 March 2017 are 100% (2016: 85%) of the standard tables S2PxA, Year of Birth, no age 
rating for males and females, projected using CMI_2015 converging to 1.00% p.a. These imply the following life expectancies:

Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% p.a. Increase by 0.6%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year Increase by 3.5% Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 125
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
11. Employee benefits (continued)
The sensitivities shown are approximate. Each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation sensitivity includes 
the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation, pension increases and salary growth. The average duration of 
the defined benefit obligation at the period ended 31 March 2017 is 18 years.
The Plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity 
risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to 
Plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future 
income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plan’s bond holdings, and in 
qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are 
in place to protect the Plan against extreme inflation.
The best estimate of contributions to be paid by the Group to the Plan for the year commencing 1 April 2017 is £0.4 million 
(2016: £0.4 million).
11.3 Employee benefit expenses
The average number of persons employed (including Directors) during the year was 810 (2016: 893).

During the prior year, the Board agreed revised interim remuneration arrangements with the Group’s investment managers 
in relation to their variable compensation. Part of the agreement involved changing the bonus calculation to be based on 
earned revenue rather than billed revenue. This resulted in the Group bringing forward the recognition of bonuses on revenues 
that were accrued but not yet billed as at 31 March 2016. A one-off additional amount of £1.4 million was included within 
2016 wages and salaries from continuing operations in the above table. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 126

In addition to amounts charged to the income statement, deferred tax of £0.2 million relating to the revaluation of 
available-for-sale financial assets has been charged directly to equity (2016: £0.1 million credit). 
Current tax of £0.1 million has been credited directly to equity (2016: £nil) and deferred tax of £0.02 million has also been 
credited directly to equity (2016: £0.8 million charge) in respect of the defined benefit plan.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on the UK corporation tax rate of 17%, as this was 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax charge for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% (2016: 20%). The differences

14.1 Goodwill
The recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is determined initially by calculating the CGU’s fair value less costs 
to sell. If this is lower than the carrying amount or is not determinable, a value in use calculation is also prepared. 
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated largely based on a percentage of FuMA. Where this approach is not appropriate, 
a turnover multiple is used.
The rates used in the fair value less costs to sell calculations are those implied by recent transactions in the market or, 
where appropriate, based on publicly available information for similar quoted businesses. When calculating the fair value 
less costs to sell, key assumptions are stress tested to determine whether the calculations are sensitive to reasonable 
potential changes in these assumptions.
At 31 March 2017, fair value less costs to sell was deemed to be higher than carrying value for each CGU. Therefore, no value 
in use calculations have been prepared.
14.1.1 Investment Management Services
The recoverable amount of goodwill related to Investment Management Services was assessed using fair value less 
costs to sell for the year ended 31 March 2017. The fair value was determined based on a percentage of FuMA. During the 
year, the Group recognised an impairment charge of £0.3 million in respect of goodwill attributable to a regional office 
which provided investment management services. In addition, goodwill of £1.3 million in respect of EBS Management PLC 
was transferred to assets held for sale at the reporting date. Consequently, the goodwill balance carried forward was 
£8.8 million. 
14.1.2 Financial Planning
The recoverable amount of goodwill relating to Financial Planning was assessed using fair value less costs to sell for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. The brought forward balance of £0.3 million was fully impaired during the year as the business 
activities to which it related are no longer undertaken.
14.1.3 Charles Stanley Direct
The recoverable amount of goodwill relating to Charles Stanley Direct was assessed using fair value less costs to sell for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. The recoverable amount was determined to be higher than the carrying amount of the CGU and 
therefore the goodwill carrying value is adequately supported. 
14.2 Customer relationships
Purchases of customer relationships relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the introduction 
of customer relationships.

Freehold premises is carried at revalued amount. The most recent valuations of freehold premises were carried out in 
March 2014 by independent chartered surveyors. If freehold premises had been carried under the cost model, its carrying 
value would have been £4.6 million (2016: £4.7 million). 
During the year, the Group moved its London-based staff from multiple offices to new leasehold premises at 55 Bishopsgate. 
The Group surrendered the remaining lease on one of its former long leasehold premises to the building’s landlord for 
£5.6 million. The carrying value of the leasehold premises was negligible, therefore a gain of £5.6 million on the lease 
disposal has been recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Assets with a carrying value of £2.2 million were disposed of in the year due to the Group’s head office relocation. 
There were no disposal proceeds in respect of these assets, therefore a loss on disposal of £2.2 million has been 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Included in the short leasehold additions for the year is an amount of £1.0 million in respect of a dilapidations obligation 
arising under the lease at 55 Bishopsgate, which has been capitalised as part of the fit out costs in accordance with IAS 16. 
In the half year results to 30 September 2016, these dilapidation costs had been expensed to the income statement.
The cost and accumulated depreciation of property, plant and equipment in the above table includes £13.2 million 
(2016: £11.1 million) in respect of fully depreciated assets of which are still in use. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 130

reduced from 19% in April 2017 to 17% in April 2020. Deferred tax balances have therefore been calculated based on these 
reduced rates where timing differences are forecast to unwind in future years. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 132

The fair value of listed investments is determined by reference to quoted prices on active markets. 
Listed investments include a £2.0 million (2016: £2.0 million) holding in gilts which is pledged to the Group’s clearing house. 
Unlisted investments include the Group’s holding of 6,030 shares in Euroclear PLC. The board of Euroclear PLC announced 
a share buyback to its shareholders on 8 March 2017, to be carried out by way of a reverse auction in April 2017. The Group 
submitted an offer deed on 5 April 2017 to sell its entire holding at €774 per share. On 28 April 2017, the Board were notified 
that the Group’s tender had been partially successful, with a total of 3,672 shares to be bought back by Euroclear PLC. 
As such, the full holding was revalued to €774 per share as at 31 March 2017 and translated into GBP at the rate of exchange 
on the balance sheet date. The value of the shares to be sold after the balance sheet date has been presented within 
current assets and the value of the unsold shares has been presented in non-current assets.
Also within unlisted investments is the Group’s investment in a technology company called Runpath Group Limited. 
The initial investment was £1.0 million (£0.5 million in 119,154 ordinary shares and £0.5 million of convertible loan notes). 
As at 31 March 2016, the Group held the equity at £nil and the loan notes at £0.3 million. During the year, the Group 
converted the loans into equity and subsequently disposed of 25% of its enlarged holding, recognising a gain of £0.4 million. 
The remainder of the equity investment is carried at fair value as determined by the Directors. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 133

Included within trade and other receivables is the deferred consideration balance receivable by the Group in relation to the 
sale of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited (CSFS) to CS Financial Solutions Holdings Limited on 1 April 2016, net of 
provision for impairment. The deferred consideration of £0.5 million LIBOR plus 2% Secured B Loan Notes 2019 is repayable 
in three equal instalments on each anniversary following the sale. At 31 March 2017, the balance of the loan receivable had 
been impaired in full as Management believes that its recoverability is doubtful. A breakdown of the deferred consideration

The rights and obligations attached to the Parent Company’s ordinary shares are set out in the Directors’ report (page 89).
During the year 12,000 ordinary shares were issued fully paid for cash at an average price of £2.56 per share following the 
exercise of options by employees. These shares had a nominal value of £3,000 and a total consideration was £30,000.
21.2 Merger relief reserve
The merger relief reserve is used where more than 90% of the share capital in a subsidiary is acquired and the consideration 
includes the issue of new shares by the Group, thereby attracting merger relief under Section 612 of Companies Act 2006. 
The merger relief reserve arose on a placing of the Group’s shares and forms part of distributable reserves.

The Group’s exposure to currency and liquidity risk related to trade and other payables is disclosed in note 24.
24. Fair values and risk management
Through its normal operations the Group is exposed to a number of risks. The most significant financial instrument risks are 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Information is presented below regarding the exposure to each of these risks and 
the procedures for measuring and managing them.
24.1 Market risk
This is the risk that the Group’s income or value of its financial instruments are impacted by fluctuations in market prices, 
such as equity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group does not undertake any proprietary trading other than in respect of its own equity holdings and positions arising 
from incidental dealing errors.
All position limits are monitored daily in accordance with policies determined by the Board.
The Group has small currency exposures. Positions are held in a variety of currencies, principally the US dollar, to support 
clients’ dealing activities.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 136
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
24. Fair values and risk management (continued)
24.1.1 Equity risk
The Group is exposed to equity market risk through its own equity holdings. These comprise:
i) available-for-sale financial investments
ii) held for trading assets and liabilities.
Equity price movements in respect of the Group’s client holdings have a direct impact on investment management fees received.
The Group has performed sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of a 10% increase or decrease in underlying equity prices. 
The results shown below are indicative of the impact at the year-end.
24.1.1.1 Available-for-sale investments
Note 17 summarises the available-for-sale investments held at the year-end date, and the disposals and fair value 
movements made in the year.
56% of the Group’s available-for-sale investments are unlisted. A 10% increase or decrease in the Group’s investments would 
have an impact on reserves of £0.8 million (2016: £0.7 million).
24.1.1.2 Held for trading assets and liabilities
The Group’s exposure to market risk on its held for trading positions is monitored daily and reported to the appropriate 
Directors and senior managers. Positions are monitored against limits determined by the Risk Committee. Any breaches 
of the limits are notified immediately to the Head of Compliance.
A 10% increase or decrease in equity prices of trading assets and liabilities would increase/reduce profit in the consolidated 
income statement by £7,000 (2016: £7,000).
24.1.1.3 Investment Management Services fees
A 10% increase or decrease in equity prices would increase/reduce investment management fees in the consolidated income 
statement by £4.7 million (2016: £4.0 million).
24.1.2 Foreign exchange risk
The table below summarises the Group’s foreign currency exposure arising from unmatched monetary assets or liabilities 
not denominated in the Group’s functional currency: 
Net assets
2017
£000
2016
£000
Euros – 190
US dollars 29 619
Other currencies 30 31
59 840
The Group’s activities are denominated primarily in GBP and it does not enter into forward exchange contracts for hedging 
anticipated transactions. The risk of adverse currency movements for settlement of non-GBP trades on behalf of clients is 
not borne by the Group. The Group is exposed to currency risk for settlement of non-GBP trade suppliers and miscellaneous 
income streams. At 31 March 2017 these totalled £16,000 (2016: £22,000).
24.1.3 Interest rate risk
The Group holds interest-bearing assets, principally cash and cash deposits, available-for-sale financial assets and loan 
notes accruing interest at fixed rates. The Group views such exposure to interest rate fluctuations as immaterial. If interest 
rates had been 200 basis points higher, profit for the year would have been £1.2 million higher (2016: £1.1 million). If interest 
rates had been 200 basis points lower, profit for the year would have been £0.2 million lower (2016: £0.1 million). Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 137
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
24. Fair values and risk management (continued)
24.2 Credit risk
This represents the risk of loss through default by a counterparty. The most significant risk to the Group is either a client or 
market counterparty failing to settle a trade. Given the wide range of retail clients of the Group it is not considered that a 
material default by connected counterparties would arise. Other credit risks, such as free delivery of stock or cash, are not 
deemed to be significant as the Group has an effective credit control department to recover any monies or stock owed 
through default.
The Group monitors both the collateral requirements of individual client accounts, as well as any debit balances that occur 
if stock purchases are not settled on due date, or that are due to losses that have been incurred during client trading activity, 
on a daily basis.
Shares are only delivered free of payment to a client or their agent once settlement has been achieved and there is no 
outstanding debit balance on the account. In the event of an error, it will again be made immediately apparent the next 
day when both the debit balances and collateral requirements of clients’ accounts are monitored.
On occasion, delivery of stock to a recognised professional counterparty may take place free of payment via an electronic 
settlement system, but only on prior confirmation from their custodian that the required funds in settlement will be 
transferred directly to the Group’s bank account. There have been no historic instances where this has created an 
irrecoverable loss.
Exposures for trades that are outstanding beyond the contractual settlement date are monitored on a daily basis.
The Group has a Market Exposure Committee (MEC) which reviews exposures to market counterparties on a daily basis. 
The Committee also sets exposure limits in respect of individual market counterparties.
Trade receivables represent monies due from clients and market counterparties. The Risk department undertakes reviews of 
new accounts and periodically reviews all counterparties.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with regulated financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The list of 
approved banks is reviewed at least annually by the Treasury Committee. The Group has no concerns over the credit quality 
of these institutions.
An ageing analysis of the Group’s financial assets is presented in the following table:

24.3 Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents that are designed to meet the Group’s operational and 
trading activities. The Group does not use the wholesale markets for any funding and is confident that it has sufficient 
liquidity for the foreseeable future. At 31 March 2017 the Group had £58.4 million in bank accounts (£52.1 million included 
in cash and cash equivalents and £6.3 million included in assets held for sale) and accordingly a high degree of liquidity.
The Group’s liquidity risk is overwhelmingly short-term in nature and arises from the settlement of trades within the 
stockbroking business.
The Treasury Committee operates within strict policies and procedures approved by the Board, which include strict controls 
on the use of financial instruments in managing the Group’s risk. It is the Group’s policy to hold cash resources to meet 
obligations as and when they fall due.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, and various items including trade receivables and 
trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The Group reviews the credit quality of counterparties and limits its 
aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The majority of the short-term liabilities arise from the settlement of clients’ trading activities and it is the policy to pay 
stockbroking creditors on Settlement Day or when the stock is delivered, whichever is later. The Group’s policy is also to 
pay suppliers in accordance with their payment terms.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and financial liabilities which are all repayable on 
demand or within three months. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 139

24.3.1.2 Measurement of fair values
i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
Financial instruments measured at fair value
Fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation 
techniques used. The different levels are defined as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the 
measurement date.
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset either directly (that is, 
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 – inputs for assets that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 charles-stanley.co.uk 141
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
24. Fair values and risk management (continued)
The following table shows the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 3 fair values for financial instruments measured 
at fair value in the statement of financial position, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used:

Interrelationship between

Equity Securities: Euroclear Fair value is determined

Earnings assumed to remain

illiquid market for the shares
Fair value may be higher if 
the forecast forward 
earnings of Euroclear 
increases, and vice versa
The value of the shares may 
increase if the market for the 
shares becomes more liquid
There were no transfers between any of the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended 31 March 2017 or in the 
prior year.
ii) Level 3 fair values
The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair values:

Disposals (125)
Total unrealised gains and losses for the year included 
in consolidated statement of comprehensive income 946
At 31 March 2017 4,530
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. If one or more significant 
inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. Recognised techniques are used to 
value the financial instruments grouped under Level 3, including discounted future cash flow and dividend yield valuation 
methods. All valuations performed are presented to the Group Executive Directors for final approval. Significant valuation 
issues are reported to the Group Audit Committee.
24.3.2 Equity securities – available-for-sale
The Level 3 balance relates to holdings in unlisted investments. At 31 March 2017 these unlisted investments had a fair value 
of £4.5 million (31 March 2016: £3.2 million). Included within this balance is the Group’s holding of 6,030 shares in Euroclear 
PLC which had a fair value of £4.0 million (31 March 2016: £3.1 million). Fair value was determined using a valuation 
technique that required significant unobservable inputs.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 142

26. Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities
The Group holds fund management contracts over various investment funds (all open-ended investment companies), 
acting as an agent on behalf of the Authorised Corporate Director. These investment funds invest capital received from 
investors in a portfolio of assets in order to provide returns to those investors from capital appreciation of those assets, 
income from those assets or both. The investment funds are financed through the issue of units to the investors. The Group’s 
objective is to generate fees from managing assets on behalf of third parties.

29. Contingent liabilities
Following the recent rulings under the European Working Time Directive, ‘normal pay’ for the purposes of calculating 
statutory holiday pay should include contractual commission in addition to basic salary. Based on the current available 
information, the advice received to date and the nature of the Group’s activities, the Working Time Directive is not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group. However, if the actual impact of these rulings is different to current expectations, 
the Group may be exposed to an additional material liability.
In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain legal and tax issues which could, in the event of a dispute, 
develop into litigious proceedings and in some cases may result in contingent liabilities. During the year, the Group has not 
become engaged or involved in, or otherwise subject to, any litigation which has resulted in liabilities crystallising.
30. Commitments
At 31 March 2017, capital expenditure authorised and contracted for, but not included in the financial statements, 
amounted to £nil (2016: £nil).
31. Subsequent events
The Group announced the sale of EBS Management PLC to Embark Group Limited on 11 April 2017. The sale completed 
on 31 May 2017 for total consideration of up to £4.0 million. The consideration is to be satisfied by the payment of 
£2.0 million in cash on completion, £1.0 million of fixed deferred consideration and £1.0 million of contingent deferred 
consideration. 50% of each element of deferred consideration is payable one year after completion, with the remaining
