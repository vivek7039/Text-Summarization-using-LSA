For us, brewing beer and running pubs is not just 
our business. It’s our passion. We bring everything 
to it, committing all our energy and creativity to 
make Fuller’s beers, pubs and hotels just that  
little bit more special than the competition.
Our enduring London roots are symbolic of the 
spirit and imagination we bring to our business.  
We never stop exploring new ways to make  
things better, more interesting, more Fuller’s.
We genuinely believe every one of our beers and pubs 
deserves to be celebrated for its individuality and unique 
character. And this holds true for our people too, whose 
unique talents are behind it all, making the real difference 
to everything we do for our customers.
While every Fuller’s beer and pub does stand proudly  
on its own – each an achievement in its own right –  
the Fuller’s name tells you they have all been crafted  
with the same passion, care and attention to detail that  
we bring to everything we do.
This is what it means to be part of Fuller’s.

Overview THE PERFECT  
PINT

In the last year, we brewed 
40 different beers
at Chiswick  F U L L E R ’ S C R A F T
“ WE CREATE BESPOKE  
BEERS OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY TO SUIT EVERY 
DISCERNING PALATE.  
IT’S OUR CRAFT”
GEORGINA YOUNG 
HEAD BREWER
QUALITY. 
CREATIVITY. 
PRIDE.
W
hile we have always had fantastic brewers at 
Fuller’s, we take great pride in the nuts and 
bolts of the Brewery too. To make great beer, you 
need the best ingredients, the best brewers, the 
right kit, a large dose of creativity and lots and 
lots of passion.
This year, our new cross-flow filter became fully 
operational. It might not sound sexy, but it has 
helped us improve flavour stability. This means 
that the beer in our kegs, bottles and cans tastes 
better for longer – surely a good thing in anyone’s 
brewing book. It works by first centrifuging the 
beer to remove the yeast and then forcing the 
beer at high pressure through membranes with 
very tiny holes, which are only 0.65 microns wide.
As a result, more of the important flavour 
molecules make it into the beer and that’s good 
news for our customers. With more flavour 
coming in and a new piece of kit to play with, our 
brewers are experimenting even more than ever 
and that’s already resulted in a Black IPA, which 
was part of the seasonal calendar for the spring. 
With such creativity flowing, we just can’t wait to 
see what the brewers come up with when they get 
given access to the planned, new pilot plant.

3 Chairman’s Statement
A clear vision  
and a great 
business
I am delighted to be 
announcing another 
year of strong results 
due to our clear, 
consistent strategy,  
the dedication of our 
people across the 
business and the 
strength of our 
management team. 
Michael Turner
Chairman
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.
4 I am pleased to be announcing another year of strong  
results due to our clear, consistent strategy, the dedication  
of our people across the business and the strength of our 
management team. Our total revenues during this 53 week 
period have increased by 12% to £392.0 million (2016: 
£350.5 million) and this has led to a rise in adjusted profit 
before tax of 5% to £42.9 million (2016: £40.9 million). 
One of the key measures for shareholders, adjusted earnings 
per share (EPS), has risen by 5% to 61.39p (2016: 58.35p), 
reflecting a continuous upward trend, and I am delighted to 
announce a rise in the full year dividend of 5%. As ever, we 
have delivered excellent returns for our shareholders and over 
the last five years, our EPS has risen 56%.
Our Managed Pubs and Hotels have had another very strong 
year, with like for like sales rising by 3.7%, outperforming  
the market once again. Food sales have grown ahead of this 
rate, while our accommodation business has performed 
exceptionally well, with a rise in occupancy rates increasing 
like for like sales by 6.4%.
The Tenanted Inns division has had a year of consolidation 
while we reviewed our strategy. We have a clear vision of 
where we can add value to the tenanted partnership and  
how to build solid foundations for future growth. It will  
be a long term process, but I look forward to updating you  
on progress in the coming months and years.
The Fuller’s Beer Company continues to produce an 
interesting and award-winning range of beers and ciders  
and brands such as Frontier, our delicious craft lager, have 
grown sales and taken Fuller’s into new listings. 
During the year, we appointed Simon Dodd, who used to  
run the Premium City pubs for Fuller’s Inns, to the role of 
Managing Director of The Fuller’s Beer Company. He brings 
a real customer focus, a keen understanding of consumer 
trends and a new approach to the role.
In another personnel change, John Keeling will be spending 
more time in a beer ambassador role, promoting Fuller’s both 
in the UK and globally and I am delighted that he has handed 
the Head Brewer baton to Georgina Young, who he has 
mentored and developed since she joined us in 1999. 
Dividend
The Board is pleased to announce a final dividend of 11.55p 
(2016: 11.00p) per 40p ‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary share and 1.155p 
(2016: 1.10p) per 4p ‘B’ ordinary share. This will be paid on 
27 July 2017 to shareholders on the share register as at 
23 June 2017. The total dividend of 18.80p per 40p ‘A’ 
and ‘C’ ordinary share and 1.88p per 4p ‘B’ ordinary share 
represents a 5% increase on last year and will be covered 
3.3 times by adjusted earnings per share.

Michael is a keen skier and still races for the 
Vintners’ Ski Team – where he has been known 
to pick up the odd gold medal. He first took to 
the slopes at the tender age of four and a half 
when his father put him in the car, put the 
car on a plane, and took him to Adelboden 
in Switzerland.

“ OUR FOOD IS OUR 
REPUTATION AND

OUR FOOD AS IT 
IS FOR OUR BEER.  
IT’S OUR CRAFT”
PAUL DICKINSON 
DIRECTOR OF FOOD
PASSION. 
INNOVATION. 
PERFECTION.
T
he Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild is the foundation 
for our food business. It is the route by which 
we recruit, develop and inspire our teams. It is 
designed to ensure consistency in our dishes, 
without limiting creativity and from Kitchen 
Porter to Head Chef, there is always something 
new for everyone to learn.
Bringing our chefs and our suppliers together 
has helped to build on the family values that run 
through the heart of Fuller’s. A chef who has seen 
a fish smoked, a cow milked or an ice-cream 
churned has a better appreciation of the flavours 
in, and the passion behind our ingredients. It helps 
to inspire them to create exciting dishes and it 
builds a relationship with the supplier that creates 
a lasting and sincere partnership.
The Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild was the start of the 
Fuller’s Kitchen initiative. With social media and 
billboard advertising bringing our chefs to life 
and our Chef of the Year competition now in its 
second year, we are on the right path to achieving 
our goal of becoming famous for our food. And we 
are attracting the right people, at all levels, to 
build the kitchen teams of the future.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. A new look for our 
seasonal range
We have taken a new approach to our seasonal ale 
calendar this year. Each season sees one ‘Super 
Seasonal’ cask ale, two more cask ales both available 
for six to eight weeks each and, for the first time ever, 
a seasonal keg too – for spring, it was a Black IPA.  
The pump clips and keg lenses for all the seasonal 
beers have been designed with our other brands in 
mind, to ensure they are unmistakeably Fuller’s.
Great chefs in Fuller’s kitchens
We are one of the only companies where everyone from 
Kitchen Porter to Head Chef is developed through the 
Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild training programme. All levels of  
our chefs’ focus on keeping classical skills alive, cooking 
delicious fresh food and making sure that the craft and 
passion in our chefs rival that of our brewers.

FISTRAL BEACH
LOCAL. 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
ADVENTUROUS.
T 
he Stable now sits proudly with 17 sites across 
the UK and as well as being famous for its 
incredible range of ciders and delicious pizzas, it is 
becoming equally famous for the locality of its 
ingredients and the amazing names it gives its pizzas.
Take The Headland Herbivore for instance, on the 
menu at Fistral Beach, a delicious veggie treat 
heroing Cornish Blue cheese, or The Fresh 
Hawaiian, with local ham from the West Country. 
In Birmingham, your lamb will have come from 
Dorset, but what’s not to love about The Perry 
Barr Baa or even The Smethwick Scorcher – 
although the three chilli rating might deter those 
with a weaker constitution. And if it’s chicken 
you’re after, the Bournville Bantam makes more 
than a passing nod to the area’s heritage, although 
it doesn’t have any chocolate on it.
It’s not just the locals who might be turned on  
by the menu though. The Stable is building an 
enviable reputation with the vegan community 
with a range of pizzas, salads and sides on all Stable 
menus. Finally, there is one pizza that appears 
throughout the estate – The Longhorn Jim. This  
is a tribute to Jim Armstrong, who has supplied 
beef to The Stable from his farm in Little Bredy, 
Dorset, since the first Stable was opened in 
Bridport in 2009.

Simon is a big fan of music – and especially 
live music. He has a particular love of U2, 
who he has seen at least six times in four 
different countries. He was present at the Live 
Aid concert, Wembley 1985, and his original 
ticket is one of his most precious possessions.
It has been another good year for Fuller’s with a 
strong set of results for the Company. Food and 
accommodation have driven like for like sales 
growth in our Managed Pubs and Hotels and the 
targeted investments we have made in both new 
sites and redeveloping our existing estate have 
generated excellent returns. We have purchased 
five new sites and completed 25 major 
refurbishments in the last 53 weeks.
Although The Fuller’s Beer Company and our 
Tenanted Inns have had a more demanding year, 
both divisions have made excellent strategic 
progress, developing new plans and laying the 
foundations for future growth. This is not about 
fixing problems, it is about building a clear vision 
with achievable goals to drive these businesses 
forward. We have strong teams in place and 
while this is a long term process, these are 
exciting times for both of these key parts 
of the Company.
When I took over as Chief Executive, I made 
a clear commitment to enhance the way we 
develop our most talented people and build 
succession plans for the future. As a result of the 
great work of our training team, this year 66% 
of our appointments were internal promotions. 
This included the appointment during the year 
of three divisional directors – Liz Peck as Sales 
Director, Paul Dickinson as Director of Food 
and Jane Jones as Director of Marketing. In 
addition, Georgina Young, who originally joined 
Fuller’s as a junior brewer under the tutelage of 
John Keeling, was promoted to Head Brewer. 
We are seeing significant changes to our business 
and the way many of our customers run their day 
to day lives – and we have to adapt accordingly. 
This includes embracing and increasing the way 
we use the digital space to amplify and bring to life 
our long term, consistent strategy. To that end, 
we have a number of different projects underway 
within the business. We are improving the way 
we collect, collate and use the data we generate to 
enrich our distinctive customer experience. Other 
digital led projects will help us build a leaner cost 
base – including investing in a comprehensive, 
far-reaching enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system. All parts of our business and each element 
of our strategy must accommodate and embrace 
the digital world and the new technologies that 
form a major part of our consumers’ lives, while at 
the same time it is imperative that we do not lose 
the personal touch and excellent face to face 
relationship we enjoy with our customers.
It is important to remember that while our 
strategy is consistent, our business also has the 
flexibility and capability to evolve and react quickly 
to the external environment. We are facing 
unprecedented cost pressures with a sharp 
increase in business rates (an additional £2 million 
in the next full financial year), the impact of the 
National Living Wage and increasing competition 
for key skilled team workers such as chefs. This is 
compounded by the uncertainty around Brexit 
and the future for the EU nationals that are a key 
part of our business, particularly in London. 
However, we have robust plans in place, a superb 
team of people and we are ready to tackle these 
future challenges and seize the opportunities 
they present.

Yet again, our Managed Pubs and Hotels division 
has outperformed the market with like for like 
sales rising by 3.7% and an increase in operating 
profit

 of 5% to £32.4 million (2016: £30.9

 grew 10% to £48.1 million

While food has continued to show strong like for 
like growth of 4.5%, accommodation has been 
the standout performer over the last 12 months, 
with like for like sales rising by 6.4%. This was 
driven by a strong rise in occupancy rates, 
benefiting from both an increase in inbound 
tourists, many of whom like to stay in a traditional 
British pub, and a rise in the popularity of the 
staycation. We are continuing to upgrade our 
hotel stock and this year added a further 71 
bedrooms through the acquisition of new 
properties and building more in our existing 
estate. This brings the total number of bedrooms 
in our Managed Pubs and Hotels division to 706.

London Porter Smoked Salmon
We’ve talked about it before – and we’ll talk 
about it again, but we are just so proud of our 
excellent London Porter Smoked Salmon. As 
well as serving it with scrambled eggs or in 
Eggs Royale for a delicious breakfast, it is also 
the hero of our Salad Nicoise, just one of the 
lighter dishes we have added to our menus.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Our total food sales have risen 11%, while like for 
like food sales have risen by 4.5% during the 
period. This is an area where we continue to invest 
in our kitchens, as well as developing our team 
members and building sustainable, mutually 
beneficial relationships with our suppliers. During 
the year, we held our inaugural Chef of the Year 
competition, with over-25 and under-25 
categories. The two winners, Gavin Sinden of The 
Stonemason’s Arms in Hammersmith, and Luke 
Emmess of The Still & West, Southsea, were 
rewarded with a trip to Dubai, including the chance 
to cook in some of the Emirates’ top restaurants.
The successful Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild continues to 
deliver excellent results and is one of the ways we 
are mitigating the problems of chef recruitment. 
We have increased both the number of chef 
scholars undertaking one of our training 
programmes and the frequency of the training 
cycles, with six cycles per year, each lasting five 
and a half months. In addition, we are in the 
second year of our Chef Apprentice programme, 
aimed at entry level kitchen positions. This has 
proved successful and we have provided 
permanent jobs for all those who completed the 
apprenticeship programme. These trainees will, 
we hope, be the Head Chefs of the future.
Our food journey continues and we are currently 
investing in systems to underpin the fantastic 
work we have completed around supplier 
partnerships, training and development. This 
includes a new food recipe, margin and stock 
system which will enable us to improve food 
margin and consistency of our freshly cooked 
dishes, while maintaining the quality, originality 
and provenance of the ingredients we use. We are 
also expanding our healthier options and in the last 
12 months have markedly increased the number 
of vegetarian and vegan dishes on the menu.
During the year we relaunched and refreshed 
the wine offer in our pubs. We redesigned our 
lists around styles, giving customers a choice 
of wines of different origin and price, while 
retaining our focus on provenance and quality. 
The lists now have unfussy descriptions of the 
flavours and the move has resulted in customers 
trading up to more premium wines. Our efforts 
have also been noticed outside of Fuller’s and we 
have just taken the title of Pub Merchant of the 
Year at the Sommelier Wine Awards. Craft 
beers also continued to perform well across the 
Managed estate, with sales increasing of both 
Fuller’s own range and those from other brewers. 
In addition, our Managed Pubs now have access 
to an even wider range of brands through 
Nectar. All of these trends have helped invested 
like for like drinks sales to grow 3.1%.
With customers looking for new, exciting and 
experiential reasons to visit the pub, we look to 
provide many and varied interesting events. The 
popular Shakespeare in the Garden programme 
featured Twelfth Night last summer and once 
again, we had a full house at each performance. 
We will be re-running the My Dad’s Pub 
competition that we created last year, whereby 
one lucky father wins his own pub for the day, 
including personalisation of the pub’s hanging 
sign. Our Fuller’s Kitchen campaign continues, 
seizing the opportunities presented by Instagram 
to share photos of delicious dishes through social 
media to whet our customers’ appetites. Fuller’s 
Kitchen has also been focusing on monthly 
offers that combine food and drink and over 
12,000 of these were redeemed over a five 
month period, with a chorizo burger paired 
with a pint of Frontier being the most popular. 
Bedroom Business
Four of the five new pubs we have opened this 
year have bedrooms. The Half Moon’s rooms 
are all named after people who have walked 
on the moon, while The White Star in 
Southampton has had some unlucky residents 
in the past. It played host to a number of 
transatlantic passengers in 1912, the night 
before they boarded the Titanic, hence the 
reason it is named after the ill-fated ship’s 
operating company.

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Chief Executive’s Review continued
Digital technology is allowing us to enhance 
our distinctive customer experience and deliver 
efficiency and we have a number of exciting 
initiatives in place. Our single customer view 
database was launched at the start of the year 
and has helped to drive incremental revenue 
through carefully targeted email marketing 
activity. We pride ourselves on the individuality 
of each of our pubs and our online approach is 
no different. We have upgraded over 100 of 
our pub websites with fully responsive, mobile 
optimised sites where photography is at the 
heart. We place huge value on the feedback that 
we receive from our customers and launched a 
new online feedback system which has so far 
generated over 40,000 individual responses. 
Over 60% of our managed pubs and hotels now 
have a superfast WiFi connection and we are 
continuing to invest to improve the experience 
for the 400,000 customers that use the service 
each month.
During the year, we purchased or opened five new 
Managed Pubs, including The Gun, a pub in South 
Quay, Docklands, with panoramic views across the 
bend of the River Thames to the O2 and an 
enviable reputation for food, and The Half Moon 
in Herne Hill, an iconic pub in South London, an 
area in which Fuller’s is underrepresented. It is a 
Grade II listed building and our scheme restored 
many original features and added 12 stylish, 
individually-designed bedrooms. It is truly 
wonderful to see this grand old lady of Herne Hill 
once again proudly dominating the local scene. 
We also purchased The White Star in 
Southampton, which comes with 14 bedrooms, 
The King’s Arms in Woodstock, which has 15 
bedrooms, and The Albert Arms in Esher, an 
affluent area perfect for our premium fresh 
food offer. The Albert Arms has six bedrooms, 
is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment 
and we plan to reopen it in the second half 
of the year.
During the year, we have invested £20 million in 
our existing Managed estate with a number of 
high profile refurbishments that have resulted 
in a record number of 155 closure weeks (2016: 
121 weeks). These included adding additional 
bedrooms at sites such as The Princess Royal in 
Farnham and The Head of the River in Oxford as 
well as developing sites to broaden their appeal, 
such as The Three Guineas at Reading Station. 
This traditional station pub has been completely 
repositioned, with an excellent food offer and the 
innovative conversion of a large disused cellar 
area into a superb function space. The Three 
Guineas is in a perfect position to benefit from 
the forthcoming arrival of Crossrail.
Ultimately, the success of our Managed 
Pubs and Hotels is due to the excellent team 
of people who work in them, and we continue 
to invest wholeheartedly in their training and 
development. We are fortunate to have some 
incredible team members from throughout 
Europe and beyond working in our pubs and in 
the light of Britain’s forthcoming departure from 
the EU, we are investing in and supporting our 
people by covering the cost of applying for a 
permanent residence card for any eligible EU 
or EEA nationals who have worked for us for at 
least one year.
After opening four new sites for The Stable in 
the first half – two in London at Whitechapel 
and Kew Bridge and two closer to the brand’s 
heartland in Bournemouth and Exeter – we are 
pausing for breath in our opening programme. 
Since acquiring The Stable just three years ago, 
it has trebled in size, and now stands at 17 sites. 
During the year we increased our stake in this 
business to 76% and we have the option to 
acquire the remaining 24% in 2018.
In order to focus on The Stable’s position 
as the  home of great cider, we have rolled 
out a Cidermaster programme, creating cider 
sommeliers in each restaurant. We have also 
created a house cider, Rapscallion, produced at 
Cornish Orchards and collaboratively blended by 
The Stables’ Cidermasters and the talented cider 
makers at Duloe. In the latter part of the year 
we appointed David Gough, another internal 
promotion, to the role of Operations Director. 
We have moved the back office and systems to 
Chiswick to allow The Stable to benefit from 
being part of the Fuller’s family, while the retail 
offer remains wholly under the control of The 
Stable team. The Stable is still a very young and 
exciting brand and it continues to offer a point 
of difference to the Fuller’s portfolio.
The Astronomer, 
London E1
The Astronomer was just one 
of the refurbishments we carried 
out during the last year. Formerly 
The Shooting Star, this fantastic 
pub pays homage to the great 
astronomers and has a downstairs 
bar known as The Hubble Room. 
TV presenter Dallas Campbell 
came and opened it for us and 
even brought a real space suit 
with him.

 Operating profit excluding separately

Tenanted Inns
£13.2m
Operating profit
1
 (-1%)
Our Tenanted business has had a challenging year 
with like for like profits, our main KPI, decreasing 
by 1% (2016: +2%). The division generated £13.2 
million of profit
1
 during the year (2016: £13.4 
million) and average EBITDA per pub increased 
by 2%. During the year, we completed a strategic 
review of the business and identified 20 pubs that 
we did not feel belonged in the Fuller’s portfolio. 
Prior to the period end, we sold four of these and 
another 16 are either held for sale or have been 
sold since the year end. In addition we sold two 
Tenanted pubs in the first half of the year.
A Fuller’s branded pub should always be a 
hallmark of high standards and great quality with 
regards to beer, wines and food, irrespective of 
whether the site is managed or tenanted. The 
strategic review of this part of our business has 
given us an opportunity to identify and clarify 
the standards we expect for our customers and 
ensure they are evident in all pubs. 
Investment in our Tenanted pubs has always 
played an important part in our journey and in 
light of the strategic review we have undertaken, 
we have implemented a plan to grow our annual 
rate of investment in our Tenanted pubs by over 
50% to around £3 million per year. This investment 
will be back and front of house, in the right pubs, 
in conjunction with the right entrepreneurial 
Tenants. We have completed 15 projects during 
the year that have enhanced the nature of the 
business including The Prestonville in Brighton, 
The Globe in Brentford, The Bear & Swan in 
Chew Magna, which included adding boutique 
bedrooms, The Oak at Stanstead Abbotts and 
The Buckingham Inn, Buckingham. All of these 
projects were jointly funded by Fuller’s and 
the Tenant.
As part of this programme, we have put in place 
a new agreement based on a turnover rent, 
benefiting both the Company and the Tenant, 
including better transparency of trade and 
trading patterns and giving the Tenant greater 
flexibility in how they grow their business. In the 
future, Tenants will have access to the excellent 
Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild and we will be improving 
access to our food supplier base.
It is early days, but we are delighted that among 
our first turnover agreement signatories are a 
former Fuller’s Managed Pub Manager and 
Head Chef – completing the career path from 
front line team member to business owner. We 
have also had two internal promotions within 
the team, with one of our first set of graduate 
trainees and a former Fuller’s Managed Pub 
Manager both taking up Business Development 
Manager positions. Finally, we now have 92% of 
our estate on substantive agreements, up from 
85% a year ago. 
There is much work still to be done, but we have 
a number of workstreams in place to further 
develop the new agreement, enhance the look 
and feel of our Tenanted estate, improve the 
quality of the food and, as a result, recruit 
talented, entrepreneurial Tenants. 
“ In light of the strategic 
review we have 
undertaken, we have 
implemented a plan 
to grow our annual 
rate of investment in 
our Tenanted pubs by 
over 50%”
Our Tenants have access to Brewer Street 
coffee and its special blend of beans, chosen 
by our Head Brewer. Brewer Street is available 
Only at Fuller’s and we support those Tenants 
that take it on by helping with a promotional 
starter kit.

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Chief Executive’s Review continued
The Fuller’s Beer 
Company
£8.0m
Operating profit
1
 (+5%)
Revenue in The Fuller’s Beer Company rose 
by 17% to £147.9 million (2016: £126.8 million), 
principally due to the full year effect of the 
Nectar acquisition, although volumes (excluding 
Nectar) were down by 2%. Operating profit
1
 
rose 5%, to £8.0 million (2016: £7.6 million). 
We continue to see a shift to higher margin 
beers and ciders and it is only the impact of 
Nectar, our specialist craft beer wholesaler, 
that has caused the overall margin to fall. 
One of the top performers during the year 
was Frontier Craft Lager, which saw volumes 
increase by 27% and capped off the year by 
picking up the 2017 International Beer and 
Cider Award for Champion Draught Lager. 
This prestigious award reinforces the appeal 
of this fantastic beer, which continues to gain 
new fans across the UK and beyond. 
Cornish Orchards has performed well with 
volumes also rising by 27%. Cornish Orchards 
has released some well received new products, 
such as the refreshing seasonal cider Keeper’s 
Meadow, and launched three of its range – 
Cornish Orchards Gold, Cornish Orchards 
Blush and Alcoholic Ginger Beer – in 
330ml cans.
The year saw the launch of London Pride 
Unfiltered. This new beer takes the original 
London Pride recipe with the beer being 
centrifuged but not filtered. The beer is then dry 
hopped with additional Target hops. The result is 
a delicious, slightly hoppier, beer with all the 
balance of original London Pride. It still has a 
full flavour and is served colder, which appeals 
to today’s craft beer drinker. Early signs are very 
positive and we are confident the beer will bring 
London Pride to a whole new audience. London 
Pride cask still remains the grand master of our 
beer portfolio and we will be unveiling exciting 
new plans for it later in the year. 
London Pride has been supported by a number 
of exciting marketing initiatives during the period, 
particularly in the social media space. Drop of 
Pride, whereby offices can compete on Twitter 
using the hashtag #DropOfPride to have a 
one-off delivery of London Pride to their office 
on a Friday afternoon, has been shortlisted for 
an Institute of Promotional Marketing award. 
Meanwhile, #whenitrainsitpours, a combined 
Twitter and Periscope activation featuring 
weatherman Michael Fish, received over four 
million views. Consumers could receive a voucher 
for a free pint of London Pride when the live 
Periscope feed showed it was raining outside 
our pub The Hydrant at Monument. The site 
generated a fantastic response with the 
supporting ads reaching 11.2 million people 
and over 1,200 pints being given away over 
a three week period.

 Operating profit excluding separately

20 We continue to invest in our brewery, with the 
new cross-flow filter coming into action, helping 
improve the quality and range of our keg and 
bottled beers. We have made a number of other 
improvements that have resulted in a positive 
impact on our efficiency, such as new electric 
forklift trucks with lower carbon emissions and 
changes to our loading bank to create more 
space and easier stock movement. The Brewery 
team participated in our first ever Brewery 
employee engagement event, promoting and 
improving health and safety through an 
impactful, innovative and fun day. We are 
looking forward in the new financial year to 
improvements in the cask racking line and we will 
be building a pilot plant to allow our brewers to 
experiment and be even more creative.
Maintaining a wide portfolio of interesting 
brands is key to our success and while smaller 
brands may not generate huge volumes, they 
keep Fuller’s top of mind with the beer 
cognoscenti and provide interest and excitement 
for our consumers. During the year, we have 
changed the look and feel of our seasonal 
portfolio, ensuring that the range is a perfect 
complement at all times to our core selection. 
Finally, it has been a busy year for both Cornish 
Orchards and Nectar with notable infrastructure 
investments in both businesses. A new 
warehouse and new offices have been built at 
Duloe, where production has trebled since our 
acquisition in 2013. Meanwhile, at Nectar we 
have built a new warehouse which will double 
capacity. Both of these business are generating 
good returns for The Fuller’s Beer Company and 
we look forward to helping them continue to 
grow in the future.
Current trading 
and prospects
We are only nine weeks in to the new financial 
year but we have had a very strong start, albeit 
against our softest quarter last year, with like 
for like sales in Managed Pubs and Hotels up 
6.6%, like for like profits in our Tenanted Inns up 
5% and volumes in The Fuller’s Beer Company 
rising 7%.
There are a number of headwinds that will have a 
significant financial impact on both Fuller’s and 
the industry as a whole, but we face the future in 
a strong position. Our Managed Pubs and Hotels 
are in good shape and although there is a lot of 
work and a long way to go, we have a clear vision 
and solid strategy for both our Tenanted Inns and 
The Fuller’s Beer Company.
We will continue to build and develop our 
business and have plans to invest £25 million, 
before allowing for any pubs we find to acquire. 
A further £5 million, which we will expense, has 
been allocated to the implementation of the 
once in a generation replacement of our core 
systems, which will equip us for further success 
in the coming years.
The projects that we have started today give us a 
solid digital foundation and a clear vision for the 
future. We will use integrated technology to get 
to know our customers and our teams better and 
form the best possible personal relationship with 
everyone who comes into contact with Fuller’s.
In short, while we are cautious and realistic 
about the future, we are well-placed to continue to 
delight our customers, recruit and develop the best 
team members and reward our shareholders.

London Pride Unfiltered
In February, we launched London Pride 
Unfiltered at Craft Beer Rising, in Shoreditch. 
It is colder, hoppier and hazier and it is proving 
very popular with both new drinkers and 
traditional Pride drinkers looking for extra 
refreshment on a hot day. Delicious!

T
he team down at Cornish Orchards have been 
busy this year, with new products, new offices 
and a new warehouse. The additional capacity that 
went in during the previous financial year is all now 
up and running and we have trebled production 
since we acquired the business in 2013. 
During the last year, we have expanded the range of 
drinks produced at Westnorth Manor Farm in Duloe 
to include Sparkling Apple, a soft drink made with 
Cornish spring water taken from a spring in our own 
orchard, and we’ve taken our popular Rhubarb and 
Vanilla Sparkle and made it available all year round. 
In addition, we have added Cornish Orchards Blush, 
with a hint of fresh raspberry, to our draught portfolio.
The new year has seen the arrival of even more new 
products and new formats with Gold, Blush and our 
Alcoholic Ginger Beer now available in cans and a new 
draught and bottled cider, Keeper’s Meadow. This 
apple and pear-based cider has a hint of elderflower, 
creating a highly refreshing drink and making it 
appealing to the prosecco brigade. 
The key ingredient at Cornish Orchards is fresh fruit 
– from our own orchards, from local people who sell us 
their apples and from other fruit growers in the South 
West. All the fruit is then pressed at Westnorth 
Manor Farm and we never, ever use concentrate. It’s 
that commitment to fruit, to quality and to the skill of 
our blenders that means you can taste the nature in 
Cornish Orchards ciders and juices.

The Group has a strong financial position as  
a cash generative business with a high quality, 
mainly freehold asset base and a ratio of net debt 
to pro forma EBITDA of 2.9 times  
(2016: 3.0 times).
We have grown revenue by 12% on the prior  
year with the majority of the growth driven by 
strong like for like trading within the Managed 
estate along with the impact of the five new and 
acquired pubs, four further Stable sites and the 
acquisition of Nectar in the prior period. 
Excluding Nectar our revenue has grown by 7%. 
Our operating profits before separately disclosed 
items grew by 5% to £42.9 million (2016: £40.9 
million), with the largest contribution to growth 
again coming from the Managed Pubs and Hotels 
division, where profits grew by £1.5 million.

26 March 2016. All commentary is for the 
statutory periods with the exception of like for like 
information. A summary of the impact of the 53rd 
week is detailed in the accompanying table with 
the additional 53rd week contributing £8.0 million 
of revenue and £0.8 million of adjusted profit
1
.
Finance costs
Net finance costs before separately disclosed 
items have increased by £0.6 million to  
£6.6 million with the significant capital 
investment in 2016 and continued investment in 
2017 leading to a higher average level of debt 
compared to the prior period. The average cost 
of gross borrowing has decreased to 3.0% (2016: 
3.1%) reflecting the reduction in interest rates. 
The net interest expense on our defined benefit 
pension scheme is shown within separately 
disclosed items as the charge is driven by market 
conditions at an arbitrary point in time and is  
not associated with our underlying trading. 
Separately disclosed items
Net separately disclosed items before tax of  
£3.0 million comprised £0.9 million profit on 
property disposals, offset by £1.3 million of 
acquisition costs expensed, £1.5 million of business 
reorganisation costs, primarily related to The 
Fuller’s Beer Company, £0.3 million deemed 
remuneration on the future purchase of shares in 
The Stable and a net interest charge on our 
pension deficit of £0.8 million. After separately 
disclosed items, profit before tax was therefore 
£39.9 million (2016: £39.2 million). 
Tax
A full analysis of the tax charge for the year is  
set out in note 7 to the financial statements.  
Tax has been provided for at an effective rate  
of 21.2% (2016: 20.5%) on adjusted profits. The

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Financial Review continued
Pensions
The defined benefit pension scheme deficit  
has increased by £14.4 million to £37.9 million 
(2016: £23.5 million). The present value of 
pension obligations increased from £119.5 million 
to £149.3 million, this was driven by the assumed 
discount rate decreasing from 3.55% to 2.60%, 
RPI inflation assumptions increasing from 
3.05% to 3.30% and a £3.2 million experience 
loss due to the updating of membership data 
following the 2016 triennial valuation. This was 
partly offset by an increase in the fair value 
of scheme assets of £15.4 million from 
£96.0 million to £111.4 million. Following the 
conclusion of the 2016 triennial valuation, 
the Company agreed to increase the deficit 
recovery payments to £2.0 million per annum 
from 1 January 2017 from £1.1 million. Deficit 
recovery payments of £1.3 million were 
therefore made during the financial year. 
Shareholders’ return
Adjusted earnings per share were 5% higher  
than last year at 61.39p (2016: 58.35p). The 
proposed final dividend of 11.55p per 40p  
‘A’ ordinary share, together with the interim 
dividend of 7.25p per share already paid, makes 
a total of 18.80p and compares with a total 
dividend of 17.90p last year. The total dividend 
per share has grown by 5% and will be covered 
3.27 times by adjusted earnings per share, 
compared with 3.26 times in the previous year. 
Shareholders’ equity at the year end was 
£312.8 million.
During the period 341,415 ‘A’ ordinary 40p 
shares were purchased into treasury for a total 
of £3.5 million (2016: 274,000 ‘A’ ordinary  
40p shares and 1,000,000 ‘B’ ordinary 4p 
shares for £4.4 million). In addition 105,764  
‘B’ ordinary 4p shares were purchased for  
£0.1 million by or on behalf of the Trustees  
of the Long Term Incentive Plan to cover  
future issuance (2016: 146,028 ‘A’ ordinary  
40p shares and 225,281 ‘B’ ordinary 4p shares 
for £1.8 million by or on behalf of the Trustees  
of the Share Incentive Plan and the Long  
Term Incentive Plan to cover future issuance). 
The average price paid was 1,036.5p per  
‘A’ ordinary 40p share. The middle-market 
quotation of the Company’s ordinary shares  
at the end of the financial year was 997.5p.  
The highest price during the year was 1,098p, 
while the lowest was 930p. The Company’s 
market capitalisation at 1 April 2017 was  
£551.3 million (2016: £580.9 million).

Cash flow and net debt
The Group-generated cash available for 
discretionary spend was £59.6 million (2016: 
£56.8 million) with the increase due largely  
to EBITDA growth. In line with our long term 
investment strategy, we invested £55.8 million 
in capital expenditure (2016: £80.7 million). 
We spent £35.0 million on continued 
investment in our existing business through  
pub refurbishment, new pub and restaurant  
site openings, investment in equipment at the 
Chiswick Brewery including the cross-flow filter, 
and increasing warehouse capacity at Cornish 
Orchards and Nectar. 
We have also spent £16.6 million on the 
acquisition of four pubs that fit with our strategic 
goals – The Gun in London’s Docklands, The 
Albert Arms in Esher, The King’s Arms in 
Woodstock, and The White Star in 
Southampton. During the period we have 
acquired an additional 25% share in The Stable 
Pizza & Cider Limited for £2.7 million, taking our 
ownership to 76%, and paid £1.2 million in 
deferred contingent consideration to the former 
owners of Cornish Orchards. Asset disposals 
from the sale of properties within the tenanted 
portfolio raised £4.4 million and generated a 
separately disclosed profit of £0.9 million, which 
we will use to further invest in our estate as part 
of our property portfolio management.
Overall net debt has increased by £7.6 million  
to £206.1 million due to our commitment to 
investment in all aspects of our operations.  
Our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio  
has reduced to 2.9 times (2016: 3.0 times) 
reflecting our EBITDA growth in the period.  
Our committed facilities, along with our strong 
balance sheet position, give us the flexibility to 
invest strategically in the future should 
opportunities arise. 
Sources of finance
The Group has £210 million of available long 
term facilities, £126.7 million of which has been 
extended for another year and is now available 
until August 2021. Of the remaining long-term 
facilities, £33.3 million is available to August 
2020 and £50 million is available until August 
2019. An additional £20 million facility is 
available until August 2017. Our undrawn 
committed facilities at 1 April 2017 were 
£35.5 million, with a further £15.3 million of 
cash held on the Balance Sheet.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. £90.0 million of our borrowings at 1 April 2017 
were hedged; £60.0 million is swapped at a 
blended interest rate of 1.89% (excluding bank 
margin), £20.0 million is subject to a cap of 2.1% 
and £10.0 million is subject to a cap of 1.73%. 
The interest rate swap agreements in place will 
allow us to continue to borrow a portion of our 
bank debt at a fixed interest rate until 2022. 
The Group’s financing is a mix of bank debt, 
debentures, cumulative preference shares, 
overdraft, cash and short term deposits  
as disclosed in notes 22, 24 and 26. Other 
financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and payables arise through the 
Group’s operating activities. The Group does  
not trade in financial instruments. 
Financial risks and treasury policies
The Group operates a centralised treasury 
function, which controls cash management  
and borrowings and the Group’s financial risks.  
The objectives of the function are to manage  
the Group’s financial risk; to secure cost effective 
funding for the Group’s operations; and to 
minimise the adverse effects of fluctuations in 
the financial markets on the value of the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities, on reported 
profitability and on the cash flows of the Group. 
The Group Treasury team monitors the overall 
level of financial gearing weekly, with our short and 
medium term forecasts showing underlying levels 
of gearing which remain within our targets.
Transactions of a speculative nature are prohibited. 
The Group’s treasury activities are governed by 
policies approved and monitored by the Board.  
The Group treasury team consists of the Finance 
Director and the Group Financial Controller. 
Going concern statement
In adopting the going concern basis for  
preparing the financial statements, the Board 
has considered the business activities as set  
out within the Strategic Report along with the 
principal risks and uncertainties as detailed on 
pages 28 to 29. On the basis of current financial 
projections and having considered the facilities 
available, the Board are confident that the 
Group and Company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason the Board 
considers it appropriate for the Group to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over the four year period to March 2021, 
taking into account the Group’s current position 
and the potential impact of the principal risks 
documented on pages 28 and 29 in the Strategic 
Report. Based on this assessment, the Board 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 
March 2021. 
Four years has been considered an appropriate 
period for assessment as that is the time horizon 
for which the Board analyses and reviews 
detailed strategic plans and is considered to be a 
good balance between providing a medium term 
horizon whilst not becoming speculative.
The assessment has taken into account the 
available debt facilities, analysed the key risks  
to the business and considered the effectiveness 
of internal controls and review processes.  
The Board have performed scenario modelling 
based on a worst case economic outlook, being 
a recession deeper than that triggered by the 
2008/9 financial crisis.
Key factors considered include: the Group’s 
asset backed balance sheet and strong financial 
position; the strength of the Group’s credit 
and availability of finance; the ability to  
preserve significant cash flows by a reduction  
in discretionary investments; and the long term 
strategy and outlook of the Group.

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Principal Risks and Uncertainties
In the course of its normal business, the Group continually assesses and 
takes action to mitigate the various risks encountered that could impact the 
achievement of its objectives. As detailed in the Corporate Governance 
Report, there are systems and processes in place to enable the Board to 
monitor and control the Group’s management of risk. The Audit 
Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of this process and seeks to 
ensure that management’s response is adapted appropriately to the 
changing environment.
External risks
There are a number of external risks over which the Board has no direct 
control, which are discussed at Board and Audit Committee meetings to 
ensure that the business can respond effectively to changes in the external 
environment. The following risks are therefore considered at both a 
strategic and micro-environment level. 
a) A decline in the UK economy would reduce consumer disposable  
income and could see a reduction in revenues across the industry,  
or a polarisation between cost leaders and premium operators. 
b) The implications of Brexit are uncertain and will continue to be for the 
next two to five years while exit terms are negotiated and the 
consequences are realised.
c) Terrorism in the UK has an impact on the way in which we operate and 
the safety of our customers and employees is of paramount importance. 
A prolonged terrorist campaign could ultimately reduce consumer 
spending habits.
Risk Management
The following sets out what the Board considers to be the principal risks which affect the Group at present, although it is not intended to be a comprehensive 
analysis of all the risks that the business may face. In addition, the key financial risks to the Group are detailed in note 26C to the financial statements.
Regulatory and compliance risks
Description Risk Mitigation and Monitoring
Legislative changes
Fuller’s operates in a highly regulated sector where 
government legislation impacts much of the way 
we do business and therefore the business model. 
Any significant changes in policy could lead to 
a sudden change in profitability or the long term 
decline of the business. 
The National Living Wage (NLW) and apprenticeship 
levy present challenges to the way in which we 
control staff costs, specifically in the managed 
houses, and the impact of the recent rates 
revaluation is expected to be significant. Similar 
changes in future could reduce profitability. 
Legislative changes to the sale of alcohol could 
reduce consumer spending habits.
We carefully monitor legislative developments and review sales trends and consumer habits  
to gauge their impact on our business. 
We participate in industry initiatives aimed at the responsible promotion and retailing of alcohol. 
We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the NLW legislation through review of our staff 
hours and pricing strategies and we are in a unique competitive position as we already pay the 
majority of our employees above the NLW. We are also monitoring closely the potential wider 
wage inflation impact.
We have diversified our offering to include soft drinks, coffee, food and accommodation 
to reduce our reliance on alcohol-based revenue. 
We continue to maintain ongoing dialogue with government and industry bodies and  
our Directors are members of key industry lobbying committees. 
Health and safety
The health and safety of the Group’s employees and 
customers is a key concern to us. We are required to 
comply with health and safety legislation, including 
fire safety, food hygiene and allergen measures.
Operating a large number of houses and sites 
increases the complexity of ensuring the highest 
health and safety standards are adhered to at  
all times.
A Health and Safety Committee oversees the operation of the Group’s health and safety  
policies and procedures, and regularly updates its policies and training programme to ensure all 
risks are identified and properly assessed and that relevant regulation is adhered to. We report 
and investigate all accidents and near misses and have appointed dedicated safety champions 
throughout the business.
In our Managed Pubs and Hotels we have automatic fire suppression systems in our kitchens 
to reduce fire risk.
All staff receive food hygiene and allergen awareness training as standard and regular kitchen 
audits/checks ensure they comply with the standards expected of them. Quality assurance 
checks on our core suppliers ensure hygiene standards have been adhered to before produce 
reaches our kitchens.
28
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Operational risks
Description Risk Mitigation and Monitoring
Business continuity and crisis management
The Group’s headquarters and sole brewing  
facility are based at the Griffin Brewery site in 
Chiswick. A disaster at this site would seriously 
disrupt operations.
Our managed houses represent a key revenue stream. 
The impact of a major disaster affecting a number of 
these over a period of time could be significant.
We take various measures to mitigate the impact of such an event. We continually monitor  
fire safety and invest in capital projects to reduce the risk of failure.
We store recipes and yeast off-site and have informal arrangements in place to use alternative facilities.
We have well-documented disaster recovery plans which are rehearsed regularly throughout the 
business to ensure that normalisation can occur as swiftly as possible after a serious incident and 
that any damage is contained.
Information technology
The Group is increasingly reliant on its information 
systems to operate on a daily basis and trading would 
be affected by any significant or prolonged failure 
of these systems.
The data held by the Group is a key business asset 
and personal data protection is key. Any significant 
loss of data could lead to a considerable interruption 
for the business and reputational damage.
To minimise this risk the IT function has a range of facilities and controls in place to ensure that in 
the event of an issue normal operation would be restored quickly.
These include a formal IT Recovery Plan, online replication of systems and data to a third party 
recovery facility, and external support for hardware and software.
The IT systems in place follow appropriate data protection guidelines to ensure the risk of both 
personal and Company data loss is minimal.
Recruitment and staff retention
The Group has a business model built upon 
recruiting the best people in order to support its 
strategy. There is a risk that if a number of key 
employees were to leave at the same time, it may  
risk the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
There is a risk that recruitment will become 
increasingly competitive and that staffing shortages 
within the hospitality industry could drive wage 
inflation, especially if restrictions to free movement 
of EU nationals are imposed as a result of Brexit.
The Group performs detailed succession planning to ensure that key roles are considered to 
ensure appropriate cover is available. In addition the remuneration policy is set up to ensure that 
the key members of our staff are appropriately remunerated to reduce the likelihood they are 
attracted to competitor businesses.
We have established a strategy which will ensure we continue to attract and retain highly trained, 
quality staff in all of our divisions and have invested in internal development as part of our Chefs’ 
Guild Scholarship programme. 
We have taken steps to ensure that we will be prepared for the impact of a potential reduction in 
qualified hospitality workers in the wake of Brexit and that we will remain the employer of choice. 
Economic and market risks
Description Risk Mitigation and Monitoring
Brands and reputation
Fuller’s has a wide portfolio of brands and has 
established an excellent reputation in the market. 
Principally, there is a risk that the Group’s beer 
could become contaminated at source or outlet, 
which could damage the reputation of the brand 
and deter customers.
The Group reduces product contamination risks to an acceptable level by ensuring that the 
business is operated to the highest standards by maintaining long term relationships with suppliers 
and by significant investment in security, quality control and cleaning. The Group has in place 
product recall procedures, which are regularly rehearsed, together with insurance coverage in the 
event of contamination. In addition, the Group runs an active and continuous training programme 
covering all aspects of the pub operations and provides its pubs with on-site technical support.
Loss of company values or a failure to adhere to them
Fuller’s is a company based on a strong set of  
values which are key to its success and future. 
Should these be undermined or not adhered to,  
the Company’s unique position and long-term  
future would be jeopardised.
The Company has a unique culture due to its share structure and history which ensures business 
decisions are taken for the long term benefit of the Company.
This culture also promotes a long term and collaborative approach that does not lead to excessive 
risk taking and the reward system encourages appropriate behaviour.
The share structure of the Company and family shareholder representation on the Board and 
involvement in the Company’s management ensure the values are maintained and followed. 
Consumer demand shifts
A significant part of the Group’s success is 
attributable to its ability to anticipate and react  
to consumer demand.
The way in which the Group responds to market 
changes is critical to its ongoing strategy and has  
a direct impact on all operational activity.
Management monitor and research consumer trends and run trials of new technologies, brands 
and products. 
We gather consumer feedback through Net Promoter Score surveys, customer complaints and 
online and social media reviews. 
We analyse retail pricing and market share data to ensure we are competitive but still premium. 
The Executive Committee approves all significant new product development and acquisition 
decisions and therefore controls key changes to the Group.

 t Fuller’s, we are very proud of our distribution 
 team – they are a key part of the relationship 
we have with our customers. Often, they are the 
Brewery team member who has the most contact 
with a licensee, our front line if you like.
A Fuller’s drayman is very conscious of the job 
they are there to do and the beer needs to get to 
the pub, come what may. They deal every day with 
traffic, weather, diversions and even the building 
of the cycle superhighway, which has created an 
interesting addition to the route in and out of the 
City of London. But they deal with it all in good 
humour and still help by putting the beer right 
into the cellar and often on the stillage too.
There is one other group of people who are always 
very pleased to see the Fuller’s dray – and that’s 
runners in the London Marathon, where it marks 
the half way point. Resplendent in its London 
Pride livery, it plays host not to beer, but to live 
entertainment – and we do the same for our 
annual Brewery Open Day. From horses to horse 
power, the Fuller’s dray has been a familiar site in 
London over the last two centuries – and long may 
it continue.

This is where our corporate social responsibility 
starts and those communities do not just revolve 
around geographical locations. They include all 
our team members throughout the business,  
our suppliers, local charities and the environment 
as a whole.
Our strong culture has always been one of caring 
and consideration and this continues today with 
one of our four key values being Always doing 
things the right way. At Fuller’s, that does not 
mean the cheapest or the quickest way, but  
the way that gives the best results for all our 
stakeholders, inside and outside the business.
There are four key areas where we implement  
an active Corporate Social Responsibility  
(CSR) strategy:
 — Charity and community support
 — Responsible retailing and supplier engagement
 — People
 — The environment
Charity and community support
We raise a substantial amount for a wide range  
of charities. As much of this is raised in our pubs, 
it is hard to quantify the amount exactly, but in 
the last year this was around £340,000 across 
the Company.
There are two main ongoing pieces of charitable 
activity that are activated as part of our day to 
day business, benefiting the charities Shooting 
Star Chase and Seafarers UK.
Shooting Star Chase is an amazing charity  
that helps improve the lives of children with 
life-limiting illnesses, both at home and in its two 
hospices. For every children’s meal that we sell, 
we donate 50p to the charity and we also donate 
£1 for every tasting board sold in our Ale & Pie 
pubs. This year, we have contributed just under 
£80,000 to Shooting Star Chase via these 
two initiatives. 
In total, during the financial year, we have raised 
just over £190,000 for the charity. As well as 
the meal donations, we have raised money 
through a game on our stand at The London 
Marathon Expo, donations at The Annual 
Sausage Roll Off, which is held at The Red Lion 
in Barnes, and numerous events in individual 
pubs. These have included a skydive by the team 
at The Mill at Elstead, undertaking the Three 
Peaks Challenge by team members at The Rose 
& Crown in Ealing and a £1 cheque challenge by 
The Red Lion Hotel in Hillingdon who collected 
over 600 £1 cheques for the charity.
The largest single amount outside the children’s 
meal donation came via our inaugural Fuller’s 
and Shooting Star Chase Bike Ride. In May 
2016, 22 riders left The Brewery in Chiswick and 
headed to our pub, The Pointer, on the Isle of 
Wight. The 100 mile route took in a number 
of our pubs, raising awareness of this excellent 
charity and our intrepid riders generated a 
donation of £40,000 for the event. It was so 
successful that it was repeated in May 2017, this 
time ending at The Boater in Bath – a distance 
of 125 miles and with over 40 riders participating.
We launched a trial of Pennies in five pubs 
during the year too, adding another 15 sites just 
before the year end. Pennies is an electronic 
charity box – with guests being offered the 
chance to round up their bill to the nearest 
Doubling our donations
This year we match funded 
£30,000 that was raised by our 
team members for a variety of 
charities, but we want to give 
more. This coming financial  
year we will be encouraging our 
employees to increase their  
Give As You Earn donations and 
we will match up to £2,000 per 
employee per year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. pound when they pay using a chip and pin 
machine, with the rounding going to charity. 
This year the sites generated an average of 
£25 per week, a total of £4,000, to add to 
our Shooting Star Chase total.
Our other main corporate charity is Seafarers 
UK, where our relationship goes back over a 
decade. Seafarers UK is a charity that helps 
people in the maritime community by providing 
vital support to seafarers in need and their 
families. We support Seafarers UK by donating 
£5 per barrel of Seafarers Ale and this year we 
donated just over £29,000 to the charity. 
We are looking forward to continuing to support 
Seafarers UK in the coming year, when this 
valuable charity celebrates its centenary.
We brewed another charity beer during the  
year for a very limited period in the run up to 
Christmas. Wise Men was produced in support 
of Prostate Cancer UK. This delicious seasonal 
beer certainly seemed to resonate with our 
customers and we very quickly sold the entire 
stock, raising £15,000 for this worthwhile cause.
Fuller’s makes a number of donations through 
the Charities Aid Foundation to charities that 
are either local to our sites at Chiswick, 
Horndean in Hampshire and Duloe in Cornwall, 
that have relevance to us due to the nature of 
our industry, such as alcohol-related charities, or 
that involve a connection to the business such as 
through an employee. This year, for instance, we 
have given £29,000 to alcohol-related charities. 
In the coming year, we will be running a series 
of workshops focusing on Give As You Earn to 
make sure that our team members are able to 
donate to charity in a tax efficient manner and 
to open access to a larger pot of money for 
matched funding. We will be encouraging team 
members to open their own Charities Aid 
Foundation accounts and we will also match fund 
any regular donations employees make under 
this method, up to £2,000 per person per year. 
We expect this will greatly increase the sum of 
money we donate through match funding, which 
this year was £30,000, and have set a target in 
the future of raising the equivalent of 1% of our 
profits for charitable causes.
As always, we continue to support a plethora  
of raffles, fetes and events with brewery tour 
vouchers or free beer for the organisers to sell  
to raise money. We do this around Chiswick, 
Horndean and Duloe and feel it is an important 
way to be a good neighbour and support our  
local communities.
Our managed and tenanted pubs also raise 
money for causes local to them and the figure 
raised during the year from this activity is in the 
region of £70,000.
We have some very longstanding community 
sponsorships with local events. We sponsor the 
Fuller’s Brewery Surrey County Cricket League 
and the Head of the River IVs, as well as the 
Hampshire Village of the Year. We provide a 
glass for every participant and prizes for the 
winners of the Thames Towpath Ten, a local race 
that we have teamed up with for the last 12 years 
and we donate beer to the Hospital of St Cross, 
an almshouse near Winchester, which sells  
the beer to raise money for the home and  
its residents. 
Finally, in another piece of great community 
support, we have supported the installation of 
defibrillators at two of our pubs – The Fisherman’s 
Haunt in Winkton and The Ship at Langstone. 
The units are installed externally at the pubs  
so in the case of an emergency in the local area, 
the medics or ambulance crews can bring the 
patient to the pub to use the equipment. It is 
a valuable local service with particular relevance 
in rural areas.

supplier engagement
In the past, responsible retailing in the 
pub sector has tended to focus on alcohol 
consumption, but today, the focus is just 
as concentrated on the food agenda.
This year has seen a major focus on allergens  
and allergen training. We have joined the 
Anaphylaxis Campaign and we have rolled out  
a comprehensive training programme to ensure 
that all of our Managed House team members 
check before taking an order whether any diner 
has allergy requirements. 
Focused on fresh ingredients
Fresh produce is vitally important to our 
business and we work in genuine partnership 
with our suppliers to get great meat, fish 
and fresh fruit and vegetables. Take 
Sheringhams for instance, working with 
British farmers to get the best seasonal 
produce at its peak. That’s why if you have 
broad beans in a Fuller’s pub in June, they 
will have travelled less than 100 miles and 
you can really taste the freshness. Truly 
British, truly local, truly summer.

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Issues around obesity continue to dominate the 
headlines and we took the decision during the 
year to change the Pepsi on our soda guns in our 
Managed estate to sugar-free Pepsi Max. This 
reflects changing consumer trends in our own 
venues and UK sales in general. We have used 
a sugar free lemonade on our soda gun for many 
years, so the move to a sugar-free cola was a 
natural progression.
We have also continued work to reduce the 
sugar and salt content of our menus, through 
a number of initiatives. We have introduced 
new training to upskill our chefs’ understanding 
of healthy food and this has led to less salt 
being put into our dishes. We always have salt 
and pepper on the table so customers can still 
add their own, but the choice is in the hands 
of the customer.
In addition, we add no seasoning to food on the 
children’s menu and our children’s pizza is made 
using seaweed as a salt substitute. We have also 
worked hard to put more low fat/light options on 
the menu and increased the range of dishes 
suitable for vegans and vegetarians. With a focus 
on fresh food, we use no processed products, 
which gives us full control of ingredients and  
we ensure there are minimal nitrates in our  
cured products. 
Working in partnership with local suppliers is one 
of our key tenets and we have good transparency 
in our food chain. All our contracted suppliers 
are audited to ensure they have CSR policies and 
there are some basic principles, such as only 
using free range eggs, which we adhere 
to stringently. Any fresh meat or fruit and veg 
that can be sourced from within the UK is, so we 
keep our food miles to a minimum, and by having 
long term relationships with our suppliers they 
have the confidence to invest and we have 
confidence in the quality, provenance and safety 
of the food we purchase. Where we cannot 
source from the UK, we still maintain an ethical 
stance – for instance, our Brewer Street Coffee 
is 100% Fairtrade.
Finally, we continue to be a responsible retailer 
of alcohol. We have our own range of soft drinks, 
produced by Cornish Orchards, and sales of our 
Brewer Street coffee remain strong. We avoid 
discounted drinks promotions and are supporters 
of the PASS scheme to prevent those under  
18 from having access to alcohol.
People
The fantastic people in our business make us 
successful and set us apart from the competition 
and we continue to invest heavily in training and 
development. During the year, our team members 
undertook over 15,000 days of training. 
One of our key aims this year was to instigate  
a cultural change in the way our Brewery teams 
view health and safety. We held our first 
Brewery employee engagement event, to bring 
this to life in a fun and motivating way. This was 
combined with some e-learning and we are now 
at the point where every Brewery employee in 
Brewing and Operations is trained to Level 2 
Health and Safety qualification standard.
Lost days due to accidents have decreased by 
21%, from 58 in the last full year to just 46 this 
year. In addition, during the period we have had 
an 80% drop in reportable accidents from five to 
just one.
On a wider scale, we continue to offer a wide 
range of career paths and opportunities for  
our employees and this year, 66% of our 
appointments have been filled with internal 
promotions – up from 35% in 2014. As well as 
linear career paths, the diverse nature of our 
growing business allows for a career path that 
crosses from one part of the business to another. 
The Fuller’s & Shooting Star 
Chase Cycle Challenge
Some were experienced, some were novices, 
some were just brave – that sums up the 22 
people who left The Griffin Brewery in Chiswick 
at 7am on Friday 13 May, 2016 to cycle to The 
Pointer in Newchurch on the Isle of Wight. The 
weather was perfect, the five pubs the intrepid 
explorers visited along the way provided the 
warm welcome Fuller’s is famous for and 
Shooting Star Chase benefited to the tune 
of £40,000. An all-round success – with only 
one puncture and a slap-up BBQ at the end.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. As an example, the Sales and Operations 
Manager from the Brewery in Chiswick has been 
promoted to Head of Operations at Nectar, 
while a Fuller’s Inns Operations Manager was 
promoted to the position of Operations Director 
at The Stable.
We have increased the focus on employee 
benefits during the year too, with the issue of  
our first ever benefits statements to remind our 
employees of the many perks of a job at Fuller’s. 
Although the benefits on offer depend on the 
part of the business and level an employee is in, 
the range includes shares, staff discounts and 
private health care.
Finally, it has been a difficult year for our 
European team members with the result of the 
referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. 
We are very proud of the contribution made to 
our success by all of our employees and we have 
decided to assist with the process and pay the 
permanent residency fee for any EU or EEA 
employee who is eligible and has worked for us 
for at least 12 months. This has been well 
received and nearly 200 team members have 
either applied or expressed an interest.
The environment
We made further strides during the year  
to reduce our impact on the environment.  
A number of improvements in our cellars using 
remote cooler pumps and a new gas for our 
remote coolers has reduced energy consumption 
and we are using variable fan speed motors, which 
accelerate as trade increases and decelerate as it 
slows. We have also installed our first heat 
recovery system from cellar cooling at The Head 
of the River in Oxford. It is early days, but again 
this should generate savings in both energy use 
and environmental impact, as well as costs.
At the Brewery, we have installed solar panels 
and converted to electric forklift trucks, which 
will reduce our carbon footprint. In addition, 
we have moved our main printers to a Follow Me 
printing system. This allows the user to collect 
printing from any printer in the business by 
swiping their ID card. Any uncollected printing 
is removed from the printer’s memory after 
24 hours. This has reduced paper usage in the 
brewery by 5.8%.
Our pubs carry out recycling on site including 
food, glass, card and plastic and all our pubs  
have their waste oil collected and recycled for use 
as bio-diesel. In addition, we continue to look at 
ways to reduce our effluent levels at the Brewery.
Brewing is historically a very green process 
and we still reduce our waste by sending the 
by-products of the brewing process for pig feed, 
and for cattle and lamb feed during winter 
months. To complete nature’s circle, we buy these 
animals from the butcher for sale in our pubs.
While we are a long way from being carbon 
neutral, we do continually look at ways to reduce 
our carbon footprint and reduce our impact on 
the environment.

ENTHUSIASM.

EMPOWERMENT.
O 
ur Service Coach programme was launched 
in August 2012. The Olympics had just 
finished and although our plans were already in 
place, the Olympic Games Makers added an extra 
inspiration. The idea behind our initiative was to 
create a team of people who had customer service 
firmly front and centre – and not just be able to 
deliver it themselves, but to instil the same ethos 
in the rest of the team.
It formed part of the Every Customer Leaves 
Happy strategy. A Service Coach will always go 
the extra mile. They can help out at other pubs in 
times of need. They belong to an elite team and 
they are ever present at our big events – ready to 
help, to guide and to lead when necessary.
Being a Service Coach also forms part of the 
career structure for our pub teams. Over the last 
five years, we have grown the number of service 
coaches in our business. We are not quite there 
yet – but we have a goal of making sure each pub 
has at least one. And some of them have 
progressed even further up the Fuller’s career 
ladder – with at least six former service coaches 
now managing their own pubs. Customer service 
back, front and centre – that’s the Fuller’s way.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.
39 Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report to shareholders together with the 
audited financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017. 
Strategic Report
The statements and reviews on pages 8 to 37 comprise the Strategic 
Report which includes information about the Group’s strategy and  
business model as well as providing an update on the business and financial 
performance during the year and indications of likely future developments, 
KPIs, principal risks and uncertainties and the Group’s financial 
management and treasury policies. 
Directors 
A list of Directors who served during the financial year, together with 
biographical details, is given on pages 38 and 39. 
Ian Bray resigned as a Director with effect from 31 May 2016. On the 
recommendation of the Nominations Committee, Simon Dodd was 
appointed by the Board of Directors with effect from 1 August 2016.  
In accordance with the Articles of Association, his reappointment will be 
subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
John Dunsmore, Richard Fuller and Jonathon Swaine retire by rotation  
at the Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-election. 
Richard Fuller and Jonathon Swaine are Executive Directors and have  
a rolling service contract of 12 months’ duration. 
Details of all Directors’ interests as at the end of the financial year  
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 67. 
Dividends
The Company paid an interim dividend of 7.25p per ‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary 
share of 40p each and 0.725p per ‘B’ ordinary share of 4p each on  
3 January 2017. The Directors now recommend a final dividend of 11.55p 
per ‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary share of 40p each and 1.155p per ‘B’ ordinary share 
of 4p each. This makes a total dividend for the financial year of 18.80p per 
‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary share of 40p each and 1.88p per ‘B’ ordinary shares  
of 4p each.
The total proposed final dividend on ordinary shares will be £6,378,000 
which together with the 2017 interim dividend paid of £4,009,000 and the 
£120,000 of cumulative preference dividends paid will make total dividends 
of £10,507,000.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office as at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information (as defined in Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 
2006) of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware and each Director 
has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information to establish that the 
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information. The Auditors, Grant 
Thornton UK LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office, 
and a resolution that they be re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Indemnity provisions
The Articles of Association provide the Directors with indemnities in relation 
to their duties as Directors, including qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions (within the meaning of the Companies Acts). All of the Executive 
Directors’ contracts contain a clause which states: “the Executive shall be 
indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any liability incurred 
by him as a Director or other officer of the Company in defending any 
proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in which judgement is given in his 
favour or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application under 
the Companies Acts in which relief from liability is granted to him by the 
court from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust 
he may be guilty of in relation to the affairs of the Company.” The Company 
purchases Directors and Officers liability insurance which gives appropriate 
cover for any legal action brought against its Directors. This insurance also 
covers the Trustees of the Company’s defined benefit pension scheme. 
James Douglas is a Trustee of the Scheme.
Political donations
The Group does not make political donations. 
Purchase of own shares 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 July 2016, the Company was 
given authority to purchase up to 4,846,553 ‘A’ ordinary shares to be held 
as treasury shares to be used in connection with, among other purposes, 
the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and/or other share option schemes. 
This authority will expire at the Annual General Meeting and shareholders 
will be asked to give a similar authority to purchase shares up to 15% of the 
‘A’ ordinary share capital at that date. 
The Company’s maximum issued ordinary share capital during the year was 
£22,793,726 comprising 33,553,879 40p ‘A’ ordinary shares, 89,052,625 
4p ‘B’ ordinary shares and 14,525,173 40p ‘C’ ordinary shares. 
During the year the Company purchased a total of 341,415 40p ‘A’ 
ordinary shares at a total cost of £3,506,525.61 (exclusive of stamp duty). 
These share purchases represented 0.25% of the maximum issued ordinary 
shares and 1.02% of the Company’s issued ‘A’ ordinary share capital. 
101,813 40p ‘A’ ordinary shares held in treasury, with a value of 
£923,299.30, were transferred to the Trustee of the LTIP. 108,057 40p 
‘A’ ordinary shares held in treasury were allocated to participants of the 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Executive Share Option 
Scheme on exercise of options, generating net cash proceeds of 
£827,331.48. As at 1 April 2017, a total of 1,263,830 40p ‘A’ ordinary 
shares and a total of 4,558,009 4p ‘B’ ordinary shares are held as  
treasury shares.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Employees
The Group gives a high priority to communication with all its employees 
and pensioners thus encouraging a common awareness of the financial  
and economic factors affecting the Group. Increasingly, the Company’s 
intranet and e-mail systems facilitate this, and we will continue to search for 
ways to exploit these media to best effect. Twice a year, all Brewery-based 
employees are invited to a results presentation led by the Chief Executive. 
Once a year the Company also runs “Connection Week” where one person 
from each pub is invited to a conference at which a number of messages  
are communicated. That employee returns to their pub and shares the 
information with their colleagues. News is regularly communicated via both 
traditional notice boards and e-mail distributions as well as town-hall style 
meetings. The communications policy, which is in operation throughout 
the business, is designed to ensure the successful cascading of information. 
A structure of consultation committees at both Divisional and Corporate 
level is in place to facilitate a dialogue between the Group and 
representatives of all employees including union members. Taken together, 
these communications have allowed the Group to engage successfully 
with all our employees, wherever they are employed.
The Group’s recruitment policy is designed to ensure that all applications 
for employment, including those made by disabled persons, are given 
full and fair consideration, in light of applicants’ particular aptitudes and 
abilities. The Group also has an equal opportunities policy which is designed 
to ensure that all employees are treated equally in terms of training, career 
development and promotion. Where employees develop a disability during 
their employment by the Group, every effort is made to continue their 
employment and arrange for appropriate training, career development and 
promotion as far as is reasonably practicable. Development and training of 
our employees at all levels has always been a priority at Fuller’s.
The Company continues to offer qualifying staff a Savings Related  
Share Option Scheme, a Share Incentive Plan and a variety of  
performance-related bonus arrangements, which serve to encourage  
staff interest in the Group’s performance. Staff throughout the Group  
are given an ‘Inndulgence’ card allowing them to benefit from a staff 
discount scheme in the Group’s managed pubs.
Share capital
Information on the Company’s capital structure and related restrictions  
is given in note 27 to the financial statements. Details of significant 
shareholdings are set out below.
Computershare Trustees Limited holds a total of 392,490 40p ‘A’ ordinary 
shares on behalf of employees of the Company who are participants in its 
SIP. This represents 1.22% of the issued ‘A’ ordinary share capital (excluding 
shares held in treasury). In respect of the shares that have been allocated, 
Computershare Trustees Limited exercises voting rights in relation to those 
shares, having consulted with the participants about their voting intentions.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company had been advised under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules that the following held an interest in 3% or more of the voting rights

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Directors’ Report continued
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association state that the Board may appoint Directors  
and that at the subsequent Annual General Meeting, shareholders may 
elect any such Director. Alternatively the Company may directly appoint  
a Director. The Articles also contain the power for the Company to remove 
any Director by special resolution and appoint someone in his place by 
ordinary resolution. There are various other circumstances under the 
Articles which would mean that the office of a Director would be vacated, 
including if he resigns, becomes of unsound mind or bankrupt.
At every Annual General Meeting one-third of the Directors who are 
subject to retirement by rotation or, if their number is not three or any 
multiple of three, then the number nearest to but not exceeding one-third 
shall retire from office but, if there is only one Director who is subject to 
retirement by rotation, he shall retire. In addition, if any Director has at the 
start of the Annual General Meeting been in office for more than three 
years since his last appointment or re-appointment, he shall retire at that 
Annual General Meeting.
The Articles do not contain any specific provisions about amendments  
to the Articles which are therefore governed by the relevant Companies 
Act requirements which state that the Articles may only be amended 
by special resolution.
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association and 
UK legislation, the business of the Company is managed by the Board 
which may exercise all the powers of the Company. The Articles of the 
Company have a section entitled “Powers and Duties of the Board” which 
sets out powers such as the rights to establish local boards, to appoint 
agents, to delegate and to appoint persons with the designation “Director” 
without implying that the person is a Director of the Company. There are 
further sections of the Articles entitled “Allotment of Shares” setting out 
the Board’s power to issue shares and purchase the Company’s own shares, 
and “Borrowing Powers” setting out the provisions concerning the 
Company’s power to borrow and give security. The Directors have been 
authorised to allot and issue ordinary shares. These powers are exercised 
under authority of resolutions of the Company passed at its Annual 
General Meeting.
The Group has entered into a number of agreements with the major 
brewers operating in the UK under which it both buys and sells beers  
and these agreements may be terminated by the other party should  
the Group undergo a change of control.
In the event of a change of control the Company is obliged to notify its 
main bank Lenders of such. The Lenders shall not be obliged to fund any 
new borrowing requests and the facilities will lapse after 30 days from  
the change of control if terms on which they can continue have not been 
agreed. All borrowings including accrued interest will become repayable 
within 10 days of such a lapse.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Directors’ Statements
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the  
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the 
Annual Report, the Remuneration Report and the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law  
and those International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have elected to prepare 
the financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Group and Company  
for the financial period. In preparing the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation 
of Financial Statements and then apply them consistently;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 — make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern;
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group and Company’s financial position and financial performance;
 — state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRS,  
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the  
financial statements; and
 — make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and  
the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable regulations, including the requirements of the Listing Rules and 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) and in the case of the 
Group financial statements, with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. The Directors consider 
the Annual Report and the financial statements, taken as a whole, provides 
the information necessary to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy and is fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement as to Preparation of Financial Statements
The Directors confirm, to the best of their knowledge:
 — that these financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Company taken 
as a whole; and
 — that the Annual Report and the Strategic Report includes a fair review  
of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group and Company taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors of Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. are listed on pages 38 and 39.
Directors’ Statement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving  
the Directors’ Report are listed on page 38 and 39. Having made enquiries 
of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these Directors 
confirms that:
 — to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of this report of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 — each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken to be aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Corporate Governance Report
I am pleased to confirm that I see it as the Chairman’s responsibility to  
lead the Board and make sure it is working effectively. This year we are  
able to report full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”) as revised in September 2014. There are several key issues 
that I want to comment on. One of these is the issue of succession 
planning. This is a complex topic for a business that has very low turnover 
amongst its senior management and is still very much a family controlled 
concern whilst also being a listed public company. However, succession 
plans continue to be discussed both at Executive Committee and Board 
level. Throughout the business, succession plans are in place at 
departmental level and are reviewed regularly by the relevant Directors in 
conjunction with their Executive colleagues and their personnel advisors. 
Furthermore, all department plans are compiled into a Company 
succession plan which provides effective review of cross-departmental 
promotion and opportunities. 
In terms of Board balance, I chair the Nominations Committee and am 
personally involved in all Board level recruitment. Therefore, I am able  
to ensure that we continue to have a good balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on our Board and our Board Committees.  
I am satisfied that our Board is comprised of the right individuals who  
have the skills required to run this type of business and to respond to the 
challenges presented by the continually changing environment in which  
we operate. The Board recognises the importance of all types of diversity 
for Board effectiveness. We continue to believe that appointments  
should be made on the basis of merit against the selection criteria 
for any particular role. 
We believe that you can only have an effective Board when all members 
understand what is required of them and when they all have time to conduct 
their duties. All of our Directors have detailed appointment letters or 
contracts which set out their duties. We confirm that appointment letters 
for Non-Executive Directors set out the expected time commitment 
required. We also have a policy that the Directors can only take on 
additional roles with Board approval. In line with the Code, the terms of 
appointment for all our Non-Executives specifically state that the role of 
the Non-Executive Directors is to challenge and help develop strategy.
Finally, I would like shareholders to understand that I am in charge of 
our annual Board evaluation. I am aware that larger PLCs are required to 
seek external assistance to effect this process but do not believe that this 
would be likely to add extra value as long as our own process is robust. 
I believe that we have that robustness and that the manner in which the 
evaluation is carried out encourages a healthy debate on things that could 
be improved.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Introduction and compliance
The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and believes that such standards are critical to overall business 
integrity and performance. This report explains how the Company applies 
the principles of the Code which shareholders can find on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk.
The Company has complied with the requirements of the Code, as 
applicable to a smaller quoted company, throughout the financial year.
The information that is required by Code provision C.1.2 on the business 
model and the strategy for delivering the Company’s objectives can be 
found in the Strategic Report on page 8 to 37. The information relating  
to the share capital of the Company that is required by DTR 7.2.6R  
can be found within the Directors’ Report, on pages 40 and 41.
The Board
The Board’s role
The Board of Directors is collectively responsible to the shareholders  
for the performance and long term success of the Group. Its role includes 
the establishment, review and monitoring of strategic objectives, approval 
of major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure, ownership of  
the corporate values, overseeing the Group’s systems of internal controls, 
governance and risk management and ensuring that the appropriate 
resources are in place to deliver these and fulfil the Company’s obligations 
to its stakeholders.
How the Board works
The Board governs through its executive management, and formally via  
its other clearly mandated Committees. Each standing Board Committee 
has specific written terms of reference which are reviewed by the Board 
annually and there is a formal list of Matters Reserved for the Board (which 
is also reviewed annually). This distinguishes between matters reserved  
for the Board and Executive Committee decisions. The terms of reference 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available  
on the Company’s website. All Committee Chairmen report orally on the 
proceedings of their Committees at the next meeting of the Board, and the 
minutes of the meetings of all Board Committees (with some exceptions  
on remuneration matters) are provided to Board members. The Chairman 
ensures that the Executive Directors provide accurate and timely 
information for Board meetings which is then open to debate and challenge 
by all. Meetings enjoy open dialogue and constructive challenge on all issues 
is encouraged. With a good information flow between and prior to Board 
meetings, decisions are made in a timely manner after appropriate 
questions are dealt with. The Board has adopted a procedure, in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles, to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company.
Board Meetings
The Board meets formally at least six times a year with papers circulated a 
week in advance and the agenda and papers for these meetings are subject 
to the scrutiny of the Chairman and the Company Secretary. However the 
Board regularly considers matters on an ad hoc basis between scheduled 
meetings. The Executive Committee meets formally at least eleven times  
a year and also meets informally most weeks. There is thus a regular flow  
of information at Board and Executive Committee level.
At Board meetings, the agendas cover projects, analysis of the market  
in which the Group operates and performance. Each of the Executive 
Directors and the Company Secretary also update the Board at each 
meeting on matters for which they are responsible. The Board is responsible 
for approving the annual budget and the annual and half year results.  
At the beginning of some of the Board meetings, a Divisional Director 
or Senior Manager is invited to join the meeting and inform the Board of 
developments in their area of the business. The Board also meets away from 
the Griffin Brewery every year for an in-depth review of corporate strategy, 
and other agenda items might include an update on the economy and a 
review of the Group’s competitors. The Non-Executive Directors from 
time to time meet with members of the senior management team at the 
Brewery and also spend days out in the trade with individual members of 
that team. This helps to keep the Non-Executive Directors up to date with 
the operations of the Group and also provides the Executive Directors with 
valuable feedback about the Company’s people and its operations.
The Executive Committee is chaired by Simon Emeny and its meetings 
focus on the detail of the Group’s performance. The Finance Director  
leads a review of the Group’s management accounts and presents updates 
on treasury and credit control. Each Executive Director and the Company 
Secretary update their colleagues on the key issues facing their part of the 
business. There is a good level of consultation and debate at these meetings. 
The list of Matters Reserved for the Board sets out which matters need 
Board approval and which decisions can be made at Executive Committee 
level. Most significant business decisions are made by the Board, but 
matters such as health and safety policy and approving major contracts are 
taken at Executive Committee level. At the beginning of most Executive 
Committee meetings, a Senior Manager is invited to join the meeting and 
talk to the Committee about the issues in their department. Three times 
a year, all of the divisional directors and financial controllers join together 
with the Executive Committee to conduct a detailed review of the half year 
and full year accounts, and to construct the annual budget, before these are 
debated at Board level. 
As well as the dialogue within the boardroom, the Non-Executive Directors 
meet privately, under the leadership of the Senior Independent Director, 
without the Executive Directors present. They also meet with the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive on a regular basis. These meetings allow 
for the review of issues faced by the business, the continuation of dialogue 
on strategic issues, the discussion of Board appointments when appropriate, 
succession planning, and the provision of support to the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive in their roles.

Attendance at Board and Committee Meetings
The table above gives details of attendance at Board and Committee 
meetings during the year.
The Board believes that all of its members have sufficient time to discharge 
their duties effectively. All Directors are required to seek permission before 
accepting any external appointments, therefore Board members are kept 
fully aware of their colleagues’ other commitments.
Composition and balance of the Board
Michael Turner is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness and openness, and that communications with shareholders 
are valuable. The Chairman does not have any commitments which 
constrain his ability to fulfil his role. Simon Emeny is responsible for  
all operational aspects of the Group.
During the period, Ian Bray resigned as a Director with effect from 31 May 
2016. On the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, Simon 
Dodd was appointed to the Board with effect from 1st August 2016. New 
Directors undertake a tailored induction programme. 
The Company has five Non-Executive Directors, two of whom – Sir James 
Fuller and Michael Turner – are family members. This representation is 
very important in a company with a high proportion of family shareholders. 
The other three Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are deemed 
independent under the Code, are experienced business leaders and all of 
the Non-Executive Directors bring a wide range of skills and experiences to 
the Board. The Directors consider that the Board is well-balanced as it has 
the right number of members for the size of the Group and the Directors 
agree that no one individual dominates discussions and that each makes a 
full and positive contribution. The Directors’ biographies are on pages 38 
and 39. John Dunsmore is the Senior Independent Director and an 
industry expert who brings knowledge, support and advice to the Chairman 
and all the other Board members; he is in regular dialogue with all Board 
members outside of Board meetings and co-ordinates the views of the 
Non-Executive Directors as and when required. All of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and there are no relationships or circumstances 
which could affect or appear to affect their judgement; all are appointed 
for specified terms. The details of the Non-Executive Directors’ respective 
arrangements are as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 51 to 67 and are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Advice for the Board
There is a procedure in place under which Directors can obtain independent 
professional advice. The Directors also have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with. The Directors are 
satisfied that any concerns they raise at Board meetings are recorded  
in the minutes. The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover  
in respect of legal action against its Directors and Officers.
Professional development
All Directors attend training courses, industry forums and specialist 
briefings relevant to their role throughout the year. Occasionally, specialists 
such as the Company’s actuary or corporate lawyer join a Board meeting 
to brief the Board on a particular topic. Both the Board and the Executive 
Committee visit Group pubs and hotels as part of the Board meeting 
programme. On these and on other occasions, Board meetings may be held 
in the Group’s pubs, with the aim of keeping the Directors familiar with the  
Group’s estate. Executive Directors are permitted to hold one other paid 
directorship, with the Board’s consent, as the Board believes that experience 
of how other boards work enhances the Directors’ contribution to Fuller’s. 
Simon Emeny currently holds such a directorship at Dunelm Group plc.
46
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Board evaluation
The Chairman conducts an annual evaluation of the Board, where all Board 
members are asked to rate the Board’s work across a number of different 
topics, with constructive criticism encouraged, via the medium of a 
questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions on the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge, diversity (including gender 
diversity), how the Board works as a unit and other factors relevant to its 
effectiveness. Where necessary, the Chairman seeks clarification on the 
responses given; he then consolidates the responses and reports back  
to the Board, highlighting significant improvements and deteriorations in 
any particular area by comparing results with previous years’ outputs and 
agreeing actions to tackle any areas requiring improvement. Unattributed 
comments of significance are shared with all. This year the results were 
marginally lower than last year’s scores. The results did provide some insight 
into areas that could be improved further and these were debated at a 
Board meeting and were the Chairman’s focus in terms of follow up.  
The Audit and Remuneration Committees conduct similar assessments  
and their work is also commented upon in the evaluation conducted by  
the Chairman. The Senior Non-Executive Director annually appraises  
the Chairman’s performance, having first consulted with the other 
Non-Executive Directors and also the Executive team. The appraisal  
of the other Executive Directors and the Company Secretary is conducted 
annually by the Chairman or Chief Executive and, as part of the appraisal 
process, individual training and development needs are discussed.  
The annual appraisal of the Non-Executive Directors is conducted  
by the Chairman, following consultation with the Executive team.
Board re-election
The Articles of Association of the Company ensure that all Directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting 
after their appointment and to re-election at three-yearly intervals.
Board Committees
The Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee Chairman is Michael Turner and the other 
members are John Dunsmore and Lynn Fordham. It is responsible for 
nominating candidates for appointment as Directors, for approval by the 
Board although the full Board will also typically informally discuss Board 
appointments. The Committee met once during the year to consider the 
appointment of a new Managing Director for The Fuller’s Beer Company. 
The Board does not believe that setting percentage targets for the number 
of women on the Board is appropriate, given the key principle  
of appointing on merit. As and when Board vacancies arise and should  
the support of an executive search firm be required, the Board and the 
Nominations Committee will ensure that it only uses firms that have signed 
up to their industry’s Voluntary Code of Conduct (prepared in response  
to Lord Davies’ report). Further information on gender diversity across  
the business can be found in the Corporate and Social Responsibility 
Report, on page 34.
The Remuneration Committee
Information about the Remuneration Committee and Remuneration 
Policy is given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board, chaired by Lynn Fordham, comprises 
the three Independent Non-Executive Directors and meets at least four 
times a year. The members of the Audit Committee consider that they  
have the requisite skills and experience to fulfil the responsibilities of the 
Committee. In addition, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance 
Director and members of the finance team join the meetings on a regular 
basis, as do the external Audit Partner and Audit Manager.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee encourages comprehensive debate 
and scrutiny of management’s and auditors’ reports by the Committee 
members. She also meets with the manager responsible for internal audits, 
the external Audit Partner and the Finance Director outside of Audit 
Committee meetings to give them the opportunity to raise any concerns 
they may have about their work or their roles and to provide advice and 
support as required. 
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities are outlined in the Committee’s 
terms of reference and cover all those matters required by the Code.  
The Committee has a meeting planner which sets out the key items to  
be covered at its regular meetings which include reviewing the financial 
statements and announcements, monitoring changes in accounting 
practices and policies and reviewing decisions with a significant element  
of judgement. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring 
that the Company’s risk monitoring programme, internal audit processes 
and regulatory compliance are appropriate. At all meetings an update  
on risk management is presented. The Chairman of the Committee 
encourages debate and discussion of topical issues outside of the routine 
agenda items and ensures that such discussions are held at least twice 
a year. The Audit Committee has responsibility for the oversight of the 
external audit function. At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee 
provides confirmation to the Board as to how it has discharged its 
responsibilities so that the Board can be satisfied that information 
presented in the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. 
During its review of the Group’s financial statements for the period  to         
1 April 2017, the Audit Committee has reviewed the key judgements 
applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, 
including those communicated by the auditors during their reporting. These 
are described in the accounting policies detailed in note 1 of the financial 
statements. The Board was made fully aware of any significant financial 
reporting issues and judgements made in connection with the preparation 
of the financial statements. 
47
Governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Key accounting judgement How the issue was addressed
Separately disclosed items The Audit Committee considered the nature of items classified as “separately disclosed items” in the financial statements. 
The Committee was satisfied that the items management proposed to show as separately disclosed items are not linked to 
the underlying trading of the Group. Separately disclosed items continue to include:
 — Profit or loss on property disposals
 — Transaction costs on site acquisitions both completed and aborted
 — Reorganisation costs, principally related to The Fuller’s Beer Company
 — The Stable deemed remuneration in relation to the revaluation of the option to purchase the remaining share in          
The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited.
 — Net movement on revaluation of financial instruments that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting
 — Net interest expense on the Group’s defined benefit pension plan.
In addition, the Committee reviewed these disclosures within the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts to ensure they are 
clearly identified and reconciled to the relevant GAAP measure.  
Impairment testing of  
goodwill and property,  
plant and equipment
The Committee considered the proposed impairment of property assets and goodwill for both the Half Year Report and 
the Annual Report. The Committee was satisfied with the approach presented by management and the judgements made 
for those properties at risk of impairment.
Pension accounting The pension liability is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions applied in measuring future cash outflows. The use of 
assumptions such as discount rate and inflation which have an impact on the valuation of the defined benefit pension 
scheme, was assessed by the Committee.  The Committee was satisfied with the proposed accounting treatment and 
revised disclosures of the Group's defined benefit plan in the financial statements.
Subsidiary share  
purchase options
The Committee considered the fair value of the liabilities recognised in the financial statements for the subsidiary share 
purchase options relating to the remaining shares in The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited and Nectar Imports Limited. The 
Committee was satisfied with the approach presented by management and the judgements made in the calculation of the 
potential option liabilities. 
The key issues and judgements considered by the Audit Committee are 
detailed in the accompanying table. The presentation of financial 
information within the Annual Report was also discussed given the financial 
statements are for the 53 weeks to 1 April 2017, compared to 52 weeks 
ended 26 March 2016, including the supplementary disclosure in relation 
to the impact of the 53rd week within the Financial Review. 
The Audit Committee assessed the going concern and viability reviews 
undertaken by management as detailed in the Financial Review on page 27. 
The Committee was satisfied with the approach presented by management 
and the judgements made in the estimation of future cash flows.
Other items discussed in the year included the Company’s risk 
management process, of selected individual risks from the risk register, the 
internal audit work completed during the period and progress on actions 
arising from both risk management and internal audits. The Group’s tax 
strategy and tax risk management governance processes were also reviewed 
and approved in advance of review and approval by the Board.
The Audit Committee has a primary responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the re-appointment and removal  
of external auditors. The Company put the role of the auditors to tender 
during 2013 and following tenders from three firms for audit services,  
the decision to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP was made. The Company’s 
year ended 1 April 2017 was the fourth of a five year maximum term that 
the current Audit Partner has been in the role for the Company.
There is in place a whistle blowing policy, which is overseen by the Audit 
Committee, and which allows staff to raise any concerns in confidence, 
directly with the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Posters reminding 
staff about the existence of the policy and how it may be used are reissued 
annually in order to maintain a good awareness of the whistleblowing 
arrangements throughout the Company. 
The Committee also reviewed its own effectiveness during the year.
The Directors’ statement on the Company’s system of internal controls  
is set out on page 49.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Accountability
Auditors
The Committee is happy for the Board to recommend to shareholders the 
re-election of Grant Thornton UK LLP who were appointed in September 
2013 following a formal tender process. Their effectiveness will be formally 
reviewed by the Committee at the September 2017 meeting, although 
there are no issues of concern with their performance to date.
The Group’s auditors may from time to time provide non-audit services to 
the Company. In 2017, the fees paid to Grant Thornton UK LLP for audit 
services were £129,000 (including £44,000 for the audit of subsidiaries), 
for audit-related services were £1,000, other assurance services of 
£15,000 and for non-audit services were £5,500. The Committee imposes 
an upper limit of £50,000 per annum on the amount that the finance team 
can spend with the auditors for non-audit items without specific approval 
from the Committee. It is Group policy to seek quotations from multiple 
providers for significant non-audit services and only to appoint the provider 
(which could then be the Auditors) that offers the best combination of 
price and expertise. The non-audit services were provided in the year by a 
team independent of those providing audit services.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and management of risks and reviewing its effectiveness. The 
system is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance of:
 — The mitigation of risks which might cause the failure of business objectives
 — No material misstatements or losses
 — The safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or disposition
 — The maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability  
of financial information used within the business or for publication
 — Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The business maintains business continuity plans, and exercises these plans 
on an annual basis.
Management within the Finance Department are responsible for the 
appropriate maintenance of financial records and processes that ensure 
that all financial information is relevant, reliable, in accordance with the 
applicable laws and regulations, and distributed both internally and 
externally in a timely manner. A review of the financial statements is 
completed by management to ensure that the financial position and results 
of the Group are appropriately reflected. All financial information 
published by the Group is subject to the review of the Audit Committee.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control which has also been discussed in detail by the Audit Committee, 
including taking account of material developments since the year end.  
The review covers all material controls including financial and operational 
controls, compliance and risk management systems. Where weaknesses  
are identified, actions to address them are agreed. 
The Board has procedures in place necessary to follow the Turnbull 
Guidance (“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”) for the full financial year. The Group Risk Manager co-ordinates 
this process by leading regular risk assessment workshops in which new risks 
are identified and added to the risk register, and existing risks are                
re-evaluated by the risk owners. Regular meetings, chaired by the 
Executive Directors, are held in addition to the workshops in order to assess 
the effectiveness of the controls that are in place, identify new risks and 
review existing risk mitigation plans.
Key elements of the system of internal control designed to address significant 
risks and uncertainties, as documented on pages 28 and 29, include:
 — Clearly defined levels of responsibility and delegation throughout the 
Group, together with well-structured reporting lines up to the Board
 — The preparation of comprehensive annual budgets for each division, 
including commentary on key business opportunities and risks, approved 
by the Executive Directors and further reviewed by the Board on a 
consolidated basis
 — An Executive Committee review of actual monthly results against 
budget, together with commentary on significant variances and  
updates of both profit and cash flow expectations for the year
 — A detailed investment approval process requiring Board authorisation  
for all major projects
 — Detailed post-implementation appraisals of major capital  
expenditure projects
 — Regular reporting of legal and accounting developments to the Board
 — Regular review of the Group’s risk register and discussion of significant 
risks by the Board and Audit Committee, which among other things 
takes account of the significance of environmental, social and 
governance matters to the business
 — Monitoring of accident statistics and the results of health and  
safety audits
 — Maintenance of an ISO 9000 certified quality control system.
The Group does not have a formal internal audit function and, after a review 
by the Audit Committee and the Board, the Board has confirmed that it 
believes that the existing arrangements for internal audit are appropriate. 
Management may from time to time augment the internal resource for 
these audits with specialist external resources. The Group carries out 
internal audits on financial areas according to a programme agreed between 
the Audit Committee and the Finance Director and with input from the 
other Executive Directors and the external auditors as appropriate. The 
audits are co-ordinated by an experienced senior member of the finance 
team and are undertaken by other members of the finance team; in each 
case, the person undertaking the audit is independent of the area which  
is the subject of the audit. The internal audit reports, the management 
responses and the recommended actions are presented in summary  
form to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. There are also in place 
procedures to ensure recommended actions are implemented. During the 
year, audits were performed on the Gifts and Hospitality declaration 
process and the documentation surrounding Right to Work, as well as a 
number of reviews of other internal processes including controls in place 
at the Stable and Nectar. 
In addition, the Group employs a team of retail business auditors who 
monitor the controls in place in the Managed Pub estate and The Stable, 
in particular those over stock and cash. This team reports directly to  
the Fuller’s Inns Financial Controller but their Manager attends Audit 
Committee meetings twice a year to discuss the progress his team is 
making and the issues they are dealing with.

Governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Corporate Governance Report continued
Relations with Shareholders
The Company has an ongoing programme of individual meetings with 
institutional shareholders, allowing it to update shareholders on the 
performance of the business and the strategy for the future, and to give 
shareholders an opportunity to discuss corporate governance matters.  
The Company’s brokers contact key shareholders to establish if they would 
like to see the Chief Executive and Finance Director in the days following 
their presentation to the City on the preliminary and half year results.  
The Chairman, Richard Fuller and Sir James Fuller are the key contacts 
with the Company’s family shareholders and Sir James Fuller has a specific 
role to keep in touch with those shareholders. The Senior Independent 
Director and the other Non-Executive Directors are all willing to attend 
meetings with shareholders or to be contacted by shareholders should they 
have any concerns which have not been resolved through the normal 
channels. The Non-Executive Directors have had no such requests during 
the last financial year. All Board members receive feedback from the 
City presentations and meetings with shareholders, thus keeping them 
in touch with shareholder opinion.
The Board supports the use of the Annual General Meeting to 
communicate, in particular, with private investors, and the Chairman and 
Chief Executive make a detailed presentation to shareholders updating 
them on the Company’s performance and progress. The Public Relations 
team also attends the Annual General Meeting and provides further 
information to shareholders about the Company through photo boards 
featuring pub and product information. The Board is keen to encourage 
institutional investors to attend the meeting, in line with the duties set out  
in the Stewardship Code for institutional shareholders first published in  
July 2010. Should they have concerns over any issues being voted upon 
at the Annual General Meeting, they can then meet all the Directors and 
discuss them in person, particularly if they have declined an invitation for 
an individual meeting. The Chairman arranges for the Chairman of each 
of the Company’s Board Committees to answer relevant questions at the 
meeting and encourages all Directors to be present.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Directors’ Remuneration Report
Statement of the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report 
for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017. 
The report follows last year’s presentation in two separate sections.  
The first covers the Company’s Remuneration Policy for all of its Main 
Board Directors (set out on pages 38 and 39) as approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 Annual General Meeting for a period of three years. It is 
designed to explain to shareholders how that policy supports the 
Company’s strategy. There are no changes being proposed to the policy  
and there have been no payments made outside of the approved policy  
in the reporting period. The policy as it currently stands will be proposed  
for approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
for a new period of three years.
The second part of the report shows you the detail of how the policy was 
applied in the last financial year. That part of the report will be subject to 
your approval in the same way as it was last year.
Whilst there has not been any change to remuneration during the financial 
year and therefore we have not engaged with shareholders, I would be 
happy to receive any comments you may have on this report. I hope that 
you find the report clear and comprehensive and that it helps demonstrate 
how the remuneration of your Directors is very much linked to the 
performance of your Company, and that you are able to support the 
resolutions on remuneration being presented to you at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. 
Alastair Kerr
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
8 June 2017
Report on Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
This policy, approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held 
on 24 July 2014, was prepared in compliance with Part 4 of Schedule 8  
to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Company intends to  
make all future payments to its Directors consistent with this policy for  
the three years following the date of approval of the policy unless amended 
by the shareholders at an intervening general meeting. This policy, without 
amendments, will be put forward for re-approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2017.
The Remuneration Policy is designed to support the Company’s business 
strategy of creating shareholder value and increasing earnings per share 
(“EPS”) in the longer term for its shareholders. In order to do so it must 
attract, retain and motivate high calibre Executive Directors. The policy  
is therefore to provide competitive packages for the Executives, through 
reflecting the Group’s performance against financial objectives and 
rewarding above-average performance. Accordingly, the key elements are:
 — A significant proportion of performance-related pay that rewards 
Executives in line with Company performance and strongly aligns their 
interests with those of shareholders
 — Personal bonus targets for operational Directors that focus on delivery 
of the strategic drivers for growth in the Company’s business strategy
 — Base pay that rewards above-average performance and remains 
competitive
 — A competitive range of benefits 
 — Participation in a range of share schemes including a long term  
incentive plan.
When setting the Remuneration Policy, the Committee considered the 
Group’s performance on environmental, social and governance matters. 
The Committee does not believe that the existing incentive structure raises 
any environmental, governance or social risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
The Committee believes that the Remuneration Policy is consistent with  
its risk management policy in that existing remuneration structures do not 
encourage management to take inappropriate risks to achieve targets. It is 
felt that there is a very low risk of short term decisions being taken to drive 
annual bonus pay-outs and the focus is very much based on a long-term 
remuneration model, delivering value through the Company’s various  
share plans.
Overleaf are the various elements of the Directors’ remuneration and the 
different performance conditions that apply to them.

Benefits To recruit and retain Executives by 
providing competitive benefits which  
also protect Executives and provide 
preventative care for them. 
The Company offers Executives a range of benefits which include:
 — Car allowance
 — Paid holidays
 — Life assurance
 — Private medical insurance
 — Product allowance 
 — A private account which allows the purchase of goods at cost price plus VAT 
 — Subscriptions to professional bodies or other relevant organisations
 — Regular medical check-ups

Annual Bonus To incentivise Executives to deliver 
performance in line with the  
Group strategy and to align their  
interests with those of shareholders.
Bonus targets are set annually in relation to the profit achieved by The Fuller’s Beer 
Company, Fuller’s Inns and the Group. The performance measures are weighted  
dependent on the responsibilities of each Executive and are designed to be stretching. 
The target for the bonus includes the cost of the bonus itself. 
The maximum pay-out under the bonus scheme is 75% of 
salary. No pay-out would be made if the minimum threshold  
on the bonus target schedules is not achieved. If profits have 
declined to a specified degree in the year bonuses are due to  
be paid, the Committee will assess the performance of the 
Group relative to a selected peer group. Payments will only  
be authorised if the Group has performed better than the 
average of the peer group and where the Group’s performance 
represents outperformance.
The actual performance measures are linked to the  
EPS and profit targets contained in the Group budget  
for Fuller’s Inns and The Fuller’s Beer Company.  
Current and previous targets are considered commercially  
confidential and will not be published. These targets have  
been selected as the Committee believes they reward 
Executives in line with Company performance and strongly 
align their interests with those of shareholders.
New bonus targets were 
agreed in May 2017 for the 
financial year 2017/2018 
subject to the bonus rules 
which include malus and

Share Options
Executive 
Share Option 
Scheme 
(“ESOS”)
To align the interests of Executives  
with those of shareholders. 
A tax-advantaged executive share option scheme under which options may be granted  
to Executives periodically up to a maximum total value set by HM Revenue & Customs.  
Once options have vested, they must be exercised before the tenth anniversary of grant.
Executives may be issued and hold share options up to  
the current maximum value set by HMRC of £30,000  
at any one time.
ESOS options vest when growth in EPS adjusted  
principally to exclude separately disclosed items (“Adjusted 
EPS”) exceeds growth in the retail price index by at least 9% 
over the three year performance period. The Committee 
is authorised to make appropriate amendments to 
Adjusted EPS.
No change.
Senior Executive  
Share Scheme 
(“SESOS”)
A non-tax-advantaged executive share option scheme under which options were granted  
to Executives but which has now expired.
The maximum benefit granted to Executives under  
the SESOS was 20% of salary per annum.
SESOS options vest at 40% (minimum) when growth in 
Adjusted EPS exceeds growth in RPI by at least 9% over 
the three year performance period. Maximum vesting 
(100% of grant) occurs when growth in Adjusted EPS 
exceeds inflation by 21% over the three year period. 
The performance targets and restrictions are considered 
to be a realistic test of management performance and were 
chosen because they are consistent with corporate profit 
growth objectives and ensure that options only become 
exercisable against the background of a sustained real 
increase in the financial performance of the Group.
The last set of options 
granted under this scheme  
in 2013 vested during 
the period.

Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
To reward the efforts of Executives  
in line with the Company’s objective  
of creating shareholder value and 
increasing EPS in the longer term.
The rules of the LTIP allow for discretionary annual awards of ‘A’ (listed), and ‘B’ and ‘C’ 
(unlisted) ordinary shares. Grants are calculated by reference to the middle market quotation 
at close the day before. In all cases shares will vest, subject to performance criteria being 
attained, within 72 days of the publication of results for the last financial year in the 
performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the Adjusted EPS performance 
condition has been met using the EPS information which is published in the Group’s  
Annual Report and Accounts. BDO LLP confirms the level of vesting of awards  
based on EPS calculations provided by the Group.
The maximum value of shares for which an award may 
 be made to an Executive in any financial year is 110% of  
salary and will vary depending on seniority. Actual vesting  
will depend on how well the Company performs against the 
LTIP’s performance conditions.
To assess the awards, the average growth in Adjusted EPS is 
compared with the growth in inflation over the performance 
period. The performance period covers three financial years 
starting from the start of the financial year in which the award 
is made. No vesting occurs if the Adjusted EPS growth fails to 
exceed the RPI by at least 9%. 40% of the award vests if the 
target is hit and there is a sliding scale above that point. For 
100% of an award of shares to vest, growth in Adjusted EPS 
needs to exceed the growth in RPI by 24% or more over the 
period. The Committee feels that since underlying long-term 
freehold property growth is not being included in the 
calculation, 9% over inflation is a testing target, and one that 
merits a 40% vesting level. The Committee further believes 
that the 40% vesting threshold at 9% in excess of inflation  
is triggering vesting at a value that is still below that being 
employed by many other companies and that it is the value  
of the vest that should be considered and not the percentage. 
Please see the graph on page 59 for further details.
No change.
Pension To provide Directors with long-term  
pension provisions on a competitive basis.
The Company operates a variety of pension benefits. Executives are either deferred  
members of the defined benefit Company pension plan – now closed to future accruals –  
or the Company’s defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, or receive a salary 
supplement or a mixture of these. Further details are available on page 61 of this report.
Defined benefit Company pension plan Main section: Until 
closure, accrued at 1.7% of basic salary less lower earnings limit 
(up to a pensions cap) per year of service. Additional salary 
supplement of 17.5% paid over the earnings cap. This applied 
only to Simon Emeny. Defined benefit Company pension plan 
Directors’ section: Richard Fuller withdrew from this scheme  
on 31 March 2015 and now receives a salary supplement of 
17.5% of his salary for use in his retirement planning. Pension 
contributions: For the other Executives the Company will 
contribute a total of 17.5% of the Executive’s salary to the 
defined contribution Company pension plan and/or their 
nominated pension scheme or pay a salary supplement for  
them to use as part of their retirement planning subject to  
the Executive making a net contribution of 8% themselves. 
Not applicable. No change.
Malus and 
Clawback
The malus and clawback provisions act  
as a disincentive to overstate the metrics 
that determine the rewards the Executive 
Directors receive.
These were introduced in 2014 to the bonus scheme and to LTIP awards made from last year. 
They will enable the Committee not to pay bonuses or allow LTIP awards to vest where 
misconduct occurs during the relevant financial year or before a bonus is paid or an LTIP 
award vests. They will also enable the Committee to recover bonuses or awards where it is 
discovered that the Company materially misstated its results for the last whole financial year 
or a material error was made in assessing the relevant performance conditions.
The malus and clawback principles apply to the bonuses that 
may be paid from 2015 onwards and option grants made from 
2014 onwards.
Not applicable. No change.
Non-Executive Directors
Basic and 
Additional  
Fees
To attract and retain high-calibre  
Non-Executive Directors by offering 
market competitive fee levels that 
recognise the time that the  
Non-Executive Directors  
commit to their various roles.
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees paid to the other Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and  
the Executive Committee. Fees may be paid for specific duties such as the fee paid to  
Sir James Fuller for his work in liaising with family shareholders. Non-Executive Directors  
do not participate in bonus schemes, share options or long term incentive plans. None of the 
Non-Executive Directors are members of any Group pension scheme, with the exception  
of Michael Turner, who is a pensioner of the Directors section of the defined benefit 
Company pension plan. 
All Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee. The Senior 
Independent Director receives a fee for that role and there  
are additional fees for chairing and being a member of the  
Audit and Remuneration Committees and other specific  
roles. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are not usually reviewed 
every year but at periods of two to three years when market 
data on the level of fees is consulted.
There are no specific measures set but appraisals are  
carried out as explained in the Corporate Governance  
Report on pages 44 to 50.
No change.
Benefits To encourage Non-Executive Directors  
to keep up to date with the Company’s 
product range and to reimburse expenses.
Non-Executive Directors receive a modest product allowance and are entitled to buy 
additional products at cost plus VAT. They are reimbursed for travel and other business- 
related expenses. The Chairman, Michael Turner, also benefits from life insurance cover 
and private medical insurance.
Product allowances are reviewed from time to time, but not 
typically increased every year.
Not applicable. None.

of the vest that should be considered and not the percentage. 
Please see the graph on page 59 for further details.

Pension To provide Directors with long-term  
pension provisions on a competitive basis.
The Company operates a variety of pension benefits. Executives are either deferred  
members of the defined benefit Company pension plan – now closed to future accruals –  
or the Company’s defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, or receive a salary 
supplement or a mixture of these. Further details are available on page 61 of this report.
Defined benefit Company pension plan Main section: Until 
closure, accrued at 1.7% of basic salary less lower earnings limit 
(up to a pensions cap) per year of service. Additional salary 
supplement of 17.5% paid over the earnings cap. This applied 
only to Simon Emeny. Defined benefit Company pension plan 
Directors’ section: Richard Fuller withdrew from this scheme  
on 31 March 2015 and now receives a salary supplement of 
17.5% of his salary for use in his retirement planning. Pension 
contributions: For the other Executives the Company will 
contribute a total of 17.5% of the Executive’s salary to the 
defined contribution Company pension plan and/or their 
nominated pension scheme or pay a salary supplement for  
them to use as part of their retirement planning subject to  
the Executive making a net contribution of 8% themselves. 
Not applicable. No change.
Malus and 
Clawback
The malus and clawback provisions act  
as a disincentive to overstate the metrics 
that determine the rewards the Executive 
Directors receive.
These were introduced in 2014 to the bonus scheme and to LTIP awards made from last year. 
They will enable the Committee not to pay bonuses or allow LTIP awards to vest where 
misconduct occurs during the relevant financial year or before a bonus is paid or an LTIP 
award vests. They will also enable the Committee to recover bonuses or awards where it is 
discovered that the Company materially misstated its results for the last whole financial year 
or a material error was made in assessing the relevant performance conditions.
The malus and clawback principles apply to the bonuses that 
may be paid from 2015 onwards and option grants made from 
2014 onwards.
Not applicable. No change.
Non-Executive Directors
Basic and 
Additional  
Fees
To attract and retain high-calibre  
Non-Executive Directors by offering 
market competitive fee levels that 
recognise the time that the  
Non-Executive Directors  
commit to their various roles.
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees paid to the other Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and  
the Executive Committee. Fees may be paid for specific duties such as the fee paid to  
Sir James Fuller for his work in liaising with family shareholders. Non-Executive Directors  
do not participate in bonus schemes, share options or long term incentive plans. None of the 
Non-Executive Directors are members of any Group pension scheme, with the exception  
of Michael Turner, who is a pensioner of the Directors section of the defined benefit 
Company pension plan. 
All Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee. The Senior 
Independent Director receives a fee for that role and there  
are additional fees for chairing and being a member of the  
Audit and Remuneration Committees and other specific  
roles. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are not usually reviewed 
every year but at periods of two to three years when market 
data on the level of fees is consulted.
There are no specific measures set but appraisals are  
carried out as explained in the Corporate Governance  
Report on pages 44 to 50.
No change.
Benefits To encourage Non-Executive Directors  
to keep up to date with the Company’s 
product range and to reimburse expenses.
Non-Executive Directors receive a modest product allowance and are entitled to buy 
additional products at cost plus VAT. They are reimbursed for travel and other business- 
related expenses. The Chairman, Michael Turner, also benefits from life insurance cover 
and private medical insurance.
Product allowances are reviewed from time to time, but not 
typically increased every year.
Not applicable. None.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee is advised of the proposed annual pay review for staff in advance of them considering the proposed pay reviews for Directors, so that this 
can be taken into account when determining Directors’ remuneration for the relevant financial year. Salary increases will ordinarily be (in percentage terms) 
in line with those of the wider workforce, and significant variances would only be expected where there had been a significant change in an individual’s 
responsibilities or a market review had been conducted which suggested that an individual’s salary was no longer competitive, or where the Committee 
wanted to take account of an individual’s performance or experience. The Committee would also be advised if there were any other key changes to the  
terms and conditions on which staff are employed. 
Consideration of employee views
The Committee does not formally consult directly with employees on executive pay or in drawing up the Remuneration Policy but does receive  
periodic updates from the People Director. Share ownership amongst the Company’s employees is encouraged through the SAYE Scheme and SIP.  
These tax-advantaged schemes allow employees to participate as shareholders and align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
Shareholder views are sought when there is any significant change to Directors’ remuneration. Should shareholders have any concerns about the 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee Chairman would endeavour to meet with them, as appropriate, to understand and respond to any issues they  
may have.
Discretion employed by the Committee 
The Committee will operate the annual bonus, the LTIP, the ESOS and SESOS in accordance with their applicable rules and in accordance with the  
Listing and Disclosure Rules where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation  
and administration of these schemes. These include, but are not limited to, routine matters such as who participates in them, the timing of awards and vests, 
the size of awards/pay-outs, the determination of vesting, and the setting and application of targets. Other non-routine matters where the Committee  
may need to use its discretion include, but are not limited to, making adjustments to targets and/or pay-outs when there has been a change in accounting 
policy, making adjustments required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group, determination of the treatment of leavers and 
adjustments required in certain circumstances such as rights issues and corporate restructuring events. Any use of the above discretions would, where 
relevant, be explained in the Annual Remuneration Report and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
Illustration of the Application of the Remuneration Policy

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. In illustrating the potential reward, the following assumptions have been made:
Minimum performance – fixed remuneration only with no pay-out under the bonus scheme or LTIP/share options.
In line with expectation – this is based on what Executives could receive if bonuses pay out at 60% of the maximum bonus allowance (i.e. 45% of salary) 
for achieving target performance, LTIP pay-out at 80% of maximum vesting and pay-out under the ESOS at 100%. 
Maximum – 100% of the bonus (i.e. 75% of salary) and 100% of LTIP and ESOS awards.
Recruitment and promotion
The Company wishes to attract talented individuals to Executive positions either from the industry/market or from internal succession. It would not expect 
any new Director to receive salary or any other part of their remuneration package that is more than 50% higher than current maximum payments which 
could be received by the previous role holder. The various components of the package for a new Executive are those already on offer to existing Executives 
as set out in the table above and they are salary, benefits, bonuses, share schemes and pension. The approach to each component is as set out in the tables 
on pages 52 to 55, subject to existing rule constraints. Contracts would be offered on the basis that on early termination a payment equal to the salary due 
for the unexpired period of their notice would be made, payable in monthly instalments. For the period of their notice the Executive would be expected to 
seek alternative income, and if they are successful, that income would be notifiable to the Company and would be set off against the remaining instalments. 
The Company is only likely to offer a cash amount on recruitment, payment of which may be staggered, to reflect the value of benefits a new recruit may 
have received from a former employer. Relocation expenses and accommodation might be provided if necessary.
In respect of Non-Executive Directors, the Company would not expect any new Director to receive fees that are more than 50% higher than the fees 
which could be received by the previous role holder.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual 
and the fees paid to existing Non-Executive Directors.
Service contracts/payments on loss of office 
Executive Directors have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than one year’s notice served by the Company or Director. 
Jonathon Swaine and Simon Dodd are entitled on early termination of their contract to a payment equal to the salary due for the unexpired period of their 
notice. This is payable in monthly instalments and for the period of their notice they are expected to seek alternative income, and if successful, that income 
must be notified to the Company and will be set off against the remaining instalments. 
The contracts of the other Executives (which were all in place before 27 June 2012 and are different from those that would be offered to any new 
Executives and are therefore not in line with the approach to recruitment remuneration as set out above) state that they are entitled to a payment equal 
to salary and the value of all benefits for the unexpired period of their notice, without any reduction for mitigation. Benefits in kind would be valued with 
reference to their P11D value or cost to the Company. 
The Committee has considered whether it should attempt to negotiate a change to the contracts of these Executives but does not believe that this is 
currently appropriate.
The rules of the bonus scheme and LTIP and other share option schemes set out what happens to awards if a participant ceases to be employed before the 
end of a bonus year or performance period. Generally, any outstanding share awards will lapse on such cessation, except in certain circumstances when a 
Director might be deemed a “good leaver” which could include on redundancy or retirement (these are examples and are not intended to be a definitive 
list). In determining whether an Executive Director should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to which bonuses, awards and share options vest or  
become exercisable, and/or a pro-rated bonus is due, the Committee will take into account the circumstances of an individual’s departure and his or  
her performance.

The information on pages 60 to 67 has been audited.
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of Independent Non-Executive Directors and the members are currently Alastair Kerr (Chairman),  
John Dunsmore and Lynn Fordham. The Chairman of the Company, Michael Turner, and the Chief Executive, Simon Emeny, are invited to attend  
the Committee meetings and to advise, where appropriate, on the remuneration and performance of the Executive Directors and related matters.  
The Committee is advised internally by the Company Secretary, Séverine Garnham, who also acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee’s terms of reference state that the Committee is responsible for determining the total remuneration package (including pensions, service 
agreements and termination payments) of the Executive Directors. The Committee also reviews the remuneration of the Company’s Divisional Directors  
in consultation with the Chief Executive. Members of the Committee have no personal financial interest in the Company, other than as shareholders  
and Directors. 
The Committee’s Advisors
Xafinity Consulting Limited provides the Committee and the Company with advice on matters relating to pensions. BDO LLP provides the Committee 
and the Company with advice in connection with the Company’s LTIP and share option schemes and other remuneration matters. Both of these 
consultants have been providing advice to the Company for some years and were not specifically appointed by the Committee. Xafinity Consulting Limited 
is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and its actuaries are also separately required to abide by Actuarial Profession Standards 
which include the requirement for them to provide objective and independent advice. BDO LLP abides by the Remuneration Consultants Code of 
Conduct, which requires it to provide objective and independent advice. Other advisors did not charge fees for services provided in respect of Directors’ 
remuneration during the year.

 LTIP/Options includes the value transferred to Directors from the LTIP, ESOS, SESOS and SAYE Schemes. Benefit is calculated as the share price at the year end  
less the exercise price multiplied by the number of vested options. Options are considered to have vested if substantially all of the performance criteria have been met 
in the financial year, in which case the number of vested options is estimated based on performance against performance measures. The table below sets out how the 
award is linked to performance of the Group.

 Ian Bray ceased to be a Director with effect from 31 May 2016. No annual bonus or LTIP/options were due. In accordance with the provision of his employment 
contract, he was entitled to a payment equal to the salary due for his one year notice period of £211,000 payable in monthly instalments. Ian Bray did not notify the 
company that he had secured alternative income in the period to be set off against any such instalments. In addition, he received a payment of £160,000, which is not 
included in the table above.

 Simon Dodd was appointed with effect from 1 August 2016. As such, his salary includes that for the period prior to this appointment where he was a Divisional Director,

Share scheme interests outstanding at the year end
Shares
The Company has Share Ownership Guidelines for Directors which state that Executives should hold shares worth at least 100% of their salary. 
Accordingly, until their guideline is met, Executives are required to retain:
a) All shares they hold in the SIP
b) All shares they acquire as a result of exercising SAYE options
c) All shares that they acquire as a result of exercising options under the tax-advantaged ESOS net of the cost of those options
d) At least 75% of any shares that they acquire as a result of exercising options under the non-tax-advantaged SESOS net of the cost of those options

Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 1 April 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the 53 week period then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union; 
– the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
What we have audited
Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.’s financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, 
the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, 
as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Overview of our audit approach
– Overall Group materiality: £2 million, which represents approximately 5% of the Group’s profit before taxation and separately disclosed items; 
– We performed full scope audit procedures at the Parent Company, from which all of the Group’s profit before taxation arose, and targeted 
procedures for subsidiary operations; and
– Key audit risks identified were assessment of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition and presentation of separately disclosed items.
Our assessment of risk
In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, we highlight the following risks that, in our judgement, had the greatest effect on our audit: 
Audit risk How we responded to the risk
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
As more fully explained in note 11, the Directors are required to make 
an impairment assessment for property, plant and equipment when 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired and for goodwill 
annually. The process for measuring and recognising impairment under 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ is 
complex and highly judgemental, particularly as each individual trading 
outlet is treated as a separate cash-generating unit for impairment 
purposes. We therefore identified the assessment of impairment of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a significant risk 
requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
– reviewing the accounting policy for compliance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and that the application by the Group is consistent with the 
stated policy;
– an assessment of current trading and the market for pub transactions;
– challenge of the impairment models prepared by management that 
assess each trading property and each component of goodwill; 
– testing of the integrity of data used in the models by agreeing a sample 
to source data; 
– a review of the key inputs within the calculations, as well as performing 
a completeness review of all operating units to ensure all appropriate 
sites had been appropriately identified;
– challenging management’s impairment model, using industry data 
to consider the reasonableness of management’s assumptions, in 
particular maintainable trading levels, growth and discount rates; and
– testing the accuracy of management’s forecasting through a comparison 
of budget to actual data and historical trends.
The Group’s accounting policy on impairment is shown in note 1 and related 
disclosures are included in respect of property, plant and equipment 
in note 11 and goodwill in note 10. The Audit Committee also identified 
impairment testing of property assets as a significant issue in its report on 
page 48, where the Committee also describes how it addressed this issue.

Audit risk How we responded to the risk
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Under International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland) 
240 ‘The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in an audit of 
financial statements’ there is a presumed risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition. As the Group records a substantial proportion of sales 
in cash and through point of sale transactions, we identified the risk 
of fraud in revenue recognition as a significant risk requiring special 
audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
– an evaluation of the revenue recognition policies for each of the 
Group’s two principal revenue streams against the requirements 
of the Group’s stated accounting policies and IAS 18 ‘Revenue’; 
– for beer and liquor sales made by the Brewery we performed testing 
of certain key controls such as proof of delivery over invoicing and 
despatch, testing the recovery of trade receivables to after date 
cash and checking the application of cut-off at the period end; and 
– for managed inns revenue we tested the key controls over the 
completeness and capture of sales from individual inns and tested 
the receipt of cash collected at inns into Group bank accounts. 
– for all income streams, we assessed management review processes 
for the assessment and reporting of revenue.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue, including its recognition, 
is shown in note 1 and related disclosures are included in note 3.
Presentation of separately disclosed items
As set out in the consolidated income statement and note 5, the financial 
statements included a net charge of £3m in respect of separately disclosed 
items. There is significant management judgement in the determination of 
these items, which are not defined by IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, and reported upon as part of an alternative performance measure 
within the financial statements. Consistency of presentation is important 
for maintaining comparability between reported results for each period. 
We therefore identified the presentation of separately disclosed items as a 
significant risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
– testing the criteria used by management to determine classification 
as a separately disclosed item;
– agreeing the classification was consistent with the Group’s stated 
accounting policy;
– considering whether the classification was appropriate, and the 
presentation enhanced the clarity and understanding of financial 
statements for the reporting period; and 
– checking that the presentation was consistent with that presented 
in prior periods. 
The Group’s accounting policy on separately disclosed items is shown in 
note 1 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in 
note 5. The Audit Committee identified separately disclosed items as a 
significant issue in its report on page 48, where the Committee also 
described how it addressed this issue.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of that work.
We determined materiality for the audit of the Group financial statements as a whole to be £2 million, which is approximately 5% of the Group’s 
profit before taxation and separately disclosed items. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because it is one of the key performance 
indicators for the Board and its shareholders as well as being a crucial component of the earnings per share calculation and in calculating 
Directors’ bonuses. 
Materiality for the current period is unchanged from the level we determined for the 52 week period ended 26 March 2016 to reflect the similar 
activities and operations as the prior period. 
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75% of financial statement 
materiality for the audit of the Group financial statements. We also determined a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as Directors’ 
remuneration and related party transactions.
We determined the threshold at which we communicate misstatements in respect of the Group financial statements to the Audit Committee 
to be £100,000. In addition we communicated misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.

Overview of the scope of our audit
A description of the generic scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
‘Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit’ section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those Ethical Standards.
Our audit approach was based on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business and is risk based, and in particular included: 
– evaluation by the Group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine the planned 
audit response based on a measure of materiality. Although the Group financial statements are a consolidation of the Parent Company and 
its trading subsidiaries, all of the Group’s profit before taxation arose in the Parent Company on which we performed a full scope audit; 
– recognition that the Group is organised into three principal operating divisions: Managed Pubs and Hotels, Tenanted Inns and The Fuller’s Beer 
Company. We tested controls over the financial reporting systems identified as part of our risk assessment, reviewed the accounts production 
process and addressed critical accounting matters. We sought, wherever possible, to rely on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
in order to reduce substantive testing;
– undertaking controls and substantive testing on significant transactions, balances and disclosures, the extent of which was based on various factors 
such as our overall assessment of the control environment, the design effectiveness of controls over individual systems and the management of 
specific risks; and
– the only change in the overview of the scope of the current period audit from the scope of that of the prior period was the inclusion of the audit of 
separately disclosed items as a significant risk. Separately disclosed items were included as a reported risk reflecting greater consistency between 
risk and materiality assessment, and the judgment exercised in the determination of separately disclosed items irrespective of the monetary value 
of these items. Accounting for acquisitions was included as an audit risk in 2016 but was not included as an audit risk in 2017 as the accounting 
principles and valuation assessment had been established in prior periods and adjustment of estimates was immaterial.
Other reporting required by regulations
Our opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 are unmodified
In our opinion, the part of the Director’s Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
– the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
– the Strategic Report and the Director’s Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Financial Statements
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
– the directors’ statements, set out on page 27, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; 
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review.
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
– otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
– we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable; or 
– the annual report does not appropriately disclose those matters that were communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed. 
We have nothing to report in respect of any of the above matters.
We also confirm that we do not have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
– the Directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
– the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
– the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
– the Directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
What the directors are responsible for:
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 43, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
What we are responsible for:
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies
Authorisation of Financial Statements 
The financial statements of Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 were authorised for 
issue by the Board of Directors on 8 June 2017 and the Balance Sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by M J Turner. Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. 
is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary ‘A’ shares are traded on the London 
Stock Exchange.
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group’s and Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted for use in the European Union and applied to the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017, 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are 
set out in the accounting policies below. 
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are shown in millions of pounds (£m) rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore continued to be prepared on a going concern basis. See the Going 
Concern statement on page 27 of the Financial Review.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate Income Statement for the Parent Company has not been prepared.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements
The areas of judgement, estimation and assumption which are considered to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows:
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units 
to which the goodwill is allocated. This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate. Full details are supplied in note 
10, together with an analysis of the key assumptions.
The Group reviews for impairment all property, plant and equipment at cash-generating unit level where there is any indication of impairment. 
This requires an estimation of the value in use and involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate. See note 11, 
which describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the key assumptions.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the 
expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate. These have been determined on advice from the Group’s qualified actuary. 
The estimates used and the key assumptions are provided in note 23.
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a 
formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. 
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate 
accounting treatment. See note 7.
The assessment of fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements on the acquisition of a business and additional 
consideration, and the date that control is obtained, require significant judgement and estimate. Management assess fair values, particularly for 
property, plant and equipment, with reference to current market prices. See note 17 for business combinations made in the year.
Judgement is used to determine those items that should be separately disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading 
performance of the Group. The judgement includes assessment of whether an item is of a nature that is not consistent with normal trading activities 
or of sufficient size or infrequency. See note 5.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 (2016: 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016).
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated 
until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary which significantly affect 
the return of the subsidiary, so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights; 
currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights; or by way of contractual agreement. All inter-company balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.

Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies continued
Adoption of new standards and interpretations
The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations are effective for the Group’s period commencing 27 March 2016:
– IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
– Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016
– Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 1 January 2016
– Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: Bearer Plants 1 January 2016
– Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
– Annual improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 cycle 1 January 2016
– Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2016
– Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016
The Directors do not believe the adoption of the new standards and interpretations has had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the 
financial statements.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are 
carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises 
from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Payments made to acquire operating leases from third parties are 
classified as intangible assets and amortised over the expected life of the lease and recognised in the Income Statement. 
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the purchase method. Any excess of the consideration of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the 
Balance Sheet as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment of goodwill 
made cannot be reversed if circumstances subsequently change.
Any contingent considerations recognised on business combinations are measured at fair value using Level 3 valuation techniques.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units (or group of cash-generating units) monitored 
by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss 
is recognised in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, 
or of an operation within it.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis down to the estimated residual value over the expected useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold buildings – Hotel accommodation and offices Up to 50 years
Freehold buildings – Licensed retail property, unlicensed property and brewery 50 to 100 years
Leasehold improvements The term of the lease
Roofs From 10 to 50 years
Plant, machinery and vehicles, containers, fixtures and fittings From three years up to 25 years
As required under IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment, expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed every year. Land is not depreciated.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that 
the grants will be received. Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises 
as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the 
Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the Balance Sheet and transferred 
to the Income Statement on a systematic basis over the useful economic life of the related assets.  80

Investment property
The Group owns properties that are not used for the production of goods or services but are held for capital appreciation or rental purposes. 
These properties are classified as investment properties and their carrying values are based on cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis 
down to the estimated residual value over the expected useful life of the asset, which for investment properties is 50 to 100 years.
Impairment
Carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If such an indicator exists 
and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable 
amounts. An asset’s recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell, and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the smallest cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses, and any reversal of such losses, are recognised in the 
Income Statement.
Leases
Group as a lessee
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable 
are charged in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group has a number of lease arrangements in which the rent 
payable is contingent on revenue. Any contingent rentals payable are accrued in line with revenues generated by the site.
Group as a lessor
Assets leased under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Rental income, 
including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.  
To be classified as such management need to have initiated a sales plan as at the Balance Sheet date and must expect the sale to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year. Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation 
is charged whilst assets are classified as held for sale.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the ‘First In First Out’ method. The cost of own beer 
consists of materials with the addition of relevant overhead expenses. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business less estimated costs of completion and the costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and loans to customers do not carry any interest and are recognised at their original invoiced amounts, less an allowance for any 
amounts that are not considered to be collectible. Increases to the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement within operating costs. 
At the point a trade receivable is written off the ledger as uncollectible, the cost is charged against the allowance account and any subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the Income Statement.
Cash and short term deposits
Cash and short term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where the rights 
to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables do not bear interest and are carried at original cost.
Bank loans, overdrafts and debentures
Interest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and debentures are initially recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, and thereafter 
at amortised cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an effective 
interest rate basis in the Income Statement. Finance charges are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise. Financial Statements

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies continued
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability 
is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange transaction risks, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts. In order to 
hedge its exposure to interest rate risks, the Group enters into interest rate derivative contracts. The Group uses these contracts in order to hedge 
known borrowings. The Group does not use any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The fair value 
of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value 
of interest rate swap and cap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. This represents a Level 2 fair value under 
the hierarchy in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.  
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness 
will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective. For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging an exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with 
a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Interest rate swaps are classified as cash flow hedges. If they are effective hedges, then any changes in fair value are deferred in equity until 
the hedged transaction occurs, when any changes in fair value will be recycled through the Income Statement together with any changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item. If the hedges are not effective hedges, then any changes in fair value are recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously 
recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the Income Statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the Income Statement.
The put and call options for the remaining shares in The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited and Nectar Imports Limited are recognised as derivative 
financial instruments measured using Level 3 fair value valuation techniques.
Classification of shares as debt or equity
When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Company or Group is presented as a liability in the Balance Sheet; 
measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption. The 
corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the Income Statement. The initial fair value of the 
liability component is determined using a market rate for an equivalent liability without a conversion feature.
The remainder of the proceeds on issue is allocated to the equity component and included in shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. 
The carrying amount of the equity component is not remeasured in subsequent years.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. For the purposes of the disclosures given in note 26, the Group considers its capital 
to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium, capital redemption reserve, hedging reserve and accumulated retained earnings plus its 
preference shares which are classified as a financial liability in the Balance Sheet. There have been no changes to what the Group considers to be 
capital since the prior year.
Preference shares
The Group’s preference shares are reported under non-current liabilities. The corresponding dividends on preference shares are charged as interest  
in the Income Statement. Preference shares carry interest at fixed rates. 82

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies continued 
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and revenue can be reliably measured.  
It is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and VAT.
Sales of goods are recognised when the goods are delivered and title has passed. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease. Revenue for bedroom accommodation is recognised at the point the services are rendered. Amusement machine revenue is recognised 
in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Finance revenue
Finance revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are generally recognised as an expense when incurred. Interest expenses directly attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets being created. This is applied 
to development projects where the development is expected to last in excess of six months at the commencement of the project.
Separately disclosed items
The Group presents as separately disclosed items on the face of the Income Statement those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the 
elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.
Share-based payments
The Group has an employee Share Incentive Plan, that awards shares to employees based on the reported profits of the Group for the year, and 
a Long Term Incentive Plan that awards shares to Directors and Senior Executives subject to specific performance criteria. The Group also issues 
equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under approved and unapproved share option schemes and a Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the date at 
which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become 
fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of 
any vesting conditions. The Group has no equity-settled transactions that are linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. At each Balance Sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, 
representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market 
conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous Balance Sheet 
date is recognised in the Income Statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the 
original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new 
vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value 
of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled (including when a non-vesting condition within the control of the entity or employee is not met), it is 
treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the Income Statement for the award is expensed immediately. 
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value 
being treated as an expense in the Income Statement.
Own shares
Shares to be awarded under employee incentive plans and those that have been awarded but have yet to vest unconditionally are held at cost by an 
employee share ownership trust and shown as a deduction from equity in the Balance Sheet.
In addition to the purchase of shares by the various employee share ownership trusts for specific awards, the Group also from time to time acquires 
own shares to be held as treasury shares. These shares are occasionally but not exclusively used to satisfy awards under various share option schemes. 
Treasury shares are held at cost and shown as a deduction from total equity in the Balance Sheet.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost 
being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares. Financial Statements

1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies continued
Taxation
Current tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year using UK tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which they can be utilised.
Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the  
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when they relate to items that are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income or directly in equity respectively.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined contribution schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operated a defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees where contributions were made into a separate fund administered 
by trustees. The Scheme closed to future accrual in January 2015.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method calculated by qualified actuaries. 
This attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior periods (to determine 
the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. Past service costs are recognised in the Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction 
in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial 
assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The Group determines the net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure 
the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net pension liability/(asset) at the beginning of the period. The net interest charge 
is recognised immediately as a separately disclosed finance cost/(income) in the Income Statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Balance Sheet comprises the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a 
discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which 
the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. 
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group 
expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost 
being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares. 84
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Accounting Policies continued 
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the year end exchange rates and the resulting exchange differences are taken to the Income Statement, except where 
hedge accounting is applied.
Dividends
Dividends recommended by the Board but unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they are paid (in the case of the 
interim dividend) or approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (in the case of the final dividend).
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be 
insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such 
time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost. Income is recognised from these investments only in relation to distributions received 
from post-acquisition profits.
New standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for periods starting on or after the date on which 
these financial statements start:
– IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
– IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (effective 1 January 2018)
– Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (effective 1 January 2017)
– Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows (effective 1 January 2017)
– Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle (effective 1 January 2017)
– IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective 1 January 2018)
– Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (effective 1 January 2018)
– Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ with IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (effective 1 January 2018)
– Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property (effective 1 January 2018)
The Directors expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed below will have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in future periods: 
– New requirements within IFRS 16 to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact on the 
amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. However, there will be no impact on the cash flow of the business. 
The impact of this change is still being assessed.
– IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments, the impact of which is being assessed.  Financial Statements

2. Segmental Analysis
Operating Segments
For management purposes, the Group’s operating segments are:
– Managed Pubs and Hotels, which comprises managed pubs, managed hotels, and The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited;
– Tenanted Inns, which comprises pubs operated by third parties under tenancy or lease agreements; and
– The Fuller’s Beer Company, which comprises the brewing and distribution of beer, cider, wines, spirits and soft drinks, and Nectar Imports Limited.
The Group’s business is vertically integrated. The most important measure used to evaluate the performance of the business is adjusted profit, which 
is the profit before tax, adjusted for separately disclosed items. The operating segments are organised and managed separately according to the nature 
of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic operating unit. More details of these segments are given in the 
Strategic Report on pages 8 to 37 of this report. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit before separately disclosed items and 
is measured consistently with the operating profit before separately disclosed items in the consolidated financial statements.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Segment revenue, 
segment expense and segment result include transfers between operating segments. Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation. Group 
financing, including finance costs and revenue, and taxation are managed on a Group basis.
As segment assets and liabilities are not regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Group has elected, as provided under IFRS 8 
Operating Segments (amended), not to disclose a measure of segment assets and liabilities.

Acquisition costs of £1.3 million during the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 (2016: £1.1 million) relate to transaction costs on site acquisitions both 
completed and aborted. In the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016, the costs incurred related to site and business acquisitions. See note 17.
The reorganisation costs of £1.5 million incurred in the period, were principally incurred within The Fuller’s Beer Company and primarily relate 
to staff costs.
Deemed remuneration on the future purchase of shares in The Stable relates to the remuneration element of the increase in the estimated value 
of the option remaining on The Stable group of companies. The original option was over 49% of the shares, but during the current period, the Group 
exercised the option to purchase an additional 25% of the shares for £2.7 million, taking its shareholding to 76%. The current estimate of the amount 
payable for the remaining 24% is £3.4 million, of which £2.8 million is accrued at the balance sheet date, with the balance to be accrued over the 
remaining period to 31 March 2018.
There was no property impairment in the period. In the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016, there was a write down of licensed properties to their 
recoverable value. The reversal of impairment credit of £0.6 million during the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016 related to the write back of previously 
impaired licensed properties to their recoverable value.
The onerous lease provision release of £0.2 million in the prior period relates to a leasehold property disposed during the prior period.
The profit on disposal of properties of £0.9 million during the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 (2016: £2.9 million) relates to the disposal of six licensed 
properties (2016: five licensed properties). 
The cash impact of separately disclosed items before tax for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 was £2.4 million cash outflow (2016: £1.1 million 
cash outflow). 90

During the period The Finance Act 2016 received Royal Assent. The main impact was the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% 
from 1 April 2020. To the extent that this rate change will affect the amount of future cash tax payments to be made by the Group, this will reduce 
the size of both the Group’s Balance Sheet deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset. The impact in the 53 weeks to 1 April 2017 was a credit to 
separately disclosed items in the Income Statement of £1.0 million, and a charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of £0.3 million. 92

For the purposes of calculating the number of shares to be used above, ‘B’ shares have been treated as one tenth of an ‘A’ or ‘C’ share. The earnings 
per share calculation is based on earnings from continuing operations and on the weighted average ordinary share capital which excludes shares held 
by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury of 1,760,953 (2016: 1,628,444). 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated using the same earnings figure as for basic earnings per share, divided by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion 
of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Adjusted earnings per share are calculated on profit before tax excluding separately 
disclosed items and on the same weighted average ordinary share capital as for the basic and diluted earnings per share. An adjusted earnings per share 
measure has been included as the Directors consider that this measure better reflects the underlying earnings of the Group.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing on an estate and divisional cash-generating unit level. 
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Recoverable amount is based 
on a calculation of value in use based upon the budget for the forthcoming financial year approved by senior management. For the Gales and Jacomb 
Guinness estates, cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated in perpetuity on the assumption that the growth rate does not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. For Cornish Orchards, The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited and Nectar Imports Limited cash 
flows beyond the modelling horizon are valued on a conservative market multiple basis. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 
based on the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and current market conditions.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions in respect of achievement of budgeted cash flows, growth rate and discount rate. 
The calculation of value in use is also dependent upon the following assumptions: sales volume; gross margin in managed premises; barrelage and rent 
projections in tenanted premises; wage cost in managed premises; and capital expansion in Cornish Orchards and The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited. 
Gross margins are based on historical performance levels. All of the key assumptions above have their assigned values based on management 
knowledge and historical information.
Sensitivity to Changes in Assumptions
Management have considered reasonable changes in key assumptions used in their calculations of value in use. They have concluded that such changes 
will not result in an impairment to any of the cash-generating units at 1 April 2017. 96

Impairment
The Group considers each trading outlet to be a cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable 
amount is deemed to be its value in use.
During the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017, the Group recognised an impairment loss of £nil (2016: £1.4 million) in respect of the write down of licensed 
properties purchased in recent years where their asset values exceeded either fair value less costs to sell or their value in use. The impairment losses 
were driven principally by changes in the local competitive environment in which the pubs are situated. Following an improvement in trading 
performance and an increase in the amounts of estimated future cash flows of certain previously impaired sites, no reversals were recognised during 
the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 (2016: £0.6 million). 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those detailed in note 10.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The value in use calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used. The Directors consider a movement of 1% in the discount rate and 0.5% in the growth 
rate to be reasonable with reference to current market yield curves and the current economic conditions. The impact is set out as follows:
Impact on impairment of asset at risk – increase/(decrease)

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
During the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017, the Group did not impair any investment properties (2016:£nil).
Investment Property Income
The properties are let on both landlord and tenant repairing leases. Amounts recognised in the profit for the financial year relating to rental income 
from investment properties are as follows:

Limited put and call option, originally recognised in non-controlling interest, through the purchase of a further 25% share in The Stable Pizza & Cider 
Limited. In the prior period, the adjustments arising from change in non-controlling interest related to the initial recognition of Nectar Imports 
Limited and the accompanying put and call option.
17. Business Combinations
On 27 May 2016, the Group purchased an additional 25% of the shares in The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited for £2.7 million, bringing the Group’s 
interest in the Stable Pizza & Cider Limited to 76%. The Group has the option to acquire the remaining 24% of shares in 2018 and a liability of 
£2.8 million has been recognised at the balance sheet date, which reflects management’s best estimate of the option value (see note 13). 
The Group has also paid £1.2 million in contingent consideration to the former owners of Cornish Orchards Limited, which was acquired  
on 4 June 2013, and £0.3 million to the company that formerly held the import and distribution rights to Sierra Nevada.
During the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017, the Company has individually acquired four new pubs for £16.6 million, all of which have been treated 
as business combinations as they were operating as a business at the point the Company acquired them. 
In the prior period, the Company purchased a 51% holding in Nectar Imports Limited which is a wholesale distributor and 100% of G & M Leisure 
Limited, which operates The Lord Northbrook pub in Lee, South East London. Additional contingent consideration of £2.5 million was recognised as a 
balance sheet liability in relation to the acquisition of Nectar Imports Limited and reflects management’s best estimate of the likely amount to be paid 
out for the remaining 49% of the business. Under the terms of the agreement, the total consideration will not exceed £10 million.

23. Pensions
a) Retirement Benefit Plans – Group and Company
The Group operates one closed funded defined benefit pension scheme, the Fuller Smith & Turner Pension Plan (the ”Scheme”). The plan was closed to 
future accrual on 1 January 2015. The plan is defined benefit in nature, with assets held in separate professionally managed, Trustee-administered funds. 
The Scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs registered pension plan and subject to standard United Kingdom pension and tax law. 
The Group also operates three defined contribution stakeholder pension plans for its employees. The Fuller’s Stakeholder Pension Plan was set up 
for new employees of the Parent Company after the closure of the Fuller, Smith & Turner Pension Plan to new entrants on 1 August 2005. The 
Griffin Stakeholder Pension Plan operates for those employees of a Group subsidiary. The Gales 2001 scheme was set up following the closure of the 
Gales defined benefit scheme in 2001. The Group offers workplace pensions to all employees who are not members of the three defined contribution 
stakeholder pension plans. The Group offers these pensions through the National Employment Savings Trust (“NEST”).
The Group also pays benefits to a number of former employees which are unfunded. The Directors consider these benefits to be defined benefit 
in nature and the full defined benefit liability is recognised on the Balance Sheet.

The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution stakeholder schemes is shown above.
c) Defined Benefit Plans – Group and Company
The Scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants upon death. Trustees are appointed by both the 
Company and the Scheme’s membership and act in the interest of the Scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company. 
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the Scheme’s assets. The Company pays the costs as determined by regular actuarial valuations. 
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the Scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be 
best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit on the Scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company. The major 
risks are: 
– Interest and investment risk – The value of the Scheme’s assets are subject to volatility in equity prices. The Scheme has diversified its investments 
to reduce the impact of volatility and variable interest return rates;
– Inflation risk – The defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation so higher rates would result in a higher defined benefit obligation; and 
– Longevity risk – An increase over the assumptions applied will increase the defined benefit obligation.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies. The Trustees manage 
governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies. 
The Scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years. Following the conclusion of the 2016 triennial 
valuation, the Company agreed to increase the deficit funding payments from 1 January 2017 to £2 million per annum from £1.1 million per annum.  108

The figures in the following disclosures were measured using the projected unit method.
The Scheme has not invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments or in properties or other assets in use by the Group.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions used in the 2017 valuation of the Scheme are set out below:
Mortality assumptions
2017
Years
2016
Years
Current pensioners (at 65) – males 22.2 22.2
Current pensioners (at 65) – females 24.3 24.4
Future pensioners (at 65) – males 24.0 23.6
Future pensioners (at 65) – females 26.2 25.9
The average age of all non-pensioners is 55.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of the Scheme 2017 2016
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.30% 3.05%
Discount rate 2.60% 3.55%
Inflation assumption – RPI 3.30% 3.05%
Inflation assumption – CPI 2.30% 2.05%
The present value of the Scheme liabilities is sensitive to the assumptions used, as follows:
Impact on Scheme liabilities – increase/(decrease) 
1
2017
£m
2016
£m
Increase rate of pensions in payment by 0.5% 7.2 5.5
Increase discount rate by 1.0% (24.1) (18.0) 
Increase inflation assumption by 0.5%² 3.8 3.3 
Increase in life expectancies by 1 year 6.8  4.9 
1
 The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all of the other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes 
in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity to change, the same actuarial method has been applied as when calculating the 
pension liability within the Balance Sheet. Due to the Scheme closing to future accrual on 1 January 2015, there are no longer any active members in the Scheme. 
As the members who were active at closure did not maintain a salary link on their past service benefits, the future salary increase assumptions no longer has an 
impact on the Scheme’s liabilities.

 For members who were active at closure, their pensions now increase in deferment in line with CPI inflation.  Financial Statements

Details of the Group’s Treasury function are included in the Financial Review’s discussion of financial risks and treasury policies on page 27.
The accounting treatment of the Group’s financial instruments is detailed in note 1.

In managing its capital the primary objective is to ensure that the Group is able to continue to operate as a going concern and to maximise return 
to shareholders through a combination of capital growth, distributions and the payment of preference dividends to its preference shareholders. 
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt and equity that balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and maintains sufficient funds to meet 
working capital targets, investment requirements and comply with lending covenants. The Group bought back £3.6 million of shares in the 53 weeks 
ended 1 April 2017 (2016: £6.2 million), none of which related to purchases made by or on behalf of employee share ownership trusts (2016: 
£1.6million). As a minimum, the Board reviews the Group’s dividend policy twice yearly and reviews the treasury position every Board meeting. 112

There is no set off of financial assets and liabilities as shown above.
c) Financial Risks – Group and Company
The main risks associated with the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are set out below, as are the Group’s policies for their management.  
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with Group policy.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group manages its cost of borrowings using a mixture of fixed rates, variable rates and interest rate caps. The current Group policy is that a 
minimum of 50% of total outstanding borrowings should be at a fixed or capped rate of interest. This is achieved by both taking out interest rate swaps 
and caps with third parties and by loan instruments that require the Group to pay a fixed rate. Fixed rates do not expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk, but do not enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling. Interest rate caps limit the maximum rate payable 
but require payment of a lump sum premium. The fair value risk inherent in fixed rate borrowings means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs 
if debt is paid off earlier than anticipated. Floating rate borrowings, although not exposed to changes in fair value, expose the Group to cash flow risk 
following rises in interest rates and cost.
The debentures totalling £25.9 million (2016: £25.9 million) are at fixed rates. The bank loans totalling £194.5 million (2016: £177.0 million), net of 
arrangement fees, are at floating rates. At the year end, after taking account of interest rate swaps and caps, 47% (2016: 48%) of the Group’s bank 
loans and 53% (2016: 55%) of gross borrowings were at fixed or capped rates. Financial Statements
113
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C.
26. Financial Instruments continued
Interest rate swaps 
The Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements, where the Group pays a fixed rate and receives 1 month or 3 month LIBOR, in order 
to hedge the risk of variation in interest cash flows on its borrowings. At the balance sheet date £60 million of the Group and Company’s borrowings 
(2016: £65.0 million) were hedged by interest rate swaps at a blended fixed rate of 1.89% (2016: 1.94%). Of the swaps active at 1 April 2017, 
£20 million expires in 2020, £20 million expires in 2021 and £20 million expires in 2022.
Interest rate caps
The Group has entered into interest rate cap agreements in order to hedge the risk of variation in interest cash flows on its borrowings. At the 
Balance Sheet date £30.0 million (2016: £20 million) of the Group and Company’s borrowings were hedged by two interest caps at a blended rate 
of 1.98% (2016: 2.1%), £20.0 million of which expires in 2020 and £10.0 million in 2022. 
The interest rate swaps and caps are expected to impact the Income Statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in section (iv) below. 
The interest rate swap cash flow hedges and the interest rate caps cash flow hedges in effect at 1 April 2017 were assessed as being highly effective. 
No net unrealised gain or loss (2016: £0.3 million loss) has been recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. 
Sensitivity – Group and Company
The Group borrows in Sterling at market rates. Three month Sterling LIBOR rate during the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 ranged between 0.34% 
and 0.59%. The Directors consider 1.00% to be a reasonable possible increase in rates and 0.50% to be a reasonable possible decrease in rates, 
with reference to market yield curves and the current economic conditions. 
The annualised effect of these changes to interest rates on the floating rate debt at the Balance Sheet date, all other variables being constant, 
are as follows:
Impact on post-tax profit and net equity – increase/(decrease)

Increase interest rate by 1.0% (1.1) (0.9) (1.9) (1.4)
* The Company has substantial interest bearing payables due to subsidiary companies (note 21).
(ii) Foreign currency risk
The Group buys and sells goods and services denominated in non-Sterling currencies principally US dollar, Euro and Australian dollar. As a result, 
movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Group’s revenues and purchases.
The Group policy on covering foreign currency exposure is included in the Financial Review’s discussion of financial risks and treasury policies on page 
27. As a minimum, it buys or sells forward the net known value of all committed purchase or sales orders. In addition, the Group will usually buy or 
sell a proportion of the estimated sale or buy orders for the remaining part of the year to minimise its transactional currency exposures in non-Sterling 
currencies. Forward currency contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged items. The Group does not trade in forward currency hedges.
At 1 April 2017, the Group and Company had no open forward contracts. At 26 March 2016, the Group and Company had open forward contracts 
to buy €4.9 million with a Sterling equivalent of £3.8 million and a net gain of £0.2 million when comparing the contractual rates with the year end 
exchange rates. At 26 March 2016 the Group and Company had open forward contracts to buy $1.0 million with a Sterling equivalent of £0.7 million 
and a net gain of £nil when comparing the contractual rates with year end exchange rates.
At 1 April 2017 the only significant foreign currency assets or liabilities were the following:

(iii) Credit risk
The risk of financial loss due to a counter party’s failure to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to transactions where the Group provides 
goods and services on deferred payment terms, deposits surplus cash and enters into derivative contracts. 
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses and deferred terms are only granted to customers who demonstrate an appropriate payment history 
and satisfy credit worthiness procedures. Individual customers are subject to credit limits to control debt exposure. Credit insurance is taken out 
where appropriate for wholesale customers and goods may also be sold on a cash with order basis. 
Cash deposits with financial institutions for short periods and derivative transactions are only permitted with financial institutions approved by the 
Board. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is 
represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Trade and other receivables
The Group records impairment losses on its trade receivables separately from gross receivables. Further detail is included in note 19.
(iv) Liquidity risk
The Group minimises liquidity risk by managing cash generation, applying debtor collection targets, monitoring daily cash receipts and payments and 
setting rolling cash forecasts. Investments have cash payback periods applied as part of a tightly controlled investment appraisal process. The Group’s 
rating with credit agencies is excellent.
The Group has a mixture of long and short term borrowings and overdraft facilities: 16% (2016: 13%) of the Group’s borrowings are repayable after 
more than five years, 75% (2016: 77% ) within the first to fifth years and 9% (2016: 10%) within one year.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 1 April 2017 based on undiscounted contractual cash flows, 
including interest payable. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the Balance Sheet date.

Covenants – Group and Company
The Group and Company are subject to a number of covenants in relation to their borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans 
becoming immediately repayable. These covenants inter alia specify maximum net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, 
and minimum earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to interest.

Level 1 fair values are valuation techniques where inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access 
at measure data.
Level 2 fair values are valuation techniques where all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly, but are not derived directly from quoted prices in active markets. The Group bases its valuations on information provided by financial 
institutions, who use a variety of estimation techniques based on market conditions, such as interest rate expectations, existing at each Balance 
Sheet date.
Level 3 fair values are valuation techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are not observable. Derivative 
fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets. The fair values of borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of preference shares have been calculated using the market interest rates. The fair values 
of cash, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables and trade and other payables are equivalent to their carrying value. The fair value of 
the put and call option has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash payments for the shares in The Stable Pizza & Cider Limited and 
Nectar Imports Limited set under the terms of the respective shareholders’ agreements. Financial Statements

Share capital represents the nominal value proceeds received on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 40p and 4p ordinary 
shares. The Company’s preference shares are classified as non-current liabilities in accordance with IFRS (see note 24).
The ordinary shareholders are entitled to be paid a dividend out of any surplus profits and to participate in surplus assets on winding up in proportion 
to the nominal value of each class of share (‘B’ shares have one tenth of the nominal value of ‘A’ and ‘C’ shares).
All equity shares in the Company carry one vote per share, save that shares held in treasury have their voting rights suspended. The ‘A’ and ‘C’ shares 
have a 40p nominal value and the ‘B’ shares have a 4p nominal value so that a ‘B’ share dividend will be paid at 10% of the rate applying to ‘A’ and ‘C’ 
shares. The ‘A’ shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The ‘C’ shares carry a right for the holder to convert them to ‘A’ shares by written 
notice in the 30 day period following the half year and preliminary announcements. The ‘B’ shares are not listed and have no conversion rights. 
In most circumstances the value of a ‘B’ share is deemed to be 10% of the value of the listed ‘A’ shares. The Trustee holding shares for participants 
of the LTIP currently waives dividends for shares held during the initial three year period. Dividends are not paid on shares held in treasury.
The Articles include provisions relating to the Company’s ‘B’ and ‘C’ shares which provide that shareholders who wish to transfer their shares may

b) Own Shares
Own shares relate to shares held by independently managed employee share ownership trusts (“ESOTs”) together with the Company’s holding 
of treasury shares. Shares are purchased by the ESOTs in order to satisfy potential awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and Share 
Incentive Scheme (“SIP”). Treasury shares are used, inter alia, to satisfy options under the Company’s share options schemes. The LTIP ESOT 
has waived its rights to dividends on the shares it holds. Treasury shares have voting and dividend rights suspended. All own shares held, as below, 
are excluded from earnings and net assets per share calculations.

28. Share Options and Share Schemes
The key points of each of the Group’s share schemes for grants up to 1 April 2017 are summarised below. All schemes are equity-settled. All disclosure 
relates to both Group and Company. For the purposes of option and LTIP schemes, “Adjusted EPS” will normally be consistent with the post-tax 
earnings per share excluding separately disclosed items as presented in the financial statements. However, the Remuneration Committee is 
authorised to make appropriate adjustments to Adjusted EPS as applied to these schemes.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”)
This scheme grants options over shares at a discount of 20% on the average market price over the three days immediately prior to the date of offer. 
Employees must save a regular amount each month. Savings are made over three or five years, at the participant’s choice. The right to buy shares at the 
discounted price lasts for six months after the end of the savings contract. There are no performance conditions, other than continued employment.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
This is an unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme. If growth in Adjusted EPS exceeds growth in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) by 9% over the 
performance period of the option, then 40% of the award will vest. Vesting levels are then on a sliding scale, with 100% vesting occurring if growth 
in Adjusted EPS exceeds growth in RPI by more than 21%. The performance period for grants under this scheme is three years. Options must be 
exercised within seven years of the end of the performance period.
Executive Share Option Scheme
This is an approved Executive Share Option Scheme. The options vest if growth in Adjusted EPS exceeds the growth in RPI by 9% or more, over 
the three year performance period of the option. The options must then be exercised within seven years after the end of the performance period.
LTIP
This plan awards free shares. Vesting is conditional on growth in Adjusted EPS exceeding growth in RPI by 9% or more over the three year initial 
performance period of the award. Vesting levels are on a sliding scale from 40% up to 100%, if growth in Adjusted EPS exceeds growth in RPI by 24% 
or more. An independent firm of advisors verify the vesting level each year. The initial vesting period is three years. After this time the shares may be 
passed to the plan participants, as long as vesting conditions are met. 
SIP
This plan awards free shares. The number of shares awarded, up to a maximum value of £3,000 per person per year, is based on length of service 
and salary. The life of each plan is five years, after which shares are released to participants. There are no performance conditions as in almost all 
circumstances participants can retain the shares awarded (although there may be tax consequences if sold within five years of the award). 
Share-Based Payment Expense Recognised in the Year
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2017 is £3.2 million 
(2016: £2.6 million). The whole of that expense arises from equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Market Value
The market value of the shares at 1 April 2017 was £9.98 (2016: £10.40).
Movements in the Year
The following tables illustrate the number and weighted average exercise prices (“WAEP”) of, and movements in, each category of share instrument 
during the year.  120

The fair value of free shares awarded under the SIP is the share price at the date of allocation. The total value of SIPs awarded is a fixed rate based on the 
Group’s performance in the preceding financial year. The number of shares awarded is therefore dependent on the share price at the date of the award.  124

Commercial property operating leases are typically for 20 to 25 years, although certain leases have lease periods extending up to 40 years.
Operating leases where the Group is the lessor
The Group earns rental income from two sources. Licensed property included within property, plant and equipment is rented under agreements 
where lessees must also purchase goods from the Group. Additionally there are a smaller number of agreements in respect of investment properties 
where there is no requirement for the lessee to purchase goods.
Investment properties are let to third parties on leases that have remaining terms of between one and ten years.
At 1 April 2017 future minimum rentals receivable by the Group are as follows:

The Group’s and Company’s commercial leases on property are principally for licensed outlets. The terms of the leases are normally for either three, 
five or ten years with the maximum being 30 years. The agreements allow for annual inflationary increases and full rental reviews occur on renewal 
of the lease, or every five years for a ten year lease.
At 1 April 2017 future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable sub-leases included in the figures above were £4.5 million (2016: £8.3 million).
