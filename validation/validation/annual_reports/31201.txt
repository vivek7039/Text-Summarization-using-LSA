BUSINESS MODEL IN ACTION
Strategy formation  
and planning Our industry insight across 
multiple markets holds the key 
to solving complex problems.
We actively seek to build close working relationships with 
our large customers to create strategic customer accounts. 
We have established partnerships with many large OEMs 
across different markets who we discuss future market 
growth and product requirements with. Where the market 
is more fragmented, we employ the targeted use of 
distributors and agents to ensure optimum proﬁtability.
We operate globally but our 
customers see us as a local partner.
We aim to be a trusted partner to our customers by 
creating innovative customer solutions, providing high 
quality engineering and operating efficient manufacturing 
processes. We base our R&D centres close to our 
customers to ensure that we can work closely throughout 
the product design and development phase. At the same 
time, where efficient, we utilise low cost manufacturing 
hubs to ensure we can offer competitive pricing.
We are helping to set the pace 
for automotive connectivity.
In just a few short years, the idea of ‘connected vehicles’ 
has moved from blue-sky thinking to everyday media 
headlines – and technology from our Connected 
Vehicle Solutions (CVS) division is playing a key role 
in that transformation. 
We’re the largest supplier of antennae to the Big Three 
automakers in the US, with a track record of building 
excellent customer relationships. So when we outgrew 
our facility it was strategically important to stay close 
to our customers.
Our new $14m, 43,000 sq. ft., 14.5 acre centre of 
excellence in Grand Blanc, Michigan is helping us to 
set the pace for automotive connectivity, today and 
into the future. Product Development Engineering 
Manager Jason Stoddard who, alongside Jason Furr, 
was responsible for seeing the project through from 
start to completion said, “As this is the hub of the auto 
industry in North America and because we wanted to 
retain our talented people, it was vital that we didn’t 
move far. The new centre gives us more room and 
improved facilities while also reﬂecting our image and 
reputation as a world-class engineering company.”

BUSINESS MODEL IN ACTION
Flawless 
execution I am pleased to report a very much 
improved performance for Laird in 
2017. After a difficult 2016, the swift and 
comprehensive action taken to address 
the problems has delivered reassuring 
results. We have achieved signiﬁcant 
progress in ﬁnancial performance, with 
substantial growth in revenue and a large 
increase in proﬁt. Following completion 
of the rights issue at the start of the year, 
the balance sheet is much strengthened. 
The business now has much more robust 
foundations and is better placed to take 
advantage of future opportunities. 
I have been particularly encouraged 
by the steps that have been taken to 
streamline the organisation and strengthen 
the management of the Company. 
The consistency of delivery across the 
business this year has been in no small 
measure due to these changes. The Board 
is conﬁdent about its plans and the 
Company’s potential. However, it has been 
disappointing not to see the signiﬁcant 
progress that the Company has made 
reﬂected in the share price.
The Board has now received an offer from 
Advent International that represents an 
attractive 72.6% premium to the closing 
share price as at 28 February 2018 and 
provides our shareholders with the 
certainty of realising value from their 
investment in the form of cash. We are 
recommending to our shareholders that 
this offer is accepted. 
Board
The Board reacted well to the difficulties 
in 2016 and continued to challenge and 
support management on both operational 
and strategic issues during 2017.
Following the appointment of Wu Gang as 
a new Non-Executive Director on 1 January, 
there were no further additions to the 
composition of the Board in 2017.
I should like to express the Board’s 
appreciation of our former colleague, 
Sir Christopher Hum, who retired from 
the Board after 10 years of service in 
May 2017. His judgement and wisdom 
were greatly valued.
We take board evaluation very seriously. 
We addressed points arising from a board 
evaluation in 2016 and have recently 
undertaken an independent evaluation 
led by Korn Ferry.

People
The recovery and the momentum that 
has been built in the business in 2017 
would not have been possible without 
the hard work of Laird’s people. I would 
like to thank them for their commitment. 
They deserve credit for the much stronger 
performance delivered by the Company 
during the year.
In a global, dispersed workforce, regular 
and transparent communication is 
essential. I was therefore particularly 
pleased at the excellent participation in 
the Laird Employee Engagement survey 
in 2017 and at the good and improved 
overall score for the business. The Board 
has visited several Laird sites over the 
year, taking the pulse of the Company. 
It also participated in a recent Leadership 
Meeting. This approach builds a culture 
of openness, support and constructive 
challenge which is vital for Laird’s success.
As three years have expired since our 
last Directors’ remuneration policy was 
approved in 2015, the Board is bringing 
a proposal to shareholders for a new 
incentive framework for approval this 
year. At the same time, we will align 
share-based incentive awards for senior 
management with those of the Executive 
Directors to ensure that all management 
awards are linked to delivery against 
targeted business performance objectives.
Outlook
Last year, I said that I remained conﬁdent 
about the potential of Laird and its 
ability to deliver for our shareholders. 
Operationally, we have recovered well 
from 2016 and delivered ahead of 
expectations in 2017.
We have put in place the teams and 
structures to underpin growth, build 
on Laird’s market positions and deliver 
long-term sustainable earnings growth 
and improved cash generation.
We feel that the offer received from 
Advent International is one which 
our shareholders would wish us to 
accept and that it will be easier for 
the Company to implement its plans 
in a private environment.
All successful companies need to be 
valued by their customers. Laird has 
been providing products and solutions 
for almost 200 years and our customer 
survey in 2017 showed that the Company 
retains its good reputation in the eyes of 
its customers. Our end markets remain 
strong and Laird’s businesses can look 
to the future with growing conﬁdence.

13 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information As we announce our results for 2017, the 
Board has received and is recommending 
an offer from Advent International to 
buy the company. Laird is a high quality 
engineering business, with great products, 
people and technology, as the offer, and 
our 2017 results, both demonstrate. I will 
say more on the future of the Company 
in my outlook below.
At the start of 2017, I said that my 
focus on improving the efficiency 
and proﬁtability of our operations 
would be relentless. I am pleased that 
this forensic approach to operational 
improvement has brought much improved 
full year results. Laird has delivered a 
strong proﬁt uplift and entered 2018 
with encouraging momentum.
Our goal is to deliver long-term, 
sustainable revenue and earnings growth 
for our shareholders. This year we have 
made progress across all three divisions, 
as a result of the actions taken to 
improve performance. 
Our ambition is to be the partner of choice 
for our customers, who are redeﬁning 
the world through technology. We aim 
to harness our engineering expertise, our 
market insights and our reputation for 
delivery, to outperform our competitors. 
In doing so, we will deliver a powerful 
investor proposition. 
In 2017, we began putting the components  
in place to achieve this objective. In addition 
to the operational improvements, I have 
strengthened Laird’s executive team 
signiﬁcantly and embedded a new, 
simpliﬁed divisional structure. 
We will deliver our vision through a laser-
like focus on excellent customer service; 
through ﬂawless execution; and through 
continued investment in the world class 
engineering and materials science talent 
that is a key differentiator for Laird. 
In the short-term, we are much improved 
but far from perfect. There are further 
opportunities in front of us to improve our 
operational and commercial performance, 
and this will be a key theme for us in 2018.
Divisional highlights
2017 saw signiﬁcant beneﬁts from the 
simpliﬁed structure, which has brought 
efficiencies and enabled a greater 
focus on complementary markets 
and technologies.
In its ﬁrst year, the new Wireless and 
Thermal Systems (WTS) division 
performed well. The potential here is 
substantial, and we will continue to make 
the investments needed to secure future 
growth opportunities. 
WTS covers three broad technologies: 
connectivity, controls and active thermal 
management. We brought these together 
to better leverage the substantial array of 
engineering skills and technologies at our 
disposal. Connectivity and Thermal both 
delivered year-on-year revenue progress, 
with Connectivity being the stronger. 
The Controls product group was impacted 
in the previous year by the signiﬁcant 
external headwinds in one key market, the 
US rail freight sector. The market has not 
yet rebounded, although we do expect it 
to strengthen over time. In the meantime, 
there has been some encouraging early 
progress in our plan to diversify, both by 
product and geographies.

Chief Executive’s review
Our goal is to deliver long-term, 
sustainable revenue and earnings growth.
A stronger 
company with  
encouraging  
momentum Looking ahead, an area with some 
potential for WTS is Machine Condition 
Monitoring, a high-growth market 
addressing strong customer demand for 
solutions that contribute to productivity 
and efficiency, by monitoring performance 
of critical industrial equipment. Laird has 
a track record of excellence in wireless 
connectivity and deep expertise in 
mission-critical environments, which will 
be highly relevant. 
In Performance Materials (PM), we saw 
good revenue growth, albeit against a 
relatively weak comparative in the prior 
year. We have focused on improving 
the productivity of our manufacturing 
and operations, as well as improving our 
internal processes and correcting our 
commercial inefficiencies. 
The top line performance in 2017 
demonstrates that the actions taken to 
stabilise and improve our commercial 
and operational performance in PM have 
delivered results, with growth in all parts 
of the division, but particularly in Thermal 
Materials and Precision Metals. In Thermal 
Materials, the automotive market presents 
an attractive growth opportunity where we 
may have a real opportunity to generate 
value. The proliferation of electronics within 
the vehicle requires thermal and shielding 
solutions, where we very much excel. 
Medical and absorber markets in Europe 
and the US are also promising focus areas. 
In PM, we are working to establish a 
model that can deliver earnings growth, 
year-on-year, through the smartphone 
cycle. This requires targeted investment 
in non-smartphone business, to drive 
diversiﬁcation. We aim to leverage our 
unique materials science capability 
to develop differentiated solutions 
for our customers, a key to driving 
future proﬁtability. 
In Connected Vehicle Solutions (CVS), 
we are delivering strong revenue growth. 
In 2017 we exceeded $750m in future 
contract wins, which will fuel growth in 
future years. CVS has a full connectivity 
package to offer the major automotive 
manufacturers, and within that a strong 
suite of connectivity and smart device 
integration products. As a leading global 
provider of end-to-end automotive 
connectivity, we have continued to beneﬁt 
from the very strong relationships we have 
established in both the US and Europe. 
It is a market with very strong growth 
dynamics, but also highly competitive. 
It takes early investment to win contract 
opportunities, and that impacts 
margins. But we focus continually on 
sharpening our operations to maximise 
internal efficiencies. 
An important step for us this year was the 
establishment of our new research and 
design centre in Grand Blanc, Michigan, 
in the heart of America’s automotive 
industry. With state-of-the-art engineering 
and design facilities, testing laboratories 
for quality assurance, and other facilities, 
this new centre keeps Laird at the forefront 
of automotive connectivity R&D.
People
Laird’s people are our enduring 
advantage, and in the last 12 months, 
I have signiﬁcantly strengthened Laird’s 
leadership team. I want to thank the new 
executive team for driving our strong 
performance this year. Laird will only grow 
and prosper if we have the right people 
and invest in human capability across the 
company. Together we will write the next 
chapter in Laird’s story. 
Outlook
Laird made signiﬁcant progress and 
delivered a much improved performance 
this year, underpinned by our resolute 
focus on operational excellence. The steps 
taken have laid the ﬁrm foundations 
needed to build a platform for the future.
We have started 2018 with good 
underlying trading momentum across the 
majority of the business, with new business 
wins and new product launches expected 
to support future growth. We expect 
to demonstrate continued progress in 
underlying ﬁnancial performance this year, 
despite possible challenges in premium 
smartphone end markets.
However, as I write this we do have 
currency headwinds against our reported 
results, which are in Sterling. This should 
not distract from driving improvements in 
the sustainability of underlying proﬁt and 
quality of earnings, over the long term.
We aim to harness 
our engineering 
expertise, our 
market insights 
and our reputation 
for delivery, to 
outperform our 
competitors
The strong results secured by the 
actions taken over the past 12 months 
demonstrate the underlying strength of 
Laird. This strength has been recognised 
by Advent International who have offered 
a substantial premium to buy the Group. 
With almost 200 years of history, Laird 
has signiﬁcant prospects to grow and 
strengthen for many more years to come.

17 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Forging deep customer 
relationships based on trust 
and mutual respect.
In Germany, our Performance 
Materials (PM) division works 
with Continental Automotive 
GmbH (Continental), a major 
supplier of radars, infotainment 
systems, dashboards, tyre 
pressure monitoring systems, 
vehicle diagnostic tools and other 
products to the European OEM 
market. “We’ve collaborated 
closely for many years – and in 
that time we’ve built a proactive 
relationship based on trust and 
mutual respect,” explains Stefan 
Suslik, Strategic Account Director 
Automotive at PM. “Continental 
aims to establish a teamwork 
approach with its key suppliers, 
and our technical and sales teams 
talk with their counterparts at 
Continental on a regular basis. 
It’s an approach that works well 
for both parties – our sales with 
Continental have trebled in the 
last three years and at any time 
we will have around 20 different 
projects underway together.”
One such project has involved 
PM producing innovative 
electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) shielding for a network 
control module that manages 
a car’s engine and some safety 
systems. Teams from Laird and 
Continental jointly designed the 
solution to meet the target of zero 
defects in design and production. 
“Our challenges included 
incorporating an in-line cleaning 
module into the manufacturing 
process, to help ensure product 
cleanliness,” adds Stefan. 
“This project has been an excellent 
demonstration of partnership 
in action – thanks to its success, 
PM now supplies shields to more 
than 10 European locations 
of Continental.”

CASE STUDY: CONTINENTAL AUTOMOTIVE
Image: Petr Stryal, 
Process Engineer. Liberec The division creates industry-leading 
solutions which protect electronics 
by conducting harmful waste energy 
streams (e.g. heat and electrical noise) 
safely away from important components 
within devices. Our high-performance 
products include: Precision Metals, 
Thermal Materials, EMI shielding, and 
Magnetic and Ceramics Products that 
protect signal integrity. The division also 
includes Model Solution, our prototype 
and mock-up business based in South 
Korea that is a specialist in designing 
and manufacturing fast turnaround 
prototypes. Model Solution is currently 
classiﬁed as an asset held for sale as the 
Board expects to dispose of the business 
in the next 12 months.
We partner with customers to identify 
and solve complex problems as 
technology changes and devices shrink. 
Our customers are redeﬁning the future 
of technology and include smartphone 
manufacturers, telecom infrastructure 
providers, automotive suppliers and 
military ﬁrms.
Review of the year 
The priority for the past year has been to 
stabilise the ﬁnancial performance of the 
division, following on from a challenging 
2016. Total revenue grew by 13.5% to 
£448.3m (2016: £395.0m) and on an 
organic constant currency basis, revenue 
was 8% higher, albeit against a relatively 
weak comparative in the prior year. 
The revenue growth in 2017 demonstrates 
that the actions taken to stabilise and 
improve commercial and operational 
performance in the division have 
delivered results, with particularly strong 
growth in Precision Metals, Magnetic 
and Ceramic Products and Thermal 
Materials. During the year we focused 
on ensuring we have tight commercial 
controls and disciplines in place, especially 
around the interface with the customer. 
This, combined with customer obsessed 
deployment across our huge portfolio of 
application solutions, has been a critical 
contributor to the improved performance.
With respect to market performance, 
we experienced strong revenue growth 
in smartphones, military and consumer 
electronics. The proliferation of electronics 
within the vehicle, requiring solutions to 
waste energy challenges, continues to 
drive performance in automotive.
Our broad range of materials science 
capabilities and increasing ability to 
deliver multi-functional solutions that 
address multiple application challenges 
simultaneously, ensures we are well placed 
to help solve the complex needs of our 
customers in a wide variety of markets.
Underlying operating proﬁt in the 
year was £47.0m (2016: £42.4m) as a 
result of the organic revenue growth†. 
Operating margin declined to 10.5% 
(2016: 10.7%) as a result of the adverse 
impact of exchange rate movements 
between the US Dollar and RMB and a 
mix shift towards lower gross margin 
handset volumes.
Outlook
In Thermal Materials, the automotive 
market presents an attractive growth 
opportunity where we may have a 
real opportunity to generate value. 
The proliferation of electronics within 
the vehicle requires thermal and shielding 
solutions, where we excel. Medical and 
Defence markets in Europe and the US 
are also promising focus areas.
On the consumer electronics front, 
proliferation of the ‘Connected Home’, 
continuing and evolving growth in 
wearable technologies and the mainstream 
emergence of other consumer devices 
such as drones combine to ensure a 
broad front of opportunities to grow with 
new customers. We continue to focus on 
driving sales with new products. 
We also continue to work on establishing 
a model that can deliver earnings growth, 
year-on-year, through the smartphone 
cycle; while targeting investment in 
non-smartphone business to drive 
diversiﬁcation. We aim to leverage our 
unique materials science capability 
to develop differentiated solutions 
for our customers, a key to driving 
future proﬁtability.
A lean and highly efficient manufacturing 
process remains a critical focus for the 
division as we move towards creating a 
higher quality business and improved 
operating margins.

signals and distribute those signals to 
various parts of the vehicle.
The breadth of our product offering and 
strong market position in antenna ensures 
we are well placed to take advantage of 
the market trend of increased connectivity 
in the vehicle.
Review of the year
This has been a successful year for CVS, 
with the division delivering superior 
revenue growth in a buoyant and 
competitive market. Content requirements 
in the vehicle continue to increase and 
our broad product offering has proven to 
be a real advantage. Total revenue grew 
by 26% to £318.6m (2016: £252.1m), and 
on an organic constant currency basis, 
revenue was 18% higher. This was driven 
by continued strong performance in multi-
functional antennae and the high growth 
in demand for smart device integration 
products. We continue to beneﬁt from 
the strong relationships we have with 
automotive manufacturers in both North 
America and Europe. 
On top of this strong revenue growth, 
the future contract pipeline continues to 
build. During the year, we won contracts 
totalling $750m that are due to go into 
production between 2019 and 2025. 
There was continued progress in Asia, 
with new contract wins worth over $100m 
in China and ﬁrst time contract wins with 
customers in Japan. Progress in these 
markets has been part of our overall 
strategy since 2013 and we continue to 
strengthen our sales and engineering 
teams in the region to take advantage 
of the opportunity that continued 
deployment of 4G brings for our multi-
functional antenna business. 
During the year we opened a new $14m 
state-of-the-art research and design 
facility in Grand Blanc, Michigan providing 
engineering solutions, sophisticated 
testing labs for quality assurance, an 
outdoor testing range and one of two 
world class testing chambers that we own. 
The other is at our facility in Hildesheim, 
 Germany. This new, 43,000 sq. ft. facility  
also provides us with space for future 
expansion to design and test new 
technologies. The Grand Blanc site is 
a reﬂection of a broader strategy to 
ensure we have high quality global design 
centres, combined with an efficient 
manufacturing footprint. 
As previously announced, we exited our 
loss making site in Brazil.
Underlying operating proﬁt in the 
year was £15.9m (2016: £13.0m) as a 
result of the strong revenue growth. 
Operating margin declined marginally 
to 5.0% (2016: 5.2%) as a result of the 
continued investment in research and 
development resources to win and deliver 
future contracts, as well as the adverse 
impact of exchange rate movements 
between the US Dollar and RMB. 
Outlook
Our market-leading reputation as an 
advanced antenna provider ensures we 
are well positioned to take advantage of 
the move to 5G vehicle connectivity, which 
in turn will enable functionality such as 
in-car Wi-Fi calling. The next generation 
of vehicles will be focusing on hidden 
antennas which give teams designing the 
vehicles more ﬂexibility in the look and 
feel of the vehicle. 
As one of the world’s leaders in wireless 
charging in the vehicle, we are well 
positioned to take advantage of this 
strong customer desire as increasing 
numbers of mobile phones enable this 
technology. The expansion of wireless 
charging products to North America 
and Asia provides a signiﬁcant revenue 
opportunity over the next three years. 
We remain on course to deliver $500m 
of revenue in 2020.
There remains signiﬁcant opportunity 
to improve operating margin, through 
increased operating leverage, improved 
operating efficiencies and the wind down 
of low margin/loss making contracts 
that came with the acquisition of Novero 
in 2016.

We began working with Audi, one 
of the leading exponents of in-car 
communication, on this issue back 
in 2012. Today, the relationship 
between our Connected Vehicle 
Solutions (CVS) division and Audi 
has led to our wireless charger 
being integrated into all current 
Audi models. To date, around 
500,000 wireless chargers have 
been installed at Audi – and just 
under one million in the entire 
Volkswagen Group – and 2018 will 
see sales ﬁgures double. 
Drivers and passengers have 
gained great beneﬁts from our 
partnership. In addition to fast, 
safe and convenient wireless 
charging, the advantages include 
being able to use the smartphone 
to take over the functions of the 
car key, such as opening and 
closing the vehicle and starting 
the engine.
Holger Thiel, project leader 
of wireless charging at Audi, 
describes the collaboration 
with Laird as very positive and 
emphasises the value of our 
advanced development work.  
“For us, it is crucial to keep 
to our tight scheduling. 
Without preliminary development 
and prototyping by the supplier, 
this can’t be done.” 
“When our purchasing 
department sends out the booklet 
with the requirements to the 
supplier, the supplier should 
already have the prototype 
ready. That was the case with 
the wireless charger from Laird, 
and it saved us time and work. 
This allowed us to deliver the 
highest level of comfort to our 
customers as quickly as possible.”

CASE STUDY: AUDI
Image: Audi wireless charger. Ensuring a safer workforce
According to Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA), 
in 2015 almost 5,000 workers 
were fatally injured in industrial 
accidents. A new development by 
our Wireless and Thermal Systems 
(WTS) division has the potential to 
drastically reduce those industrial 
accidents. Our Safe-E-Stop product 
is a wireless solution that attaches to 
the waistband of any operator, of up 
to ﬁve authorised users per active 
piece of equipment. In the event of 
a stoppage requirement, instead of 
running to the pushbutton – which 
may be inaccessible – the authorised 
user simply hits the button on 
the Safe-E-Stop. The result? 
Shutdown is typically achieved 
within half a second, which means 
reduced equipment damage, less 
product loss and, crucially, a safer 
and more productive workforce. 
Safe E-Stop is fundamentally 
changing the landscape through 
untethered safety response 
capabilities and user mobility 
within industrial applications.
“The development of Safe-E-
Stop is a great example of how 
Laird’s global experience and 
understanding of end market needs 
and wireless technology can drive 
new product development and 
create new revenue opportunities,” 
says David Stagg, Product Manager. 
“We had an existing emergency stop 
solution which we were selling into 
another industry and we identiﬁed 
opportunities for a custom-designed 
ergonomic emergency stop for 
the automation marketplace. 
In effect, we took a proven concept 
and applied the expertise and 
experience gained in one sector in 
order to move Laird into a new and 
potentially very exciting market.” 
“We presented our initial concept 
during the Rockwell Automation 
Show – and the interest it 
generated was incredible. 
This conﬁrmed our view that Safe-
E-Stop would win business across 
the automation sector, and gave 
us the conﬁrmation to develop it

processes, and provide data for real-
time operating decisions. Our products 
are designed to provide continuous 
connectivity in extremely challenging 
and hostile environments. Our customers 
include large medical and laboratory 
equipment manufacturers, developers 
of high density infrastructure, industrial 
processors, municipalities, and railway 
and mining operators.
Review of the year
The focus of the past year has been 
on successfully establishing this new 
division. We have taken three technologies 
(Connectivity, Controls and Thermal) from 
what were four separate business units to 
form a division where the whole is stronger 
than the sum of the component parts. 
Our application insights, capability range 
from design to ﬁeld service, and operations 
leverage create unique value for our WTS 
customers across end markets.
Total revenue grew by 10% to £169.7m 
(2016: £154.5m), and on an organic 
constant currency basis, revenue was 4% 
higher, primarily driven by Connectivity 
and Thermal products.
Connectivity drove strong revenue and 
proﬁt growth, accelerating in the second 
half of the year. Medical, public safety, 
telecom and commercial markets saw 
the largest growth, driven in part by new 
product launches throughout the year. 
Examples include the 60 Series Wi-Fi 
module targeting medical and commercial 
applications and the LoRa Gateway, 
which provides long range, low data rate 
connectivity across markets.
Controls stabilised ﬁnancial performance 
through better execution in our core 
markets. Whilst the US rail freight 
industry has not rebounded materially 
since the sharp declines seen in 2016, our 
global industrial markets experienced 
modest growth.
Thermal saw solid revenue and accelerated 
proﬁt growth during the year, streamlining 
operations and enhancing lead times 
across its product range.
We see strong growth potential in this 
segment as we commercialise medical 
markets and diversiﬁcation investments 
from recent years.
WTS underlying operating proﬁt in the 
year was £19.8m (2016: £14.3m) as a result 
of the organic revenue growth combined 
with a signiﬁcant increase in operating 
margin to 11.7% (2016: 9.3%). 
In creating WTS, we streamlined our 
operating structure, driving leverage 
and efficiency across processes and 
locations. We invested in sales, marketing, 
and product management capabilities 
to improve our customer and product 
alignment for growth.
Completion of our manufacturing 
footprint changes, announced in late 
2015, further contributed to operating 
margin improvement.
Outlook
The need for tailored connectivity in 
industrial and commercial markets is 
accelerating, driving design and test 
services, module growth, and expansion 
of gateway products. Portable medical 
applications continue to expand, and 
data management and decision support 
has become a key differentiator across 
markets. 5G in high density indoor and 
outdoor applications is accelerating, 
further enhancing the growth proﬁle for 
our Connectivity segment. 
In Controls, recent investments made 
in new products, such as E-Stop (a new 
wireless safety system) (see opposite) 
and a new integrated rail platform provide 
solid foundations for growth. We expect to 
expand further outside the US rail freight 
market, growing our industrial range in 
Europe and increasing our traction in Asia. 
Our Thermal segment is diversifying 
beyond its medical core into new markets, 
where heat loads and demand for 
active cooling systems are accelerating. 
For example, 5G migration and the need 
for higher data networking speeds has 
created opportunities for innovative 
thermal solutions that our business 
provides. We are continuing to expand 
our range of liquid cooling solutions for 
larger and more complex applications. 
Productivity, equipment uptime, safety, 
and operating costs are an increasing 
focus for industrial customers. Solving their 
complex, dynamic problems requires an 
integrated connectivity, sensor, control,  
and software solution tailored to 
application speciﬁcs. WTS is leveraging 
its product and service portfolio to bring 
tangible solutions for these Enterprise 
Internet of Things (EIoT) challenges. 
During 2017, we have made signiﬁcant 
investments in new and improved 
products across all of our segments. 
These investments, combined with 
the changes already made to the 
organisational structure have set us 
up well to drive growth in the future.

* Operating Margin is deﬁned as Segment adjusted operating proﬁt divided by Segment revenue. The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) and recognises that behaving 
ethically, working safely, responsibly 
managing our environmental impact 
and contributing to the communities in 
which we operate, creates and sustains 
value for our shareholders and our 
wider stakeholders. Beyond a baseline 
of responsible compliance, we target 
improvement in our key sustainability 
indicators and operate to mitigate risks 
and improve our operating efficiencies as 
part of the day job through embedding 
our CSR ethos in the way we operate to 
drive sustained growth hand-in-hand with 
lower environmental impacts.
Ethics and human rights
We are committed to high standards of 
business ethics and the promotion of 
human rights within our business and in 
our dealings with stakeholders. We apply 
these standards in our dealings with 
employees, customers, suppliers and 
other stakeholders. This commitment is 
underpinned by a mindset of compliance 
with all legislative and regulatory 
requirements and on the maintenance of 
high ethical standards, within each of the 
territories and jurisdictions in which we 
conduct our business. 
Our Global Code of Conduct (the Code) 
provides the guiding principles, forms 
the basis for how we do business and 
is rooted in the principles of honesty, 
integrity and fairness. The Code, which 
is available on our website alongside all 
key social responsibility policies, provides 
the framework for our policies, processes 
and procedures relating to human rights, 
equal opportunity, anti-slavery, ethics, 
compliance, anti-harassment, anti-bribery 
and corruption, conﬂicts of interest and 
regulatory compliance.
Our global Ethics Hotline provides a 
conﬁdential way for employees to raise 
concerns about inappropriate behaviour 
anonymously. The hotline utilises an 
independent telephone and internet 
provider, offering support in local 
languages and has an internal escalation 
and resolution process.
Safety
The safety of our people and visitors to 
our sites is of paramount importance 
to management. 2017 saw an increase 
in the reportable accident rate against 
a backdrop of signiﬁcant operational 
change as we completed a project 
to rationalise our global operational 
footprint. Having set the framework for 
better EHS systems of transparency 
and accountability, the focus of our 
EHS strategy in 2018 will shift to driving 
cultural change globally, recognising their 
personal ownership and empowerment 
on safety and environmental issues. 
Sustainability and environment
We are committed to continuously 
improving our sustainability to increase 
efficiency in energy, waste generation 
and water usage. Our manufacturing sites 
develop local sustainability initiatives 
each year in addition to centralised 
initiatives for shared services such as 
global logistics. We have maintained our 
standing on the FTSE4Good index in 2017 
for a 14th consecutive year.
We measure our progress by monitoring 
non-ﬁnancial Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) which are detailed on pages 30 
to 35 within this section. Our carbon 
emissions relative to revenue, which are 
driven predominantly by power usage, 
have been managed down in 2017 by 8% 
with a reduction in waste to landﬁll of 11% 
as a proportion of sales. It is anticipated 
that the project to rationalise our global 
operational footprint, which completes 
in 2017, will drive further environmental 
improvements in 2018. 
CO 2 emissions
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions KPI data 
was derived using an emissions calculator 
within the EICC Carbon Reporting System 
tool that converts actual site-level energy 
usage data into tonnes CO 2 equivalent 
(CO 2e) direct and indirect emissions.

Key Performance Indicators
In this section, we show how we are 
delivering against our KPIs relating to 
being a good citizen. Performance against 
our other KPIs relating to ﬁnancial 
strength, proﬁtable growth and investing 
in our business can be found in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s report, pages 30 to 35.
The emissions calculator is consistent 
with GHG Protocol and the best available 
public emissions factors from sources that 
include the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Control (IPCC), the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) and the United 
States Department of Energy (US DOE). 
Throughout 2017, we monitored energy 
usage and carbon emissions in our largest 
seven sites which account for more 
than 75.9% of our scope 1 and scope 2 
CO 2 emissions. Total GHG at these 
sites in 2017 were 53,302 tonnes CO2, 
approximately 15.5% above 2016 levels 
(46,168 tonnes CO 2).
Tonnes of CO2 equivalent
Scope 1 4.0%
Scope 2 96.0%
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG 
emissions from sources that are owned 
or controlled by the entity such as fossil 
fuels burned on site and other direct 
sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect 
GHG emissions resulting from the 
generation of electricity, heating and 
cooling or steam generated off site but 
purchased by the entity.
Water
In 2017 we continued to monitor and 
measure water usage at Laird locations, 
with total usage of 459,171 cubic meters 
(436,537 in 2016).
Community
We have continued to focus on our 
place in the local communities in which 
we operate, with support initiatives and 
charitable activities, such as established 
support provided for local schools, driven 
by our operational site management 
teams. This approach helps embed our 
facilities as recognised contributors 
in their local environments, which 
has a positive impact not only on the 
communities but on our people and 
local stakeholders. 
Supply chain 
Management of CSR with suppliers 
Laird requires all its suppliers to sign 
up to a Supplier Code of Conduct that 
mirrors our internal Business Conduct 
Code, covering a wide range of ethics 
issues including prohibiting child 
labour, conﬂict minerals and requiring 
action to prevent slavery and human 
trafficking throughout the supply chain. 
Laird uses a team of supply chain auditors, 
operating in a prioritised framework, to 
provide assurance on compliance with the 
Code of Conduct as well as quality and 
operational requirements.
Our people
We recognise that we need to attract 
high quality people while retaining the 
skills and knowledge already present in 
order to build a pool of talent focused 
on delivering our business objectives 
and sustaining our success. We aim to 
achieve this by creating a safe, stimulating 
work environment which offers 
great opportunities and competitive 
remuneration. Developing the right 
leadership culture is central to this and

Gender split of permanent 
staff as at 31 December 2017 This document contains certain ﬁnancial measures that are not 
deﬁned or recognised under IFRS, including Covenant EBITA and 
Covenant EBITDA, net debt, cash interest expense, underlying 
proﬁt before tax, underlying operating proﬁt, underlying basic 
earnings per share, operating cash ﬂow, free cash ﬂow, organic 
constant currency metrics and ﬁgures relating to the reorganisation 
of the Group’s divisions. These measures are unaudited and are 
not measures of ﬁnancial performance under IFRS and should not 
be considered as alternatives to other indicators of the Group’s 
operating performance, cash ﬂows or any other measure of 
performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, these 
non-IFRS measures should be viewed as supplemental to, but not 
as a substitute for, measures presented in the Laird Final Results 
and Laird Annual Report and Accounts, which are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
Information regarding these measures is sometimes used by 
investors to evaluate the efficiency of a company’s operations and 
its ability to employ its earnings toward repayment of debt, capital 
expenditures and working capital requirements. However, there 
are no generally accepted principles governing the calculation 
of these measures and the criteria upon which these measures 
are based can vary from company to company. These measures, 
by themselves, do not provide a sufficient basis to compare the 
Company’s performance with that of other companies and should 
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating proﬁt 
or any other measure as an indicator of operating performance, 
or as an alternative to cash generated from operating activities 
as a measure of liquidity.
Covenant EBITA and Covenant EBITDA
The Group is subject to two key ﬁnancial covenants, which 
are tested semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December of 
each year. These covenants relate to the leverage ratio, being 
the ratio between Covenant EBITDA and net debt, and the 
interest cover ratio between Covenant EBITA and cash interest 
expense. The calculation of these ratios involves the translation 
of non–sterling denominated debt using average, rather than 
closing, rates of exchange and adjustments for removal of 
the 49% of Model Solution that the Group does not own from 
the calculation.
Covenant EBITA is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before 
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets 
and exceptional items, adding back amortisation of software, 
amortisation and impairment of capitalised development costs, 
share based payments and pre-acquisition gains/(losses), 
less the amounts attributable to the 49% of Model Solution 
that the Group does not own. Covenant EBITDA is deﬁned as 
Covenant EBITA adding back depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment. The Group uses Covenant EBITA and Covenant 
EBITDA in the calculation of its interest cover and leverage ratios 
under its ﬁnancing arrangements, respectively.
Covenant EBITA and Covenant EBITDA eliminate potential 
differences in performance caused by variations in capital 
structures (affecting net ﬁnance costs), tax positions (such 
as the availability of net operating losses against which to 
relieve taxable proﬁts), the cost and age of tangible assets 
(affecting relative depreciation expense), the extent to which 
intangible assets are identiﬁable (affecting relative amortisation 
expense) and other speciﬁc items that are considered to 
hinder comparison of the trading performance of the Group’s 
businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. 
For the periods under review, other speciﬁc items represent 
items deﬁned by management are exceptional items and share 
based charges.
Covenant EBITA and Covenant EBITDA have limitations as an 
analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:
• does not reﬂect the Group’s cash expenditures or 
future requirements for capital expenditures or 
contractual commitments;
• does not reﬂect changes in, or cash requirements for, the 
Group’s working capital needs;
• does not reﬂect the signiﬁcant interest expense, or the 
cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal 
payments, on the Group’s indebtedness;
• although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, 
the assets being depreciated and amortised will often 
have to be replaced in the future, and Covenant EBITA and 
Covenant EBITDA do not reﬂect any cash requirements for 
such replacements;
• it is not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that 
are reﬂected in the Group’s statements of cash ﬂows; and
• the further adjustments made in calculating Covenant EBITA 
and Covenant EBITDA are those that management consider 
are not representative of the underlying operations of the 
Group and therefore are subjective in nature.

of the year prior to the acquisition by the Group of that business asset.
2. As required by the Group’s Existing Finance Arrangements, the 
calculation of Covenant EBITA and Covenant EBITDA is adjusted to 
exclude amounts attributable to the 49% of Model Solution that the 
Group does not own.
Net debt
The Group uses net debt, deﬁned as total borrowings less 
cash and cash equivalents, as a supplemental measure in 
evaluating its liquidity, as it indicates the level of the Group’s 
borrowings after taking account of cash and cash equivalents 
within the Group’s business that could be utilised to pay down 
the outstanding borrowings, as well as in the calculation of 
the leverage ratio under its ﬁnancing arrangements.

exchange movements (£3.2m in 2017) and the 49% of the 
external debt of Model Solution that the Group does not own 
(£3.5m in 2017). In 2017, the Group’s net debt for purposes of 
covenant calculation was £164.1m. 
Cash interest expense
The Group uses cash interest expense, deﬁned as ﬁnance costs,

instruments, impairment of goodwill, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and exceptional items) and underlying 
operating proﬁt (underlying proﬁt before tax, adding back 
ﬁnance income, ﬁnance costs and other ﬁnance revenue – 
pension) as supplemental measures of the Group’s proﬁtability, 
which the Group considers useful due to the exclusion of

Organic constant currency metrics
The Group uses organic constant currency metrics because 
the Directors believe that these measures provide investors 
with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying 
performance of the Group as they eliminate the effect of 
acquisitions and the translation effect of currency exchange 
movements from period to period.
The following tables provide reconciliations of Group and 
segmental revenue on an actual basis to revenue on an 
organic constant currency basis for the periods indicated.

29 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Revenue and segment adjusted 
underlying operating proﬁt/margin
Revenue increased by 16.8% from 
£801.6m in 2016 to £936.6m in 2017. 
Performance Materials revenues were 
up 13%, Connected Vehicle Solutions 
revenues were up 26% and Wireless and 
Thermal Systems revenues were up 10%.
The table below provides further 
analysis of revenue and the underlying 
operating proﬁt. 
Revenue on an organic constant currency 
basis was up by 10%. This excludes revenue 
from acquisitions for a period of 12 months 
from the acquisition date and applies prior 
year exchange rates to convert current 
year revenues to GBP. Segmental revenue 
is also disclosed in note 3.
Revenue from our largest customer 
amounted to 14% of revenue (2016: 13%). 
Segment adjusted operating margin* 
for Performance Materials was up 11% 
at £47.0m (2016: £42.2m), although the 
segment adjusted operating margin* fell 
to 10.5% (2016: 10.7%) as the revenue 
mix moved towards lower than average 
margin business (smartphone handsets). 
Connected Vehicle Solutions segment 
adjusted operating proﬁt* was up 22% 
at £15.9m (2016: £13.0m) with segment 
adjusted operating margin* falling slightly 
to 5.0% given the continued investment 
in the business, particularly in engineering 
capability. Wireless and Thermal Systems 
segment adjusted operating proﬁt* was 
up 38% at £19.8m (2016: £14.3m) and 
the segment adjusted operating margin* 
increased signiﬁcantly to 11.7% (2016: 9.3%). 
In creating the new Division a streamlined 
operating structure was put in place, driving 
efficiency across processes and locations.

30 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Chief Financial Officer’s report 
Much improved results 
lay strong foundations 
for the future
The commercial 
strategy of the business 
is supported by tax-
aware, commercial 
decisions that are made 
in a timely manner.  Statutory proﬁt
Proﬁt before tax was £57.0m (2016: 
loss before tax of £122.3m). The loss in 
2016 was principally due to recognising 
a £155.5m charge for impairment 
of goodwill. The following sections 
break down the movement into its 
component parts.
In 2017, there was a statutory proﬁt after 
tax of £71.8m, compared to a loss after tax 
of £110.8m in 2016. In 2017 there was a 
tax credit of £14.8m compared to a credit 
of £11.5m in 2016. The overall 2017 tax 
credit includes a credit of £31.1m relating 
to deferred tax on goodwill, acquired 
intangible assets and US capitalised 
development costs (2016: £19.4m credit) 
and deferred tax on US losses of £3.5m 
(2016: £1.2m credit).
Underlying proﬁt† and taxation
Underlying proﬁt before tax† in the year 
was £67.3m (2016: £51.1m). Underlying proﬁt 
before tax is deﬁned on page 27.
The underlying tax charge† on total 
underlying proﬁt before tax is equivalent to 
an average tax rate of 24.1% (2016: 24.9%). 
Proﬁts in the US in the period were 
sheltered by amortised goodwill 
deductions resulting from acquisitions 
and interest expense. As a result, Laird’s 
tax payable largely arises in China, the 
Czech Republic, Korea and Malaysia. 
An analysis of the total tax charge is given 
in note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Tax strategy
Laird operates with integrity in all tax 
matters and takes into account the needs 
of all relevant stakeholders. We operate an 
effective tax control framework to ensure 
compliance with all relevant legislative and 
regulatory requirements, while maximising 
shareholder value in line with our stated 
commercial strategy.
The commercial strategy of the business 
is supported by tax-aware, commercial 
decisions that are made in a timely 
manner. They provide a sustainable 
operating platform to the Group’s 
commercial activities and are designed 
to ensure that the Group’s tax obligations 
are consistently met whilst maintaining 
Laird’s reputation for innovation, reliable 
fulﬁlment and speed.
Impact of US tax reform
In December 2017 the US enacted 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (‘the Act’) 
which came into effect on 1 January 
2018. The measures included in the Act, 
subject to any further speciﬁc guidance 
on interpretation being released, give 
rise to an initial one-off non-cash tax 
credit of £38.5m in 2017 resulting from 
the revaluation of the Group’s aggregate 
US Deferred Tax Liabilities following 
the reduction in the US federal rate of 
corporate income tax to 21%. The rate 
change also gives rise to a one-off non-
cash tax charge of £17.7m in 2017 resulting 
from the revaluation of the Group’s US 
Deferred Tax Assets related to brought-
forward losses of £9.2m, and in respect of 
other US Deferred Tax Assets of £8.5m. 
Following the changes in the US tax 
regime, the Group has reassessed the 
amount of the Deferred Tax Asset that 
should be recognised in respect of US 
brought-forward losses. This revaluation 
has led to a one-off non-cash tax credit of 
£5.7m in the 2017 period.
The Act also includes a transition tax as 
the US moves to an exemption regime 
for foreign dividends. There is a one-off 
non-cash amount of £3.0m in respect of 
cumulative retained earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries that reduces the unrecognised 
losses available for future periods.
R&D expenditure has increased by 30.2% to £90.9m (9.7% of revenue) from £69.8m 
(8.7% of revenue). The increase is primarily driven by the translation of these costs 
into Sterling and partly due to continued investment in future growth opportunities.

There was an exceptional credit of 
£0.7m in 2017 (2016: £1.2m credit). 
Restructuring costs include charges 
associated with the reorganisation of 
the business into three divisions and the 
closure of the CVS site in Brazil, partially 
offset by a credit relating to the re-design 
of our operating model. The acquisition 
related credit relates to a settlement 
with the previous owner of Novero, a 
settlement with an ex-sales representative 
of Novero and the release of an onerous 
contract provision that was on the balance 
sheet when we acquired Novero and has 
been re-negotiated. Refer to note 27 of 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 
details of the change in valuation of the 
put and call options in respect of Model 
Solution. A deﬁnition of exceptional items 
is given in note 2 of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements on page 113.

Treasury policies
Laird has a centralised Treasury function, 
the objectives of which are to monitor and 
manage the ﬁnancial risks of the Group 
and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is 
available to meet the requirements of the 
business. Group Treasury is not intended 
to be a proﬁt centre and operates within 
a framework of policies and procedures.
Laird’s Treasury uses derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to assist in the management 
of foreign exchange and interest rate 
risk, principally forward foreign exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps. 
All hedging is carried out centrally 
and speculative trading is speciﬁcally 
prohibited by Group Treasury policy. 
The non-cash tax credits and charges 
arising from US tax reform can be seen 
in note 11 to the accounts, with closing 
deferred tax balances shown in note 24.
Laird continues to work through the 
details of this complex legislation and the 
associated guidance. It is not expected 
that there will be an increase in the 
underlying tax charge for the Group as 
a result of these reforms. However there 
will be an increase in the cash tax 
payable in the US of approx. £1.5m for 
2018, and approx. £3m for 2019 due to 
the newly-introduced Base Erosion and 
Anti-Abuse Tax.
Uncertainties relating to tax liabilities
The global nature of the Group’s 
operations and the presence of cross-
border transactions present a complex 
tax environment with less certainty 
over the tax treatment of certain items. 
Laird engages with the relevant tax 
authorities to achieve certainty over 
the tax treatment, but where this is not 
possible, or when dialogue is ongoing, 
a tax provision for uncertainty is 
sometimes needed. 
The total tax provisions at 31 December 
2017 amount to £22.9m. As these items 
can be complex and highly judgmental, 
when assessing the need for, and the 
quantum of, these provisions, Laird 
considers the status of tax audits, the 
outcome of previous similar claims, 
changes in local and international tax 
laws and the wider tax environment. 
In particular, Laird continues to monitor 
the situation as to the OECD’s Base 
Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting initiative and 
relevant government responses, as well 
as the European Commission’s State Aid 
investigation into the UK’s Controlled 
Foreign Company regime. 
Further information as to the accounting 
policies relating to tax provisions can be 
found in note 2.
Future tax charge
It is expected that the underlying tax 
charge in 2018 will be in the range of 
24% to 25%, subject to any unexpected 
changes to tax rates in the countries in 
which we operate. The reduction in the tax 
rate from the prior year is primarily due to 
the impact of changes in the group’s proﬁt 
mix, amendments to the group’s transfer 
pricing policies to ensure alignment with 
the Divisional reorganisation in 2017, 
as well as actions that Laird plans to 
implement to mitigate the impact of the 
US tax reforms enacted at the end of 2017.

£2.8m (2016: £1.9m loss), were £9.6m, 
compared to £10.8m in 2016. 
Earnings per share
Basic statutory earnings per share was 
15.8p (2016: 31.8p loss, restated for the 
2017 rights issue). The basic weighted 
average number of shares in issue 
in 2017 was 452.7m.
Underlying earnings per share
Continuing underlying basic earnings per 
share were 11.1p (2016: 10.5p, restated for 
the 2017 rights issue). 
Cash ﬂow
The table below provides a further 
analysis of cash ﬂow to complement 
the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. 
The increase in operating proﬁt broadly 
carried through to Operating Cash Flow 
as lower capital expenditure was offset 
by a higher working capital outﬂow and 
higher capitalised development (to drive 
future growth). Operating cash ﬂow grew 
by 84% to £51.8m.
Deﬁnition: See page 28 for a full deﬁnition

Deﬁnition: Operating cash ﬂow expressed as 
a percentage of underlying operating proﬁt.
Why we measure: Measures cash generation and

Total borrowings 216.8 409.1
The reduction in borrowings from 2016 
to 2017 reﬂects the proceeds from the 
rights issue being used to pay down debt. 
Within the 2017 ﬁgures are borrowings 
associated with assets classiﬁed as held 
for sale of £8.5m (2016: £nil) and ﬁnance 
leases of £0.6m (2016: £9.1m).
Balance sheet policy
The Group considers its capital to be 
the sum of its equity and net debt. 
The Group’s policy is to manage a 
conservative Balance Sheet gearing 
position, with appropriate levels of debt 
for our business risk. During 2017 the 
Group raised £174.9m of net proceeds by 
means of a fully underwritten rights issue, 
resulting in a reduced level of leverage 
and improved covenant headroom.
Capital structure is further discussed 
in note 27 to the ﬁnancial statements 
on page 139 under the heading 
Capital Management. 
Operations classiﬁed as held for sale
On 12 December 2017 the Board resolved 
to dipose of the Group’s Model Solution 
business and negotiations with an 
interested party have subsequently 
taken place. These operations, which are 
expected to be sold within 12 months, 
have been classiﬁed as a disposal group 
held for sale and presented separately 
in the consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position. Further details are 
provided in note 17 of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Interest rate risk
Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as 
it holds borrowings on both a ﬁxed and 
ﬂoating basis. Our policy for this risk is 
to optimise the mix of ﬁxed and ﬂoating 
rate borrowings using interest rate swaps 
and forward rate agreements to manage 
Laird’s ﬁnance costs.
Credit and counterparty risk
Our policy on counterparty risk 
management is to place cash deposits 
and other ﬁnancial instruments with 
our relationship banks, all of which also 
provide credit facilities to Laird. The level 
of exposure to each bank is continually 
monitored. As at 31 December 2017, 
all cash and short-term deposits had 
a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign exchange management
Due to the international reach of the 
Group, currency transaction exposures 
exist. The Group has a policy in place to 
hedge between 75% and 100% of local 
foreign currency exposures on a quarterly 
basis, and may further hedge material 
ﬁrm commitments and a proportion of 
highly probable forecast transactions for 
longer maturities. The Group continues its 
practice of not hedging income statement 
translation exposure. Foreign currency 
borrowings are used partially to hedge the 
currencies of the Group’s principal assets 
and cash ﬂows.
Net debt and debt facilities
Net debt was £164.4m (2016: £344.6m). 
Refer to the Adjusted Measures section on 
page 27 for a reconciliation of the Group’s 
net debt from borrowings. A cornerstone 
of our ﬁnancial planning is to ensure that 
we maintain committed loan ﬁnance 
which provides sufficient headroom above 
expected borrowing requirements and 
has a signiﬁcant proportion with terms 
that exceed one year. Our committed 
bilateral revolving credit facilities total 
£235m, and will expire in 2019. In addition, 
we have total US Private Placement notes 
and Schuldschein loans of $140m and 
€77m outstanding:
Deﬁnition: See page 26 for a full deﬁnition 
and reconciliation.
Why we measure: Conﬁrms compliance with the 
covenant maximum of 3.5 times and demonstrates 
the level of headroom to the covenants. 
Deﬁnition: Covenant EBITA divided 
by cash interest expense.
Why we measure: Conﬁrms compliance 
with the covenant minimum of 3.0 times

There is also the translation impact in 
converting overseas proﬁts into the 
Group’s reporting currency (Sterling); 
A one percent depreciation of Sterling 
against all other currencies approximates 
to an annual increase in operating proﬁt 
of £0.9m.
During the year Sterling was weaker than 
in 2016. This delivered a £5.1m translation 
beneﬁt to Group operating proﬁt.
Pensions
There are approximately 1,500 deferred 
and current pensioners. There is an overall 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme surplus 
under IAS 19 (revised 2011) of £5.2m at 
31 December 2017 (2016: £1.2m deﬁcit). 
Scheme liabilities increased mainly due 
to a reduction in assumed inﬂation from 
3.45% to 3.25% and a reduction in the 
discount rate from 2.50% to 2.45%. 
The reduction in liabilities was partly 
offset by a reduction in the value of 
scheme assets to £131.8m (2016: £134.8m).
Shareholders’ funds
Equity attributable to owners of the 
parent company at the 2017 year 
end was £569.9m (2016: £343.8m). 
The reconciliation is set out in the 
Group statement of changes in equity.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed (underlying 
proﬁt before interest and tax as a 
proportion of average shareholders’ funds 
plus net borrowings during the year) was 
10.8% in 2017, compared with 9.5% in 2016.
By order of the Board
K J Dangerﬁeld
Chief Financial Officer
1 March 2018
Dividend policy and post 
balance sheet event
On 1 March 2018 the Board announced 
that it had reached agreement on the 
terms of a recommended cash acquisition 
of the entire issued and to be issued 
ordinary share capital of Laird PLC. 
Further details are provided in note 35 
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
As a result of this announcement no ﬁnal 
dividend is currently proposed.
Covenants
A key consideration for ﬁnancial planning 
is to maintain sufficient headroom 
between borrowings and the ceiling set 
by the covenants. Our bank facilities, 
Schuldschein and US Private Placement 
loans contain two principal ﬁnancial 
covenants: net debt/EBITDA (earnings 
before exceptional items, interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and 
interest cover. The normal permitted 
limits are a maximum net debt of 3.5 
times EBITDA and an interest cover of 
at least three times. For the year ended 
31 December 2017, net borrowings were 
1.4 times EBITDA, within the normal 
maximum permitted of 3.5 times. 
Interest cover was 10.2 against the 
minimum requirement of three times. 
The expected headroom is routinely 
estimated against the covenants and 
the sensitivity to a number of alternative 
scenarios is tested to ensure ongoing 
compliance. At the balance sheet date 
the covenant ratios fall comfortably 
within these limits.
Currencies 
As a global business, the Group is exposed 
to a number of foreign currencies. 
While a signiﬁcant proportion of our 
revenue is denominated in US Dollars, 
our costs are often in the local currency 
of the countries in which we operate. 
This leads to a mismatch and therefore 
an exposure to currency movements on 
a transactional basis. 
Deﬁnition: Underlying operating proﬁt divided 
by average equity attributable to owners of the 
parent company and net debt. 
Why we measure: Provides an indication of 
how we are performing relative to our peers 
and against our cost of capital.

10.8 The Board conducts an annual review of 
the effectiveness of the risk and controls 
framework, and reviews the principal risks 
and the arrangements for monitoring and 
controlling the risk environment.
Reporting of changes to risks and 
incidents in-year are embedded in the 
monthly Executive Committee business 
performance review process, with material 
changes to risks and incidents being 
reported up to Board level for every Board 
meeting through a risk management 
section in the Group Performance Report. 
Under the revised risk management 
framework cross division and functional 
assessment of the current risk environment 
will be undertaken four times a year by the 
RGSG with review of the highest level risk 
register and a risk incident dashboard and 
outcomes of the review reported to the 
Executive Committee and included in the 
Group Performance Report for the Board.
Assurance on the adequacy of key risk 
controls is provided by internal audit for 
ﬁnancial controls, reporting up to the 
Audit Committee. Assurance is provided 
by assurance teams for environmental, 
health and safety risks, site business 
interruption risks and trade and customs 
compliance. These teams report centrally 
to the Chief Risk Officer with oversight of 
their ﬁndings through the RGSG.
A modiﬁed process 
for the new 3 Division 
Business Model. 
Through 2017 we have 
worked on embedding a 
modiﬁed risk framework 
tuned to new 3 Division 
Business Model
Following the major challenges in 2016, 
our emphasis in 2017 has been to stabilize 
the business and to focus on operational 
and commercial delivery. The successful 
completion of the Rights Issue in April 
2017 addressed the liquidity and banking 
covenant risks which ﬂowed from the 
challenges of 2016. We have completed 
the project rationalizing our global 
footprint and been embedding the new 
3 Division organisational structure and 
risk-governance model.
Risk framework
The Executive Committee has 
responsibility for reviewing risk and 
setting the direction of risk activities 
in Laird while the Board continues to 
retain overall accountability for risk. 
With the restructure to a 3 Division 
business model at the start of 2017, 
the risk framework was developed with 
the creation of the Risk and Governance 
Steering Group (‘RGSG’) which has senior 
representation from the three divisions 
and key corporate functions. The RGSG 
has delegated responsibility from the 
Executive Committee to oversee the 
adequacy of controls and the delivery of 
remediation actions in relation to risks as 
well as to monitor changes to the wider 
risk environment and movements in the 
factors affecting Laird’s principal risks. 
The RGSG has further responsibility 
for incident/crisis management and 
monitoring the risks related to major 
change programmes.
Divisional and functional risk reviews 
are embedded in the strategic planning 
process, with facilitated workshops with 
management teams for risk identiﬁcation 
and monitoring, with in year review 
managed by risk champions in each 
division or function. Each of the three 
divisions and the key corporate functions 
have an individual risk register and any 
risks that are signiﬁcant either alone or 
in aggregate are included in the group 
register. This “bottom-up” approach to 
the risk management process facilitates 
clear ownership and accountability of 
the risks by the Divisions and underpins 
risk analysis and linkage to the risk 
assurance and risk transfer mechanisms.

Risk management 
Embedding 
a strong risk  
management  
process Key developments in 2017
Laird has continued to improve its risk 
management policies and procedures 
during the year
• Implemented an enhanced 
risk framework to formally 
deﬁne the infrastructure 
and activities within which 
risk is proactively managed. 
This framework consists of a 
collection of policies, processes 
and methodologies and includes 
new risk categories, impact and 
likelihood scales and formal 
reporting mechanisms.
• Established the RGSG consisting 
of divisional and corporate VPs 
with delegated authority for 
overseeing the management 
of risks and incidents. 
• Facilitated risk workshops 
with divisional and functional 
management to support 
effective risk identiﬁcation and 
risk assessments as part of the 
Strategic planning process. 
• Initial development of a 
framework process for risk 
appetite statements within the 
business to set the context for 
management of risk by Divisional 
and Functional owners.
• Following these developments 
and advice on best practice, we 
have reassessed the principle 
risks and uncertainties, as 
discussed on the following page.
Viability Statement
Risk Testing
Scenario testing of the principal 
risks has been conducted in 
support of the Viability Statement 
in the Directors’ report for 2017, 
see page 89. 
A methodology which focused on 
the speed-to-impact potential for 
cash impairment and impact on 
banking covenants was used to 
assess principal risks in order to 
identify relevant key risk scenarios 
which could impact viability. 
Scenario testing of the principal 
risks was then conducted using 
the impairment principles (cash 
headroom and asset impairment 
sensitivity) used for the ‘Going 
Concern’ statement, but over 
the three-year horizon of the 
Strategic Plan.
The scenario testing covered the 
impact of individual risk scenarios, 
the cumulative effect of combined 
identiﬁed risks crystallising as well 
as stress testing for the impact of 
all viability risks occurring.

FUNCTIONS Principal risks and uncertainties
Laird faces a number of normal business risks such as those 
relating to regulatory compliance, geopolitical change and changes 
in general economic conditions. In the context of our strategies 
above, the following summarises the principal risks which are the 
most important for us because of our market, industry, strategy 
and global footprint. The following risks are listed based on the 
residual risk once the impact, likelihood and effectiveness of 
existing controls have been taken into account. Impact factors 
are assessed across ﬁve areas, ﬁnancial, strategic, operational, 
legal and reputational.
While many UK businesses would have the United Kingdom’s 
anticipated withdrawal from the European Union as a principal 
risk, Laird does not have signiﬁcant trading activities in or 
from the United Kingdom, so direct impacts from Brexit are 
limited and it is not considered a principal risk. 
How we have categorised our risks
Strategic 
Includes risks arising from adverse business decisions, improper 
implementation of decisions, or unexpected adverse changes 
in the business environment with respect to the economy, 
political landscape, public policy, or the actions of competitors.
Operations and Governance 
Includes risks resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, operations governance compliance, people, 
systems, or from external events.
Finance 
Includes risks associated with client debt obligations, 
adequacy of cash resources, interest rate ﬂuctuations, foreign 
currency transactions, ﬁnancial accounting and disclosure.
Changes in Principal Risks
Key changes in principal risks over 2017:
• Increased risks in the automotive sector related to rapidly 
growing automotive revenue. 
• Increased risks to global trade from protectionist agendas.
• Reduction in change management risk (no longer 
considered a principal risk) with the completion of the 
project to rationalise the global operational footprint.
• Increased volatility in foreign exchange exposure driving 
translational and transactional uncertainty.

Key Customer 
Dependency
Aligned to 
strategy points:  
3,4,5
The Group is dependent on a small number of large 
global customers with whom it does not have any 
contractual guarantees for a signiﬁcant portion of its 
sales and a decrease in or the loss of business from 
one or more of these customers or increased pricing 
pressure from one or more of these customers would 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
The Group’s customers in its largest business unit 
typically do not commit to long-term purchase 
contracts, which results in low visibility on future 
cash ﬂows in that business unit.
• Protecting our position by maintaining 
and extending a broad customer base 
and monitoring the market to support 
a swift response to market changes.
• Developing the business into new and 
attractive growth markets in line with 
strategic objectives.
• Maintaining a competitive and ﬂexible 
manufacturing base.
• Differentiating Laird with customers. 
• Contract review and negotiation through 
in-house legal team and external advisers.

Automotive  
Market  
Dynamics
Aligned to 
strategy points:  
2,3,4
Rapid growth of Laird business in the automotive 
sector brings with it the risks associated with 
bidding in a competitive market for very long-term 
business with a limited number of large customers. 
Participation requires substantial up-front investment 
in design and development capability, well in advance 
of associated revenues.
• Robust business opportunity evaluation 
and approval processes.
• Differentiating Laird with customers 
to achieve close partnerships. 
• Strategic options to balance Laird’s 
overall business portfolio.

Increased  
Trade  
Protectionism 
Aligned to 
strategy points:  
3 & 5
The Group may be adversely impacted by a move towards 
protectionist international trade policies. Recent political 
events in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have 
signalled increasing vocal support for a move toward 
protectionist international trade policies. Restrictions on 
or rising costs of global free trade may require the Group 
to relocate manufacturing activities, which could entail 
signiﬁcant costs and could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, ﬁnancial condition and results of 
operations in the short-term.
• Global manufacturing footprint ﬂexibility. 
• Trade Compliance optimisation strategies.
• Contractual risk sharing with customers 
and suppliers.
Slow. Changes to 
international trade 
treaties are 
subject to detailed

Property 
Rights (IPR)
Aligned to

If the Group’s products, systems or solutions are found 
to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the 
Group may be required to change its business practices 
and may also become liable for damages and face 
invalidation of the Group’s intellectual property rights.
Failure to protect the Group’s intellectual property rights 
could adversely affect the Group’s ﬁnancial condition 
and results of operations.
• Specialist IPR legal review. 
• Patent checks in the product

Actual, possible or perceived defects, failures or quality 
issues associated with the Group’s products could lead 
to product recalls and litigation, including product 
liability claims, or negative publicity that could materially 
adversely affect the Group’s reputation, business, 
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations
• Product and operations quality 
control processes.
• Supplier quality review and audits.
• Automotive, ISO and other relevant 
standards compliance Production

Operations 
Continuity
Aligned to 
strategy points:  
1 & 5
Disruptions of operations at the Group’s key factories or 
sites due to disasters or other business continuity events 
could impact the Group’s ability to meet its production 
requirements and a failure to successfully recover from 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s business.
A cybersecurity incident could negatively impact 
the Group’s business or operations or may harm its 
relationships with customers.
• Risk management and recovery plans in 
place at site, business unit and corporate 
functional levels.
• Use of expert partners to continuously 
improve site risk management controls

• Flexing production between sites.
• Cyber and IT protections and Business

Contract Risk
Aligned to 
strategy points:  
3,4,5
Market dynamics in some parts of the business with large 
key customers could lead to onerous or imbalanced 
contracts, potentially for very long term business, where 
assumptions on future cost and efficiencies could lead to 
commitments to potentially unproﬁtable business and/or 
unlimited or very high potential penalties and legal costs.
• Robust business opportunity evaluation 
and approval processes.
• Comprehensive contract review by 
internal legal function. 
• Effective operational 
efficiency mechanisms.
• Product quality and compliance controls.

Exchange rate movements could impact on reported 
proﬁt through a combination of translational and 
transactional risk. 
• Commercial management of exposures. 
• Hedging activity.
• Matching of currency borrowings.
• Debt apportionment in currencies 
to offset translation risk.

Dear Fellow Shareholder
Good corporate governance underpins 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy 
and overall commercial objectives. 
As Chairman of the Company, I am 
therefore pleased to present our 
Corporate Governance Statement for 
2017. This report describes how our Board 
applies the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) and its general approach 
to corporate governance.
Further information about the application 
by the Board of the main principles and 
provisions of the Code can be found on 
page 45. As a Board, our focus continues 
to be on strategy. However, in the light 
of the disappointing results in 2016, 
increased attention was placed on the 
detailed operational performance of 
the Company and of its Divisions. 
Both Divisional and Functional 
Management regularly present to 
the Board and on two occasions we 
speciﬁcally met to consider Management’s 
proposals concerning bids for potential 
contracts with customers. Towards the 
end of 2017, we held a dedicated strategy 
meeting at our new state of the art 
Grand Blanc facility in Michigan 
and, in January 2018, met with the 
Group’s senior leadership team at their 
conference in Seattle. 
We have sought and received regular 
updates on the views of stakeholders, 
including investors, customers and 
employees. As described in the introduction 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
our Remuneration Committee consulted 
with major shareholders regarding the 
implementation of a new Remuneration 
Policy (‘the Policy’). The current policy 
has been in existence for 3 years and, 
in accordance with regulations, now 
requires renewal. No material changes 
are proposed. The revisions which are 
being put forward are detailed in the 
remuneration section on pages 58 to 88. 
They are aimed primarily at improving 
the robustness of the policy framework 
and incorporating new standards of best 
corporate practice. The Policy will be put 
to shareholders at the 2018 AGM. At the 
same time, we will be aligning share based 
incentive awards for senior management 
with those of the Executive Directors to 
ensure that all management awards are 
linked to delivery against targeted business 
performance objectives.
As I noted in my report last year, we 
commenced a fully underwritten Rights 
Issue, which was successfully completed 
in April 2017. It allowed the Company 
to reduce its borrowings under existing 
revolving credit facilities, signiﬁcantly 
strengthening our ﬁnancial position. 
Board and Executive Committee changes 
As announced last year, Wu Gang joined 
the Board as an Independent Non 
Executive Director and member of the 
Remuneration Committee with effect 
from 1 January 2017. Sir Christopher Hum, 
having served on the Board for over 10 
years and delayed his planned retirement 
in the interests of board continuity, 
stepped down at the 2017 AGM. 
Sir Christopher brought considerable 
insight to the deliberations of the Board 
and its Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees and I thank him for his 
invaluable contributions over the years. 
We also saw several changes to our 
Executive Committee in 2017, with Kevin 
White being promoted to President, 
Wireless and Thermal Systems and 
44 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Corporate governance statement
Introduction to the Corporate Governance Statement
Dr Martin Read, CBE
Chairman Directors’ statements
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The principal rules applying to UK 
companies listed on the London Stock 
Exchange for the period covered by this 
statement are contained in the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
published by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (‘FRC’). A copy is available at 
www.frc.org.uk. For the period ended 
31 December 2017, the Board considers 
that the Company was fully compliant 
with the provisions of the Code except 
in respect of the composition of its 
Remuneration Committee between 
29 April 2017 and 13 December 2017. 
The Code recommends that the 
Remuneration Committee consists of 
at least three independent directors. 
Following the retirement of Sir Christopher 
Hum on 28 April 2017 until the appointment 
of Kjersti Wiklund on 13 December 2017, 
the Remuneration Committee consisted 
of two independent directors and the 
Chairman, Dr Read. Dr Read was an 
independent Non-Executive Director on 
his appointment but, as Chairman of the 
Company, is disregarded in the calculation 
of the number of independent directors 
on the Committee. On 13 December 2017, 
Kjersti Wiklund, a further independent 
Non-Executive Director, was appointed 
to the Committee, at which point the 
Remuneration Committee met the 
membership recommendations of 
the Code.
Going Concern
As set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 93, the Accounts 
have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. A statement on going concern 
relating to a business requires judgement 
at a point in time about future events 
which, by their nature, are inherently 
uncertain. The Directors have reviewed 
the Group’s performance for the year and 
the principal risks it faces, together with 
budget and cash ﬂow forecasts and have 
considered the ability of the Group to 
maintain committed ﬁnance, meet existing 
debt covenants and the impact of foreign 
currency exposures. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Accounts. 
Viability
The Board has assessed the prospects 
of the Company over a longer period 
than the 12 months required by the going 
concern requirements of the Code. 
On the basis of a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, the 
Board’s review of the three-year operating 
forecasts to December 2020, the 
Company’s current ﬁnancial, operational 
and investment proﬁle, the Board conﬁrms 
that it has a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, 
over the three-year period to December 
2020. Further details are set out on 
pages 91 and 92.
On 1 March 2018, the Board announced 
that it had reached agreement on the 
terms of a recommended cash acquisition 
of the entire issued and to be issued 
ordinary share capital of Laird PLC at a 
price of 200p per share by a wholly-owned 
indirect subsidiary of funds managed by 
Advent International Corporation. 
The offer, which would be effected by 
means of a scheme of arrangement 
under Part 26 of the Companies Act, 
is subject to shareholder approval and 
standard conditions set out in the 2.7 
notice, including relevant clearances from 
competition and regulatory authorities in 
China, EU and US.
The preceding going concern and 
viability statements assume that, should 
the proposed offer proceed, the Group 
continues to operate in line with its current 
business plans.
Principal Risks 
The Directors have undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. Further details of 
the principal risks and uncertainties are 
set out on pages 38 and 39.
Review of Internal Control 
and Risk Management
During the year, the Board, with the 
assistance of the Audit Committee, 
monitored the systems of internal control 
and risk management and carried out a 
review of their effectiveness. Further details 
are set out on pages 49 and 50.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable
The Directors consider the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
to provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
strategy, business model, position and 
performance. Further details are set out 
on page 89.
Carmen Chua and Christine 
McGourty joining Laird as 
President, Performance Materials 
and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer 
respectively. Changes continued 
in 2018, with Mike Bell joining the 
Executive Committee in the newly-
created role of Chief Technology 
Officer. Matt Stripe will be joining 
Laird on 19 March 2018 as the Chief 
Human Resources Officer.
Board performance evaluation 
The Board asked Korn Ferry to 
carry out an externally facilitated 
review of its performance in 2017. 
The review found that the Board 
operates well and, noting the 
challenges faced last year, that 
the dynamic in the Board room 
reﬂects a healthy and robust 
debate amongst an experienced 
set of Directors. The Board remains 
committed to ensuring that a high 
standard of corporate governance 
is maintained throughout 
the Company. 
I look forward to welcoming those 
of you that are able to attend our 
AGM in April. 
Dr Martin Read, CBE

and experience to ensure the Board is 
effective and no individual or group can 
dominate the Board’s decision-making.

Nomination Committee. Further details 
of the Nomination Committee and its 
activities are set out on pages 51 and 52.

On appointment, Directors are notiﬁed 
of the time commitment expected from

joining the Board and, as part of the 
annual performance evaluation, the

All the Directors are subject to re-election 
at the AGM each year.
C. Accountability

that they are fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Strategic Report 
set out on pages 1 to 39 provides 
information about the performance of 
the Group, the business model, strategy 
and the principle risks and uncertainties 
relating to the Group’s future prospects.
C.2 Risk Management and 
Internal Control
The Board decides the Group’s risk 
appetite and annually reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems. The activities of the Audit 
Committee, which assists the Board 
with its responsibilities in relation to the 
management of risk, are summarised on 
pages 53 to 57.
C.3 Audit Committee and Auditors
The Board has delegated a number 
of responsibilities to the Audit 
Committee, which is responsible 
for overseeing the Group’s ﬁnancial 
reporting process, internal control and 
risk management framework, the work 
undertaken by the External Auditor 
and the work of internal audit.
D. Remuneration
D.1 Level and Components 
of Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee sets 
levels of remuneration which are 
designed to promote the long-term 
success of the Company, but also 
structures remuneration so as to link 
it to both corporate and individual 
performance, thereby aligning the 
Executive Management’s interests 
with those of shareholders.
D.2 Development of Remuneration 
Policy and Setting of Remuneration 
Packages
The Remuneration Committee has 
been delegated the responsibility for 
developing the remuneration policy 
and proposing individual packages, 
with no Director having any involvement 
in the determination of their own 
remuneration. Details of the activities 
of the Remuneration Committee are 
set out on pages 58 to 88.
E. Relations with 
Shareholders
E.1 Dialogue with Shareholders
The Board takes an active role in 
engaging with shareholders. The Board 
particularly values the opportunity 
to meet with shareholders and the 
Chairman ensures that the Board is 
kept informed of shareholder views.
E.2 Constructive Use of the Annual 
General meeting (‘AGM’)
The AGM provides the Board with 
an opportunity to meet with the 
Company’s shareholders, who are 
invited to meet the Board informally 
following the formal business of 
the meeting.
Application of Code principles
How the Company has applied the main 
principles of the Code is explained below. 
46 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued A. Leadership
The Role of the Board
The Board is appointed by the 
shareholders, who are the owners of 
the Company. The Board is collectively 
responsible for the oversight and success 
of the business. The Board establishes the 
aims and objectives for the Company, sets 
the strategic direction and plans, and the 
operating budgets which are proposed 
by the Chief Executive, and monitors 
performance against them.
The Board is also responsible for 
identifying, evaluating and monitoring 
the key risks faced by the Company 
for exercising proper and appropriate 
corporate governance, for establishing 
and ensuring the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control and for 
reviewing management performance. 
Through the Chief Executive, the Board 
has regard to the necessary ﬁnancial 
and human resources required to meet 
the Company’s objectives. 
There is a schedule of key operational 
matters reserved for Board approval.
The Board also delegates certain 
responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees (the 
‘Committees’). The written terms 
of reference of the Committees are 
available on the Company’s website 
at www.laird-plc.com and from the 
Company on request. The Chairman of 
each Committee reports to the Board, 
as appropriate, and the minutes of all 
Committee meetings are circulated to all 
Board members, unless it is inappropriate 
to do so. More details about these 
Committees can be found in this report.
Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are held separately and there 
is a clear written division of responsibility 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive, which has been agreed by 
the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for 
the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the day-
to-day management of the Company 
and implementation of the strategy 
and policies adopted by the Board. 
The Chairman’s other signiﬁcant 
commitments are detailed in his 
biography on page 41. There were no 
signiﬁcant changes to his commitments 
during the year.
Mike Parker has been the Senior 
Independent Director since March 2015. 
He serves as an additional contact point 
for shareholders. He provides a sounding 
board for the Chairman and is available 
to fellow Non-Executive Directors, either 
individually or collectively, to discuss 
any matters of concern in a forum that 
does not include the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors or other members 
of the management team. He also has 
responsibility for leading the annual 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance.
Non-Executive Directors
Our Non-Executive Directors complement 
the skills and experience of the Executive 
Directors. They constructively challenge 
and scrutinise the performance of 
management and help develop proposals 
on strategy. The letters of appointment of 
the Non-Executive Directors are available 
from the Company on request and are put 
on display at the AGM.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to the Board and its Committees and 
attended all board meetings during 
the year under review. The current 
Company Secretary, Gerhard du Plessis, 
was appointed in August 2015, having 
been appointed as General Counsel in 
October 2014. He is also a member of 
the Executive Committee.
B. Effectiveness
Effective Composition of the Board
The composition of the Board, as 
outlined on pages 40 and 41, includes 
an appropriate balance of the skills 
and experience appropriate for 
the requirements of the business. 
Further information relating to 
appointments to the Board and the 
Board’s policy on diversity, including 
gender, is included in the Nomination 
Committee section of this report on 
pages 51 to 52.
As noted in our last Annual Report, Wu 
Gang was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 1 January 2017. 
Sir Christopher Hum, who had served 
the Board for over 10 years and delayed 
his planned retirement in the interests of 
Board continuity, retired at the 2017 AGM.
 
Recommended acquisition
The Work of the Laird Board
The Board has received an offer from 
Advent that represents an attractive 
72.6% premium to the closing share 
price as at 28 February 2018 and 
provides our shareholders with the 
certainty of realising value from 
their investment in the form of cash. 
In the process of considering the offer, 
the Board received detailed brieﬁngs 
on Directors’ responsibilities and 
Takeover Code issues. It also received 
and debated an update of its strategic 
plan and detailed presentations on 
valuation. Throughout the period, the 
Board was advised by the General 
Counsel & Company Secretary and 
experienced investment banking and 
legal advisers. We are recommending 
to our shareholders that this offer 
is accepted.
47 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Operation of the Board
The Board and Committees have regular 
scheduled meetings and hold additional 
meetings as and when required. The Board 
meets at least eight times a year. A schedule 
of meetings and principal matters to be 
discussed is normally set out at least 
12 months in advance. The Board makes 
periodic visits to the Company’s operations. 
During the year under review, the Board 
visited the Company’s new Connected 
Vehicle research facilities in Grand Blanc, 
USA, and a number of Board members 
visited the Wireless and Thermal Systems 
division’s facilities in Cedarburg, USA. 
Additionally, the heads of the business 
Divisions and other senior executives 
holding functional responsibilities 
periodically give presentations at Board 
meetings. The Board, with the exception of 
Ms Bell, further met the Group’s leadership 
team at its annual management conference 
in early 2018, held in Seattle, USA.
The Board held eight scheduled meetings 
in 2017, including a dedicated strategy day. 
There were ﬁve Audit Committee meetings, 
ﬁve Remuneration Committee meetings 
and two Nomination Committee meetings 
during the year. Details of attendance at 
Board and General meetings are given 
in the table above and are discussed in 
more detail in the separate Committee 
sections of this report. Two additional ad-
hoc meetings were held on short notice 
to discuss new business proposals for 
which Board approval was required under 
the Company’s Delegated Authorities. 
Directors are expected, where possible, 
to attend all Board meetings, relevant 
Committee meetings and the AGM. 
Whenever a Director is unable to attend a 
meeting, the Director will consult with the 
Chairman prior to the meeting and is briefed 
by the Chairman after the meeting.
Independence
Currently the Board comprises a Non-
Executive Chairman, ﬁve other Non-
Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. The Code requires that at least 
half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should be independent Non-Executive 
Directors. This requirement continues to be 
met as the Board considers all of the Non-
Executive Directors to be independent. 
The Board considers all of the Non-
Executive Directors to be independent 
of management and in character and 
judgement, and are free from any business 
or other relationship that could interfere 
with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. Under the Code a chairman 
is not considered to be an independent 
director but is required to be independent 
on his appointment. Martin Read was 
appointed as an independent Non-
Executive Director in February 2014 before 
he became Chairman in May 2014.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors met at least twice during the year 
without the Executive Directors present 
and the Senior Independent Director met 
at least once with the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Chairman present.
Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s 
share or bonus schemes and their 
service is non-pensionable.
Induction and training
Upon his appointment, Wu Gang received 
a tailored induction which included 
meetings with members of the Executive 
Committee and senior members of the 
Company’s divisions. As part of board visits 
to the United States he met with senior 
members of management responsible for 
the Connectivity Solutions business of the 
Wireless and Thermal Solutions Division. 
In addition he received a brieﬁng from the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary 
on his responsibilities as a director of a 
company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and of relevant Group policies. 
Existing Directors are provided with training 
as necessary. This can take the form of 
reports and brieﬁngs from external advisers 
and senior employees, attendance at 
seminars and conferences and bespoke 
training. During the year, the Board received 
updates on legislative developments 
that impact Corporate Governance in 
the UK. In addition, as part of the annual 
performance review, each Director is asked 
about their individual training needs so 
that this can be factored into forthcoming 
programmes. The Company sponsored the 
attendance of Ms Wiklund at a course for 
non-executive directors at the Institute of 
Directors in London.
Time commitment
A schedule of meetings and principal 
matters to be discussed is normally set out 
at least 12 months in advance, enabling 
the Board to assess the expected time 
commitment. Furthermore, the letters of 
appointment of each Director include an 
approximate estimate of time required 
per annum to cover meeting attendance, 
preparation for meetings and overseas 
visits. The Board is satisﬁed that each 
Director is able to devote sufficient time 
to fulﬁl their duties.
B. Effectiveness
Attendance at meetings of the Board
There was full attendance at all meetings in the year except where indicated below. 
On the two occasions where a director was unable to attend, they were fully briefed 
prior to the meeting and any comments which they had on the matters to be 
considered were given to the Chairman or the Company Secretary.
Eight scheduled Board meetings, including a dedicated strategy day, were planned 
and held during the year. Two ad hoc meetings were convened for speciﬁc purposes. 
The table below sets out the number of Board and General meetings the Directors 
attended and the ﬁgures in brackets are the maximum number of these meetings 
the Directors could have attended.

Governance
Corporate governance statement continued Information and support
It is important that the Board should 
be supplied with information in a timely 
manner, in a form and of a quality 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties. Minutes of meetings are circulated 
to the relevant Committee members prior 
to each Committee meeting. Prior to 
Board meetings, all Directors receive 
Board papers which include detailed 
ﬁnancial information, strategic reports 
and operational overviews. Directors may 
also take independent professional advice 
where necessary at the Company’s 
expense and have access to the services 
of the Company Secretary.
Board evaluation
This year the Board carried out an externally 
facilitated board effectiveness review. 
Following a selection process, Korn Ferry 
were appointed in 2017 to conduct the 
review. Korn Ferry issued questionnaires to 
the Board and other stakeholders before 
holding a series of one-to-one meetings. 
The review was structured, around seven 
areas, including Directors contribution and 
team dynamics. The results were discussed 
with the Chairman and fed back to the 
Board as a whole, with Korn Ferry being 
invited to discuss their ﬁndings with the 
Board at its February meeting.
The review found that the Board operates 
well and, noting the challenges faced last 
year, that the dynamic in the board room 
has developed into one of healthy and 
robust debate amongst a diverse and 
experienced set of Directors. 
The Directors noted that good progress 
had been made in addressing the areas 
identiﬁed in the prior year review that could 
beneﬁt from further focus. This included 
improvements to information provided to 
the Board and a review of the approach 
to the delegation of authority and 
risk management. 
Election and re-election of Directors
All of the Directors will stand for re-
election at the AGM. Biographical details 
of the Directors are included in the 
Notice of AGM and on pages 40 and 41. 
Further information on Board changes 
during the year is given in the Nomination 
Committee section of this report on 
pages 51 and 52.
Internal control
Laird PLC is a holding company registered 
in the UK with businesses primarily 
located overseas. These businesses are 
organised as subsidiary companies where 
the management of these companies 
are appointed to manage within the 
framework established by the Laird Board, 
as well as to comply with local statutory 
and regulatory requirements. 
Overall responsibility for the Group’s 
systems of internal control including 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance 
controls, and reviewing their effectiveness 
lies with the Laird Board, which ensures 
that a review is carried out at least 
annually to assess the adequacy of 
those systems. 
Following a review of the Company’s 
systems and controls in the wake of the 
October 2016 proﬁt warning, the Board 
and Executive Management implemented 
enhanced controls and procedures in 
certain speciﬁc areas, including strategic 
planning and forecasting. To support 
this further, oversight and management 
of risk and governance was transferred 
to a newly constituted Executive 
Committee (the ‘ExCom’) in order to 
enhance further effective management 
and oversight. This ExCom consists of 
the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Heads of the three Business 
Units, the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, the Chief Risk Officer and the 
Chief Technology Officer. The ExCom is 
chaired by the Chief Executive. It reviews 
and approves all major transactions and 
material commitments by the Group. 
Meetings are held on a monthly basis, 
supplemented by weekly ad-hoc meetings 
for approvals as required. Outcomes and 
decisions from all meetings are minuted 
and distributed for implementation as 
required and reported to the Board.
Primary responsibility for systems of 
internal control rests with the managers of 
the three business divisions. The ExCom 
is responsible for implementing Group 
policy and for monitoring the business 
divisions’ performance and reporting to 
the Board thereon. Financial information is 
reviewed at business division level as well 
as by the Group’s Finance Department, 
which prepares the consolidation and 
ﬁnancial statements to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial position and results of the Group 
are appropriately reﬂected. 
An ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant 
risks faced by the Group is in place and 
complies with the Code and follows the 
FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting and is at 
least reviewed annually by the Board. 
This process has been in place for the 
full ﬁnancial year and up to the date the 
accounts were approved by the Board. 
The systems of internal control are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives as well as safeguarding the 
Group’s assets. These systems can only 
provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Authorities and delegations are 
issued periodically to the managers 
of subsidiaries setting out their 
responsibilities and delegated authorities. 
These rules require approval for speciﬁc 
transactions and call for accurate and 
relevant ﬁnancial information to be 
delivered on a timely basis. The ability 
to identify risk is enhanced by the timely 
reporting of management information 
and the short lines of communication with 
operating managers.
Business divisions and corporate functions 
participate in an annual strategic planning 
process to set out strategic objectives 
and identify the related key risk and 
control issues and mitigating actions. 
This process provides the baseline for 
them to submit their budgets annually 
to the ExCom for approval. In addition, 
through a risk and controls assessment 
process embedded in the business 
performance review process, emergent 
risk and control issues are managed 
transparently on a continuous basis. 
A risk management update, reporting 
emergent risks and any changes to the 
risk environment, is presented at Board 
meetings. This process is supplemented 
by papers submitted to the Board by 
the Executive Directors throughout the 
year and by meetings from time to time 
between the Board and the management 
of the businesses, some of which take 
place at the premises of the operating 
companies. The Chief Executive presents 
the Company’s business objectives which 
are approved by the Board, and the Board 
also addresses those risks which affect the 
Company as a whole. The Board instigates 
further reports and investigations as it 
considers necessary.

49 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information E. Relations with shareholders
Shareholder engagement
The Company is committed to 
increasing shareholder value and 
ensures it communicates its prospects 
and achievements to shareholders in 
a timely manner and within the limits 
imposed by the Listing Rules made 
by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Regular communication with shareholders 
takes place through the Annual Report 
and Accounts, the Final and Interim 
Results presentation materials and other 
press releases of business signiﬁcance 
throughout the year. Signiﬁcant matters 
relating to the trading or development 
of the business are communicated to 
the market by way of announcements 
through a regulatory information service. 
These announcements also appear 
on the Company’s website, along with 
other press releases, presentations, 
webcasts, informative videos and business 
case studies.
The Head of Investor Relations, working 
closely with the Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Officer on a day-to-day 
basis, has full responsibility for devising 
and implementing the Company’s Investor 
Communications Plan to service its 
current and prospective shareholders and 
provide information to ﬁnancial analysts.
The Board receives regular written reports 
and verbal updates on ongoing Investor 
Relations activity, including from the 
Company’s brokers. These, along with 
reports from the investor community 
help the Board, and in particular the Non-
Executive Directors, gain an understanding 
of major shareholders’ views.
During 2017, there was continued 
proactive focus on engaging with the 
Company’s institutional shareholders 
and private client brokers to ensure the 
Company’s prospects and developments 
were understood. This included 
institutional investor roadshows, both in 
the ﬁrst and second half of the year, with 
feedback being relayed to the Board.
Throughout the year, the Company 
participated in shareholder and 
prospective shareholder meetings. 
The Company’s largest shareholders 
were also consulted regarding the 
proposed remuneration policy, which 
will be put to shareholders at the 2018 
AGM. The Chairman also contacts all 
major shareholders at least annually in 
order to hear their views and understand 
their concerns. While a programme 
of co-ordinated activity is followed 
throughout the year, where appropriate 
we also respond to ad-hoc requests for 
meetings. The majority of the meetings 
were attended by a combination of the 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
and/or the Head of Investor Relations. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are also available for meetings 
with shareholders in the event that 
there are any concerns which cannot be 
addressed through management, or in 
connection with any signiﬁcant change 
to the Company’s strategy, remuneration 
policy or governance arrangements.
Wherever possible, the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors attend 
results presentations and they 
welcome the AGM as an opportunity 
to communicate with both private 
investors and institutional shareholders. 
Shareholders are invited to ask questions 
and are given the opportunity to meet 
the Directors informally after the 
meeting. The Chairman gives a formal 
report on the Company’s progress at 
the meeting and a copy of his statement 
is issued to a regulatory information 
service and published on the Company’s 
website. All of the Directors attended 
the AGM in 2017 and the Chairmen of 
the Remuneration, Nomination and 
Audit Committees were available to 
answer questions relating to their areas 
of responsibility. The number of proxy 
votes cast for, against and withheld 
on the resolutions are reported to the 
meeting and following the meeting are 
published on the Company’s website. 
All but two directors also attended the 
General Meeting in March 2017, at which 
the resolution to approve the allotment 
of new shares pursuant to the rights issue, 
was overwhelmingly approved.
The Company has in place internal control 
and risk management arrangements 
in relation to the Company’s ﬁnancial 
reporting processes and the preparation 
of its consolidated accounts. 
The arrangements include procedures 
to ensure the maintenance of records 
which accurately and fairly reﬂect 
transactions to enable the preparation 
of ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board adopted 
for use in the European Union (IFRS), as 
appropriate. They also provide reasonable 
assurance that reported data is reviewed 
and reconciled and there is appropriate 
monitoring internally and by the 
Audit Committee.
Ongoing ﬁnancial performance is 
monitored through regular reporting to 
the ExCom and monthly reporting to the 
Board. Capital investment and all revenue 
expenditure are regulated by a budgetary 
process and authorisation levels with 
reviews as required.

Governance
Corporate governance statement continued In reviewing its Terms of Reference, the 
Committee considered whether it was 
appropriate to expand its remit to include 
taking the lead on the annual performance 
review of individual Non-Executive 
Directors (apart from the Chairman). 
The Committee agreed to recommend the 
proposal and the attendant amendments 
to the Terms of Reference to the Board 
which agreed with the proposal. 
The Committee adopted a formal 
Board Diversity Policy which reﬂects 
the approach that has been taken in 
the recruitment for Board vacancies 
throughout my stewardship.
Appointment of new directors 
Over the last few years, we have 
progressively renewed the membership 
of the Board. Following a number of 
changes in recent years, Wu Gang, whose 
recruitment was reported last year, 
took up office on 1 January 2017 as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director and a 
member of the Remuneration Committee. 
Board evaluation 
This year, in accordance with the Code’s 
recommendation that the evaluation of 
the Board should be externally facilitated 
at least every three years, Korn Ferry have 
carried out our Board Review.
Further details of the process and ﬁndings 
are set out on page 49.
Director Nomination (2)

Sir Christopher Hum 1 (of 1)
M Parker 2 (of 2)
N Rachou 1 (of 1)
Dear Fellow Shareholder
The Nomination Committee 
(‘the Committee’) is responsible for 
regularly reviewing the structure, 
size and composition of the Board 
and making recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes. 
It also leads the search process and 
makes recommendations to the Board 
for the appointment of new directors.
I chaired the Committee throughout 
the year. For the ﬁrst part of the year, 
other members were Mike Parker and 
Sir Christopher Hum. Following Sir 
Christopher’s resignation on 28 April 
2017, Nathalie Rachou was appointed 
to the Committee.
Review of activity during the year 
The Committee met twice during the 
year. It considered, among other things, 
whether to recommend for reappointment 
those Directors whose term in office was 
due to expire after the 2017 or 2018 AGMs, 
paying particular attention to Paula Bell’s 
prospective appointment at the 2018 AGM 
in the light of the fact that she will have 
served on the Board for over six years. 
Following the retirement of Sir Christopher 
Hum at the 2017 AGM, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that Nathalie 
Rachou be appointed to the Nomination 
Committee in his place. The Nomination 
Committee further recommended the 
appointment of Kjersti Wiklund to the 
Remuneration Committee.

Report of the 
Nomination Committee Diversity policy at Board level 
The Committee recognises that 
diversity is key for introducing different 
perspectives, insights and challenge 
into board debate and decision making. 
We understand that the Board sets the 
tone for inclusion and diversity across 
the business and believe in having a 
diverse leadership team and an open 
and inclusive culture. Creating an equal, 
fair and diverse workplace has always 
been a priority for Laird. 
At Laird, diversity encompasses experience, 
skills, education, tenure, age, geographical 
expertise, gender, ethnicity, professional 
background, disability and sexual 
orientation. We seek to maintain a strong 
board, with a balance of commercial and 
technical experience and believe that 
diversity of thought and business expertise 
is paramount.
The Committee regularly monitors the 
composition of the Board and reviews the 
gender proﬁle of the Group. Currently, 
women account for over half the Non-
Executive Directors, comprising 37.5% of 
the Board as a whole. Given the size of 
the Board, we do not believe that setting 
speciﬁc formulaic diversity targets is 
appropriate. A breakdown of the gender 
proﬁle for the Group, including senior 
leadership, can be found on page 25.
Looking ahead to 2018 
The Board has seen many changes over 
the last couple of years and no further 
changes to the composition of the Board 
or that of its Committees are foreseen 
over the coming year.

I am pleased to present the 
Audit Committee’s report which 
sets out details of the activities 
undertaken by the Committee 
during the period. The Audit 
Committee (‘the Committee’) 
assists the Board in fulﬁlling 
its oversight responsibilities 
regarding in particular the 
Company’s ﬁnancial and corporate 
reporting, risk management 
and internal controls, the long-
term viability statement given 
in this Annual Report and the 
independence and effectiveness 
of the external auditors. 
This was the second full year with Deloitte 
LLP (‘Deloitte’) responsible for our 
external audit. The Committee oversaw 
and monitored the work undertaken by 
Deloitte in executing the external audit 
and noted the results of the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Audit Quality Review 
of Deloitte’s audit of the Company, along 
with their performance on other audits of 
listed companies. 
Further details of this review and how 
we ensure the effectiveness of the 
external auditors can be found on 
page 56. The Committee also oversaw 
and monitored the internal audit process 
which was executed by the Chief Risk 
and Assurance Officer supported by 
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’). It also approved 
the proposed internal audit plan for 2018. 
The Committee also advises the Board 
as to whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy. At the beginning of each 
ﬁnancial year, the Committee agrees 
the annual agenda of activities identifying 
key areas of focus and emerging topics.

As a Committee we are keen to constantly 
evolve our focus on ﬁnancial risks that 
face the business as operations continue 
to grow globally, while ensuring robust 
reporting is underpinned by appropriate 
and effective processes, controls and 
assurance. The Committee recognises 
the requirement to keep primary areas 
of judgement under review and report 
accordingly and is committed to fulﬁlling 
its responsibilities in this regard.
The work of the Committee is far ranging. 
It engages with the business effectively 
and assesses the adequacy of the 
internal ﬁnancial control environment. 
The Committee receives regular updates 
throughout the year on any changes in 
the ﬁnancial controls environment and 
also receives assurances from external 
professional advisers. The Committee 
continues to challenge and develop 
the scope of the Group’s internal audit 
programme to match the evolving growth 
of the business as the organisational 
structure adapts and changes. 
The Committee also reviews and discusses 
with the external auditor the scope of the 
audit to ensure it appropriately responds 
to risk. 
In considering the integrity of ﬁnancial 
reporting this year we considered the 
following key judgement areas in detail: 
revenue recognition in the current period 
and the impact of new accounting 
standards going forward; tax provisioning 
and deferred tax valuation; and the 
carrying value of assets. Further details 
of the Committee’s work in these areas 
is set out below.
The Committee monitors and reviews 
annually the whistleblowing policy 
and process, and any incidents of 
whistleblowing are brought to the 
Committee’s attention. The appointment 
of an independent telephone and internet 
provider ensures that all staff have 
the opportunity to make conﬁdential 
disclosures about suspected impropriety 
or wrong-doing.

Report of the 
Audit Committee
Paula Bell
Chairman of the Audit Committee Objective
To provide effective oversight and 
governance over the Group’s ﬁnancial 
reporting, including the adequacy of 
related disclosures, the performance 
of both the internal audit function and 
the external auditor, and the internal 
ﬁnancial control environment and the 
processes in place to monitor this.
Responsibilities
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are documented and agreed 
by the Board. The key terms are outlined 
below and the full terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website, 
www.laird-plc.com:
• reviewing the ﬁnancial results 
announcements and ﬁnancial 
statements and any signiﬁcant ﬁnancial 
reporting issues and judgements which 
they may contain;
• advising the Board on whether the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy;
• ensuring compliance with applicable 
accounting standards and reviewing the 
appropriateness of accounting policies 
and practices in place;
• assessing the adequacy of the internal 
ﬁnancial control environment and the 
processes in place to monitor this, 
including reviewing the performance 
of the internal audit team;
• overseeing the relationship with 
the external auditor, reviewing their 
performance and advising the Board on 
their appointment and remuneration;
• reviewing the internal audit programme 
and ensuring the internal audit function 
is adequately resourced;
• ensuring appropriate safeguards are in 
place for individuals to raise issues with 
the Board where a breach of conduct 
or compliance, including any ﬁnancial 
reporting irregularity, is suspected; and
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls to guard 
against and detect fraud, review 
any instance of fraud or suspected 
fraud and to consider the Company’s 
response to any such occurrence.
Membership
The Audit Committee members are all 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee is 
Paula Bell and the other members of the 
Audit Committee are Mike Parker, Kjersti 
Wiklund and Nathalie Rachou. There were 
no changes in membership during 
the period.
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
ensures that at least one member of the 
Audit Committee has recent and relevant 
ﬁnancial experience. Paula Bell, the Chair 
of the Committee, is the Chief Financial 
Officer for Spirent Communications 
plc. With Mike Parker being the Senior 
Independent Director of publicly quoted 
company PV Crystalox Plc and a past 
Non-Executive Director of SNC-Lavalin 
Inc, a publicly quoted Canadian company, 
Nathalie Rachou being a Non-Executive 
Director of Société Générale, where she 
serves on its Audit Committee, and Kjersti 
Wiklund, a non-executive director of 
Spectris plc and who was until recently 
Director, Group Technology Operations 
at Vodafone, the Board is satisﬁed 
that the Audit Committee as a whole 
has a balance of skills with sufficient 
ﬁnancial, international and commercial 
experience to enable it to carry out its 
duties. Further details about the Audit 
Committee members can be found on 
page 41.
Meetings
The Audit Committee met on ﬁve 
scheduled occasions during the year. 
Details of attendance at these meetings 
can be found on page 53. The Chairman 
of the Board, the Chief Executive, the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk 
and Governance Officer and the external 
auditor are given notice of all meetings 
and may be invited to attend and speak 
at any meeting. The external auditor 
has the opportunity to meet with the 
Audit Committee without any Executive 
Directors present whenever necessary 
and the Audit Committee ensures that 
this happens at least once a year in order 
to discuss any issues or concerns from 
either party. Additionally, the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee has regular contact 
with the external audit partner outside 
of Committee meetings. During the year, 
the Audit Committee held two meetings 
with Deloitte without management being 
present, in order to receive feedback from 
them on matters such as the quality of 
interaction with management. 
KPMG, which provides global internal audit 
services under the direction of the Chief 
Risk and Governance Officer, attended 
three Audit Committee meetings during 
the year. The Chief Risk and Governance 
Officer briefed the Audit Committee three 
times on key internal audit matters and 
ﬁndings of internal audit investigations and 
had the opportunity at each meeting to 
meet with the Audit Committee without 
any Executive Directors present and he 
met or had phone calls separately with 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
periodically throughout the year.
The Audit Committee has authority to 
seek any information it requires from 
any officer or employee of the Company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings. 
It believes that it has received sufficient, 
reliable and timely information from 
management to enable it to fulﬁl its 
responsibilities during the year. The Audit 
Committee can take such independent 
professional advice, at the expense of the 
Company, as it considers necessary. 
54 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Report of the Audit Committee continued The primary areas of judgement and 
estimation uncertainty considered by 
the Committee in relation to the 2017 
Accounts, and how these were 
addressed, were:
Revenue recognition in the period under 
review and the impact of new accounting 
standards going forward
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with 
customers will be adopted from 1 January 
2018. The new standard leads to changes 
in the timing of both revenue recognition 
and associated costs for some of our 
businesses. IFRS 15 requires businesses 
to identify performance obligations 
made in contracts and allocate revenue 
to those promises. Revenue can only 
be recognised once the performance 
obligation is fulﬁlled, or if the business 
has an enforceable right to payment 
for work performed to date. We have 
considered the impact both for this 
year’s report and accounts and for 2018. 
Further information can be found at 
Note 2 on page 116.
Tax provisioning
Provisioning for potential current 
tax liabilities require judgement. 
The Committee addresses these 
issues through a range of reports from 
the taxation department and senior 
management and a process of challenging 
the appropriateness of management’s 
views including the degree to which 
these are supported by professional 
advice from external legal and other 
advisory ﬁrms. In 2017 an amount of 
£29.9m (2016: £33.9m) was recognised in 
relation to potential current tax liabilities. 
The recognition of these liabilities, and 
any movement in the current year, is 
discussed in detail and challenged with 
both the taxation department and senior 
management. In the current year, the 
Committee also considered the balance 
sheet classiﬁcation of these liabilities.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset, 
and the movement in the current year, 
has also been discussed and veriﬁed 
with both the taxation department and 
senior management. 
• continuing to challenge and develop 
the scope of the Group’s internal audit 
programme to match the evolving 
growth of the business in terms of 
regional expansion into new territories 
and as the organisation structure adapts 
and changes, including approving the 
internal audit plan for 2018;
• reviewing the Group’s Code of Conduct 
and arrangements for whistleblowing, 
implementing refreshed ethics training 
and relaunching the ethics hotline;
• reviewing and discussing with the 
external auditor the scope of the audit 
to ensure it appropriately responds 
to risk;
• discussing the longer-term viability 
statement and the related assessment 
work to enable the Board to make such 
a statement; and
• further considering the enhancement 
of the internal control environment, 
in particular with respect to IT controls, 
following recommendations from the 
external auditor.
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee 
in relation to ﬁnancial reporting is 
to review the half-year and annual 
ﬁnancial statements. The review is 
carried out with both management and 
the external auditor, and focus areas 
include evaluating:
• whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts represents a fair, balanced 
and understandable view of information 
for shareholders;
• whether material areas of signiﬁcant 
judgement and estimation uncertainty 
have been given due consideration by 
management and reviewed with the 
external auditor;
• the quality and acceptability of 
accounting policies and practices;
• the clarity of disclosures and 
compliance with ﬁnancial reporting 
standards and relevant ﬁnancial and 
governance reporting requirements; 
and
• any correspondence from regulators 
in relation to ﬁnancial reporting.
Main activities during the year
The Committee’s principal activities during 
the year included:
• monitoring the ﬁnancial reporting 
process and reviewing the interim 
and annual ﬁnancial statements with 
particular reference to accounting 
policies, principal risks and uncertainties 
together with signiﬁcant estimates and 
ﬁnancial reporting judgements and the 
disclosures made therein;
• reviewing the effectiveness of 
the internal audit function which 
included the appointment of a new 
KPMG partner with expertise in risk 
management and governance advisory 
and reviewing the execution of the 
internal audit plan during the year;
• receiving and discussing (in the absence 
of management where appropriate) 
reports from the external auditor in 
respect of their review of the interim 
results and the annual audit including 
the audit plan for the year;
• conducting a detailed review of the 
impact of new accounting standard 
Revenue from contracts with customers 
IFRS 15, further details of which are set 
out below;
• receiving and reviewing reports from 
the Chief Risk and Governance Officer 
on internal ﬁnancial controls twice 
each year;
• in accordance with the Code, advising 
the Board at its request on whether 
the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy;
• continuing to monitor and review the 
effectiveness of the shared services 
model to ensure that high levels of 
assurance are being maintained, 
with the Committee overseeing the 
assurance process to target priorities 
in a new control model for the shared 
services environment;
55 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information After taking into account the above 
factors, the Committee concluded that 
the external auditor was effective and 
continues to be effective.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee recommends 
for Board approval a policy for non-
audit services to be performed by the 
auditor. This policy prohibits the use 
of the external audit ﬁrm for certain 
speciﬁed matters and the hiring of its 
former employees, without prior approval 
from the Audit Committee Chairman. 
The auditor will not be engaged to 
provide internal audit services, systems 
implementations or valuations as such 
services would be deemed to conﬂict 
with their independence.
There are sound commercial and practical 
reasons, including conﬁdentiality, for using 
the auditor to provide certain non-audit 
services. During the year, Laird used the 
services of Deloitte to prepare working 
capital documents, a ﬁnancial controls 
report and comfort letters in support of 
the March 2017 Rights Issue. A breakdown 
of auditor’s remuneration, including non-
audit fees, are provided in note 6 to the 
Accounts. The Committee reviews and 
agrees any non-audit services provided 
in the year and Deloitte conﬁrm to the 
Committee its continuing independence 
and compliance with our policy on 
auditor independence.
Effectiveness
The Audit Committee continually 
considers and reviews the effectiveness 
of the external audit. As part of the 
planning process the Committee 
considers factors that could affect the 
audit quality based on past experience 
and anticipated changes to the business 
and business environment. The auditor is 
asked to explain the risks to audit quality 
that they have identiﬁed and how they 
intend to address those risks in their 
audit strategy and plan. The Committee 
probes and challenges the auditor’s 
plans and regularly reviews progress 
against the audit plan. On an annual basis 
the Audit Committee formally reviews 
the effectiveness of the external audit, 
reporting its ﬁndings to the Board as 
part of its recommendation on auditor 
appointment or re-appointment. 
This process is supported by the 
completion of questionnaires by the 
Committee and the wider ﬁnancial 
management team, which include 
consideration of the audit partner, the 
approach, communication and reporting. 
The results of the questionnaires 
are reported to and discussed by 
the Committee. 
The Audit Committee noted that the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Review team selected to review 
the audit of Laird PLC’s 2016 ﬁnancial 
statements as part of their 2017 annual 
inspection of audit ﬁrms. The focus 
of the review and their reporting is on 
identifying areas where improvements 
are required. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee received a full copy of the 
ﬁndings of the Audit Quality Review 
team and has discussed these with 
Deloitte. Some matters were identiﬁed 
as requiring improvement and we have 
agreed an action plan with Deloitte to 
ensure the matters identiﬁed by the Audit 
Quality Review have been addressed in 
the audit of the Company’s 31 December 
2017 ﬁnancial statements. The Audit 
Committee is also satisﬁed that there is 
nothing within the report which might 
have a bearing on the audit appointment.
Carrying value of assets 
The assessment of the carrying value 
of assets, in particular goodwill and 
capitalised development costs, are an 
important focus for the Committee due 
to the signiﬁcant amounts recorded on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 
the judgements involved in assessing 
goodwill for impairment. The Committee 
addresses these issues by focusing on, 
monitoring regularly and constructively 
challenging the reasonableness of 
the assumptions used in impairment 
calculations by management; challenging 
the appropriateness of judgements and 
forecast used including discount rates, 
growth rates, decision on cash generating 
units and the methodology applied. 
Similar review went into assessing the 
capitalisation of development costs and in 
ensuring the process was in line with the 
accounting policy and standards. 
External auditor
Appointment and independence 
Following a competitive audit tender 
process carried out in 2015, it was 
recommended that Deloitte should be 
appointed as auditors in place of Ernst 
& Young LLP, subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM in April 2016. 
The appropriate resolution was passed 
by shareholders at the AGM and Deloitte 
duly appointed. By undertaking the 
audit tender, the Company has complied 
with current legislation in respect of the 
mandatory use of competitive tendering 
and Audit Committee responsibilities. 
Anna Marks is the current Group Audit 
Partner and is in the second year of 
her tenure.
Deloitte’s independence was considered 
as part of the audit tender process and 
again during the course of the year under 
review. A description of the Board’s policy 
on the use of the external auditor for non-
audit services, and of non-audit services 
provided by Deloitte’s is set out below.

Governance
Report of the Audit Committee continued Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s 
procedure for handling allegations from 
whistleblowers as set out in the Group’s 
Global Code of Conduct (which is 
available on the Company’s website) and 
any whistleblowing events are brought to 
its attention. Following the 2017 annual 
policy and process review, the Audit 
Committee agreed that the policy works 
well and no changes were recommended.
A whistleblowing service, which offers 
a relevant language service in all 
countries in which Laird operates, is 
made available to all employees through 
an independent telephone and internet 
provider. Employees have the right to 
remain anonymous. A monthly report on 
any calls is sent to senior management 
and to the Audit Committee at each 
Audit Committee meeting. During 2017, 
in conjunction with refreshed Code of 
Conduct training, the Ethics Hotline was 
relaunched as part of a new campaign 
which included regionally/culturally-
tailored awareness messages and the 
promotion of a new reporting channel. 
Investigation of all whistleblower 
communications is overseen by the 
Chief Risk and Governance Officer 
with ﬁndings reported to the Board. 
 
The Corporate Governance Statement 
is set out on pages 44 to 57.

Internal audit
The Audit Committee oversees the 
internal audit function. KPMG act as the 
internal auditor services provider for the 
Group under the direction of the Chief 
Risk and Governance Officer. The Audit 
Committee considers the scope of internal 
control audits each year which are set out 
in the internal audit plan and reviews the 
internal audit process for identifying and 
managing ﬁnancial and other risks and 
the ﬁndings of those audits. In 2017, the 
Internal Audit function reviews included IT 
general controls, inventory management 
at larger sites and work on the internal 
controls at a number of ﬁnancial 
shared service centres. For 2018, the 
internal audit plan was approved by the 
Committee in October 2017 and it includes 
among other matters reviews of certain 
core ﬁnancial processes, further work on 
inventory management at larger sites, 
procurement and a review of processes, 
procedures and controls within the 
treasury function, deferred from 2017.
Internal ﬁnancial control
As noted above, the Audit Committee 
reviews the Group and Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements. It also has 
responsibility for reviewing the process 
for identifying and managing ﬁnancial 
risk, for reviewing the internal ﬁnancial 
controls and considering the scope and 
planning of internal and external audits. 
It reviews reports on internal ﬁnancial 
control including reports by the Chief Risk 
and Governance Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer and the results from 
internal ﬁnancial audits. As part of its 
audit, the external auditor, to the extent it 
considers necessary to support its audit 
opinion, reviews and tests the systems of 
internal control and the data contained in 
the accounts, including an independent 
and objective review of the approach 
of management to the reporting of the 
operating results and ﬁnancial condition.
57 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Dear Fellow Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for 2017, which has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee 
(‘the Committee’) on behalf 
of the Board. 
Context to the Committee’s decisions
Following the disappointing performance 
in 2016, the Group’s focus was to bring a 
strong proﬁt uplift alongside establishing 
a business model which could deliver 
long-term, sustainable revenue and 
earnings growth.
I am pleased to report that this strategy 
delivered a much-improved performance, 
with encouraging progress across all 
three divisions.
2017 saw a signiﬁcantly improved 
performance for Laird, with a 31.7% 
increase in underlying proﬁt before tax to 
£67.3m and a 5.7% increase in underlying 
basic earnings per share. I am pleased 
that this year we have been able to pay 
bonuses under our Annual Performance 
Incentive Scheme. This was strongly linked 
to Laird achieving a stretching underlying 
Proﬁt Before Tax target and the Executive 
Directors meeting key strategic goals. 
Further details of how each of the 
Executive Directors performed against 
their strategic goals for 2017, and of their 
strategic goals for the coming year, can 
be found later in this report. Given the 
length of service of each of the Executive 
Directors, no long-term incentives were 
due to vest to them in 2017. 
Remuneration Policy and 
Reward Philosophy
Our current Remuneration Policy has 
received continued support since its 
approval in 2015, with the Annual Report 
on Remuneration receiving a vote in 
favour of 99% in each of the last two 
years. During 2017 we undertook a 
review of the Remuneration Policy for the 
executive directors in preparation for our 
2018 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), 
when the existing policy reaches its third 
anniversary and requires resubmission to 
shareholders. The principal objective of 
the review was to ensure the remuneration 
framework remained ﬁt for purpose and 
aligned with Laird’s strategy. 
We have also taken the opportunity 
to review the Remuneration Policy for 
share and cash-based incentive awards 
for the Executive Committee and other 
members of senior management, with 
a view to establishing a policy that both 
promotes high performance in support 
of the Company’s long-term objectives 
and is aligned as closely as possible 
with the Remuneration Policy for share 
and cash-based incentive awards of the 
Executive Directors. 
Our overall reward philosophy within 
Laird is to operate market competitive 
compensation packages targeted at the 
mid-market in our respective territories.
Remuneration arrangements should 
be aligned with strategy of accelerated 
growth and the creation of long-term 
shareholder value. The Policy should 
ensure there is a clear link between 
reward and sustained performance and 
provide an appropriate balance between 
ﬁxed and variable performance related 
components, with a signiﬁcant element 
of long-term variable pay given the long-
term nature of our business. 
In conjunction with our advisors, the 
Committee considered different reward 
philosophies and believes that the 
current policy remains ﬁt for purpose and 
that it will continue to complement the 
Group’s strategy in the near to medium 
term. For these reasons, we are not 
proposing any signiﬁcant changes to the 
Remuneration Policy other than minor 
drafting amendments, with the proposed 
revisions aimed primarily at improving 
the robustness of the policy framework 
and incorporating new standards of 
best corporate governance practice. 
A summary of the Remuneration Structure 
and key changes proposed is set out on 
page 60. The Remuneration Policy is set 
out on pages 64 to 74. 
The Committee sought the views and 
comments of our top 20 shareholders 
in respect of the proposed new 
Remuneration Policy, details of which 
were shared with the whole Board before 
ﬁnalisation and recommendation of 
the Policy by the Board for approval by 
shareholders. The Committee was pleased 
that major shareholders were supportive 
of the proposed Policy. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM this 
policy may operate for up to three years.

Governance
Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Mike Parker, CBE
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee As described on page 74, under the 
proposed new Policy the Committee 
retains discretion over a number of 
areas relating to the operation and 
administration of the incentive plans, 
including whether to pro-rate bonuses 
and awards to time and treatment on 
cessation of employment on change of 
control. In light of the recommended 
acquisition of Laird the Committee will 
give consideration to the treatment 
of outstanding bonuses and awards 
for Executive Directors prior to the 
transaction completing.
2017 remuneration decisions
Key decisions made by the Committee 
during, and for, the ﬁnancial year include: 
• Reviewing the Remuneration Policy, 
considering whether it remains 
appropriate and fair and recommending 
an updated policy to the Board.
• Determining whether it is appropriate 
to recommend base salary increases for 
the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chairman, Non-Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive 
Committee, concluding that, in light 
of the poor performance of the Group 
in 2016 and its continuing recovery, 
it was not appropriate to increase 
base salary, except in one case, where 
there had been a promotion on the 
Executive Committee.
• Consideration of performance 
conditions for incentive awards for 
the wider leadership team (other 
than Executive Directors), with the 
Committee approving amendments to 
further strengthen outcomes linked with 
shareholder returns.
• Approving the remuneration packages 
offered to the new Chief Human 
Resources Officer and the new Chief 
Technology Officer.
• Setting 2017 LTIP award levels for 
Executive Directors, reducing for the 
year the maximum potential for the 
Chief Executive from 200% of base 
salary to 160% for that year.
• Approving a new Remuneration 
Policy for share and cash based 
incentive awards for the Executive 
Committee and other members of 
senior management with a view to 
establishing a policy that both promotes 
high performance in support of the 
Company’s long-term objectives and 
is aligned as closely as possible with 
the Remuneration Policy for share and 
cash based incentive awards of the 
Executive Directors.
• Terminating ‘MyShare’, an umbrella 
share purchase plan for all employees 
operated internationally under the 
Laird PLC 2015 Share Incentive 
Plan, after a review by management 
concluded that it was failing in its 
objective to efficiently incentivise 
employees due to its low take up 
and that the administrative costs of 
maintaining the scheme outweighed 
the beneﬁts. 
Gender pay 
The UK Government has introduced new 
legislation requiring certain companies 
to report later this year on their gender 
pay gap. As a global organisation 
employing around 10,000 employees we 
are committed to diversity and equality, 
including, in particular, gender equality. 
As Laird entities in the UK have less 
than 250 employees we do not have a 
reporting obligation, however we take 
the issue seriously and will publish a 
detailed statement later this year.
Shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM
The Annual Report on Remuneration 
together with this letter is subject to 
an advisory shareholder vote while the 
proposed new Remuneration Policy is 
subject to a binding shareholder vote. 
These will be put to shareholders at the 
2018 AGM. The sections of this report 
that have been subject to audit are 
labelled accordingly. 
Details of voting at last year’s AGM were 
that 99.75% of the votes cast supported 
the resolution to approve the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. This followed 
the previous year’s AGM, where 99.83% 
of the votes cast supported the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. Further details 
are set out on page 88 of this report and 
I would like to thank shareholders for 
their strong support.
We remain committed to hearing, 
and taking an active interest in your 
views as shareholders. If you would like 
to discuss any further aspect of our 
remuneration strategy, I would welcome 
your views. I can be contacted at 
m.parker@laird-plc.com.

provided to ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting and retaining 
personnel in order to deliver the Group strategy.
• Beneﬁts may include: car and fuel allowance, life insurance, personal accident 
insurance, disability and health insurance, income protection, travel insurance 
and from time to time beneﬁts such as relocation expenses.

Annual 
Performance 
Incentive  
Scheme
• Annual Performance Incentive Scheme awards are granted annually following 
the signing of the Report and Accounts, usually in March.
• The performance period is one ﬁnancial year with payout determined by the 
Committee following the year end, based on achievement against a range of 
ﬁnancial and non- ﬁnancial targets including having regard to environmental, 
health and safety issues.
• Maximum opportunity: 150% of salary. Threshold performance: 20% of maximum. 
• 2/3rds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the further 1/3rd deferred 
into shares subject to a three year vesting period. There are no further performance 
targets on the deferred amount. Malus and clawback arrangements are in place.
• Bonus awards will only be paid if the Committee is satisﬁed that the Group’s 
overall ﬁnancial performance has been sufficient to justify their payment.
None.
Long-term

• The maximum pension contribution allowance for existing Executive Directors 
is 25% of salary.
• When recruiting or promoting new Executive Directors the Committee will aim 
at aligning the pension contribution allowance to be provided with the level of 
employee pension contribution. If the circumstances require an alternative approach 
to be used, this will be fully explained in the relevant Annual Report.
None.
Shareholding  
policy
• The Committee has adopted formal shareholding requirements that will encourage 
the Executive Directors to build up over a ﬁve year period and then subsequently 
hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. The following sets

It is critical that pay for the Executive Directors reﬂects the return delivered to shareholders. The pay of our Executive Directors is 
aligned with shareholder interests in a number of ways. The bonus is linked to PBT and strategic measures. The Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) is delivered in shares and is linked to TSR and EPS performance over three years. The LTIP is also subject to a two-year 
holding period to align participants with continued share price performance. Executive Directors are required to build a personal 
shareholding over time with a guideline of 200% of salary.
As a result of the above, the pay and personal wealth of the Company’s Executive Directors is impacted by changes in share price 
as illustrated in the table below:
Shares owned

Note:
1. Decrease in value primarily reﬂects the movement in the share price assuming that Directors were interested in the same number of shares at the start 
and end of period. 
Executive incentives and link to KPIs
In line with the remuneration principles, the incentive arrangements are designed to support a number of the Company’s KPIs.

Annual Performance Incentive Scheme
2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Operation of the Policy in 2017
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme bonus awards for 2017 reﬂect the achievement of stretching Proﬁt Before Tax targets and 
strategic goals. The Committee determined that a bonus payment equal to 90.6% of salary for Tony Quinlan (60.4% of 150% of salary 
maximum) and 84.6% of salary for Kevin Dangerﬁeld (60.3% of 140% of salary maximum) should be awarded following assessment of 
the 2017 corporate scorecard and taking into account Laird’s ﬁnancial performance and also individual performance. Further details 
of individual performance can be found on pages 79 and 80. No awards were due to vest for Executive Directors in 2017 in respect of 
the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
63 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information The Policy Report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy 2018
The Policy in place at the date of this report (the ‘2015 Policy’) took binding effect from the date of its approval by shareholders at the 
AGM on 8 May 2015.
The Policy set out below (the ‘2018 Policy’) is the policy that is proposed to apply from the 2018 AGM, subject to shareholder 
approval being obtained at the AGM. The differences between the 2015 Policy and the 2018 Policy are summarised in the section 
headed ‘Summary of remuneration structure and key changes’ on page 60.
The Policy part will be displayed on the Company’s website, in the Corporate Governance part of Investor Relations section, 
immediately after the 2018 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) has agreed the Policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman. The Board has agreed the Policy on the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors. 
Following approval at the AGM, remuneration payments and payments for loss of office to Directors can only be made if they are 
consistent with this Policy or otherwise approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders. Previous share awards granted and 
commitments made under the old remuneration policy will be honoured.
Executive director remuneration policy
Future Policy Table
The table below sets out the key elements of the Policy for Executive Directors:
Base salary
Objective and link to strategy
Core element of remuneration, set at a level which is sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate 
calibre and experience, to achieve the Company’s business strategy.
Operation
An Executive Director’s basic salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually or when there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• general salary rises to employees;
• remuneration practices within the group;
• any change in scope, role and responsibilities;
• the general performance of the group;
• the experience of the relevant director;
• the economic environment; and
• when the Committee determines a benchmarking exercise is appropriate – salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in 
the comparator groups used for remuneration benchmarking.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level 
until they become established in their role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for 
employees until the target positioning is achieved.
Typically, the base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start of the policy period and who remain in the same role throughout 
the policy period will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other 
employees in the Group. The exceptions to this rule may be where:
• an individual is below market level and a decision is taken to increase base pay to reﬂect proven competence in role; or
• there is a material increase in scope or responsibility to the Executive Director’s role.
Maximum opportunity
The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a similar size to Laird and validated 
against other companies in the industry, so that they are competitive against the market.
The Committee intends to review the comparators periodically and may add or remove companies from the group as it considers 
appropriate. Any changes to the comparator groups will be set out in the section headed Implementation of Remuneration Policy, 
in the following ﬁnancial year.
In general salary rises to the Executive Directors will be limited to the same average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other 
employees of the Group. 
Performance measures and assessment

Governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued Other beneﬁts
Objective and link to strategy
Provides a market competitive package.
Operation
Beneﬁts may include:
• car and fuel or car allowance;
• life, personal accident, disability and health insurance, income protection;
• travel and Directors’ & Officers’ insurance; and
• other beneﬁts as provided from time to time, for example where a director relocates.
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable ﬂexibility in the beneﬁts provided to ensure it is able to support the 
objective of attracting and retaining personnel in order to deliver the Group strategy. Additional beneﬁts may therefore be offered 
such as relocation allowances on recruitment. 
Maximum opportunity
The maximum will depend on the cost of providing the relevant beneﬁts. The Company has monitoring practices in place to ensure 
spend on beneﬁts is efficient.
Performance measures and assessment
Not applicable.
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme
Objective and link to strategy
Incentivises the achievement of a range of performance targets that are key to the success of the Company and provides long-term 
alignment with shareholders through the use of deferral in shares.
Operation
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme awards are granted annually following the signing of the Report and Accounts, usually in 
March. The performance period is one ﬁnancial year with payout determined by the Committee following the year end, based on 
achievement against a range of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial targets including having regard to environmental, health and safety issues.
2/3rds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the further 1/3rd deferred into shares subject to a three year vesting period. 
There are no further performance targets on the deferred amount. Malus and clawback arrangements are in place as set out on 
page 68. These are compliant with the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code and in line with best practice in this area.
Bonus awards will only be paid if the Committee is satisﬁed that the Group’s overall ﬁnancial performance has been sufficient to 
justify their payment.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum: 150% of salary. Threshold performance: 20% of maximum.
Participants may be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents on the deferred shares representing the dividends paid during 
the deferral period.
Performance measures and assessment
Performance targets will be set by the Committee annually based on a range of ﬁnancial and strategic measures, including but not 
limited to: 
• underlying proﬁt before tax including interest; and
• the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable strategic, operational 
and corporate objectives for the Company.
The speciﬁc measures, targets and weightings may vary from year to year in order to align with the Company’s strategy over each 
year. However, at least 50% of the awards will be linked to ﬁnancial measures. The measures will be dependent on the Company’s 
goals over the year under review and directly link to the key measurable strategic milestones to incentivise executives to focus on the 
execution of the strategy. The performance targets are calibrated each year to align with the announced strategic plan.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed ﬁnancial targets used for 
the bonus, disclosing precise targets for the Plan in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Except in circumstances where 
elements remain commercially sensitive, targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the 
performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the Plan (in addition where elements are 
considered commercially sensitive they will be disclosed within 12 months of the end of the relevant performance period).
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to:
• change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance measures and targets part-
way through a performance year if there is a signiﬁcant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original 
measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate;
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of bonus earned resulting from the application of the performance 
measures, if the Committee believes that the bonus outcomes are not a fair and accurate reﬂection of business performance.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following year’s Remuneration Report.
Details on the measures for 2018 are set out on pages 86 and 87.
65 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Long-term incentives
Objective and link to strategy
Incentivises the achievement of long-term ﬁnancial performance and sustainable returns to shareholders in a way that aligns the 
interests of executives and shareholders.
Operation
Under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP) the Committee may award annual grants of performance share awards in the 
form of conditional awards or nil-cost options (LTIP Awards) on an annual basis. LTIP Awards under the 2015 LTIP will vest three years 
from the date of grant subject to the achievement of the performance measures. A two year holding period will apply following the 
three-year vesting period for LTIP Awards granted to the executive directors.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place as set out on page 68. These are compliant with the FRC UK Corporate Governance 
Code and in line with best practice in this area.
Cessation of employment and change of control provisions apply as set out on page 74.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum LTIP Awards are 200% of base salary. Vesting is dependent on service and performance measures.
Participants may be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents representing the dividends paid during the performance period on 
vested LTIP Awards.
Performance measures and assessment
The performance measures for LTIP Awards granted in Financial Year ending 31 December 2018 will be equally weighted between 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Earnings Per Share (EPS).
TSR will be measured against companies in the FTSE 250 (excluding Financial Services companies and Investment Trusts).
15% vesting for median performance and 100% vesting for upper quintile performance. Average Annual Growth in Continuing EPS – 
15% vesting for threshold performance and 100% vesting for maximum performance.
The performance measures have been chosen to balance growth and returns and ensure sustainable delivery of performance.
The Committee will review and set weightings and targets before each grant to ensure they remain appropriate. The Committee may 
change the balance of the measures, or use different measures for subsequent awards, as appropriate.
No material change will be made to the type of performance conditions without prior shareholder consultation.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to: 
• change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance measures and targets part-way 
through a performance period if there is a signiﬁcant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original 
measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate; and 
• make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of LTIP Award vesting resulting from the application of the performance 
measures, if the Committee believes that the vesting outcomes are not a fair and accurate reﬂection of business performance. 
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following year’s Remuneration Report.
66 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued Pension
Objective and link to strategy
To aid retention and to provide competitive levels of retirement beneﬁt.
Operation
The Company provides a pension contribution allowance in line with practice relative to its comparators to enable the Company to 
recruit and retain Executive Directors with the experience and expertise to deliver the Group’s strategy.
This allowance will be a non-consolidated allowance and will not impact any incentive calculations.
Maximum opportunity
The maximum pension contribution allowance for existing Executive Directors is 25% of salary. 
When recruiting or promoting new Executive Directors the Committee will aim at aligning the pension contribution allowance to be 
provided with the level of employee pension contribution. If the circumstances require an alternative approach to be used, this will be 
fully explained in the relevant Annual Report.
The Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of Remuneration Policy, in the following ﬁnancial year the pension 
contributions for that year for each of the Executive Directors.
Performance measures and assessment
Not applicable.
Shareholding policy
Objective and link to strategy
To ensure that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon.
Operation
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding requirements that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up over a ﬁve 
year period and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. Adherence to these guidelines is a 
condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements. This policy ensures that the interests of Executive Directors 
and those of shareholders are closely aligned. In addition, Executive Directors will be required to retain 50% of the post-tax amount of 
vested shares from the Company incentive plans until the minimum shareholding requirement is met and maintained. 
Maximum opportunity
The following sets out the minimum shareholding requirements: 
• Chief Executive – 200% of salary;
• Other Directors – 200% of salary.
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
Performance measures and assessment
Not applicable.
67 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Malus and clawback
The following is the deﬁnition of malus and clawback which applies to both the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme (including any 
deferred shares) and the LTIP: 
• Malus is the adjustment of the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme payments or unvested LTIP awards because of the 
occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil. 
• Clawback is the recovery of payments made under the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme or vested LTIP awards as a result 
of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. 
Clawback may apply to all or part of a participant’s payment under the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme or vested LTIP award 
and may be effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses. 
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows: 
• discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group or any Group company; 
• the assessment of any performance condition or condition in respect of a payment under the Annual Performance Incentive 
Scheme or LTIP award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information; 
• the discovery that any information used to determine the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme payments or LTIP award was 
based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information; 
• action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud or gross misconduct; or 
• events or the behaviour of a participant have led to the censure of a Group company by a regulatory authority or have had a 
signiﬁcant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group company provided that the Board is satisﬁed that the relevant 
participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable 
to the participant.

The Committee is satisﬁed that it has the appropriate powers to enforce both malus and clawback if required. 
Performance measures and targets
The short and long-term incentives have a number of different ﬁnancial performance measures which the Committee believes 
provide a direct link to the Company’s performance. The Annual Performance Incentive Scheme contains speciﬁc strategic and 
operational objectives which provide a direct link to the Company’s strategy, whilst the long-term performance measures of TSR 
and EPS are considered to be appropriate measures for aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.

69 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Non-Executive Director remuneration policy 
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman whose 
remuneration is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board. No director participates in discussions relating to the 
setting of his or her remuneration. The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors:
Objective and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value
Fees
Core element of 
remuneration, set at a level 
sufficient to attract and retain 
individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience 
in organisations of broadly 
similar size and complexity.
The Board is responsible for setting the remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for setting the 
Chairman’s fees.
Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee 
and additional fees for chairmanship of committees 
and the role of Senior Independent Director. 
The Company retains the ﬂexibility to pay fees for the 
membership of committees.
In exceptional circumstances, fees may also be paid 
for additional time spent on the Company’s business 
outside of the normal duties.
Fees are reviewed annually with any changes 
generally effective from 1 July and are based on 
equivalent roles in the comparator group used to 
review salaries paid to the Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any 
variable remuneration or receive any other beneﬁts, 
other than being covered for disability beneﬁts 
under the Company’s insurance whilst travelling on 
Company business.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are 
positioned in line with companies of a 
similar size to Laird and validated against 
other companies in the industry, so that 
they are competitive against the market. 
The Committee intends to review the list 
of companies each year and may add or 
remove companies from the group as it 
considers appropriate. Any changes to 
the comparator groups will be disclosed 
in the part of the report setting out the 
operation of the policy for the future year.
In general the level of fee increase for 
the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman will be set taking account of any 
change in responsibility and the general 
rise in salaries across employees.
The Company will pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the Non-Executive 
Directors and may settle any tax incurred 
in relation to these.
70 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued Approach to recruitment and promotions 
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate 
calibre and experience needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the same 
principles as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and will 
have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made on 
recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
The Company’s detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new Directors is summarised in the table below: 
Remuneration element Recruitment policy 
Salary, Beneﬁts and Pension These will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors. When recruiting or 
promoting new Executive Directors the Committee will aim at aligning the pension contribution 
allowance to be provided with the level of employee pension contribution. If the circumstances 
require an alternative approach to be used, this will be fully explained in the relevant Annual Report.
Annual Scheme – 
Performance Incentive
Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 150% of salary. 
LTIP Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 200% of salary. 
Maximum Variable  
Remuneration
The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted is 350% of salary (excluding the value 
of any buyout awards). 
‘Buyout’ of incentive  
forfeited on cessation 
of employment
Where the Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment justiﬁes the 
provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of an 
Executive Director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following: 
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive Director’s 
cessation of employment; 
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of 
them being satisﬁed; and 
• any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (‘lapsed value’); 
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the 
Company’s incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout 
within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used. 
Relocation Policies In instances where the new Executive Director is required to relocate or spend signiﬁcant time 
away from their normal residence, the Company may provide one-off compensation to reﬂect the 
cost of relocation for the Executive Director. The level of the relocation package will be assessed 
on a case-by-case basis but will take into consideration any cost of living differences/housing 
allowance and schooling. 
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but 
there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. 
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the 
ongoing remuneration of the person concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the Remuneration Report for the 
relevant ﬁnancial year. 
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to 
current Non-Executive Directors.
71 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Service contracts and payment for loss of office 
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. Notice periods 
will not be greater than 12 months. The table below summarises the service contracts and letters of appointments for the Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for 
a review after an initial three-year term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
In line with best practice, all Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

Loss of Office Policy
When considering compensation for loss of office, the Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst 
applying the following philosophy: 
Element Treatment on cessation of employment
General The Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain 
liquidated damages clauses. If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation 
as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee 
a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no agreement between the 
Company and its Directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such 
payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach 
of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the 
termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment. 
Salary, Beneﬁts

Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy 
and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee commits 
to consulting with key shareholders prior to any signiﬁcant changes to its Remuneration Policy. The Committee is grateful that 
shareholders have been supportive of its Policy in the past.
During the year, the Committee conducted a review of its executive remuneration policy. The Chairman of the Committee consulted 
with the Company’s key shareholders, contacting the top 20 shareholders who together represented in excess of 70% of the issued 
share capital. Responses received were supportive. In consequence of that engagement, the Board clariﬁed its policy on pension 
contributions to Executive Directors. While maintaining the maximum pension contribution allowance for existing Directors at 25%, 
in line with our existing contractual obligations to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, when recruiting or promoting new 
Executive Directors the Committee will aim at aligning the pension allowance with the level of employee pensions elsewhere.
Elements of previous policy that continue to apply: 
The following subsisting arrangements will continue to operate on the terms and conditions set out in the relevant Rules:- 
• Unvested deferred share awards granted under the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme; and
• Unvested awards granted under the LTIP.

Pay principles 
and cascade 
of incentives
Executive Directors’ pay arrangements are aligned with all employee pay arrangements 
The Committee has information on pay arrangements throughout the Company and it makes decisions on the 
structure of executive pay in the context of the cascade of pay arrangements for all employees throughout Laird. 
Laird’s policy on pay for all employees is based on the following principles:
1.  Remuneration should be competitive with the market and facilitate retention of talent within sectors and 
geographies in which the Company operates and competes for talent.
2.  The Policy should ensure there is a clear link between reward and sustained performance.
3.  All employees should have the ability to share in the success of the Company, for example through a bonus 
or equity in the Company.
The cascade of remuneration arrangements across the Company and eligibility of different employee groups are 
set out in the table below. More details on share schemes can be found in note 29 to the Financial Statements on

Fairness 
in policy  
development
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company in developing policy
In setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird are taken into 
account, including any base salary increases awarded. The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration 
structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency 
of approach throughout the Company.
However, with 71 % of employees in Asia, 14 % of employees in North America and 15 % in Europe, only broad trends 
are considered. In 2017 salary increases for management level employees ranged from zero to 15.5 % depending on 
several factors, including the region where they work and individual performance. Although the Committee takes 
into account the pay and conditions of other employees, the Company does not consult with employees in respect 
of the Remuneration Policy for Directors. However, the Company does carry out engagement surveys which enables 
employees to shares their views with management.
The Company operates a long term incentive programme for the senior leaders (the ‘MTIP’). Awards under the MTIP 
are subject to the satisfaction of Group performance targets over three year periods.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REMUNERATION
Laird is a global company with approximately 65 UK employees and four of its most senior executives are not UK 
employees. Due to the multinational nature of the Company’s workforce and the fact that 71% of employees are 
based in Asia, the pay structure operated in respect of the vast majority of its employees is signiﬁcantly different 
from that applicable to the Chief Executive, who is UK-based. Therefore, the Committee’s view is that the most 
meaningful comparison of the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration is considered to be 
the 8 senior executives below Board level. As at 31 December 2017, three of these were based in the US, one in 
Hong Kong and four in the UK. The table below compares the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s pay 
(including salary and fees, taxable beneﬁts and annual bonus) with that of the chosen comparator group between 
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.

The performance targets set at the start of the period for the Directors in office at that time, actual performance achievement 
and resulting bonus payments are summarised below. 
Performance Measures and Targets Actual performance outcome
Performance Measure
Underlying proﬁt before tax (‘PBT’)
Weighting: 80% of maximum
Targets
Up to 80% of maximum bonus was based on achievement of budget for 
underlying PBT (adjusted for any acquisitions and disposals during the year) 
of £65.0m.
Threshold: At 100% of budget being £65.0m, 35% of maximum PBT 
element is payable.
Maximum: At 123% of budget being £80.0m, 100% of maximum PBT 
element is payable.
Underlying Proﬁt Before Tax of £67.3m was 
achieved, 87.8% of budget, leading to a payout of 
53% of the bonus attributable to PBT (i.e. 42.4% 
of Executive Directors potential total bonus). 
Performance Measure
Strategic, Corporate and Operational objectives 
Weighting: 20% of maximum
Targets
Six objectives were set for the Chief Executive for the year and six for the Chief 
Financial Officer. 
Up to 20% of maximum bonus was based on achievement of certain strategic, 
corporate and operational measures. If none of the performance metrics were 
achieved, 0% of this element would be paid. The Committee reviewed performance 
against objectives in the round at the end of the year when determining payments 
under this element of the bonus scorecard.
90% of Strategic, Corporate and Operational 
objectives were met. 
Further details of performance against individual 
goals are set below. One of Tony Quinlan’s 
performance measures remains commercially 
sensitive and will be reported next year.

Notes: 
In line with the Remuneration Policy, two thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the further third deferred into shares subject to a three-year 
vesting period. 
No discretion was exercised by the Committee when assessing the annual bonus outcomes.
4. Long-term incentives 
For the awards granted in 2012 and subsequently, the EPS performance measure is assessed based on year-end results. However, 
the TSR performance measure is assessed a number of months post the ﬁnancial year end and is subject to an underlying ﬁnancial 
performance condition until the date of vesting. Therefore, vesting is unknown at the year end. The Committee believes it would 
be inconsistent to split the performance conditions for these awards and therefore to show true comparability between annual 
grants the ﬁgures are shown for the awards which vest in the ﬁnancial year. This approach is consistent with the approach taken 
in prior years.
No Long-term incentives due to the Executive Directors were due to vest in 2017. As set out in the front part of the report a 2014 
LTIP award was granted to Jonathan Silver. The details of this award are covered under payments to past Directors on page 83. 
Tony Quinlan joined in 2015 and Kevin Dangerﬁeld joined in 2016 so they were not awarded an LTIP award in 2014.
5. Pension/cash in lieu of pension
The Company provides either a contribution to the Laird deﬁned contribution scheme or a cash allowance in lieu of pension beneﬁts. 
All Directors have elected to receive cash in lieu of pension beneﬁts. The following payments were made for 2017:

Buyout awards for Tony Quinlan
As previously disclosed in the 2015 and 2016 Annual Report, a buyout package for incentives foregone in respect of Tony Quinlan’s 
role at Drax Group plc was provided to facilitate his recruitment as Chief Financial Officer in July 2015. The Committee determined 
that Tony Quinlan would be granted nil-cost options over 147,804 Laird Shares as part of the buyout arrangements. The award was 
granted on 1 July 2015 and was made in six parts, as set out in the table below. The Committee determined the buyout share package 
on a fair value basis with new time vesting conditions (i.e. taking into account any performance measures and expected performance 
outcomes at the date of the buyout), or that buyout shares would be awarded with time-based vesting conditions where there were 
no performance conditions on the awards forfeited, or that buyout shares should be granted subject to new performance conditions.

Notes: 
1. At the time of recruitment the total value of buyout shares was limited to £525,000. This was converted into replacement share awards of 147,804 Laird PLC 
ordinary shares using a share price of 355.2p per share. The face value of the replacement shares was calculated using the closing mid-market share price 
of 372.2p per share on 1 July 2015, the date Tony Quinlan joined the Company and the date the awards were granted. 
2. The normal vesting date for the award is shown in the table above, provided that the Company is not in a prohibited share dealing period. The vesting of 
Parts 1 and 2 of the award were deferred to a date after 1 March 2016 as the original vesting dates were in a prohibited period. 
All six parts of the award are made subject to Tony Quinlan remaining in relevant employment on the vesting date and not being 
under a notice of cessation of relevant employment. Parts 5 and 6 of the award are also subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions as set out in the table below:

Non-Executive Directorships of companies outside the Group. The Board takes into account the likely time commitment for such 
appointments prior to approving them. During the year, the fees which the Executive Directors received, which they are entitled 
to retain, were as follows: 
Executive Director Company Fee (£’000)

The Policy and its implementation for the forthcoming ﬁnancial year is summarised below: 
Executive Directors
1. Salary

with the Policy and disclosed in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
2. Pension
For the year ending 31 December 2018, Tony Quinlan and Kevin Dangerﬁeld will both be entitled to receive a pension contribution

Governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued Financial performance measures
Financial performance measures are broken down into three areas: Underlying Proﬁt Before Tax; Gross Margin; and Operating 
Cash Flow. No bonuses under the APIS scheme are payable unless a minimum of £67m underlying Proﬁt Before Tax is achieved. 
The payout against underlying proﬁt before tax will be on a sliding scale for both the CEO and CFO with payout being calculated 
on a straight-line basis between each point.

The Committee considers disclosing precise targets of proﬁt and strategic objectives, which are commercially sensitive, for the 
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, performance achieved 
and awards made will be published at the end of the performance period where possible without compromising conﬁdential 
matters so that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Two-thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the further one-third deferred into shares subject to a further three-year 
vesting period to which malus and clawback apply. No further performance targets apply to the deferred shares. 
4. LTIP awards in 2018

See page 82 above for details of the vesting of Tony Quinlan’s buy-out awards. 
(c) Revision of share and option awards for the Rights Issue 
The number of shares forming an award or under an option, which are outstanding at the date of the Rights Issue, were reviewed and 
adjusted to take account of the effect of the Rights Issue. All participants have been put in the same position as they were before the 
Rights Issue. There were no adjustments made to any performance condition for any existing awards. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Board determines the fee levels for the Non-Executive Directors and the Committee determines the fee levels for the Chairman. 
The fee levels are reviewed annually and were last increased in July 2015. They were not increased in 2016 nor 2017. They will be 
reviewed in 2018 in line with the Policy and details disclosed in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Notes: 
1. Sir Christopher Hum retired as a Director on 28 April 2017.
2. Kjersti Wiklund was appointed to the Committee with effect from 13 December 2017.
The members of the Committee have no personal ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential 
conﬂicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the senior 
management and for setting the remuneration packages for each Executive Director. The Committee also has oversight of the 
remuneration policy and packages for other senior members of staff. The written Terms of Reference of the Committee are available 
on the Company’s website and from the Company on request.
The Committee’s activities during 2017 are set out on page 59. 
Advisers to the Committee
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) are independent advisers to the Committee. The advisers were selected through a competitive 
tender overseen by the Chairman of the Committee with input from the Chief Executive, Chairman of the Board and the Company 
Secretary. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. On this basis, the Committee is satisﬁed that the advice received is objective 
and independent.
PwC also provided the Company with other advisory services during the year. The Committee reviewed the nature of the services 
provided and was satisﬁed that no conﬂict of interest exists or existed in the provision of these services. 
The Committee also sought the views of the Chief Executive Tony Quinlan during the year. The Chief Executive is given notice of all 
meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends part of the meetings. The Chief Executive may request that 
he attends and speaks at Committee meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy 
matters and matters concerning the other Executive Director and employees. 
The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £71,420 (2016: £127,250). Fees were 
determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
Statement of voting 
The table below shows details of the binding vote approving the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the advisory vote on the 
Annual Report on Remuneration at the AGMs held on 8 May 2015 and 28 April 2017 respectively. The binding vote on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy is only put to shareholders every three years unless a change is being proposed to it.

The Committee believes that the overwhelming support of shareholders for both the Policy and its implementation in 2015 mean 
no changes are required to the Policy and its implementation. For this reason the proposed new 2018 Policy is in substance the same 
as the current Policy. The vote on the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration and new 2018 Remuneration Policy is due to take place 
at the AGM to be held on 27 April 2018. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Laird PLC.

required by law and regulation to include 
within the Annual Report. This section 
(together with the information from 
pages 1 to 88 and other information 
cross referenced by this section is 
incorporated herein by reference) 
constitutes the Directors’ Report for the 
purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
Certain statements are forward-looking 
and so involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to events, and 
depend upon circumstances that will 
occur in the future. Therefore results 
and developments can differ materially 
from those anticipated. The forward-
looking statements reﬂect knowledge 
and information available at the date of 
preparation of this Annual Report, and 
the Company undertakes no obligation to 
update these forward-looking statements. 
Nothing in this Annual Report should be 
construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Management report and 
future developments
This Directors’ Report together with 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39 
form the Management Report for the 
purposes of Rule 4.1.8R of the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules and the EU 
Non-Financial Reporting Directive. 
The Company has chosen, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 Section

(2016: £51.1m) and is analysed in note 
13 on page 126. Proﬁt for the year after

2017 in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2016. In light of the terms of

Directors’ report The Company has also indemniﬁed the 
Directors against liabilities they may 
incur in the execution of their duties 
as Directors of the Company and such 
indemniﬁcation was in place throughout 
the year.
Accountability and audit
Statements of the respective 
responsibilities of the Directors and 
auditor are set out on pages 93 to 101.
Signiﬁcant contracts and 
change of control
Laird has arrangements with a number of 
major customers and suppliers whereby 
regional or global terms of supply are 
agreed. However, these arrangements do 
not amount to contractual obligations to 
purchase and supply as these are covered 
by individual purchase orders. Some of 
the Group’s commercial arrangements 
including commercial agreements entered 
into in the ordinary course of business do 
include change of control provisions.
The Group’s bilateral revolving credit 
facilities, the Note Purchase Agreement 
entered into in 2014 in connection with 
the Group’s Private Placements of Notes 
and the Schuldschein loan agreements 
entered into in April 2016 each contain 
provisions under which, in the event of a 
change of control of the Company, the 
Company may be required to repay all 
outstanding amounts borrowed.
No Director or employee is contractually 
entitled to compensation for loss of office 
or employment as a result of change 
of control; however, provisions in the 
Company’s share plans may cause options 
or awards granted to employees to vest 
on a change of control.
Employment policy
Laird conducts business in multiple 
geographic locations and is committed 
to complying with the relevant 
legal requirements in each of those 
regions. Business unit management 
are responsible for implementing 
and communicating the Laird Equal 
Employment and Human Rights Policy 
Statements within their own business unit. 
Various methods are used throughout 
Laird as appropriate in each location for 
tracking morale, motivation, retention 
rates and training, which are reported 
regularly to local management teams. 
Election and re-election of Directors
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, Directors appointed during 
the year and one-third of the remainder 
must retire and stand for re-election 
each year at the AGM. However, all of the 
Directors of the Company will be retiring 
and offering themselves for re-election 
at the 2018 AGM in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016. 
The Board is satisﬁed, following the 
performance review, that each Director 
is qualiﬁed for re-election by virtue of 
their skills, experience and contribution 
to the Board.
None of the Non-Executive Directors 
offering themselves for re-election has 
a service contract with the Company or 
any of its subsidiaries. Biographical details 
and reasons for re-appointment for the 
Non-Executive Directors are given in 
the Notice of AGM.
Directors’ interests and share options 
and awards
In the year to 31 December 2017, no 
Director had a material interest in any 
third-party contract of signiﬁcance with 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Directors’ shareholdings and share options 
and awards at 31 December 2017 are 
shown within the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 86.
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors 
of public companies, subject to the 
provisions of the Company’s Articles of 
Association, to authorise conﬂicts and 
potential conﬂicts of interest, where 
appropriate. The authorisation is effective 
only if the matter is agreed to without the 
vote of the director who is subject to such 
conﬂict having been counted. The authority 
for Directors to act in situations of conﬂict 
and the rules governing their duties in such 
situations are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. Under the Articles 
of Association, a Director who is in any way 
interested in a contract must declare his 
interest. A register of conﬂicts or potential 
conﬂicts of interest is kept and it is available 
at every Board Meeting. The Board believes 
that the arrangements for reporting and 
dealing with conﬂicts operate effectively.
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
and indemnities
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
was purchased and maintained by the 
Company during the year to cover them 
against liabilities which may be incurred 
by them while acting as Directors 
and Officers.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of 
share and the rights attached to each 
share are identical. Details of the rights 
and obligations attaching to the shares 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association which are available on the 
Company’s website at www.laird-plc.com. 
The Company may refuse to register any 
transfer of any share which is not a fully 
paid share. 
At a general meeting of the Company, 
every member has one vote on a show 
of hands and on a poll one vote for 
each share held. Details of the voting 
procedure, including deadlines for 
exercising voting rights, are set out in 
the Notice of Meeting for the 2018 AGM. 
At 31 December 2017, the issued share 
capital of the Company was 488,913,007 
ordinary shares of 28.125p each. 
During the year, a total of 217,467,631 
shares were issued. 217,156,300 of these 
shares were issued in connection with the 
4 for 5 Rights Issue, undertaken in March 
2017 to reduce indebtedness, and 311,331 
in respect of allotments to participants 
in the Company’s US S423 All Employee 
Share Plan. Details of the share capital and 
awards outstanding as at 31 December 
2017 are shown in notes 28 and 29 on 
pages 146 to 150. No shares are held by 
the Company as treasury shares and 
1,215,318 are held by the Company’s 
Employee Beneﬁt Trust in connection 
with the Share plans operated by the 
Company. A dividend waiver is in place in 
respect of these shares. At the 2017 AGM, 
shareholders agreed to the renewal of the 
Directors’ power to allot shares, or grant 
rights for or to convert any security into 
shares, in the Company; the disapplication 
of pre-emption rights and authorised the 
Company to make purchases of up to 
10% of its ordinary shares representing 
48,860,167 shares on the London Stock 
Exchange. As at 28 February 2018, no 
shares have been purchased pursuant 
to this authority. Shareholders will be 
requested to renew these authorities at 
the 2018 AGM and full details are set out 
in the Notice of AGM.
Directors
The Directors of the Company as at 
the date of the approval of this Annual 
Report are shown on pages 40 and 41.

90 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Governance
Directors’ report continued Scenario 1 – Risk considered: Key 
Customer Dependency. Loss of a key 
customer part way through 2018 leading 
to materially lower group revenue and 
proﬁt over the forecast period;
Scenario 2 – Risk considered: 
Protectionism/Trade War. Political changes 
resulting in a trade war with additional 
tariffs for NAFTA and China/US trade;
Scenario 3 – Risk considered: IP Breach. 
Third party IP infringement resulting in 
an upfront claim for damages as well as 
continued licencing costs;
Scenario 4 – Risk considered: Site or 
service Business Continuity Incident. 
A major ﬁre at a key manufacturing 
facility in China resulting in total loss 
of site for a period of 18 months and a 
signiﬁcant proportion of customers lost;
Scenario 5 – Risk considered: Contract 
risk. Signiﬁcant supply chain issues 
causing an inability to service a major 
customer which results in material 
contractual penalties;
In addition to testing the principal risks, 
the Board then considered the impact 
of a combination of the risks to reach 
the reasonable worst case scenario. 
The combinations considered include 
the following:
Scenario 6 – All individual scenarios in 
combination; and
Scenario 7 – All individual scenarios in 
combination with an additional impact 
from a reduction in the USD:GBP FX rate 
to $1.15:£1.00. A lower USD:GBP rate has 
been chosen as this has an impact on our 
liquidity headroom.
On 1 March 2018 the Board announced 
that it had reached agreement on 
the terms of a recommended cash 
acquisition of the entire issued and 
to be issued ordinary share capital 
of Laird PLC at a price of 200p per 
share by a wholly-owned indirect 
subsidiary of funds managed by 
Advent International Corporation. 
The offer, which would be effected by 
means of a scheme of arrangement 
under Part 26 of the Companies Act, 
is subject to shareholder approval and 
standard conditions set out in the 2.7 
notice, including relevant clearances from 
competition and regulatory authorities in 
China, EU and US.
The preceding going concern and 
viability statements assume that, should 
the proposed offer proceed, the Group 
continues to operate in line with its 
current business plans.
Going concern
As set out in the Statement of Director’s 
Responsibilities on page 93, the Accounts 
have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. A statement on going concern 
relating to a business requires judgement 
at a point in time about future events 
which, by their nature, are inherently 
uncertain. The Directors have reviewed 
the Group’s performance for the year and 
the principal risks it faces, together with 
budget and cash ﬂow forecasts and have 
considered the ability of the Group to 
maintain committed ﬁnance, meet existing 
debt covenants and the impact of foreign 
currency exposures. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Accounts. 
Viability statement
The Board has assessed the prospects 
of the Company over a longer period 
than the 12 months required by the going 
concern requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. This longer-term 
assessment process supports the Board’s 
statements on both viability, as set out 
below, and going concern, as set out above. 
While the Board has no reason to believe 
the Group will not be viable over a longer 
period, it has assessed the Group’s 
viability over a three-year period to the 
year ending December 2020.
The three-year forecasting horizon has 
been selected because management 
and the Board believe there is sufficient, 
realistic visibility available to reassess the 
Group’s current and anticipated operating 
environment and market conditions over 
this period. The three-year period covers 
the lead times/operating cycles in some 
of our key markets and aligns with the 
Group’s strategic planning cycle. 
The Board has assessed the potential 
ﬁnancial and operational impacts, in severe 
but plausible scenarios, of the principal risks 
and uncertainties set out on pages 38 and 
39. Scenario testing has been undertaken 
to assess the resilience of the Group and its 
business model to the potential impact of 
individual key risk scenarios.
The scenario testing incorporates realistic 
assumptions based on our risk processes 
and experience of real incidents. 
We chose a number of scenarios which 
were assessed in isolation for their impact 
to viability, including the following:
Employee participation
The Board recognises that the success 
of the business relies on the skill and 
dedication of its workforce and therefore 
encourages two-way communication with 
its employees. Operating subsidiaries 
encourage consultation at local level and 
performance and development reviews 
reinforce the link between business goals, 
an employee’s contribution and his/
her remuneration. Laird communicates 
regularly with its employees, including 
through the provision of information on 
ﬁnancial performance (and ﬁnancial and 
economic factors affecting it), key events 
within Laird, charity and community 
involvement and employee achievements. 
In recognition that Laird’s business and 
its activities impact a wide community 
of stakeholders including investors, 
customers, employees, suppliers and 
local communities, the Board reviews 
the signiﬁcance of social, environmental 
and ethical matters which may affect 
Laird. Further details on all these matters 
are available in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 24 and 25.
Health and safety at work
Laird is committed to providing a safe 
working environment for its employees 
and continuous improvement is sought 
by the setting of objectives and 
targets based on relevant national and 
international health and safety standards 
and monitoring performance against 
these. In addition, Laird maintains a 
proactive communications strategy 
among all employees to promote and 
develop good health and safety practices. 
Further information is available in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report 
on pages 24 and 25.
Greenhouse gas emissions and 
gender diversity
Information on environmental matters and 
disclosures relating to diversity, gender 
and human rights are contained in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
on pages 24 and 25.
Research and development
Investing in research and development 
programmes delivers product innovation 
and manufacturing improvements 
within Laird. Expenditure in the year 
ended 31 December 2017 on research 
and development amounted to £90.9m 
(2016: £69.8m), of which £23.4m has been 
capitalised (2016: £19.9m). Laird continues 
to develop its technology capabilities, with 
research and development expenditure 
during the year running at 9.7% of 
sales (2016: 8.7%). This is in line with 
Laird’s strategic objective to increase 
R&D expenditure in the year and focus 
on innovation.
91 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information In performing the above analysis, the 
Board has made certain assumptions 
around the availability of future funding 
options, including the ability to raise 
further ﬁnance. No individual risk or 
combination of risks was found to have an 
impact on the viability of the Company. 
Our risk assessment further takes account 
of the availability and effectiveness of the 
mitigating actions that could realistically 
be taken to avoid or reduce the impact 
or occurrence of the underlying risks. 
In considering the likely effectiveness 
of such actions, the conclusions of the 
Board’s regular monitoring and review 
of risk management and internal control 
systems, as described on pages 53 to 57, 
is taken into account. 
On the basis of this robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
the Board’s review of the three-year 
operating forecasts to December 2020, 
the Group’s current ﬁnancial, operational 
and investment proﬁle, the Board 
conﬁrms that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue 
to operate and meet its liabilities, as they 
fall due, over the three-year period to 
December 2020.
Financial instruments
An analysis of debt is given in note 21 to 
the ﬁnancial statements. An analysis of 
ﬁnancial instruments at carrying value 
and fair value is given in note 27 to the 
ﬁnancial statements. Financial instruments 
and related disclosures together with a 
discussion of ﬁnancial risk management 
objectives and exposures to credit and 
liquidity risk are in accordance with IFRS 7.
It is the Company’s objective to manage 
its ﬁnancial risk so as to minimise the 
adverse ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnancial 
markets on the Group’s reported 
proﬁtability and cash ﬂows. The policies 
for managing each of the Group’s main 
ﬁnancial risk areas are referred to in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 
30 to 35. Additionally, the principal risks 
and uncertainties on pages 38 and 39 
deal with currency exposure risk and the 
mitigating activities adopted.
Post balance sheet events
On 1 March 2018 the Board announced 
that it had reached agreement on the 
terms of a recommended cash acquisition 
of the entire issued and to be issued 
ordinary share capital of Laird PLC at a 
price of 200p per share by a wholly-owned 
indirect subsidiary of funds managed by 
Advent International Corporation. 
The offer, which would be effected by 
means of a scheme of arrangement 
under Part 26 of the Companies Act, 
is subject to shareholder approval and 
standard conditions set out in the 2.7 
notice, including relevant clearances from 
competition and regulatory authorities 
in China, EU and US.
Political donations
The Group’s policy is to make no political 
donations and no political donations were 
made during the year (2016: NIL).
Auditor
Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’), the current 
auditors, have conﬁrmed that they 
are willing to continue in office, and 
resolutions proposing their reappointment 
and authorising the Audit Committee 
to agree their fees will be proposed at 
the AGM. Deloitte were ﬁrst appointed 
as the Company’s auditors at the 2016 
AGM following a tender process carried 
out in 2015. Further details are set out in 
the Report of the Audit Committee on 
page 56.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
As at the date of this report, as far 
as each Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each Director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
The Annual Report including the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39 was 
approved by the Board of Directors and 
authorised for issue on 1 March 2018.

Governance
Directors’ report continued The following statement, which should 
be read in conjunction with the Auditor’s 
statement of their responsibilities on 
pages 94 to 101, is made with a view 
to distinguishing for shareholders 
the respective responsibilities of the 
Directors and the Auditor in relation 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and 
regulations. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted by the European Union and 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The Directors are required to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial 
year which present a true and fair view 
of the ﬁnancial position of the Group and 
Company and the ﬁnancial performance 
and cash ﬂows of the Group for that 
period. In preparing those ﬁnancial 
statements on a going concern basis, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
• state that the Group has complied with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU and that 
the parent company has complied with 
UK accounting standards, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; 
and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time, 
the ﬁnancial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities. They are also responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We conﬁrm that, to the best of 
our knowledge:
(i)  the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁnancial position and result of the 
Group taken as a whole;
(ii)  the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and
(iii)  the Annual Report and ﬁnancial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities 2017 REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Laird plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the Group Income Statement;
• the Group and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income;
• the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
• the Group and Parent Company Statement of Financial Position;
• the Group cash ﬂow statement; 
• the related Group notes 1 to 35; and
• the related Parent Company notes 1 to 16.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
parent company ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We conﬁrm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
• Impairment of goodwill in CVS & WTS
• Valuation of transfer pricing provisions
• Valuation of US Deferred Tax Assets
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identiﬁed with  and any key audit matters which 
are the same as the prior year identiﬁed with .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group ﬁnancial statements was £2.7 million which was determined 
on the basis of adjusted proﬁt before tax.
Scoping The scoping of components was performed by the Head Office audit team, and we engaged 
component audit teams local to the group’s operations to perform the required audit work. 
Components subject to a full audit scope represented 81% of the group’s revenue, 91% of the group’s 
operating proﬁt before exceptional items, and 71% of total net assets.
Signiﬁcant changes 
in our approach
The valuation of US deferred tax assets is a new key audit matter for 2017, following the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act of 2017 enacted on 22 December 2017 in the United States.
We no longer consider acquisition accounting to be a key audit matter as there were no acquisitions 
in the period.
94 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Laird PLC Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in Note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the 
group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
ﬁnancial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required 
by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We conﬁrm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained 
in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 38 and 39 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ conﬁrmation on page 49 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on pages 91 and 92 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group required by Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We conﬁrm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the ﬁnancial 
statements of the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identiﬁed. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment of goodwill  in CVS and WTS 
Key audit matter 
description
Total goodwill at 31 December 2017 is £418.0 million (31 December 2016: £466.3 million). Given low 
levels of headroom in the Connected Vehicle Solutions (CVS) and Wireless & Thermal Solutions 
(WTS) divisions, as set out in note 16, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would result 
in impairment in CVS and WTS and accordingly we consider the accuracy of forecast training 
performance for these speciﬁc divisions to be an area of focused audit interest.
Goodwill impairment reviews require a number of judgements to be made by management around 
forecast cash ﬂows, discount rates, long-term growth rates and working capital assumptions. 
The results of the impairment review are sensitive to changes in these judgements, in particular (given 
recent trading performance and history of recorded impairments) the forecast trading cash ﬂows. 
Accordingly, we have pinpointed the key audit matter to the cash ﬂow forecasts used in the goodwill 
impairment reviews for CVS and WTS.
Management has identiﬁed three groups of cash-generating units as described in note 16 to the 
ﬁnancial statements and tested all three for impairment as required by IAS 36, no impairment was 
recorded in the year.
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 58, note 16 to the ﬁnancial statements and the accounting 
policy and key source of estimation uncertainty disclosure in note 2.
95 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Impairment of goodwill  in CVS and WTS 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over the impairment review process, including 
those over the forecasts that underpin the process.
We challenged the forecasts and sensitivities prepared by management that feed into the goodwill 
impairment reviews by considering historical forecast accuracy, benchmarking against industry trends 
and agreeing forecast revenues for certain major customers to external documentation including 
contracts and customer-prepared forecasts.
We evaluated whether the forecasts used are consistent with those used to support the group’s going 
concern and viability assessment and deferred tax calculations.
We sought contradictory evidence by comparing the total value in use calculations to 
market capitalisation.
We applied our own sensitivities to the impairment model, based on analysis of historical forecasting, 
external expectations and underlying assumptions in the cash ﬂow forecasts, and assessed the 
disclosed sensitivities in note 16 against these.
Key observations We found the forecasts to be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions, and concluded that 
they support the net present value of future cash ﬂows for each group of cash-generating units, which 
exceeds the carrying value of associated assets. As a result, we are satisﬁed that there is no goodwill 
impairment charge recognised in the current year.
Valuation of transfer pricing provisions 
Key audit matter 
description
Provisions have been recognised in respect of tax exposures totalling £22.9 million (2016: £28.3 million), 
of which £21.5 million (2016: £23.8 million) relates to transfer pricing.
The global nature of the group’s operations and the presence of cross-border transactions present a 
complex tax environment and the potential for misstatement. The group engages with the relevant 
tax authorities and engages external advisors to ascertain the correct tax treatment. However for 
certain ongoing matters, notably those in China and India which constitute the majority of the balance, 
tax provisions are required in respect of uncertain tax positions. Due to the high level of judgement 
and potential effect on the effective tax rate, we have considered that there was a potential for fraud 
through possible manipulation of this balance.
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 53, note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements and the accounting 
policy disclosure in note 2.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls over the calculation of tax provisions.
We challenged management’s assessment of risks, particularly focussing on areas where signiﬁcant 
judgement has been applied, by using the assistance of tax specialists to assess the likelihood of 
economic outﬂow to determine the provision recorded.
Where amounts have been provided in relation to potential enquiries by tax authorities, we have 
challenged whether the recognition of a liability is appropriate by using tax specialists to assess the 
technical merits of the tax uncertainty.
Where items have been released due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, we have considered 
this in light of local laws and regulations.
We have assessed management’s use of expert advice, including speaking directly to them where 
appropriate to understand and assess the rationale for the positions adopted.
We have used tax specialists in the relevant jurisdictions to gain an understanding of the tax authority 
environment and assess whether the provisions are appropriate.
Key observations We ﬁnd the overall provision to be reasonable, although towards the prudent end 
of the acceptable range.

Independent Auditor’s Report
continued Valuation of US Deferred Tax Assets 
Key audit matter 
description
The US operations have recorded losses for tax purposes for a number of years, largely due to the 
intercompany interest charges it suffers. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in the past up to the 
level of deferred tax liabilities that will reverse (2017: £13.9 million; 2016: £24.3 million), but no further 
asset was recognised due to the uncertainty surrounding future proﬁts in that jurisdiction against which 
to utilise the losses.
Accumulated losses in the US as at 31 December 2017 were £159 million.
One of the consequences of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 (“US Tax Reform”), along with a rate 
cut that revalued all US deferred tax assets and liabilities, was to cap the amount of interest that is 
tax deductible, and as a result management now forecasts that the US group is forecasting taxable 
proﬁts in the future and accordingly has recognised an additional deferred tax asset of £7.0 million.
The key judgements identiﬁed are:
• the interpretation of the new legislation and its application to the Laird;
• given the history of losses, whether there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that losses will be 
utilised (over and above those that offset reversing deferred tax liabilities); and
• the valuation of asset recognised.
Due to the magnitude of the brought forward losses and the level of judgement involved in the 
valuation of the asset, we consider the valuation of deferred tax assets in the USA to be a key 
audit matter.
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 53, note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements and the accounting 
policy disclosure in note 2.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls over the calculation of tax provisions.
We challenged management on whether there was sufficient evidence as to the probability of future 
proﬁts by reference to the past losses; 
With the assistance of tax specialists in the US, we evaluated the existence of the brought forward 
losses by agreeing a sample to ﬁled tax returns;
We checked that the forecasts used in the calculation of the valuation of the asset had been accurately 
extracted from the group’s board-approved forecasts (which itself has been considered as part of our 
impairment work as set out above);
With the assistance of our tax specialists in the US, we evaluated whether US tax law had been 
appropriately interpreted and applied to the forecasts to arrive at an estimate of the future tax charges;
We independently calculated an expected range for the asset based on our judgement and knowledge 
of the Group’s forecasts and operating cycles.
We considered contradictory evidence as to the period over which the losses will be utilised.
Key observations We found the asset recorded to be acceptable, albeit towards the more optimistic end of our 
acceptable range.
97 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Group ﬁnancial statements Parent company ﬁnancial statements
Materiality £2.7 million (2016: £2.7 million) £2.6 million
Basis for determining  
materiality
5% of adjusted pre-tax proﬁt. Items that are adjusted from 
statutory Proﬁt Before Tax are exceptional items and fair 
value adjustments for ﬁnancial instruments.
In 2016, due to the loss made, we considered a number of 
benchmarks including adjusted proﬁt before tax, underlying 
operating proﬁt and net assets, and the ﬁgures derived from 
those, then selected a materiality within that range that we 
considered to be appropriate.
We determined a materiality based on 
2% of net assets, however, capped at 
95% of group materiality.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
The primary and most signiﬁcant user of the ﬁnancial 
statements are investors and shareholders, with the adjusted 
PBT being their key focus. 
It is a signiﬁcant component of the 
Group and a standalone materiality 
would have been too high.
Materiality
Audit Committee reporting threshold £0.135m
Adjusted PBT 
£54.2m
Component materiality range (excluding parent company): £1.77m to £1.25m
Group materiality £2.7m
PBT Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £135,000 
(2016: £135,000) for the group and parent company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when 
assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
98 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report
continued An overview of the scope of our audit
Throughout 2017, the group organised itself across multiple locations, with each location serving one or more of the three 
divisions (Performance Materials, Connected Vehicle Solutions and Wireless & Thermal Solutions). We deﬁned our components 
based on location, with a total of 32 in existence. 11 of these components were included as full scope audits (including entities in 
the United Kingdom, the United States, China, the Czech Republic, Germany and South Korea), these being the most material 
components from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. We also identiﬁed two additional speciﬁed balances outside 
these components, and provided speciﬁc instructions to the relevant components on those.
Component materiality levels were set according to the size and scale of the relative component as well as any qualitative factors 
speciﬁc to the relevant component and were in the range of £1.25 million to £1.77 million.
In establishing our scoping of the audit, we considered the component structure and reporting mechanisms of the group. 
We further considered the effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment (taking into account the 
effects of restructuring and the reorganisation into three divisions, which led to a change in scoping approach from the prior 
period), and other risks of material misstatement that may be speciﬁc to the individual components such as internal audit ﬁndings, 
when assessing the work to be performed at each entity.
In order to direct and supervise the work of the component audit teams (Deloitte and other ﬁrms) globally, the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or another senior member of the group audit team (either the Head Office audit partner or Group Audit Director), visited 
each of these component teams at least once during the year to:
• discuss the audit approach and relevant ﬁnancial statement risks with the component team, including component tax audit 
specialists in the USA and China;
• meet with local management and attend close meetings; and
• review key audit working papers on the key ﬁnancial statement risk areas.
In addition, the majority of the component partners attended a global team meeting during 2017, to plan the audit approach and 
plan the 2017 audit.
The group team further interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during the various stages of the audit 
(planning, interim and year end), reviewed key working papers in person and remotely and performed additional procedures 
where necessary to give us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the group ﬁnancial statements.
For those entities where no component auditor was engaged, we undertook review procedures over the balances to identify 
any unusual transactions or indicators of misstatement. We also visited one of these sites in January 2018 to hold inquiries with 
local management.
At the Head office level, the group team:
• evaluated the design and implementation of entity-level controls;
• tested the consolidation, consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations and foreign currency revaluations; and
• undertook audit procedures in respect of the group’s parent company managed from the group’s corporate office in London, 
United Kingdom.

99 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report other than the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are speciﬁcally required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and ﬁnancial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
speciﬁed for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

Group cash ﬂow statement
for the year ended 31 December 2017 1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS
Explanatory note:
Simplifying the numbers These notes provide additional detail and explanations on the disclosures within our Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Laird PLC (the ultimate parent company) and all its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2018 and the statement of ﬁnancial 
position was signed on the Board’s behalf by A J Quinlan and K J Dangerﬁeld. Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (‘IFRS’), and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group, which have been consistently 
applied, are set out in note 2. 
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Explanatory note:
This section contains details of all the basic principles used to prepare the ﬁnancial statements.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative ﬁnancial instruments, 
which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling and all 
values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and 
the reported income and expense during the reporting periods. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the 
Directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these judgements and estimates.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items of income or expense incurred outside the normal course of business and are considered to be 
material and infrequent in nature. These items are presented separately within the ‘exceptional items’ income statement category. 
Determining whether an item is part of exceptional items requires judgement as to whether it meets the Group’s deﬁnition as 
detailed in the accounting policy below.
Provisions
On an ongoing basis the Group is party to various disputes, the outcomes of which cannot be assessed with a high degree of 
certainty. Management applies its judgement in determining whether or not to record a provision. A provision is recognised 
where, based on the Group’s legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered probable that an outﬂow of 
resources will be required to settle a present obligation that can be measured reliably. From this judgement the Group uses 
estimation to determine the level of provision, tax provision or deferred tax asset to recognise, which is discussed below.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the current reporting 
period that may have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next ﬁnancial year, are discussed below.
Uncertain tax provisions
Laird recognises certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty where 
the tax treatment cannot be ﬁnally determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority. These provisions 
are sensitive to the resolution of issues which are not always within the control of the Group and are often dependent on legal 
processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Issues can take many years to resolve and assumptions 
on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management. The nature of the assumptions made by management when 
calculating the provision relate to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of decisions by tax authorities in respect 
of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. 
In making the estimates, management’s judgement was based on various factors, including:
• the status of recent and current tax audits and enquiries;
• the results of previous claims of a similar nature;
107 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
• any changes to the relevant tax legislation or its interpretation both locally and internationally; and
• any other relevant changes to the tax environment including initiatives by non-governmental bodies such as the OECD 
and European Commission.
Deferred tax assets 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. The recognition and measurement 
of deferred tax assets requires the application of judgement in assessing the amount, timing (which may be different to the 
period covered by the Group’s strategic plan) and probability of future taxable proﬁts, the interpretation of any new legislation 
recently introduced in a particular country, together with future tax planning strategies. These factors affect the determination 
of the appropriate rates of tax to apply and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. See note 24 for the Group’s deferred 
tax disclosures.
Measurement of litigation provisions
The Group reviews litigation provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reﬂect the current best estimate of the ﬁnancial 
settlement. Litigation provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash ﬂows are dependent on future events. 
The Group exercises judgement in recognising litigation provisions. Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a liability 
will arise and estimation is required to quantify the possible amount of any ﬁnancial settlement. 
During the year, Management reassessed the critical estimates and critical judgements regarding litigation provisions and resolved 
that a £2.2m overall reduction in total litigation provisions was required to reﬂect latest best estimates of the probable future 
costs of the legal case and settlements during the year (see note 26). 
Discount rate and inﬂation rate used to determine the carrying amount of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation
Measurement of deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations requires estimation of the future changes in salaries and inﬂation, as well as 
mortality rates and the selection of a suitable discount rate. Of these the selection of a suitable discount rate and inﬂation rate 
are considered to be key sources of estimation uncertainty.
The Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on high quality corporate bonds. Signiﬁcant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included 
in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The most signiﬁcant criteria considered for the selection of bonds 
include the issue size of the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identiﬁcation of outliers which are excluded. 
Similarly, the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated using a selected rate of inﬂation. This is determined using 
appropriate inﬂation measures in the countries where the Group has deﬁned beneﬁt pension arrangements.
The assumptions selected, an associated sensitivity analysis and a reconciliation of the movements in deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
obligations are disclosed in note 34. 
Goodwill impairment testing: Connected Vehicle Solutions and Wireless & Thermal Systems
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the cash-generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash ﬂows, estimating 
a growth rate used for extrapolation purposes and choosing a suitable discount rate (see note 16). 
Following the Group’s various acquisitions total goodwill of £418.0m is recognised on the 2017 balance sheet. In 2016, future 
ﬁnancial projections resulted in an impairment of £155.5m in relation to the Connected Vehicle Solutions and the Wireless & 
Thermal Systems cash-generating units. Given this recent impairment the Group has identiﬁed the assumptions and estimates 
used in goodwill impairment testing as a key source of estimation uncertainty. No further impairment has been identiﬁed in 2017. 
Past assumptions have been updated in 2017 to reﬂect current trading performance and future expectations, which has resulted 
in an increase in impairment headroom over 2016.
The assumptions selected and associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 16.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Further details on Going Concern are provided in the Directors’ report on page 91.

108 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the ﬁnancial information.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings (‘the Group’). The ﬁnancial statements of the 
subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate. 
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on 
which the Group ceases to control them. Speciﬁcally, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
• Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• Exposure, or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is measured as 
the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group. The identiﬁable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition 
date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, 
including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The ﬁnancial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency. The functional currency 
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency of the Group 
is Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group ﬁnancial statements the results and cash ﬂows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using average 
rates of exchange for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained proﬁts for the period of overseas 
subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, 
are shown as movements in equity. All other exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since the adoption of IFRS are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity via 
other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ 
equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and 
represents net invoice value.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised on shipment of goods when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to a third party, the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated 
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that 
the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the Group and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect 
of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue from the provision of services is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from 
maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight-line basis.
109 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of ﬁnancial 
position and the operating and ﬁnancing costs of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans are recognised in the income statement as 
operating costs and interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing beneﬁts under the deﬁned beneﬁt plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected 
unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to beneﬁts to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to 
the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of deﬁned beneﬁt obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. 
The assets of deﬁned beneﬁt plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of ﬁnancial position and the liabilities are 
recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate. 
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund 
or beneﬁt available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists. 
Contributions to deﬁned contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), Medium Term Incentive Plan (‘MTIP’) and Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) shares 
awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. The fair value of share 
options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which share options were granted. Non-market company performance and service conditions are not taken into 
account when estimating the fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense 
is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisﬁed. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting 
as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation 
or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Acquired intangible assets are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their 
estimated useful economic lives. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful 
life of an intangible asset ranges between ﬁve and twenty years depending on its nature.
Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised 
as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including 
commercial and technological feasibility have been met. Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful 
economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically around four years. Intangible assets relating to products in the 
development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet 
date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise. Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.

GOODWILL
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the 
consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
INCOME TAXES
Tax expense
The tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred taxes.
Current taxes
Current tax is the amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable proﬁts, as adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay 
tax, or in some cases for items which we are required to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The majority of the Group’s 
taxable proﬁts arise in countries, including China, where the estimated tax liabilities are paid in on account instalments during the 
year to which they relate and are largely paid at the balance sheet date. The current tax liability of £29.9m (2016: £33.9m) includes 
£1.2m directly associated with assets classiﬁed as held for sale. The liability of £31.1m represents £8.2m (2016: £5.6m) tax due on 
proﬁts of the current and prior years as well as £22.9m (2016: £28.3m) provisions for tax uncertainties.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to shareholders’ equity. 
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reﬂects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences 
between the accounting and tax rules. Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Details of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets can be found in note 24. 
111 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Tax Provisions
Laird recognises certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty where 
the tax treatment cannot be ﬁnally determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority. The balance 
at 31 December 2017 is £22.9m.
This amount is sensitive to the resolution of issues which are not always within the control of the Group and are often dependent 
on legal processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Issues can take many years to resolve and 
assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal 
liability of the Company.
INTEREST
Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation 
and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant and equipment depreciation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows:
Land and buildings
Freehold buildings   25 years or less
Leasehold buildings   25 years or the lease term if less
Plant and machinery
Computer equipment   5 years or less
Motor vehicles    4 years
Other plant and machinery  10 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or groups of assets. If the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. 
LEASES
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as 
a ﬁnance lease. All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement 
evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful 
life of the asset. The obligations relating to ﬁnance leases, net of ﬁnance charges in respect of future periods, are included as 
appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated 
to accounting periods during the lease term to reﬂect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for 
each accounting period.

112 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SEGMENT REPORTING
Segments are identiﬁed on the basis of management information which is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision 
Maker to assess the performance of each segment. The Group moved to a three division structure effective from 1 January 2017. 
The segmental results for the comparative period have been restated for the purposes of comparability.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. 
Events which are considered to be material and infrequent in nature and therefore may give rise to the classiﬁcation of items as 
exceptional include major restructuring of businesses and related asset impairments (including the re-design of our operating 
model), the transaction costs of acquiring new businesses, transaction costs of the rights issue in 2016, gains or losses on the 
reassessment of estimated contingent consideration on acquired businesses, gains or losses on the reassessment of put and 
call options in respect of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the integration of new businesses, and gains or losses on the 
disposal of businesses.
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are recognised 
on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost 
less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability 
of insolvency or signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable. Trade and other receivables are discounted when 
the time value of money is considered material. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired. Gains and losses 
are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Derivative ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments. These assets 
are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable a part of a ﬁnancial asset or part of a group of similar ﬁnancial assets) is 
derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset have expired; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
113 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All ﬁnancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, 
directly attributable transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying 
amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively 
in ﬁnance income and ﬁnance expense. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
The Group may use derivative ﬁnancial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with 
foreign currency and interest rate ﬂuctuations. Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising 
from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity proﬁles. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, these are Level 2 derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation identiﬁes 
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be 
measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and 
periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Net investment hedges
These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign operations. 
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in 
shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement. 
Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when 
an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. As a result of 
the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as 
non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable; 
• Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input 
that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Fair value hierarchy is provided in note 27 and derivative ﬁnancial instruments are Level 1 under IFRS 13 unless otherwise disclosed.
TREASURY SHARES
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Beneﬁt Trust and the Laird PLC Employee Beneﬁt Trust are classiﬁed in 
shareholders’ equity as ‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
114 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash in the statement of ﬁnancial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as deﬁned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out 
principle. For ﬁnished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses 
(principally administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
PROVISIONS
Provisions comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted 
where the time value of money is material.
DISPOSAL GROUPS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
Disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount is anticipated to be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the disposal group 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED 
In the current year the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (‘IASB’) that are mandatorily effective for accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not 
had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these ﬁnancial statements.
Amendments to IAS 7 
Disclosure Initiative
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the ﬁrst time in the current year. The amendments 
require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of ﬁnancial statements to evaluate changes 
in liabilities from ﬁnancing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes. The Group’s liabilities 
arising from ﬁnancing activities consists of borrowings (note 21). A reconciliation between the opening 
and closing balances of these items is provided in note 31. Consistent with the transition provisions of the 
amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year. Apart from the 
additional disclosure in note 31, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet 
effective for the ﬁnancial period:
Effective date  
year starting
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Directors plan to adopt these standards in line with their effective dates stated. The current status of the Group’s assessment 
of these standards is set out below.
115 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is the new revenue standard which replaces IAS 18 Revenue. The standard is based on revenue being recognised as and 
when ‘transfer of control’ (of the goods or services provided) occurred, which is a change from the ‘risks and rewards’ model 
under the current standard.
Current status
The Group has reviewed each contract and revenue stream that is quantitatively or qualitatively material to the Group for the 
impact of IFRS 15. The main changes identiﬁed have been:
• identiﬁcation of some revenue streams that are non-distinct and therefore must be combined with other revenue streams;
• identiﬁcation of contract related costs that IFRS 15 requires to be initially recognised as an asset.
The Group expects these changes to result in approximately £1m of revenue being recognised later than under the current 
standard and a £0.1m increase in proﬁt after taxation impact at 31 December 2017.
Application
We plan to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method. This adjusts the 31 December 2017 closing reserves for the 
cumulative proﬁt impact of IFRS 15, without restatement of the prior period comparatives.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 reduces the number of primary measurement categories for ﬁnancial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value. 
The Group has reviewed the impact of IFRS 9 on the Group’s business and does not expect there to be a material impact 
on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current ﬁnance lease accounting. It is not 
practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effects of IFRS 16 Leases until a detailed review is completed. The Group 
will be assessing the impact of the standard during 2018 and will estimate the impact of the results in the 2018 consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.

adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items which we are required to pay additional 
tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reﬂects where more or less tax is 
expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.

Explanatory note:
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax credits/losses) that are attributable to each ordinary 
share we have in issue. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the proﬁt for the year divided by the 
daily average of the number of shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the same proﬁt but with 
the number of shares increased to reﬂect the daily average effect of relevant share options granted but not yet exercised where 
performance conditions have been met and shares contingently issuable.

Explanatory note:
Underlying proﬁt and earnings per share are shown as the Board considers them to be relevant guides to the performance 
of the Group.
Underlying tax is stated before tax on exceptional items, deferred tax on the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, goodwill 
and US capitalised development costs, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of 
ﬁnancial instruments. The deferred tax impact of short-term losses and current tax on the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and impairment of goodwill are included in the calculation of underlying tax.
The underlying tax charge for the year is equivalent to 24.1% (2016: 24.9%) of underlying proﬁt before tax.

Explanatory note:
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our business. 
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation is calculated by that cost, net of any residual 
value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any 
depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

Explanatory note:
This note shows the cost, amortisation and net book value of the non-physical assets controlled by us that we recognise 
in our business. The cost of an asset is the cost of purchase (applies to software), the expense incurred to develop the asset 
internally (applies to capitalised development costs) or the fair value incurred when the asset is purchased as part of a 
business combination (applies to all other intangible asset types). An asset’s net book value is its cost less any amortisation 
(including impairment, if required) charged to date.

CAPITALISED DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure typically have a ﬁnite expected 
useful life of around four years. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis. All amortisation charges 
for the year have been charged against operating proﬁt. The total amount of research and development activity incurred during 
2017 is £90.9m (2016: £69.8m) of which £23.4m (2016: £19.9m) was capitalised.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36. The Group moved 
to a three division structure effective from 1 January 2017, which caused the composition of its cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) 
to change. As a result goodwill was tested for impairment for the following groups of CGUs:
• Performance Materials division
• Connected Vehicle Solutions division
• Wireless and Thermal Systems division 
Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of £272.4m at the year end, including £24.3m of goodwill classiﬁed as assets 
held for sale (2016 restated: £287.2m). Connected Vehicle Solutions had a goodwill balance of £62.0m at the year end (2016 
restated: £65.4m). Wireless and Thermal Systems had a goodwill balance of £107.9m at the year end (2016 restated: £113.8m). 
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use. The restatements reﬂect the impact of the changes made to the 
internal organisation, as set out above.
The key assumptions were:
• A pre-tax discount rate of 15.4% for Performance Materials, 13.3% for Connected Vehicle Solutions and 13.1% for Wireless 
and Thermal Systems (2016: single Group discount rate of 14.1%). These discount rates have been derived from a market 
participant’s cost of capital and risk adjusted for individual CGU’s circumstances.
• Revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge. 
The discount rate has been applied to cash ﬂow forecasts from 2018 to perpetuity. 
The forecast cash ﬂows for 2018–2020 are based on the Board approved 2017 budget and medium-term growth plans. 
Cash ﬂows  for 2021 onwards for both divisions have been increased by 3% p.a. (2016: 3% p.a.). The long-term growth rate 
assumption reﬂects the historical and expected further long-term growth rates in the countries and markets in which the 
Group principally operates.
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash ﬂow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying 
value of the assets in the Divisions and provide further comfort that no impairment is required. There are no reasonably possible 
changes in assumptions that would give rise to an impairment in Performance Materials. For Connected Vehicle Solutions 
and Wireless & Thermal Systems, given the impairment booked in 2016, the Group identiﬁed the assumptions and estimates 
used in goodwill impairment testing as a key source of estimation uncertainty. Therefore the Group has considered the following 
individual sensitivities (which are considered reasonably possible) and have determined that headroom would be eliminated 
for each of the CGUs in any one of the following three circumstances in isolation:
 if the pre-tax discount rate was increased to 18%; or
 if no growth was assumed in the calculation of terminal value; or
 if the cash ﬂow projections were reduced by 20%.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. All amortisation charges for the year 
have been charged against operating proﬁts. The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets:
Brand names – 5 years
Trade secrets – 15 years
Trade marks and names – 5 to 15 years
Patents – 10 to 20 years
Customer relationships – 10 to 20 years
Software – 5 to 7 years
Developed Technology – 5 to 10 years

The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the 
customer to continue business with the Group for any ﬁnite period. Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible 
assets with an indeﬁnite life.
17. OPERATIONS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Explanatory note:
This note provides both quantitative and descriptive information on operations classiﬁed as held for sale in 2017, including details 
of the circumstances that led to the operations being classiﬁed as held for sale and the major classes of assets and liabilities that 
have been classiﬁed as held for sale. The note also provides details on acquisitions made by the Group in 2016, including details 
of the acquisitions themselves, the net assets acquired and the consideration paid or payable.
ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES IN 2017
There were no acquisitions made during 2017.
OPERATIONS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
On 12 December 2017, the Board resolved to dispose of the Group’s Model Solution business and negotiations with an interested 
party have subsequently taken place. 
These operations, which are expected to be sold within 12 months, have been classiﬁed as a disposal group held for sale and 
presented separately in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. 
The disposal group is presented within the Performance Materials segment.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses 
have been recognised on the classiﬁcation of these operations as held for sale.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classiﬁed as held for sale are as follows:
2017  
£m
Property, plant and equipment 13.3
Goodwill 24.3
Other intangible assets 12.3
Deferred tax asset 0.8

ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES IN 2016
On 20 January 2016, the Group acquired 100% of Novero, a leading Germany based integrated vehicle connectivity systems 
provider for a total consideration of £50.1m (€65.0m). This acquisition is expected to enhance Laird’s offering of innovative 
wireless solutions to the automotive market. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets 
were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
Fair values of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of Novero stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition, were as follows:
Fair values to 
the Group  
£m
Property, plant and equipment 5.6
Intangible assets 30.4

Consideration 50.1
Consideration satisﬁed by:
Cash consideration 39.4
Net overdraft acquired 0.3
Non-cash consideration – shares issued 10.4
50.1
In the period following acquisition, revenue for Novero was £82.5m, there was a loss after tax of £7.6m and underlying loss before 
tax was £0.6m. If the acquisition had been held for the full year 2016, Group revenues would have been £803.2m and the loss 
before tax would have been £1.2m worse at £123.5m. Included in the goodwill recognised above are certain assets that cannot 
be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These items include the expected value of synergies. 
18. INVENTORIES

contained within note 31.
Notes:
(a) The borrowings included in liabilities associated with assets held for sale are secured on the assets classiﬁed as held for sale. No other borrowings 
are secured on the assets of subsidiary undertakings (2016: £nil). 
(b) The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £235.0m (2016: £255.0m). Drawings by Group companies under these facilities 
were £35.0m (2016: £214.5m). Although these drawings are repayable within one year they are classiﬁed as long term as they can be reﬁnanced 
under the terms of the facilities.
(c) Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility.
(d) The Group has ﬁnance leases due within one year of £0.3m (2016: £0.3m) for plant and machinery and due beyond one year of £nil (2016: £8.2m) 
for buildings and £0.3m (2016: £0.6m) for plant and machinery. The Group’s obligations under ﬁnance leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the 
leased assets.
(e) The Group may redeem some or all of the outstanding US Private Placement notes at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% 
of their aggregate principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.
(f) As at 31 December 2017, ﬁxed rate borrowings carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% (2016: 3.8%) and ﬂoating rate borrowings carried 
a weighted average interest rate of 2.1% (2016: 2.1%).
(g) At 31 December 2017, £8.5m of liabilities previously classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases are included in liabilities associated with assets held for sale.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised on tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. They are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable proﬁts 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
UNRECOGNISED TAX LOSSES
Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of £36.6m (2016: £94.5m) where it is unlikely that suitable 
future taxable proﬁts will be available to allow the asset to be recovered. Of the unrecognised losses, £3.6m (2016: £1.9m) have 
expiry dates between 2018 and 2028 and £33.0m (2016: £92.6m) are available thereafter. Deferred tax assets have not been 
established on capital losses of £3.6m (2016: £3.6m) where it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable gains. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary differences of £5.6m (2016: £8.1m) where it is 
unlikely that suitable future taxable proﬁts will be available to allow the asset to be recovered. These temporary differences have 
no expiry date.
TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH GROUP INVESTMENTS
Deferred tax of £4.2m (2016: £2.1m) has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is likely 
there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends. 
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences of £6.9m (2016: £6.9m) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it 
is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 2016 represent only the 
unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE TAX CHARGES
It is expected that the underlying tax charge in 2018 will be in the range of 24% to 25%, subject to any unexpected changes in tax 
rates in the countries in which we operate. The movement in the tax rate from 2017 is primarily due to the impact of changes in the 
Group’s proﬁt mix, amendments to the Group’s transfer pricing policies to ensure alignment with the Divisional reorganisation in 
2017, as well as actions that the Group plans to implement to mitigate the impact of the US tax reforms enacted at the end of 2017.

Explanatory note:
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
An explanation of the Group’s ﬁnancial instrument risk and capital management objectives, policies and strategies are set out 
in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 30 to 35 and in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements (note 2). 
The Group’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments are forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures and 
both put and call options relating to the non-controlling interest (‘NCI’) in Model Solution (acquired April 2014). The put option 
is a liability that may become payable regarding the NCI in Model Solution. The call option is a ﬁnancial asset that the Group has 
over the NCI in Model Solution. 
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, and non-current and current trade and other receivables, 
borrowings and trade and other payables.

MARKET RISK
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial instruments in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, 
and also incurs ﬁnancial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group seeks to reduce volatility in its interest charge caused by rate ﬂuctuations. This is achieved by maintaining an 
appropriate balance between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts and similar 
instruments. The proportions of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debt are determined having regard to a number of factors, including 
prevailing market conditions, interest rate cycle, the Group’s interest cover and leverage position and any perceived correlation 
between business performance and rates. At 31 December 2017, approximately 46% (2016: 26%) of debt is at ﬁxed rate. 
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s 
proﬁt before tax (through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity. The interest 
rates considered are Sterling, Euro and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and 
held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those 
recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative ﬂoating rate ﬁnancial instruments. 
The 50 basis points sensitivity used represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates, 
otherwise viewed as two rate rises of 25 basis points each.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the entity involved. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro, Renminbi and Czech 
Koruna. The Group policy is to match the sales and purchases in these currencies as far as possible. Residual exposures are 
managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures. The forward contracts have a 
principal value of £37.8m (2016: £92.8m) and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi. They are revalued at 
their fair value estimated by discounting the future cash ﬂows using appropriate market sourced data at the balance sheet date. 
These contracts have not been designated as cash ﬂow hedges and the resulting gain of £2.8m (2016: loss of £1.9m) has been 
taken to the income statement. These are Level 2 derivative ﬁnancial instruments and there has been no movement between 
levels during the year. 
NET INVESTMENT HEDGING
Included in borrowings are US $173.9m (£128.7m) and €89.1m (£79.2m) of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net 
investments in the United States and European subsidiaries. This is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange 
risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or 
losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates in isolation against 
Sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s proﬁt before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary 
assets, liabilities and foreign currency transaction hedges) and the Group’s equity (due to changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial 
instruments designated as net investment hedges).
The 10% sensitivity used represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

PUT AND CALL OPTIONS OVER THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN MODEL SOLUTION
In accordance with the Shareholders’ agreement entered into between the Group and the minority shareholder of Model Solution, 
the Group and the minority shareholder are respectively granted call and put options which entitle the Group to purchase from the 
minority shareholder and the minority shareholder to sell to the Group the minority shareholder’s 49% interest in Model Solution. 
The call options can be exercised by the Group on 31 May 2018, 2019 or 2020, and the put option can be exercised by the minority 
shareholder on 31 May 2020 and if none of these options are exercised then the Group is committed to acquire the 49% interest 
in Model Solution on 31 May 2021. The exercise price for the call and put options will be determined in accordance with the 
Shareholders’ agreement and will be between KRW 42.2bn (£29.3m) and KRW 88.9bn (£61.7m). 
The put and call options are re-measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognised 
in the consolidated income statement as an exceptional acquisition related item. In the event that the put option lapses 
unexercised, the liability will be derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITY – PUT OPTION
The ﬁnancial liability that may become payable under the put option in respect of the non-controlling interest in Model Solution 
is recognised at a fair value of £31.4m (2016: £31.0m) within non-current liabilities. The increase in the fair value during 2017 of 
£0.4m (2016: £3.0m increase) has been taken to the income statement.
The exercise price for the put option will be calculated by dividing the EBITDA of Model Solution for the year to 31 December 2019 
by EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2015 and applying this factor against a base price of KRW 42.2bn (£29.3m). The key 
assumptions in estimating the fair value are an EBITDA projection for Model Solution for the year to 31 December 2019 and a 
discount rate of 3.0% applied at 31 December 2017 (2016: 2.7%).
The ﬁnancial liability is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, a 10% increase in EBITDA for the year to 
31 December 2019 would result in an increase in the ﬁnancial liability of £3.1m, while a 10% decrease would result in a decrease in 
the ﬁnancial liability of £2.1m. An increase in the discount rate by 1% would result in a decrease in the ﬁnancial liability of £0.7m, 
while a decrease in the discount rate by 1% would result in an increase in the ﬁnancial liability of £0.7m. In accordance with the 
fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, the put option is classiﬁed as a Level 3 derivative ﬁnancial instrument. The fair value of the put 
option is determined by reference to the terms in the underlying agreement. It is calculated at each period end by estimating a 
range of potential exercise prices for the option and applying our estimate of the weighted average probabilities to each.
FINANCIAL ASSET – CALL OPTION
There is a ﬁnancial asset recognised of £4.6m (2016: £1.5m) within non-current assets in respect of the call option that the Group 
has over the non-controlling interest in Model Solution. The increase in the fair value of £3.1m (2016: £0.8m increase) has been 
taken to the income statement.
The call option can be exercised by the Group on 31 May 2018, 2019 or 2020. The exercise price for the call option will be 
calculated by dividing the EBITDA of Model Solution for the year to 31 December prior to the date of exercise of the call option 
by EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2015 and applying this factor against a base price of KRW 42.2bn (£29.3m). The key 
assumptions in estimating the fair value are a range of EBITDA projections for Model Solution for the years to the end of the 
ﬁnancial month prior to the date of exercise of the call option and a discount rate being a Korean risk-free rate over the period to 
exercise, determined at 31 December 2017.
The ﬁnancial asset is sensitive to changes in this assumption. For example, a 10% increase in the base EBITDA scenario would 
result in a decrease in the ﬁnancial asset of £0.2m, while a 10% decrease would result in an increase in the ﬁnancial assets of £0.7m 
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, the call option is classiﬁed as a Level 3 derivative ﬁnancial instrument. 
The fair value of the call option is determined by reference to the terms in the underlying agreement. It is calculated at each 
period end using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the share price and expected exercise price, and our estimate 
of the likelihood of exercising the option at each date.
CREDIT RISK
The Group’s customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal 
products with customers who themselves have signiﬁcant market shares. Inevitably, this results in levels of business and trade 
receivables that are material in the overall Group context. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying 
amount of the ﬁnancial assets.

LOAN COVENANTS
The principal covenants in the Group’s committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net 
borrowings are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (‘EBITA’) to be not less than 
3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’).
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2017.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The US Private Placement loans with a book value of £91.8m (2016: £97.8m) have an estimated fair value of £90.8m 
(2016: £98.5m) which has been calculated by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2017. 
The valuation method is Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, and there has been no movement between levels during the year.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other ﬁnancial instruments.

There were special share awards issued to Tony Quinlan in 2015. Further detail was provided in the 2015 Directors’ 
remuneration report.
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £2.8m was recognised in the year (2016: £1.1m) before employer’s 
national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and the share 
options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards in issue at the beginning of the year, end of the year and those granted 
during the year.

All options in the table above were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as noted above. No share options were exercised in 
2017 (no share options were exercised in 2016). For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2017, the weighted average 
remaining contractual life is 0.2 years (2016: 1.2 years). 
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions 
set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market performance conditions set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
The weighted average fair value (in pence) of LTIP, MTIP, RSP, and special share awards granted during the year was as follows:

The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that may occur. 
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reﬂects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily 
prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating 
the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
30. RESERVES
Explanatory note:
Reserves form part of shareholders’ equity. They are retained in the business and not distributed to shareholders.
TRANSLATION RESERVE
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries. It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
TREASURY SHARES
The investment in Laird shares, held by the Laird PLC Employee Beneﬁt Trust and the Laird 1990 Employee Beneﬁt Trust, 
as described below, are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes.
The Laird PLC Employee Beneﬁt Trust 
The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC for the beneﬁt of current and former employees. These shares may be used 
to satisfy options and awards. The Trust, which is ﬁnanced by a loan of £6.0m from the Company, held 1,215,318 ordinary shares 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: 774,519). While shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its ﬁduciary duties. The shares held by the Trust had a total market value at that 
date of £1.7m (2016: £1.2m). 
The Laird 1990 Employee Beneﬁt Trust
The Trust purchased and held shares in Laird PLC for the beneﬁt of current and former employees. The Group intends to close this 
Trust which, as at 31 December 2017, did not hold any ordinary shares (2016: 6,843). The Group does not expect any signiﬁcant 
accounting impacts to arise from the potential closure.
OTHER RESERVES
During 2017, the Group raised net proceeds of £174.9m via a rights issue (consisting of £184.6m of gross proceeds less expenses 
of £9.7m). A cash box structure was used in such a way that merger relief was available under the Companies Act 2006, section 
612. In this circumstance no share premium can be recorded and the £115.1m excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value 
of the share capital issue has been recorded in Other reserves.
The remaining balance in Other reserves (£33.3m) consists of a charge booked to Other reserves on the initial recognition of the 
ﬁnancial liability put option in respect of the non-controlling interest in Model Solution in 2014. Further details of the ﬁnancial 
liability put option are given in note 27 Financial Instruments.

Contingent liabilities are potential future outﬂows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control; 
timing of the payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.
There are legal claims against the Company or its subsidiary undertakings but none where the Board takes the view that it is 
likely that damages will be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its ﬁnancial position.
153 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 34. POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Explanatory note:
The Group operates a number of schemes of both the deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution types. Details of the schemes 
are included below.
The income statement charge for the deﬁned contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group 
in respect of the current period.
PENSION AND SEVERANCE SCHEMES
Approximately 410 employees (2016: 450) are members of 6 (2016: 6) different deﬁned beneﬁt schemes and these schemes have 
approximately 1,500 (2016: 1,500) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during 
the year were £1.5m (2016: £1.4m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2017, at their market value, is estimated at £131.8m 
(2016: £134.8m) and the liabilities estimated at £117.2m (2016: £129.3m). 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions 
surpluses on the statement of ﬁnancial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or beneﬁt available in the form 
of reduced contributions. The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is £5.2m (2016: £1.2m liability).
DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHEMES 
UK 
In the UK, the Group supports the Laird Pension Scheme which is a funded arrangement providing deﬁned beneﬁts on a ﬁnal 
salary basis. The Group also operates an unapproved arrangement which provides unfunded deﬁned beneﬁts on a ﬁnal salary 
basis to certain members who were previously subject to the HMRC pension schemes earnings cap. Both of the UK arrangements 
are closed to new entrants. 
The Laird Pension Scheme makes up approximately 80% of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities of the Group. 
The Laird Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of the members 
in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The scheme is subject to the scheme speciﬁc 
funding requirements as outlined in UK legislation. The most recent scheme speciﬁc funding valuation was at 1 January 2015. 
The Laird Pension Scheme’s investment strategy is to gradually reduce the proportion of the total assets held in return seeking 
assets to about 15% with 85% of the assets in bonds and annuities over the period to 31 July 2018. This strategy takes account 
of the scheme’s liability proﬁle whilst aiming to minimise long-term costs by maximising return. The scheme’s assets are held 
separately from those of the Group. 
Belgium 
In Belgium, the Group operated the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan which was a funded, insured lump sum deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme and the Emerson and Cuming Pre-Pension Plan which was an unfunded plan where the employer pays a monthly 
indemnity until the retirement date on top of the unemployment allowances paid by the social security. During 2017, these plans 
were closed and all liabilities were settled.
Germany 
In Germany, the Group operates the Cattron-Theimeg Europe GmbH & Co. KG Pension Plan. This is a funded deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme currently providing pension beneﬁts to nine pensioners (2016: seven).
The Novero GmbH Pension Arrangement provides salary-linked deﬁned beneﬁts and is closed to future accrual. 
The arrangement is partly funded via an insured support fund, and partly unfunded.
Sweden
Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme included within a multi-employer plan for its employees which is insured with 
Alecta. This scheme is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the 
Group’s proportional share of the deﬁned beneﬁt commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated 
with the scheme. Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Group’s proportional share of the surplus 
or deﬁcit in the scheme. As a result, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a deﬁned contribution scheme.
Korea
Within Korea, the Group operates the Model Solution severance scheme under Korean Labour law. This provides a payment 
to an employee in the event their service is terminated, if they resign or if they retire. On any of these events, employees will 
receive a lump sum approximately equal to one month of salary for each year of service. The scheme is partially funded to 
a level of 70% (by law at least 60% of the accrued liabilities must be funded).
The beneﬁts provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the non-UK plans reﬂect their local environments. 
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is set according to the level of market yields on either corporate or government 
bonds in the relevant markets.

The disallowed asset consists of the element of the UK surplus that, under current legislation, the Group does not have 
unconditional right to a refund.
The mortality assumption used at the 2017 year end (and 2016 year end) is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier 
for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of birth. Allowance is made for 
improvements in line with CMI (2014) projections with a 1.25% (2016: 1.50%) p.a. long-term trend from 2002. The expected lifetime 
of a participant at 31 December 2017 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are 
shown in years below based on these mortality tables:
Age

Males Females Males Females
65 21.8 24.1 23.4 25.7
65 in 15 years 23.0 25.5 24.7 27.1
For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main ﬁnancial assumptions were: 
UK schemes – inﬂation of 3.25% p.a. (2016: 3.45%), salary increases of 3.25% – 4.25% p.a. (2016: 3.45% – 4.45%) and a discount 
rate for liabilities of 2.45% p.a. (2016: 2.50%); Novero arrangement (Germany) – inﬂation of 1.75% p.a. (2016: 1.95%), salary increases 
of 1.60% p.a. (2016: 1.75%) and a discount rate for liabilities of 2.00% p.a. (2016: 2.00%); and Model Solution scheme (Korea) – 
salary increases of 5.50% p.a. (2016: 5.50%) and a discount rate for liabilities of 2.80% p.a. (2016: 2.40%).

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS 
Over the year to 31 December 2018, the Group is expected to contribute 35.9% of pensionable salaries in respect of Ordinary 
Section members and 64.3% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird Pension Scheme. 
In addition, the Group will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and other administration 
expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt schemes will be £1.0m in 2018.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 16 years. 
KEY RISKS
The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. 
Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be higher 
(or lower) than disclosed. In general, the risk to the Group is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation 
of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Group is higher than expected. 
More speciﬁcally, some of the signiﬁcant risks are detailed below: 
• Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, whereas the 
schemes hold a mixture of investments; if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deﬁcit. 
• Inﬂation risk: The majority of the beneﬁt obligations are linked to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities. 
• Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities. This will be only partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the ﬁgures shown on the balance sheet. The table below shows 
the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £10.0m 
Inﬂation 
Decrease by 0.5%
Increase by 0.5%
Decrease by £6.0m
Increase by £5.5m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65 0.25% reduction in the long-term  
trend of 1.25% to 1.00%
Decrease by £1.5m
METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analysis shown above has been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using 
a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities. The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the 
nearest £0.5m. 
The sensitivity analysis to price inﬂation includes the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inﬂation and Consumer Price Inﬂation, 
as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures (salary increase, revaluation of deferred pensions 
and increases to pensions in payment). For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences between RPI/CPI and these 
related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or ﬂoors on the pension increases, in which case these have 
been applied.

as at 31 December 2017 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH FRS 101
The parent company ﬁnancial statements of Laird PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised 
for issue by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2018 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by A J Quinlan and 
K J Dangerﬁeld. The Company is a public limited company, is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. These ﬁnancial 
statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’) 
and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention.
The Company ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred 
thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The results of the Company are included in the preceding Group ﬁnancial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
• The requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in respect of paragraph 79(a) (iv) of IAS 1; 
paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets; and the requirement 
of paragraph 134 in respect of capital disclosures;
• The requirement of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
• The requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18(a) of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures;
• The requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; 
• The requirements of IAS 8 in relation to standards Issued but not effective; 
• The requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments;
• The requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures; and
• The requirements of paragraphs 91–99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the Directors to make judgements and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the ﬁnancial statements 
and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on 
the Directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these judgements and estimates.
In the course of preparing the ﬁnancial statements no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies, other than those involving estimations, that have had a signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the ﬁnancial statements.
CRITICAL SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the current reporting 
period that may have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next ﬁnancial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments’ 
value in use. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the 
investments and suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries 
was £1,122.2m. The Company has used discount rates in the range of 13.1% to 15.4% to test for impairment and a terminal growth 
rate of 3%. Downside sensitivities have been applied to the estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying 
value of investments in subsidiaries and provide comfort that no impairment is required. 
161 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements of parent company
for the year ended 31 December 2017 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities which are considered reasonably possible and headroom 
would be eliminated if the pre-tax discount rate increased to 17.5% or if no growth was assumed in the terminal value for each 
cash-generating unit in isolation.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
For all other property, plant and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values 
of the assets over their useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment 5 years or less
Other plant and machinery 10 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial year end.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of computer software and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful live 
of intangible assets. The estimated useful life of software is ﬁve to seven years.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market.
INVESTMENTS
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay 
less, or to receive more tax subject to the following:
(a)  Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement 
exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
(b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or 
there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
(c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable 
when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of 
money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost. Provisions are made when there is objective evidence that the Company 
will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. 
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired. Gains and 
losses are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All ﬁnancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition 
is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the proﬁt and loss account.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements of parent company
continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
162 Laird PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively 
in ﬁnance income and ﬁnance costs.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate ﬂuctuations. 
Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when 
the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity proﬁles. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 these are Level 2 derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to 
the proﬁt and loss account. 
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, DIVIDENDS, PROVISIONS, TREASURY SHARES 
AND SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Company’s accounting policies for the impairment of assets, retirement beneﬁt obligations, dividends, provisions, treasury 
shares and share based payments are the same as that for the Group, as set out in note 2 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
2. DIVIDENDS PAID AND PROPOSED
On 1 March 2018 the Board announced that it had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the 
entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Laird PLC. Further details are provided in note 35 of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements. As a result of this announcement no ﬁnal dividend is currently proposed.
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal 
liability of the Company.

6. POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Company operates two deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
Two employees (2016: ﬁve) are members of these deﬁned beneﬁt schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,400 
(2016: 1,400) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were less 
than £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2017 at their market value is estimated at £123.4m (2016: £122.6m) 
and the liabilities estimated at £103.8m (2016: £110.9m).
The Company has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Company to recognise 
pensions surpluses on the statement of ﬁnancial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or beneﬁt available 
in the form of reduced contributions. The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is £10.2m (2016: £5.0m asset).

The mortality assumption used at the 2017 year end (and 2016 year end) is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier 
for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of birth. Allowance is made for 
improvements in line with CMI (2014) projections with a 1.25% (2016: 1.50%) p.a. long-term trend from 2002. The expected lifetime 
of a participant at 31 December 2017 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are 
shown in years below based on these mortality tables:

For IAS 19, the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main ﬁnancial assumptions were 
inﬂation of 3.25% p.a. (2016: 3.45%), salary increases of 3.25% – 4.25% p.a. (2016: 3.45% – 4.45%) and a discount rate for liabilities 
of 2.45% p.a. (2016: 2.50%).

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS 
Over the year to 31 December 2018 the Company is expected to contribute 35.9% of pensionable salaries in respect of Ordinary 
Section members and 64.3% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird Pension Scheme. 
In addition, the Company will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and other administration 
expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme. 
The Company estimates that the total value of contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes will be less than £0.1m in 2018.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 16 years. 
KEY RISKS
The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. 
Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be higher 
(or lower) than disclosed. In general, the risk to the Company is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the 
calculation of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Company is higher than expected. 
More speciﬁcally, some of the signiﬁcant risks are detailed below: 
• Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields whereas 
the schemes hold a mixture of investments; if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deﬁcit. 
• Inﬂation risk: The majority of the beneﬁt obligations are linked to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities. 
• Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities. This will be only 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the ﬁgures shown on the balance sheet. The table below 
shows the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility.

Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £8.0m
Inﬂation Decrease by 0.5% 
Increase by 0.5%
Decrease by £5.0m 
Increase by £4.5m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65 0.25% reduction in the long-term 
trend of 1.25% to 1.00%
Decrease by £1.5m
METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analysis shown above has been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities 
using a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities. The impact on the liabilities has been rounded 
to the nearest £0.5m. 
The sensitivity analysis to price inﬂation includes the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inﬂation and Consumer 
Price Inﬂation, as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures (salary increase, revaluation 
of deferred pensions and increases to pensions in payment). For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences 
between RPI/CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or ﬂoors on the pension 
increases, in which case these have been applied.

Notes:
(a) Company borrowings are unsecured. 
(b)  The Company had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £235.0m (2016: £255.0m) which were underwritten in excess of four years. 
Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were £35.0m (2016: £214.5m). Although these drawings are repayable within one year they 
are classiﬁed as long term as they can be reﬁnanced under the terms of the facilities. 
(c)  Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility. 
(d)  The Company may redeem some or all of the outstanding US Private Placement notes at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal 
to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 
11. DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax liabilities have been recognised on other temporary differences of £nil (2016: £nil). 
The amount of deferred tax that has not been provided on non-trading losses is £9.0m (2016: £11.7m) and other deductible 
temporary differences is £nil (2016: £nil) where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on capital losses of £3.6m (2016: £3.6m) where it is unlikely that future relief 
would be available at the balance sheet date.
