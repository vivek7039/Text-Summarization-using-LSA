Strategic report Group revenue of £15.4bn was 15% 
ahead of last year and adjusted 
operating profit of £1,363m was  
22% ahead. Given the economic and 
currency uncertainties a year ago, 
these results demonstrate the benefit 
of our international diversity and the 
strong underlying performance of  
our businesses. I am therefore very 
pleased to report excellent progress 
this year with adjusted earnings  
per share up 20% to 127.1 pence.
Gross investment was again significant 
this year at £945m. This comprised 
£866m of capital expenditure and 
operating intangible assets, driven by  
a higher level of investment by Primark 
with expenditure in all its countries  
of operation, and £79m on business 
acquisitions. This year we delivered a 
particularly impressive cash flow which 
emphasises the group’s ability to convert 
profitability into cash. We also realised 
proceeds, net of costs and tax, of over 
£500m from two business disposals. 
Together these resulted in last year’s  
net debt of £315m becoming a net  
cash balance of £673m this year end.
As anticipated, we delivered a strong 
recovery in sugar profits this year.  
This was a consequence of the recent 
structural changes made to AB Sugar, 
the considerable benefit derived from 
performance improvement over a 
number of years and an increase in EU 
sugar prices. Moving to full ownership  
of Illovo last year has proved to be a 
positive step with an increase in profit 
which benefited from an acceleration  
of its commercial development and 
performance improvement. We believe 
that we are well placed to take advantage 
of the removal of sugar quotas in the  
EU arising from the reform of the sugar 
regime, and to meet the challenges 
including the recent fall in EU  
sugar prices.
Further cost reduction drove the 
continued recovery of the yeast and 
bakery ingredients business while 
excellence in execution was the  
driver of the strong performance  
from speciality ingredients. Together  
they increased adjusted operating  
profit by 34% this year.

CHARLES SINCLAIR, CHAIRMAN
04 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Associated British Foods plc WWW.ABF.CO.UK/RESPONSIBILITY
Good progress was made by Twinings 
Ovaltine, ACH in the US and George 
Weston Foods in Australia, but Grocery 
results were held back by the trading 
environment faced by the UK bakeries. 
Since the year end we have completed 
the acquisition of Acetum S.p.A.,  
a producer of high-quality balsamic 
vinegar from Modena, Italy. We look 
forward to the opportunity of developing 
further this fine business, using  
our existing capability in selling and 
marketing speciality foods internationally. 
Primark has the potential for significant 
growth and this was demonstrated  
again this year by its opening of a  
net 30 stores and 1.5 million sq ft of  
selling space across nine countries.  
The Primark management team  
also had further success in mitigating 
currency headwinds, they delivered  
on-trend fashion and their stores have 
never looked better. We look forward  
to further growth in the coming year.
Two business disposals took place  
at the beginning of the financial year.  
In November 2016 the sale of our US 
herbs and spices operation significantly 
reduced the complexity of ACH and 
facilitated a reduction in overhead.  
In December 2016 we sold our cane 
sugar operations in south China to a 
party better placed to drive its further 
development. We are proud of the 
transformation in agricultural productivity, 
sugar yields and factory efficiencies  
that we achieved over our 20 years of 
ownership. We realised a pre-tax profit  
of £293m from these two disposals  
with little impact on the group’s  
trading profit.
Corporate responsibility
Our group has grown and evolved 
considerably since its formation in  
1935 and a great deal has changed,  
but the essence of what we do has 
remained a constant. Operating ethically 
is a core value at the heart of our group 
and our intention has always been to  
do the right thing for our people and  
the wider community, believing  
that we achieve this by feeding and  
clothing millions of people every day.  
Our approach to ensuring that this is 
sustained is described in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report which has  
been updated this year. A copy of the 
update is available for download at  
www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
Remuneration
As noted in the Remuneration report  
we revised our remuneration policy  
last year to align it more closely with  
our business strategy. In particular,  
an additional earnings per share  
measure was introduced into the long 
term incentive plan that is designed  
to take into account volatility in world  
and European sugar prices. Although 
incentive payments under this additional 
measure will not arise until 2019,  
the changes in sugar prices seen over 
recent months support this decision.
The board
We are announcing today that Tim Clarke 
will retire as a director with effect from 
30 November 2017, after 13 years on  
the board. Tim’s extensive experience  
in retailing and his wise counsel over  
the years have been of immeasurable 
value and we are very grateful for his 
substantial contribution. His tenure  
did not diminish his independence at  
any time.
Javier Ferrán has completed more  
than nine years’ service as a director  
of the Company and, in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code,  
the rest of the board must now confirm 
his independence annually. This having 
been done, we are delighted that Javier 
has agreed to continue as a member  
of the board and, with Tim’s retirement,  
to take on the responsibilities of Senior 
Independent Director.
We have recently announced the 
appointment of Michael McLintock as a 
non-executive director of the Company 
with effect from 1 November 2017. 
Michael is currently a trustee of the 
Grosvenor Estate and a non-executive 
director of Grosvenor Group. He was 
chief executive of M&G Investments 
from 1997 until his retirement in 2016. 
He became a member of the Audit  
and Remuneration committees  
on appointment.
Employees
Our 133,000 colleagues in 50 countries 
contribute to the success of the group 
and I would like to thank them for 
everything they bring to their businesses. 
It is their innovation, entrepreneurial  
skill, drive and ambition that enable  
us to grow and develop, and through 
their collaboration, build a network that  
makes the whole so much greater  
than the sum of its parts.
Dividends
I am pleased to report that a final 
dividend of 29.65p is proposed, to be paid 
on 12 January 2018 to shareholders on 
the register on 15 December 2017. 
Together with the interim dividend  
of 11.35p paid on 7 July 2017, this will  
make a total of 41.0p for the year,  
an increase of 12%.
Outlook
Primark’s selling space expansion  
will continue and with margins in line 
with the current year we expect an 
increase in Retail profit. Progress is 
expected from Grocery, Agriculture and 
Ingredients. In Sugar, higher volumes 
and lower costs will only partially 
mitigate the effect of much lower  
EU prices.
At current exchange rates we expect  
no material transactional or translational 
effect on profit.
Taking all of these factors into account,  
at this early stage, we expect progress  
in adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
earnings per share for the group for the 
coming year.

“ We are a responsible business”
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
05
Strategic report 2017 was a very productive year  
in which all of our businesses made 
significant progress and delivered  
an excellent set of group results.  
With over 60% of our sales and profits 
now generated outside the UK, the 
headline results benefited from sterling 
weakness on translation. Nevertheless, 
growth was very strong on a constant 
currency basis with revenue and 
adjusted operating profit ahead by  
6% and 13% respectively.
Over the last few years AB Sugar  
has taken major steps to transform  
its business with the sale of the cane 
sugar operations in south China this year, 
the move to full ownership of Illovo last 
year and the benefits delivered by the 
performance improvement programme 
over many years. It is pleasing to report  
a substantial increase in Sugar profit this 
year which benefited from all of these 
initiatives and an increase in EU sugar 
prices. Illovo is making good progress 
with its accelerated programme of 
commercial development and the delivery 
of further production efficiencies. In the 
EU, we have established a low cost 
business which is positioned to exploit 
the market opportunities and associated 
freedom to export, following the abolition 
of sugar quotas in October this year.
In Grocery, Twinings Ovaltine, ACH in the 
US and George Weston Foods in Australia 
all increased adjusted operating profit. 
However, a difficult trading environment 
in the UK bread market led to a decline  
in revenues at Allied Bakeries and it 
sustained a loss. We are continuing to 
invest in our brands and are working 
closely with our customers to improve 
the profitability of our bakery business. 
AB Agri continued with its strategy of 
expanding the value-adding elements  
of its business. Ingredients achieved 
another strong profit and margin increase 
driven by further cost reduction in  
AB Mauri and excellent performances 
from speciality ingredients.
The expansion of Primark’s selling space 
continued apace this year and trading 
was excellent, particularly over the 
summer, delivering strong increases  
in market share. Our determination to  
be the best value on the high street 
drove the decision not to pass on to our 
customers the higher input costs arising 
from sterling weakness against the  
US dollar. The gross impact of this on 
Primark’s margin was, to some extent, 
mitigated by the work of the buying

and merchandising teams and margin 
declined by less than expected at  
the beginning of the year to 10.4%. 
Notwithstanding this highly successful 
year, Primark constantly seeks better 
ways of delivering value to customers, 
be that through store design and 
location, stock availability, or enhancing 
its reputation for on-trend fashion.  
The Primark website and social media 
are playing an ever more important role 
in the relationship with our customers  
in driving awareness of our products  
and footfall in our stores. Primark will 
continue to expand its selling space 
across all its countries of operation with 
another strong programme of new store 
openings scheduled for the coming year.
Implications of the EU referendum
The consequences for the group of the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU should  
be seen in the context of the diversity  
of our operations and geographical 
footprint, combined with a business 
model that has discrete Primark supply 
chains for the UK and Eurozone and, 
wherever possible, aligns food production 
with the end markets for our products. 
Changes in legislation and trade 
agreements provide significant 
opportunities for the food industry to 
replace imported food and build export 
markets and, for UK agricultural policy 
particularly, they have the potential  
to benefit our group. We are engaged  
at all levels with a number of UK 
Government departments to ensure  
that the full range of opportunities and 
risks, as they affect us, are recognised.
We are pleased with the Government’s 
commitment that least developed 
countries will not face an increase in 
tariffs on their exports to the UK after it 
leaves the EU. This will provide benefits 
both for UK consumers and trade  
with these countries which plays an 
important part in securing the livelihoods 
of local workforces. In common with 
many other businesses, we share a 
concern about the risk of abrupt changes 
to the UK’s customs procedures. We 
therefore welcome the Government’s 
intention to have a transition period 
beyond March 2019 in which to 
implement the necessary systems  
and processes.

Strategic report AT A GLANCE 02
Our businesses are organised so  
that they are close to the markets 
and customers that they serve.
The group is managed as five business 
segments that bring together common 
industry expertise, operational 
capability and market intelligence. 
Operational decisions are made locally 
because, in our experience, they  
are most successful when made  
by the people who have the best 
understanding of their markets and  
who have to implement them.
The corporate centre aims to provide  
a framework in which our business 
leaders have the freedom and  
decision-making authority to pursue 
opportunities with entrepreneurial flair. 
The centre is small and uses short lines 
of communication to ensure prompt, 
incisive and unambiguous decision-
making. It seeks to ensure that 
business activities are appropriately 
monitored and supported.

08 GROUP BUSINESS MODEL 
AND STRATEGY
BUSINESS STRUCTURE
ASSOCIATED BRITISH 
FOODS IS A DIVERSIFIED 
INTERNATIONAL FOOD, 
INGREDIENTS AND 
RETAIL GROUP The corporate centre agrees 
strategy and budgets with the 
businesses and monitors their 
performance closely.
The group balance sheet is managed 
to ensure long-term financial stability, 
regardless of the state of capital 
markets, and capital funding is made 
available to all of our businesses where 
returns meet or exceed clearly-defined 
criteria. The centre provides selected 
services where the scale of its 
operations enables a more cost-
effective or efficient delivery, where 
expertise that might not be available  
at a business level can be retained  
by the group, or where the provision  
of such services would otherwise 
distract business executives.
Such services include investor relations, 
pensions, insurance, legal support, 
tax and treasury management, where 
specialist expertise is brought together 
in one place for the benefit of the  
group as a whole. The centre also 
co-ordinates selected value-added 
capabilities to support the businesses 
in their local markets such as talent 
management and development, 
procurement, and the sharing of best 
practice in, for example, health and 
safety or engineering risk management. 
We operate to high ethical standards as 
an organisation and expect the same of 
our employees. We encourage an open 
and honest culture in all our dealings 
and ensure that our core values are fully 
implemented throughout the group.
Organic growth is achieved  
through investment in marketing,  
in the development of existing  
and new products and technologies  
and in targeted capital expenditure 
to improve efficiency and  
expand capacity.
We are committed to innovation,  
the continuous pursuit of improvement 
and the maintenance of our efficient 
manufacturing capability.
We aim to operate in a sustainable, 
ethical, efficient and safe manner. 
We have a strong culture of continuing 
operational improvement and focus 
on delivering exceptional quality and 
customer service. The group takes a 
long-term approach to investment and 
is committed to increasing shareholder 
value through sound commercial, 
responsible and sustainable business 
decisions that deliver steady growth 
in earnings and dividends.
Acquisitions are made to complement 
existing business activities and to 
exploit opportunities in adjacent 
markets or geographies.
We believe that an ethical business  
is primarily built by its people,  
not through codes of practice or 
words on a page.
We pride ourselves in being a first-class 
employer and we work actively to 
develop capability and create opportunities 
for employee progression. As a result, 
people tend to stay with the group for  
a long time and build exciting careers. 
Whether through formal training and 
apprenticeships, cross-fertilisation  
of skills between roles, or mentoring,  
we encourage and support everybody 
to thrive at work.
Being part of Associated British Foods 
means being part of a community that 
respects human rights and celebrates 
diversity. We recognise the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights and aim to adhere  
to the core ILO conventions and all 
relevant laws relating to working 
conditions and employment. We strive  
to promote diversity and generate new 
and equal opportunities, a good example 
being our Gender Diversity Task Force 
which has a clear and simple goal:  
‘No Barriers to Talent’. The task force aims 
to optimise talent by embedding practices 
into our core processes that enable 
women to develop on an equal footing  
to their male colleagues. We invest in  
our people to ensure they are equipped 
to deliver and excel at work, with a  
key focus on training and development 
across the group. Business-specific 
examples of such activities are highlighted 
throughout this report and also in our 
2016 Corporate Responsibility Report 
and the 2017 update.

Each of our Grocery businesses pursues 
an independent strategy, appropriate to 
its particular market position and stage  
of development. Some are focused on 
developing brands in their core markets, 
whilst Jordans, Dorset and AB World

All of these businesses are committed  
to the consistent development of  
their brands, and consumer research  
is conducted locally and internationally  
to establish consumer needs and  
ensure appropriately targeted 
investment. Our production facilities  
are well maintained and we take  
a long-term approach to capital 
investment, recognising the merits  
of building for the future. Acquisitions  
are undertaken when opportunities  
are presented to either strengthen  
or complement existing businesses.

12 BUSINESS STRATEGIES AB Agri is a unique group of leading 
agricultural businesses operating across 
the entire food supply chain. It has a 
detailed understanding of agriculture’s 
importance in our changing world and 
the ambition to drive ever greater 
production efficiency has been the  
core philosophy for over 30 years.  
AB Agri operates through individual, 
entrepreneurial businesses empowered 
to grow their interests independently, 
and through a strong network of contacts 
across the entire supply chain.
Organic growth is achieved through 
innovative product development and  
by extending the business’ already broad 
geographic reach into new territories  
and new areas adjacent to its core 
capabilities. Using the diverse breadth  
of products, services and people within 
the AB Agri community, the business 
develops bespoke solutions tailored to its 
customers’ needs. AB Agri will continue 
its successful strategy of seeking to 
make complementary acquisitions to 
strengthen its portfolio of businesses 
and its technical capability. It will also 
continue to collaborate with other 
businesses in the ABF group to harness 
new contacts and technologies.
Our Ingredients businesses are 
dedicated to understanding the key 
requirements of their customers 
and their end-use markets in order 
to ensure a relevant supply of 
ingredients, systems, products and 
technology that create value. They 
develop partnership relationships 
with customers to achieve a genuine 
understanding of their products, 
formulations, equipment and processes 
and the market environment in which  
the products are sold. They aim to grow  
by providing outstanding customer 
service backed by a high level of 
investment in technology, innovation, 
research and development.
Each business has its own business 
model that determines an appropriate 
balance of emphasis across the full  
range of potential sources of competitive 
advantage: innovative and distinctive 
products; an efficient and proprietary set 
of production processes; and compelling 
customer propositions comprising a 
blend of product performance and 
customer specific services.
AB Sugar is one of the world’s largest  
and most diverse sugar producers and 
has a simple vision to be the world’s 
leading sugar business.
Whilst sugar is at the heart of what  
we do, the sugar production process 
provides opportunities to do more  
than simply manufacture an ingredient.  
We are an innovative and advanced 
manufacturer, producing a wide range  
of sugar and co-products. Additionally, 
we are an energy and power supplier 
and, as part of the wider agri-business 
value chain, we are an important 
contributor to the economy across  
all our locations.
Our success has been built on  
continued development and innovation  
to meet the changing needs of our 
customers, to improve our operations 
and to work with our growers to ensure 
sustainable, efficient, agricultural 
production. We seek to drive continuous 
improvement in everything we do and  
are committed to developing our people 
to build capability and capacity across  
all our locations for the future.
Primark offers great value for money 
which it achieves by: incurring no 
advertising costs, instead relying on  
its customers ‘doing the talking’ about  
its products; buying in vast quantities  
and passing on the cost savings to 
customers; keeping overheads to a 
minimum but investing in state-of-the-art 
logistics to enable its stores to replenish 
stocks quickly; and not compromising 
its high-quality standards, rigorously 
testing products at the various stages  
of production.
In the world of fashion it is critical 
that once a style is seen on the fashion 
show catwalk it reaches the stores 
as quickly as possible. It can take as  
little as six weeks from initial design 
concept to being available on shelf, and 
merchandise is sourced from all corners 
of the globe. Although Primark does  
not own the companies or factories that 
produce its merchandise, it recognises 
its responsibility to the workers in those 
factories, and to its customers, to ensure 
that its products are made in good 
working conditions.

Strategic report – operating review EVERYDAY FOOD PRODUCTS  
ENJOYED ALL OVER THE WORLD
Grocery revenue and adjusted 
operating profit from continuing 
businesses, which exclude the results 
of the US herbs and spices business 
sold during the year, were both ahead 
of last year at actual exchange rates. 
Revenue was level with last year at 
constant currency although profit 
was lower. Twinings Ovaltine had 
another good year with excellent 
sales and profit growth. Profits and 
margins improved at ACH in the  
US and at George Weston Foods  
in Australia. However, a very 
competitive UK bread market and 
inflationary cost pressures led to 
lower revenue and margin at  
Allied Bakeries. 
The Twinings brand performed well in  
its major markets. It gained further value 
market share in Australia and the US,  
and good volume growth was achieved 
in black tea in the UK although infusions 
and green tea came under some 
competitive pressure. Significant 
investment in tea packaging technology 
in the UK was completed during the  
year driving production efficiencies and 
enabling the relaunch of infusions with 
an improved format. Last year’s return  
to growth for Ovaltine in Thailand, which 
is its largest market, was sustained, 
driven by a strong increase in ready-to-
drink sales. Further progress was made 
in Switzerland with particular success for 
Ovomaltine brand extensions, and the 
strong sales growth of Crunchy Cream 
over the last few years led to capital 
investment enabling production to be 
brought in-house. 
At Allied Bakeries, the Kingsmill relaunch 
earlier this year was well received by 
consumers. However, with low retail 
prices, a resurgence of lower margin 
own-label products as retailers sought  
to differentiate their bakery offering, and 
inflationary cost pressures all combined 
to result in a significant margin decline. 
Jordans and Dorset Cereals continued 
their international expansion with the 
brands now being sold in 75 countries, 
and overseas sales of Jordans now 
greater than those in the UK. Country 
Crisp and the launch of Frusli bars drove 
strong sales growth in France and further 
success was achieved in Australia where 
the brands lead the growing granola 
market. Trading conditions in the UK 
were more challenging for Ryvita with  
a larger crispbread market share being 
taken by own-label driven by the growth 
of the European retail discounters. 
Westmill Foods recently announced  
a further expansion of noodle production 
capacity at its Manchester factory, 
responding to increased demand, and  
a continuing focus on overhead reduction 
led to a rationalisation of its distribution 
operations. Patak’s and Blue Dragon are 
the leaders in their respective categories 
in the UK and both performed well  
this year. Blue Dragon underwent a 
significant re-branding and both achieved 
further growth in international markets. 
We acquired two small sports  
nutrition brands during the year:  
HIGH5, a hydration and recovery brand  
with leading positions in the UK and 
Scandinavia; and Reflex Nutrition,  
a premium, protein-based, strength  
and recovery brand. Sports nutrition  
has grown strongly in recent years 
reflecting healthier, more active, 
consumer lifestyles. The two brands 
have annual sales of some £20m and 
production will be rationalised into one 
site, in Brighton, by the end of this 
calendar year.
On 12 October 2017 we completed the 
acquisition of Acetum S.p.A., the leading 
Italian producer of Balsamic Vinegar  
of Modena for €317m including debt 
assumed. These vinegars have been 
granted European Protected Geographical 
Indication status due to the unique nature 
of their production, their provenance  
and high quality.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY The ‘Karen’ are an ethnic  
group originating primarily from 
Myanmar. Tens of thousands  
have become refugees due to 
persecution in their native country.
Some 11,000 Karen refugees have  
made their way to Australia with  
1,000 resettling and building a new 
community in the regional town of 
Bendigo, 35 kilometres from the Don 
meat factory at Castlemaine, Victoria. 
Don has been working to reduce its 
dependence on casual labour by 
creating more permanent positions 
at the Castlemaine site where  
ongoing skills can be developed 
through a more reliable and  
permanent workforce. 
This has included proactively  
exploring, with local communities  
and government bodies, how best  
to source people for these positions.
As part of a trial with the local state 
government recruitment agency,  
a small number of Karen people  
were included as part of an initial 
recruitment intake. They were a 
resounding success. Managers 
praised their work ethic and 
commitment to the organisation  
and the Karen people had access  
to permanent work to assist them  
with their assimilation into the local 
community. It was a great match.
To date Don has recruited 40 Karen 
people with immediate plans for  
a further 20, and more thereafter.  
In order to facilitate their transition, 
induction materials have been 
translated into the Karen language  
with translators on hand during  
the induction process. 
This has been a rewarding experience 
for Don, fulfilling its need for more 
permanent local labour while 
continuing to invest in and support  
the local community.

1,000 Strategic report – operating review
The Don smallgoods business  
in Australia has consistently 
demonstrated its ability to 
drive increased consumption 
and category profitability for its 
customers through the strength 
of the Don brand, its superior 
category management skills 
and a strong engagement with 
customers across all functions 
and levels. 
A twin-pronged approach of driving 
increased purchase of everyday  
items through a strong pre-packaged 
offering, coupled with a premium 
range to be sold at in-store delicatessen 
counters have resulted in Don growing 
sales strongly over the last three years.
During the last year the business  
has partnered with Coles, one  
of Australia’s leading supermarkets,  
to deliver a major change in Deli ham. 
In what has been nicknamed  
‘The Ham Revolution’ a new range  
of clearly differentiated hams was 
introduced with a ‘good, better, best’ 
tiering. All nine hams in the range  
have their own positioning and reason 
for being, providing consumers with  
more choice, and, with reinvigorated 
merchandising, the Don product 
offering within Coles has been  
brought to life. 
To make sure the excitement of this 
new initiative was followed through 
in-store, 58 two-hour engagement 
sessions were held in 25 locations 
nationally. Over five days, 700 Deli 
managers were introduced to ‘The  
Ham Revolution’, with more remote 
stores utilising an e-learning module  
to ensure they were fully informed.  
A ‘Ham Hotline’ was created to 
respond to any questions and the 
launch was supported by a strong 
in-store merchandising programme 
including badges and hats for the  
Deli team, posters and a variety  
of display features.
This project saw Don working closely 
with several teams within the Coles 
business, including Merchandising, 
Replenishment and Supply, to ensure 
the success of this groundbreaking 
initiative. Over five months, weekly 
meetings were held to ensure 
alignment around all aspects of what 
proved to be an excellent launch.  
Great work was done to reduce 
packaging and raw material sourcing 
timelines to meet launch deadlines – 
free-range ham was even available  
in the Deli three weeks earlier than 
expected! In the first three months 
some 212,000 cartons were ordered 
with a 99% customer service level. 
Latest store sales data indicates a 
significant level of category growth 
and Coles’ ‘voice of the consumer’ 
insights are very positive.
The level of engagement between 
Don and Coles around ‘The Ham 
Revolution’ was nothing short of 
‘Hamazing’ and set a new benchmark 
for excellence. Coles were so  
pleased with the project that it was 
nominated for three trophies at their 
annual Supplier Awards, and was 
successful in the Supply Chain 
Excellence category.
A CUT 
ABOVE
 THE REST
Acetum was founded by Cesare  
Mazzetti and Marco Bombarda, both  
of whom will remain in the business,  
and its brands include Mazzetti,  
the leading brand in Germany and 
Australia, as well as Acetum and Fini. 
Its products are sold in more than 60 
countries and, in the year ended 31 
December 2016, generated net sales 
of €102m. This business will benefit 
from the group’s existing capability in 
selling and marketing speciality foods 
internationally and we have ambitious 
plans to grow. 
We completed the sale of ACH’s  
herbs and spices business in the US  
on 21 November 2016 for a gross 
cash consideration of £294m. 
Operating profit at ACH’s continuing 
operations were well ahead of last 
year driven by higher revenue and 
lower overheads. Mazola increased 
its market share, with continued 
support from its successful television 
advertising, and consumer yeast, corn 
syrup and corn starch all performed 
well both in retail and foodservice. 
Margins improved again this year at 
George Weston Foods in Australia  
where cost management delivered 
significant operational efficiencies and 
overhead reduction. Tip Top achieved 
strong listings of Thins, a product new  
to the Australian market, which was 
launched during the year. The Don  
KRC meat business continued to 
grow volumes and worked closely 
with key customers to develop the 
category as exemplified by the 
introduction of a much improved deli 
ham range for Coles Supermarkets.

18 GROCERY AB World Foods’ Blue Dragon 
brand is the clear leader in the 
UK Ambient Oriental category, 
having established a strong 
position over 40 years since  
its launch in 1977.
Over the years the product range  
has developed to meet consumers’ 
changing expectations and today the 
line-up comprises a wide range of 
products including Chinese, Thai and 
Japanese cuisines. Whereas, in the 
early days, the main comparison might 
have been with the local Chinese 
takeaway, today increasing numbers  
of people are travelling to Asia and 
bringing back their experiences with  
a desire to recreate the dishes they  
have discovered and enjoyed.
This was the challenge presented to  
the Blue Dragon marketing team – the 
recipes were exciting and vibrant but 
this wasn’t matched by the packaging 
which was more reminiscent of 
traditional China. Several elements of 
the packaging had also been copied  
by others and it no longer stood out  
on shelf. A totally new identity for the  
Blue Dragon brand was developed  
which captures the excitement of 
today’s Asian cuisines, but in a way  
that is unmistakably Blue Dragon.  
This new design, which was introduced 
from early 2017, is now unmissable  
on the shelves of supermarkets and 
convenience stores across the UK,  
and has been greeted by a very  
positive consumer response.

Strategic report – operating review
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Associated British Foods plc Consumers increasingly want to be  
more involved in cooking meals for 
themselves and for their families, but in 
many cases they have neither sufficient 
time nor expertise to deliver a quality 
result. Patak’s has therefore launched  
a range of 3-step kits which include the 
necessary ingredients and step-by-step 
instructions to preparing a curry that is 
guaranteed to taste fabulous. 
Patak’s 3-step kits include a number  
of components: a variety of individual  
dry spices; pastes of blended authentic 
spices preserved in oil; and specially 
developed finishing sauces, which 
together combine to provide an involving 
and rewarding experience for home 
chefs. Patak’s has taken the hard  
work out of ingredient preparation  
and because it has expertly blended  
and balanced all the ingredients,  
the 3-step kits deliver a fantastic 
flavoured dish every time. 
Patak’s is a strong leader of the 
ambient Indian category and  
has delivered sustained growth 
over a number of years. 
An important way of ensuring  
continuing growth is keeping our  
brands relevant to consumers’  
evolving tastes and needs through  
the development of new products.  
This includes offering consumers  
new ways to enjoy authentic tasting 
Indian cuisine that suit them.

A unique blend of English 
heritage, quality and innovation  
is keeping Twinings at the top  
of the tea table. 
Much-loved blends
The Earl Grey and English Breakfast 
blends remain the best-known teas 
behind Twinings’ worldwide fame.  
Earl Grey, created by Twinings in  
1831, and English Breakfast, which 
followed a century later, are now  
sold in 117 countries. 
Exquisite black teas
Twinings builds on the devotion for its 
heritage blends with the introduction  
of other exquisite teas. January 2017,  
for example, marked the introduction  
of a new Morning Tea in Australia,  
where Twinings is already market leader. 
Intense national interest in this full-bodied 
Ceylon-based tea was boosted by a  
high profile ‘Twinings Design Challenge’, 
which involved 33 inspirational Australian 
women competing to design  
the packaging. 
Innovative promotion
The winning pack design, featuring  
a ballerina, by Australian TV presenter 
Carrie Bickmore, was revealed at a 
celebrity-packed Sydney Harbour event 
and projected across the harbour.  
More than 80,000 people voted for  
their favourite, with around 1.5 million 
sharing the result on social media. 
A contribution from each sale of  
Morning Tea over the next four years  
will go to the winner’s own charity, 
Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer.
Such innovative promotion has  
been key to Twinings’ global growth, 
particularly in conveying the message 
that, despite its exceptional quality,  
the 311-year-old brand’s tea is not  
just for special occasions. 
Attracting new consumers
Another central factor in Twinings’ 
ongoing success has been its ability  
to attract devotees of non-black tea – 
particularly younger consumers –  
to less traditional brews. 
Its herbal and fruit infusions and green 
teas – including such combinations as 
mango and lychee, orange and lotus 
flower, and ginger and buttermint  
among many new blends – have brought 
new generations to the ever-broadening 
brand offering.

Strategic report – operating review About Sugar
AB Sugar is a leading producer of 
sugar and sugar-derived co-products 
in southern Africa, the UK, Spain, 
and north China. We operate 24 plants  
in ten countries with the capacity to 
produce some 4.5 million tonnes of 
sugar and around 600 million litres of 
ethanol annually and are a significant 
employer. Our products are sold into 
industry sectors including food and drink, 
pharmaceutical, industrial, agricultural, 
power and energy.
In the EU, Azucarera is the largest 
producer in Iberia and British Sugar is  
the sole processor of the UK sugar beet 
crop. Illovo Sugar is the biggest sugar 
processor in Africa and in June 2016, 
ABF acquired full ownership putting  
both AB Sugar and Illovo Sugar into a 
stronger position to navigate the complex 
sugar landscape whilst capitalising on 
Africa’s growth market. We have a beet  
sugar business in north China that has  
achieved a strong record of performance 
improvement in agriculture and 
production efficiencies. We also operate 
one of Europe’s largest bioethanol 
producers based in the UK, serving half  
of the UK’s demand for bioethanol. 
Our success has been built on continued 
development and innovation to meet  
the changing needs of our customers,  
to improve our operations and to work  
with our growers to ensure sustainable, 
efficient agricultural production.
As a global business, we operate 
in a diverse and continually changing 
environment with many opportunities  
and challenges. Although we have 
a global portfolio, we operate with 
a local heart, working together to 
do what is right for the location and 
market. As we evolve to meet the 
world’s changing needs – customers, 
growers and others – it is our role to 
ensure we use resources responsibly, 
build strong rural economies and  
ensure thriving healthy communities.
By drawing upon everything we have 
learnt over many decades as a sugar 
producer, we continue to embrace 
innovation and strive to create more from 
less by working collaboratively across  
our group and with our stakeholders.

A WORLD-LEADING SUGAR  
BUSINESS FOCUSED ON EXCELLENCE
AB Sugar’s revenue and adjusted 
operating profit from continuing 
businesses, which exclude the  
results of the south China cane  
sugar business sold during the year, 
were substantially ahead of last  
year. The main drivers were higher  
EU sugar prices, lower UK beet costs, 
increased production and sales 
volumes at Illovo, and a further major 
contribution from the performance 
improvement programme across the 
group. We changed the Illovo financial 
year end in 2016 to align it with that 
of the group and this year’s results 
therefore included a full 12 months’ 
performance compared to 11 months 
last year.
The performance improvement 
programme comprises continuous cost 
reduction and business development 
delivered through production efficiencies, 
capital investment and procurement 
activities. The importance of anticipating 
and responding to the changing needs of 
our customers and their end consumers 
is well understood, and the long-awaited 
structural changes to the EU sugar 
industry, which are now upon us,  
have provided an added stimulus over 
recent years. Our businesses have been 
preparing for this with a thorough review 
of all aspects of their operations, from 
capabilities and processes through  
to routes to market and pack formats.  
The programme has generated initiatives 
across a range of disciplines and there 
are many still to pursue. 
UK profitability improved significantly. 
Sugar production of 900,000 tonnes  
in the 2016/17 year was abnormally low 
as a consequence of the reduction in  
the contracted growing area in order to 
reduce the high level of stocks brought 
forward from the prior year. EU stocks 
were at a low level at the end of this 
marketing year and, in anticipation of the 
abolition of quota and export restrictions 
from October 2017, our contracted area 
for the 2017/18 season was increased  
by a third. The crop has developed well, 
with favourable rainfall and temperatures 
during the growing season, and the latest 
sugar production estimate for 2017/18  
is in excess of 1.4 million tonnes. 
EU sugar prices for 2017/18 will be  
below those achieved this year although 
the profit impact for British Sugar is 
expected, to some extent, to be 
mitigated by the higher production 
volumes and the benefit of euro strength 
against sterling on euro-denominated 
sales. Beet costs will be in line with  
this year.
In Spain, profit was well ahead of  
last year with an increase in sugar 
production and higher EU sugar prices. 
Although beet sugar production of 
362,000 tonnes was lower than last 
year’s 449,000 tonnes, the Guadalete 
refinery produced 300,000 tonnes,  
and imported raw sugars co-refined  
at the beet factories produced a further  
30,000 tonnes. Next year we expect 
lower EU sugar prices to reduce the 
profit at Azucarera.
In China, we completed the sale  
of our five cane sugar factories on  
22 December 2016 for total proceeds, 
including debt assumed, of £297m.  
Our continuing operations now comprise 
two beet factories in north China at 
Zhangbei and Qianqi. These factories 
processed a record beet crop with 
180,000 tonnes of sugar produced 
although sucrose yields were lower  
than in recent years. Market prices  
have been stable and profit was ahead  
of last year. Looking ahead to 2017/18,  
the crop is progressing well with a 
smaller growing area to enable the 
optimisation of processing efficiency. 
Sucrose yields are expected to improve 
as a result of the work undertaken with 
growers to increase mechanisation of 
their agricultural operations and improve 
beet storage methods. Sugar production 
is estimated at over 170,000 tonnes.

Enabling
our employees
to develop
insight
and share AB Sugar’s International 
Experience Programme (IEP) is 
enriching the capabilities of our 
businesses and our people.
The IEP provides an opportunity  
for employees from our core factory 
operations or agriculture functions to 
work for up to six months in another 
part of our business in a different 
country. It is open to people with 
development potential at any age  
or career stage. Reflecting our 
international footprint, since the 
programme’s 2012 launch, participants 
have come from Africa, China, Spain 
and the UK. 
All-round benefits 
The IEP offers major benefits for  
our people. Employees learn about  
a new part of AB Sugar; experience  
a different culture; develop their 
language skills, technical ability and 
personal resilience; and extend and 
strengthen their internal networks. 
Among their new contacts will  
be a support team established by  
AB Sugar for each participant, including 
home and host line managers and  
a dedicated local ‘buddy’.
The business also benefits from the 
IEP through the transfer of knowledge 
between operations, the ongoing 
collaboration enabled by expanded 
networks and the development and 
increased engagement of employees. 
Participants’ identification of 
cost-saving or profit-making initiatives  
in their host country, or on return  
to their home business, has also 
delivered significant returns.
Overall, the opportunities that the IEP 
opens up for individuals and the wider 
company are supporting AB Sugar’s 
foundations and building capability  
for the future to deliver even greater 
performance improvement in a more 
competitive environment.
AN EXCHANGE PROGRAMME THAT 
ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO DEVELOP  
AND INSIGHT TO BE DISTRIBUTED 
THROUGHOUT THE BUSINESS
Since the launch in
2012
participants have come from 
Africa, China, Spain and the UK Associated British Foods plc
AB Sugar operates in a diverse 
and continually changing 
environment with many 
opportunities and challenges. 
The period since June 2013, when  
the European Council of Ministers 
confirmed that existing quota 
arrangements in the EU would cease  
on 30 September 2017, has been  
one of the most significant in the  
sugar industry’s history.
We enter this new era 
post-deregulation with confidence, 
having built upon our continued 
development and innovation  
to meet the changing needs of  
our customers, by improving our 
operations and by working with 
growers to drive sustainable,  
efficient agricultural production. 
In part, we have achieved this  
by introducing a performance 
improvement programme (PIP) that 
we launched in 2009, recognising  
that the competitive environment  
was only going to get tougher. Our 
first step was to determine a template 
for the fit and nimble group we aspired  
to be, by benchmarking ourselves 
extensively against internal and 
external models of best practice. 
Setting ambitious goals 
Having established ambitious  
goals for our group, in 2011 we  
began a four-stage programme  
to achieve them:
•  we empowered our people to 
identify, execute and maintain  
local projects that reduced costs, 
improved processes and enhanced 
operational performance. To enable 
this, we invested extensively in 
training, for example in ‘Lean’ 
production techniques which aimed 
to increase value for customers by 
making businesses more efficient 
and responsive to market needs,  
whilst reducing waste; 
•  we then tackled transformational 
projects that simplified and improved 
business processes. These projects 
tended to be large in scale, had a 
step-change impact and required  
low capital investment;
•  capital expenditure was our next 
area of focus. Deepening our already 
exacting scrutiny of investments,  
we ensured that all capital projects, 
whether related to land, buildings, 
machinery or equipment, all 
delivered strong financial returns  
to the business; and
•  we launched a global procurement 
process to increase profit through 
the implementation of a variety of 
best practice principles. This resulted 
in group-wide visibility of purchasing 
which delivered significant economies 
of scale.
A culture of continuous 
improvement 
By being open minded about just  
how much we could possibly  
achieve and by making a long-term 
commitment, we have had time  
to embed the PIP process across  
the group. International employee 
exchanges, centres of excellence, 
networking and deployment of 
projects on a group-wide basis have  
all helped ensure good practice is 
shared consistently and effectively 
and, as our pipeline of future  
projects testifies, PIP has become  
self-sustaining. Continuous 
improvement is now part of our 
culture; we are a more efficient  
and customer-focused organisation 
and have delivered substantial cost 
and performance benefits across  
each of our businesses.
“ We enter this new era 
post-deregulation with  
confidence, having built upon  
our continued development  
and innovation to meet  
the changing needs of  
our customers.” 
CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS
Sugar production at Illovo was  
1.65 million tonnes, compared with  
1.40 million tonnes last year on a 
comparable basis, following better 
growing conditions in the new  
season, particularly in South Africa  
and Swaziland. As a consequence,  
sales were strong and we continued  
to improve our consumer offering in 
Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania with  
an extended range of pack sizes  
and enhanced point of sale materials. 
Combined with the continuing 
performance improvement activities, 
profit was ahead of last year. The new 
refining and sugar conditioning plant  
in Zambia, which was commissioned  
last year, operated well during the  
year. This facility provides the capacity  
to meet the growing demand for  
more refined sugars in the local  
and regional markets. 
Further improvement in throughput  
and reliability was made during the  
year at the Vivergo Fuels bioethanol 
plant, although an operating loss was 
driven by higher UK wheat costs  
and lower ethanol prices. The UK 
Government produced its response  
to the consultation on renewables in 
transport fuels on 14 September 2017 
and proposed that the percentage  
of transport fuel from renewable 
sources would increase from its 
current level of 4.75% to 9.75% by 
2020. The crop-based component  
of this would be capped at 4% until 
2020, declining to 3% by 2026 and 
2% by 2032. Whilst we support the 
increase in the renewables mandate 
we are concerned about the 
reduction in the crop cap after 2020 
and will maintain a close dialogue 
with government on this.

26 SUGAR How we started
Founded in 1871, Germains Seed 
Technology develops innovative, 
industry-leading conventional and 
organic solutions for sugar beet, 
vegetables and flower seeds. It 
specialises in a range of seed-borne 
technologies including priming, 
pelleting, filmcoating and health. 
Germains offers a wide range of 
benefits to growers such as faster 
crop emergence, increased plant 
uniformity (allowing easier harvest), 
higher yields and better protection 
against a variety of diseases and 
pests. Using such technologies 
reduces the need for chemical 
spraying, controls dust release into 
the environment and also the amount 
of chemical required to treat the crop. 
Germains is one of the  
world’s leading seed technology 
suppliers with facilities in  
the UK, the Netherlands,  
Spain and North America.  
It works closely with partners, 
stakeholders and customers to 
ensure long-term, sustainable 
and profitable growth. 
Transforming our business model 
Since the 1940s Germains has 
pioneered the use of seed treatment 
technology for sugar beet. Working 
closely with seed companies, 
Germains has developed a range  
of products (Advantage
®
, Xbeet
®
  
and Xbeet
®
plus) which increase  
crop yield by at least 10% compared 
with untreated seed. 
While continuing to invest in sugar 
beet and maintaining its strong 
position in the market, over the last 
five years Germains has accelerated 
the development of its horticulture 
business which now accounts for 50% 
of its operations and covers a wide 
range of crops, particularly lettuce, 
onion, celery and Swiss chard. 
Working closely with its customers, 
the business invests heavily in 
research and development (R&D) 
to deliver optimised and unique 
solutions that allow growers to 
maximise the potential from  
all seeds. 
Investing in the future
The increased focus on horticulture 
has been driven by significant R&D 
investment across Europe and North 
America. In 2012, an R&D centre was 
established in Enzhuizen, at the centre 
of the Dutch horticulture industry,  
the so-called ‘Seed Valley’.
In 2015, R&D capability was further 
enhanced with investment in the 
Norwich Research Park in the UK. 
Adjacent to many leading research 
institutions, this facility works 
predominantly on researching the 
molecular development of the seed  
to understand how this can be 
influenced by novel seed treatments. 
This year has seen further investment 
in people and equipment in the North 
American business and in Growth 
Rooms near the Kings Lynn facility  
in the UK. These are controlled 
environment facilities which allow 
accelerated R&D activity and will 
further increase the speed to market 
of Germains’ new products. 
79 billion
In 2016/17 Germains processed  
79 billion sugar beet seeds and  
110 billion horticulture seeds

Germains treats over 40  
different species of seeds
Innovation in action
The recently launched North 
American product, ProBio
®
 
SafeGuard™, is a great example of 
how Germains introduces innovative 
technology with the benefit of 
customer insight. By working in 
partnership with industry bodies  
and in close co-operation with seed 
companies, growers and distributors, 
emerging problems can be identified 
and addressed. 
Over the last 10 years, the majority of 
organic spinach growers experienced 
problems caused by a soil borne 
pathogen, Pythium Ultimum, and 
were unable to meet consumer 
demand for fresh spinach for the 
salad industry. In infected fields, 
growers were losing 10–40% of the 
seed they planted due to the disease. 
Working with industry partners, 
Germains developed a unique 
product solution which targets early 
plant protection – Pythium damage 
typically takes place in the first  
14 days after planting. ProBio
®
 
SafeGuard™ establishes a barrier 
around the emerging plant  
and its developing root system that 
protects the plant during germination 
and first leaf stage. This allows a 
greater establishment of the plants 
resulting in a much improved yield.
There are over 35,000 spinach  
seeds in 1 lb and Germains utilises 
rotary film coating technology  
to coat a precise application of seed 
protection chemistry to each one.  
The seeds rotate at 30–40 rpm and 
get coated with a fine mist of the seed 
technology product. The fast rotation 
and the application of the fine mist 
evenly distribute the seed coating, 
while the air movement quickly  
dries the seeds to keep them from 
sticking together.

Strategic report – operating review
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Associated British Foods plc Our Malawian sugar business 
has successfully responded  
to challenges in European and 
regional African markets by 
transforming its commercial and 
marketing operations to focus  
on strong sales growth at home.
With EU preferential markets for bulk 
raws becoming less attractive, and with 
lower prices per tonne and increasing 
competition, Illovo Sugar refocused  
on maximising the best opportunity  
for growth in the Malawian domestic 
market by improving the structuring  
of the product range, pricing and brand 
execution for the Malawian consumer 
and retailer customers.
Increasing domestic sales
Illovo’s growth strategy aims to 
accelerate revenue growth by building 
stronger links with, and understanding of, 
domestic retailers and end-consumers. 
This is a new direction for the business in 
Malawi, where we formerly concentrated 
entirely on large distributors in the 
fragmented wholesale market.
To gain greater insight into Malawian 
consumers – many of whom have had 
their already low disposable income 
squeezed by extreme weather and a 
deteriorating economy – we launched  
an extensive programme to reshape  
our brand, products, price points and 
promotional activity. In re-engineering 
our commercial approach, we drew  
on extensive market research, 
interviewing hundreds of consumers, 
retailers and wholesalers, in both  
urban and rural settings.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
28 SUGAR Improving our route to market
The repositioning of our Malawian 
route-to-market approach has included:
• introducing a larger and stronger 
commercial team to drive sales, 
support retailers and resellers and 
maintain good levels of availability  
in the market;
• satisfying demand for smaller, 
lower-cost bags of sugar by launching 
220g and 500g packs, to complement 
the existing 1kg and 2kg packs;
• fortifying all products with Vitamin A  
in line with the Malawian Government’s 
campaign to reduce infant and maternal 
mortality; and
•  launching a more robust packaging 
design, backed by high-profile retail 
displays and nationwide advertising. 
The new brand packaging recognises 
and celebrates Malawians’ strong 
sense of national pride and heritage, 
featuring local language and imagery.
Strategic insights
The programme’s insights and its impact 
on the Malawian supply chain will further 
inform how the Illovo group improves the 
route to market in neighbouring Zambia 
and Tanzania. It will also contribute to our 
overall strategy of being a world-class 
and highly efficient organisation, 
operating in Africa.
The Illovo team’s efforts in providing  
‘an improved, secure and safe supply  
of sugar in sizes to accommodate  
difficult daily challenges’ won them 
second place in a Chartered Institute  
of Customer Management’s  
service excellence award.

31 ADDING VALUE BY IMPROVING 
THE SUSTAINABILITY OF 
FOOD PRODUCTION
AB Agri revenues were well  
ahead of last year with growth in  
all businesses and the benefit of  
a full year’s trading from Agrokorn 
which was acquired last year. 
Adjusted operating profit was, 
however, lower than last year  
mainly reflecting reduced margins  
in China and UK feeds, as a result  
of strong competition and higher  
raw material costs, and an increase  
in investment in new business 
opportunities.
Demand for feed in the UK was  
weak and the smaller sugar beet crop 
reduced co-product volumes. New  
liquid co-products from Vivergo’s  
biofuel production were developed for  
the animal feed and anaerobic digestion 
(AD) markets which partly offset the 
reduced availability of co-products from 
the food and drink industry. Our AD plant 
in Yorkshire was commissioned during 
the year enabling sales of new AD 
products and services under the Amur 
brand. A smaller UK wheat crop and  
low market volatility adversely affected 
Frontier’s grain trading performance,  
but firmer grain pricing and good growing 
conditions contributed to a strong result 
from its crop inputs business.
In Asia, AB Vista performed well with 
higher enzyme revenues although the 
market weakened in the second half 
after a strong start. Margin and profit 
reduced in China as a result of a more 
challenging environment as evidenced  
by egg prices falling to their lowest  
level in 20 years. Our feed mill in 
Shanghai was relocated to a new site 
with increased capacity. Our first 
standalone feed pre-mix site in China  
is now operational, addressing the 
growing demand for specialist,  
tailored ingredients.

In continental Europe, starter feeds 
imported into Poland from our Primary 
Diets business in the UK achieved 
excellent growth, and construction  
of the new starter feed factory in  
Spain was completed by the year  
end. AB Vista performed well both  
in Europe and North America, driving  
strong enzyme sales, and progress  
was made beyond the traditional pig  
and poultry sectors in both ruminant  
and aquaculture markets. Last year’s 
acquisition of Agrokorn, a Danish 
producer of animal nutrition products, 
premixes and milk replacers, extended 
our capability in alternative proteins and 
created a platform for further product 
development and geographic expansion. 
This business is now well integrated  
into our existing operations.
AB Agri’s extensive experience across 
the farming industry, combined with  
the greater availability of on-farm data 
and the use of proprietary technology,  
are being leveraged to provide greater 
insight into on-farm management.  
This is aimed at assisting farmers to 
increase productivity and improve  
animal nutrition.

Following the pilot,  
the programme will be 
rolled out across AB Agri’s Evolution through innovation
AB Agri continues to evolve its 
operations through innovation, as 
exemplified in its latest venture which 
uses a co-product from one of ABF’s 
other operations, Vivergo Fuels, to 
create value – and power – in another, 
Amur, an anaerobic digestion business 
that was launched last year.
AB Agri has an established relationship 
with Vivergo’s bioethanol plant in Hull  
as AB Connect already sells a quality 
animal feed co-product from biofuel 
production. The business is now 
successfully channelling a liquid 
co-product from Vivergo to feed a  
large number of anaerobic digesters 
through the Amur business. 
Environmental and business benefits
The liquid, which is made up of wheat 
proteins, fibres and yeast extracts,  
is produced during the fermentation/
distillation stage of bioethanol 
production. A proportion of this liquid  
was previously sent to landfill, at a cost 
to both the environment and the Vivergo 
business. However, using our expertise  
in livestock nutrition to analyse the 
liquid, we identified that its nutrient 
profile would help drive cost-effective 
gas production in anaerobic digestion. 
Since March 2016, in the region  
of 60,000 tonnes of the co-product  
has been marketed into a range  
of anaerobic digestion plants that  
generate power for the National Grid.
In our own Amur operation we have 
also produced a new organic fertiliser 
from the digestate which we now sell. 
This provides an offset for some of  
the carbon produced at our feed mills.
Identification of the potential value  
of the liquid’s composition reflects  
AB Agri’s ability to adapt its core nutrition 
expertise to new, developing markets.  
It also adds to its track record of deriving 
profit from co-products and evolving  
its traditional animal feed business  
into new markets, thereby helping to 
maintain its market leadership.

The purchase of Danish 
company, Agrokorn, has  
brought new vigour to AB Agri’s 
alternative proteins operation, 
which was formed as an  
AB Agri new venture in 2014.
Since launch, the small team has 
worked with experts from across the 
AB Agri group to develop a strong 
presence in the fast-growing alternative 
proteins sector. The acquisition and 
development of Agrokorn marked  
a significant step forward.
When AB Agri bought Agrokorn in spring 
2016 it was already a strong player in its 
native Denmark. Since then, AB Agri  
has helped transform the business  
and its core alternative protein product, 
AlphaSoy (Agrokorn’s flagship brand),  
to reach new levels. 
Team members from alternative  
proteins and the AB Agri group worked 
with Agrokorn to improve AlphaSoy  
to deliver better performance and 
overcome export constraints and  
open up new markets. As a result,  
the business has already expanded its 
international reach beyond Denmark  
into Asia, the US and Central America. 
AGRICULTURE 34 The success of Agrokorn’s 
development in such a short time

applying its world-leading nutritional 
expertise to evolve products, and 
providing the investment to make 
expansion possible, it is turning  
exciting opportunities into major

Ingredients’ revenues and adjusted 
operating profit were again well 
ahead of last year with a further 
increase in margin.
AB Mauri delivered another year of 
significant improvement with growth 
achieved in yeast and bakery ingredients. 
North America benefited from successful 
bakery ingredient product launches 
although the market for bakery yeast 
remains highly competitive. The business 
was well represented at the International 
Baking Industry Exposition held last 
October where it promoted its baking 
technology credentials to attendees from 
more than 100 countries. The EMEA 
region delivered profit growth and Asia’s 
results improved following last year’s 
rationalisation of production facilities  
in China. Although the economic climate  
in South America remains challenging, 
operating performance was robust. 
Capital investment in a new bakery 
ingredients plant in Buenos Aires  
was completed at the end of the  
financial year.
In January 2017 we completed  
the acquisition of Specialty Blending  
based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The  
plant features multiple blending lines  
capable of handling whole-grain bread 
concentrates and sweet goods mixes.  
It also has a speciality mill of a scale 
suited for ancient and organic grains  
and custom blends. Integration of the 
business has progressed well with 
improvements in its cake and doughnut 
mixes from the application of our 
ingredients’ technologies.
ABF Ingredients delivered strong  
sales and profit growth with margin 
improvement driven by a higher 
proportion of revenues from premium 
markets. Higher enzyme sales, especially 
feed enzymes to AB Vista, drove high 
factory utilisation and improved overhead 
absorption. We completed the capacity 
expansion of the enzymes manufacturing 
facility in Finland which has also improved 
production efficiency. 
Significant growth in food and beverage 
nutritional applications, as well as 
branded and generic pharmaceutical 
drugs, drove another year of strong  
sales growth at Abitec, our speciality 
lipids business in North America.  
Further investment was made at the 
Janesville, Wisconsin plant to meet 
increasing demand and to improve our 
research capability. SPI also benefited 
from developments in the pharmaceutical 
sector with good growth for its functional 
excipients and drug delivery solutions. 
Our US protein extrusion business 
gained from the consumer trend for 
healthy snacking, and achieved margin 
growth through improvement in 
manufacturing yields.

across our
business AB Enzymes operates across  
a number of territories, making  
it difficult for its employees to 
participate in centralised activities 
designed to support women.
The business therefore chose  
to establish a Women’s Business 
Forum with the objective of helping  
its female employees advance their 
careers. Meetings are scheduled 
quarterly to coincide with other 
business events to increase 
attendance and minimise travel. 
Members unable to attend in  
person can join by Webex.
The Forum acts as a focal point for 
women to come together and gain a 
better understanding of the business. 
It also allows them to build a network 
of contacts with whom they can  
share information and experience.
The Forum has now been running  
for two years and has proved very 
successful. Issues discussed have 
ranged from how to create an 
effective personal development plan, 
to what to consider if working in a lab 
while pregnant. The Forum has also 
encouraged women to discuss and 
debate issues to be raised with the 
senior leadership team, giving them  
a stronger voice within AB Enzymes.

Our joint-venture manufacturing  
facility at Rajamäki in Finland, part of  
the Roal enzymes business, is now at 
full production following completion  
of an extensive eight-year, three-phase 
expansion programme.
The first phase was commissioned  
in April 2009 to increase fermentation 
capacity and was followed, in 2013,  
by Phase II which focused on delivering 
utilities and services for future expansion. 
With the completion of Phase III in August 
this year, the business has increased  
its fermentation capacity further and 
significantly reduced its operating costs  
and environmental footprint.
Phase III of the project started in September 
2015, primarily to meet the ever-increasing 
demand for Roal’s enzymes, particularly 
animal feed, detergent and bakery enzymes, 
in a sustainable and efficient way. New 
buildings, additional fermenters, an industry-
leading filtration system and increased 
storage capacity were added, the ERP 
system was expanded and downstream 
processing equipment was upgraded to 
improve the plant’s core processes.
This was a complex project requiring the 
considerable expertise of a dedicated project 
team and the use of cutting-edge solutions 
to overcome a series of technical challenges, 
not the least of which was to maintain 
production during the project without 
disruption to customer service. As many as 
125 third-party contractors worked on site at 
any one time which added health, safety and 
environmental complexity. The commitment 
to planning, and the dedication of the 
Technical and Health and Safety teams 
contributed immeasurably to the safety  
of all those who worked on the project.
With all three phases of Rajamäki’s 
expansion now complete, Roal has 
increased enzyme production capacity, 
lowered operational costs, created more 
jobs and made the facility an even safer  
and more efficient place to work.

Strategic report – operating review About Retail
Primark is one of the largest clothing 
retailers in Europe. It has 345 stores  
and employs 73,000 people in the UK, 
Republic of Ireland, Spain, Portugal, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Austria, France, Italy and the US.  
It was founded in June 1969 in the 
Republic of Ireland where it continues  
to trade as Penneys.
Primark’s organic growth has been 
achieved through a combination of 
like-for-like growth and increasing selling 
space. The like-for-like growth reflects 
investment in buying, merchandising and 
our success in constantly refreshing the 
stores to ensure they remain exciting 
places to shop. The increase in selling 
space has been driven by capital 
investment in freehold and leasehold 
properties as they have become 
available, first on the high streets of  
the UK and Ireland, and more recently  
on the high streets and in the shopping 
centres of continental Europe and the 
US. 2006 saw Primark’s first foray into 
continental Europe with the opening of  
a store in Madrid and it now operates 
from over 13 million sq ft of selling  
space across 11 countries.
With a unique combination of the 
latest fashion and lean operations, 
Primark offers customers quality, 
up-to-the-minute designs at value-for-
money prices. Buying and merchandising 
teams travel internationally to source  
and buy garments that best reflect  
each season’s key fashion trends. 
Primark’s range includes womenswear, 
lingerie, childrenswear, menswear, 
footwear, accessories, hosiery,  
beauty and homeware.

Strategic report – operating review QUALITY, UP-TO-THE  
MINUTE-DESIGNS AT  
VALUE-FOR-MONEY PRICES
Sales at Primark were 19% ahead  
of last year at actual exchange rates 
and 12% ahead at constant currency. 
On a comparable week basis, 
adjusting for the impact of 2016 being 
a 53 week year for Primark, sales at 
constant currency were 14% ahead 
driven by increased retail selling 
space and 1% growth in like-for-like 
sales. Operating profit margin 
declined from 11.6% to 10.4% 
reflecting the strength of the  
US dollar on input costs. The gross 
transactional effect of the strength  
of the US dollar was lessened by 
effective input-margin mitigation  
and the strength of our summer 
trading which resulted in a lower  
than normal level of markdown.  
As a consequence, on a comparable 
week basis at constant currency, 
adjusted operating profit was  
5% ahead.
Primark performed particularly well in  
the UK where sales were 10% ahead  
of last year on a comparable basis and 
our share of the total clothing market 
increased significantly. After a good first 
half, third quarter trading was strong in 
the lead-up to Easter, with the growth 
also benefiting from comparison with 
prior year results that were affected  
by poor weather and an earlier Easter 
holiday. Fourth quarter trading was 
equally strong, fully reflecting the 
success of our consumer offering. This 
was driven by the ability of our buying, 
merchandising and design teams  
to identify and deliver key seasonal  
trends. The consumer response to  
our new autumn/winter range has  
been encouraging.
Sales in continental Europe were 16% 
ahead of last year at constant currency 
and on a comparable week basis, 
reflecting the extensive selling space 
expansion there. It is noteworthy that,  
of Primark’s top 20 stores by sales 
density, 15 are now in continental  
Europe including seven in our newest 
markets of France and Italy. The major 
success of the newly-opened store in 
Liffey Valley in Dublin demonstrates  
the opportunity for further selling space 
expansion in our more established 
markets. During the two years since  
the opening of our first US store at 
Downtown Crossing in Boston we  
have learned much about trading in  
the US and are constantly fine-tuning  
our ranges and store sizes to recognise 
the different demands of US shoppers. 
We opened three stores during the  
year and extended the Boston store  
by 20% to 92,000 sq ft. In the coming 
year we plan to reduce the size of three  
of our earlier stores in order to optimise 
their efficiency and provide the best 
shopping experience for our customers. 
We will also open our ninth US store  
in Brooklyn, New York in the summer.
Primark enjoys a loyal fashion following 
and the brand boasts over 10 million 
followers across its social media 
platforms. From the latest beauty tutorial 
videos to live streaming of press events 
and store openings, engaging this 
community directly drives footfall in our 
stores, and sales. The Primark website 
aims to inspire, and enables its followers 
to keep up-to-date on all the latest 
products, create wish lists, receive 
styling advice, and upload outfit posts  
to Primania. When leading Irish lifestyle 
blogger, Pippa O’Connor, put a picture  
of a star print Primark dress on Instagram 
in November 2016 it received over 
11,000 ‘likes’ in a week and the dress 
sold out in a matter of days.

to full-time One element of Primark’s 
recruitment strategy is to seek  
to attract those who, for a variety 
of reasons, have been out of the 
workforce for an extended period 
of time. Not only is this socially 
responsible, it also forms an 
important part of building  
teams that work well together, 
particularly in new stores.
During 2016/17, 28% of those hired for 
new UK stores were returning to work 
after an extended period. In Iberia the 
percentage rose to 56% and in Italy, 
our newest market, 46% of recruits 
were in this category. In both Belgium 
and The Netherlands, 35% of all hires 
came via the unemployment service.
My name is Stefano and I am 41 years 
old with a wife and two beautiful  
little children. I have been working in 
Primark as a Retail Assistant since the 
opening of the Arese store. Previously, 
I was employed in a chemist and at  
a warehouse. I was also employed  
for eight years as a payroll clerk in  
a temporary employment agency.  
In 2014, I lost my job after a change  
in company management. I was 
unemployed for two years and  
this was a difficult period for me. 
Fortunately, in early 2016, I applied  
to Primark for an interview and now,  
a year later, I have a permanent job 
with this great company!

PRIMARK IS GIVING PEOPLE THE 
OPPORTUNITY AND FLEXIBILITY  
TO GET BACK INTO FULL-TIME WORK  
IN THE RETAIL SECTOR
I am a mother of 21 year old twins 
whom I looked after until they went  
to university. Returning to work  
as a woman over 50 years old was 
difficult. For two years I applied for 
office and translating jobs but was 
unsuccessful as most employers  
just saw a woman over 50 years old 
with a massive gap in employment.  
I think they assumed I did not know 
how to use email or a computer.  
Just over a month ago my daughter 
suggested I apply to Primark.  
I applied to the Marble Arch store 
because of its mix of cultures and 
languages where I believed my  
skills would be best used. 
The process brought to mind my 
grandmother who is now 100 years 
old and was a dress maker which  
is where I get my love of fashion.  
I was apprehensive about the 
interview but the next day I received 
a call informing me that I had got  
the job. I cried but was really excited. 
When arriving for my first shift I was 
nervous but my team were great and 
made me very welcome; at times I 
feel like their mother. I believe I have 
brought a different set of skills: as a 
mother I am used to teaching how  
to fold clothes and organise things 
and although I am not working  
in an office, my skills are relevant. 
Working in this store I get to meet  
a great variety of people. I love 
watching them buy for their loved 
ones and it feels good to see them 
leave happily after I have assisted 
them. Finally, it feels great to be 
earning my own money again  
and looking forward to payday.

Marble Arch, UK  Strategic report – operating review
With most of next year’s first half  
UK purchases contracted at a weaker 
sterling/US dollar exchange rate than  
the same period last year, there will be 
an adverse effect on margin in the first 
half. However, the strengthening of  
the euro against the US dollar in recent 
months will have a beneficial transaction 
effect on Primark’s eurozone margins 
particularly in the second half of next 
year if these rates prevail. With a more 
typical level of markdowns and the 
absorption of some cost increases we 
expect full year margins to be similar  
to that achieved this year.
This year’s increase in the scale and 
breadth of the Primark estate was very 
strong: 1.5 million sq ft of selling space 
and a net 30 stores were opened across 
nine countries. This brought the total 
estate to 345 stores and 13.9 million sq ft 
at the financial year end. Eleven stores 
were added in the UK; three in each  
of Spain, France, the Netherlands,  
Italy and the US; two in Germany  
and one each in Belgium and Ireland.  
Our city centre flagship store at  
Oxford Street East was extended by  
40% during the year, increasing it to 
114,000 sq ft. The stores in Sheffield  
and Reading were relocated to bigger, 
better locations and two stores have 
been temporarily relocated while  
their existing sites are redeveloped.

Strategic report We continue to explore 
opportunities to bring our  
unique offer of ‘Amazing  
Fashion, Amazing Prices’ to  
new markets across Europe
Launching in the Italian market in 2016, 
we were confident our brand would 
make an impact in a country famous  
for its fashion credentials. We felt, 
despite being a relatively unknown 
retailer in Italy, that we still had an 
advantage over our competitors.
Our first store was in the Il Centro 
shopping centre in Arese, about 12km 
from fashion capital Milan. A former  
Alfa Romeo factory which has been 
transformed into the largest shopping 
centre in the country, Arese has over  
200 shops and a projected footfall  
of 13 million people each year. 
At the Arese store opening, the first 
customer in the queue enthusiastically 
commented: “I couldn’t sleep last night 
because I was so excited; I’m a huge 
Primark fan! I cannot wait to see what 
the store looks like inside but I’m sure  
it’ll be great because the windows look 
fantastic.” The opening was supported 
with a live stream on Facebook that gave 
an exclusive first look at the new store. 
The post reached 3.3 million people with 
1.1 million views on the platform. Since 
then we have had three more, highly 
successful, Italian store openings in 
Brescia, Florence and Verona.
We are trading above expectations in  
this new market with both our men’s  
and women’s clothing departments 
demonstrating higher sales mix than 
other European markets. Licensed 
merchandise is performing particularly 
well as consumers have responded 
positively to the broad selection of 
products available at a lower price point 
than our competitors. For example, 
during the last autumn/winter season, 
the Arese store experienced the 
strongest sales of the Harry Potter range 
when compared with the rest of the 
business. An important part of engaging 
our customers is the provision of an 
outstanding, cutting-edge, shopping 
experience. We have made significant 
advances in window presentation, visual 
merchandising, digital communication 
and the look and feel of each 
department, most notably with the 
introduction of ‘trend rooms’. 
These areas are dedicated to calling  
out our strongest fashion pieces  
every six weeks and highlighting the 
regularly changing items available  
across our range.
Our Italian store designs reflect the 
concept introduced in the US market:  
a stripped back industrial look with 
design details – concrete floors, pared 
back fittings and high-impact visual 
merchandising displays. Both Brescia 
Elnòs Shopping and Florence Il Gigli  
have generous space at the front of  
the store that brings our brand promise 
‘Amazing Fashion, Amazing Prices’ to  
life and provides a welcoming entrance. 
Shoppers are greeted by mannequins 
positioned on plinths creating a ‘fashion 
catwalk’ showcasing our latest looks  
and emphasising the great value that 
Primark offers. All four Italian stores  
give our customers the excitement  
of shopping in a contemporary, 
fashionable environment.
Brand building remains a focus, 
particularly as we enter new markets. 
Ahead of our entry into Italy, fashion 
influencers and press were introduced  
to Primark with a spring/summer press 
event in Milan.
The space was transformed into  
a welcoming ‘home’ featuring our 
womenswear, menswear, kidswear, 
beauty and homeware collections. 
Consumer media were invited to attend 
during the day with the real ‘house party’ 
happening in the evening with the  
arrival of over 180 digital influencers. 
The Primark branded logo wall 
encouraged guests to pose and post 
pictures using the hashtag #CiaoPrimark. 
Both hashtags #CiaoPrimark and 
#CasaPrimark received significant 
engagement across social media 
platforms, trending on Twitter and 
Instagram in Italy.
There were more than 30 fashion events 
happening in Milan on the same day yet 
our event still received an overwhelming 
turnout from the traditional press, and 
the blogger party was oversubscribed. 
Opening in one of the world’s most 
renowned fashion capitals was an 
exciting proposition, and we are very 
proud of our success to date as Italy 
further cements our fashion credibility.

FOR THE GROUP
JOHN BASON, FINANCE DIRECTOR
Group performance
Group revenue increased by 15%  
to £15.4bn and adjusted operating  
profit was 22% higher at £1,363m.  
In calculating adjusted operating profit, 
the amortisation charge on non-operating 
intangibles, transaction costs, and profits 
or losses on disposal of non-current 
assets are excluded. On an unadjusted 
basis, operating profit was 21% higher 
than last year at £1,336m. Last year’s 
revenue and operating profit both 
benefited to a small extent from a 53rd 
week’s trading activity in some of our 
businesses, but this was offset by the 
consolidation of only 11 months’ results 
for Illovo last year as a consequence of 
the alignment of its year end with the 
rest of the group.
The result of the UK referendum on  
EU membership saw sterling weaken 
substantially in June 2016 against all 
major currencies. With over 60% of the 
group’s operating profit earned outside 
the UK, this devaluation resulted in a 
translation benefit of £85m this financial 
year, most of which arose in the first 
three quarters. Sterling weakness  
against the US dollar had an adverse 
transactional effect on Primark’s largely 
dollar denominated purchases this year, 
whilst the euro’s strength in the second 
half had a beneficial effect on British 
Sugar’s margin.
Next year we expect no material 
translation benefit at current exchange 
rates. Sterling weakness against the US 
dollar will continue to have an adverse 
transactional effect on Primark’s margin 
in the first half although a benefit from 
the euro’s strength is expected in the 
second half. At current exchange rates, 
we also expect the euro’s strength to 
benefit British Sugar’s margin next year.
Net financing costs remained at a similar 
level to last year, despite the improvement 
in our net cash position, as a result of the 
group’s longer-term financing, through 
our US private placement, and some 
local currency debt maintained as a 
hedge against assets in high inflation 
economies. Profit before tax increased 
from £1,042m to £1,576m with the 
benefit of substantial profits on the sale 
of businesses. On our adjusted basis, 
which excludes these items, profit  
before tax rose by 22% to £1,310m.
Acquisitions and disposals
The disposal of our cane sugar business 
in south China was completed on  
22 December 2016 for total proceeds, 
including debt assumed, of £297m. The 
sale of ACH’s herbs and spices business 
in the US completed on 21 November 
2016 for a gross cash consideration  
of £294m and the assumption by the 
purchaser of net pension liabilities  
of £14m. The profit arising on these 
disposals amounted to £293m on  
which tax of £87m was payable.
In October 2016 Stratas Foods, our 
commodity oils joint venture, completed 
the purchase of Supreme Oil, based in 
New Jersey, thereby strengthening its 
market capability in the northeast of the 
US. In January 2017 AB Mauri acquired 
Specialty Blending, a bakery ingredients 
business located in Iowa. 
We also acquired two small sports 
nutrition businesses in the UK. HIGH5  
is a hydration and energy brand popular 
with endurance athletes and Reflex 
Nutrition provides a range of premium 
protein-based recovery products.  
Sports nutrition is a high-growth market 
segment and we plan to develop these 
brands and broaden their distribution.
Since the year end we have completed 
the acquisition of Acetum S.p.A., the 
leading Italian producer of Balsamic 
Vinegar of Modena for €317m including 
debt assumed. In the year ended  
31 December 2016, the company 
generated net sales of €102m. 
Taxation
We recognise the importance of 
complying fully with all applicable tax 
laws as well as paying and collecting the 
right amount of tax in every country in 
which the group operates. Our board-
adopted tax strategy is based on seven 
tax principles that are embedded in the 
financial and non-financial processes and 
controls of the group. Our tax strategy  
is available on the group’s website at 
www.abf.co.uk/documents/pdfs/policies/
abf_tax_strategy.pdf.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
48 FINANCIAL REVIEW Strategic report
This year’s tax charge of £365m includes 
a charge of £293m at an effective rate  
of 22.4% (2016 – 21.2%) on the adjusted 
profit before tax. Last year’s effective 
rate included the beneficial effect of the 
revaluation of UK deferred tax balances 
following announced reductions in the 
rate of UK corporation tax to 17% from  
1 April 2020. We currently expect next 
year’s effective tax rate for the group  
to be similar to the current year. 
The overall tax charge for the year 
included a charge arising on the disposal 
of businesses of £87m and benefited 
from a credit of £15m (2016 – £5m) for 
tax relief on the amortisation of non-
operating intangible assets and goodwill 
arising from business combinations. 
Earnings and dividends
Earnings attributable to equity 
shareholders in the current year were 
£1,198m and the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the 
year, which is used to calculate earnings 
per share, was 790 million (2016 – 791 
million). Earnings per ordinary share were 
47% higher than last year at 151.6p with 
the benefit of substantial profits on the 
sale of businesses this year. Adjusted 
earnings per share, which provides  
a more consistent measure of trading 
performance, increased by an impressive 
20% from 106.2p to 127.1p.
The interim dividend was increased  
by 10% to 11.35p and a final dividend  
has been proposed at 29.65p which 
represents an overall increase of 12%  
for the year. The proposed dividend is 
expected to cost £234m and will be 
charged next year. Dividend cover, on  
an adjusted basis increased to 3.1 times.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets of £7.6bn were 
£0.7bn higher than last year driven  
by higher capital expenditure than 
depreciation and an increase in  
employee benefits assets following  
the move of the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme into surplus. 
Working capital at the year end was  
at a similar level to last year, despite the 
growth of the group. As a consequence 
of the very tight management throughout 
the year, average working capital  
as a percentage of sales improved 
substantially from 8.4% last year to 6.5% 
this year, with lower inventories and 
higher sales in AB Sugar being a major 
driver. Net cash at the year end was 
£673m compared with net debt at  
the end of last year of £315m reflecting  
the strong operating cash flow and 
proceeds from business disposals.
The group’s net assets increased by 
£1.3bn to £8.4bn. Return on capital 
employed for the group, which is 
calculated by expressing adjusted 
operating profit as a percentage of the 
average capital employed for the year, 
was higher again this year at 20.5% 
compared with 18.1% last year. This 
reflected a major improvement in  
AB Sugar and increases in Ingredients 
and Grocery which more than offset  
the decline in Primark, which reflected  
the reduction in its margin. 
Cash flow
This was a year of very strong cash 
generation for the group with a net  
cash inflow from operating activities of 
£1,641m driven by the higher operating 
profit and a substantial reduction in 
working capital achieved with lower 
sugar stocks and the benefit of tight 
management by the businesses during 
the year. Gross capital expenditure 
including operating intangibles amounted 
to £866m compared with £804m last 
year. Primark spent £487m of this 
including the acquisition of new stores 
and the fit-out of existing stores. 
Expenditure in the food businesses 
remained at a similar level to last year. 
£49m was realised from the sale of 
property, plant and equipment, the  
major elements of which were the sale 
for redevelopment of a former bakery  
in Australia, two former bakery sites  
in the UK and the sale of two Primark 
stores in the UK following relocation  
to larger premises.
The net cash inflow after tax from the 
sale of the south China sugar and US 
herbs and spices businesses amounted 
to £477m, including debt disposed, and 
£79m was invested in acquisitions in  
US bakery ingredients and the sports 
nutrition businesses.
Tax paid in the year amounted to £356m 
including £92m arising on the business 
disposals. Generally in the UK, 50%  
of the corporation tax due in respect of 
an accounting period is payable in that 
period with the remaining 50% being 
paid in the following accounting period. 
Changes made by HMRC which come 
into effect next year will result in all  
of the tax due for a financial year being  
paid in that financial year. Accordingly, 
the group’s tax cash outflow in 2018 will 
be higher than 2017.
Financing
The financing of the group is managed by 
a central treasury department. The group 
has total committed borrowing facilities 
amounting to £1.9bn, which comprise: 
£0.6bn of US private placement notes 
maturing between 2019 and 2024, with 
an average fixed rate coupon of 4.7%; 
£1.2bn provided under a syndicated, 
revolving credit facility which matures in 
July 2021; and £0.1bn of local committed 
facilities in Africa. During the financial 
year we repaid, from existing cash 
resources, £15m of private placement 
notes. At the year end, £558m was 
drawn down under these committed 
facilities. The group also had access  
to £621m of uncommitted credit lines 
under which £214m was drawn at the 
year end. Cash and cash equivalents 
totalled £1.6bn at the year end. 
Pensions
The group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes were in surplus by £126m at 
the year end compared with a net deficit 
last year of £303m. The UK scheme 
accounts for 89% of the group’s gross 
pension liabilities and this year’s surplus 
of £233m compared with a deficit of 
£138m last year. The major drivers of the 
year-on-year improvement were the use 
of the latest scheme membership data  
in the 2017 triennial valuation, which 
identified that there had been more exits 
from the scheme than expected over the 
past three years, and higher investment 
returns relative to the IAS19 assumptions.
The most recent triennial valuation of  
the UK scheme was undertaken as at  
5 April 2017, which was agreed by the 
scheme trustees after the group’s year 
end, and revealed a surplus of £176m  
on a funding basis. As a result there is  
no requirement to agree a recovery  
plan with the trustees. 
The charge for the year for the group’s 
defined contribution schemes, which 
was equal to the contributions made, 
amounted to £79m (2016 – £74m). This 
compared with the cash contribution to 
the defined benefit schemes of £36m 
(2016 – £38m).

OUR CUSTOMERS
Since our business was founded 
in 1935, it has been important  
to us to operate ethically.  
This is part of the essence  
of Associated British Foods.
Today, our approach to corporate 
responsibility is framed by five strategic 
pillars which ensure we consider all our 
stakeholders as we make decisions  
about how to run our business:
In 2016, we published a full Corporate 
Responsibility Report, and this year  
we have produced a supplemental 
document which contains new case 
studies and updated content.
Corporate responsibility is a central  
part of how we think about and run  
our business and is incorporated  
into our day-to-day decision-making 
processes. We have followed the 
guidance of the Financial Reporting 
Council and sought to make our  
approach to reporting reflect that  
level of integration.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
50 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Environment
Energy use
In 2017, our absolute use of energy  
was 23,300 GWh Δ, up from 22,800 
GWh in 2016. Of this total energy used, 
49% came from renewable sources.  
Our sugar businesses consumed 83%  
of the group’s energy this year and  
the 2% increase in energy use is  
partly the consequence of favourable 
weather conditions which extended  
our sugar campaigns.
A number of our sites are ‘energy 
positive’ meaning they generate their 
own energy and, when they create 
surplus, they export this to national  
grids or other organisations.
In 2017, we exported 850 GWh of 
electricity which is an 11% increase  
on last year.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our total gross greenhouse gas 
emissions amounted to 8.7 million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO
2
e) Δ, which is consistent with  
last year despite our increased 
production output.
In this document, you will find case 
studies in each of the divisional  
updates that illustrate our efforts  
to develop and take care of our people 
and those living in our wider community 
– information that we previously only 
included in our Corporate Responsibility 
Report. We also use certain non-financial 
metrics, many of which are specific to 
the individual businesses, as the board  
is as concerned about the safety and 
wellbeing of our employees as it is  
about revenue and profit.
In the pages that follow, we share 
additional data on our environmental  
and health and safety performance  
over the last year. We also provide  
detailed information about the gender 
breakdown of our business, the gender 
pay gap, and our efforts to reduce the 
risk of any human rights abuse in our 
supply chain. Our Corporate Responsibility 
Update 2017 contains further information 
on each of these topics as well as data  
on, and case studies about, our five 
business segments.
Read our Corporate Responsibility Update 
2017 at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
The energy we use in our factories, 
offices, warehouses, distribution centres 
and stores created 79% of these gross 
emissions. The transportation of  
our goods and people by owned or 
third-party vehicles generated 10%  
and process emissions from production  
such as bread baking or fermentation, 
were responsible for 9%. Emissions 
from agriculture account for the 
remaining 2%.
Our net emissions, which include  
only those from conventional fossil  
fuels, amounted to 5 million tonnes  
of CO
2
e Δ which is consistent with  
last year.
We engaged Ernst & Young to provide limited 
assurance over the reliability of 14 KPIs for the  
year ended 31 July 2017. These are marked  
with the symbol Δ in the following pages.

Strategic report Water usage
In 2017, we abstracted 811 million m
3
 Δ 
of water for our use, 2% more than 2016. 
This increase is attributed to the inclusion 
of cooling water in the calculation as well 
as production increases and higher water 
levels in some of the southern African 
sites, permitting more water to be used 
for irrigating our crops.
The majority of the water we use is to 
irrigate our extensive sugar cane fields. 
Over recent years and as part of its 
long-term water strategy, Illovo Sugar in 
Africa has been investing in meters to 
improve its monitoring and measurement 
of water used for irrigation. Illovo accounts 
for 95% of the group’s total water usage 
this year.
Waste management
We generated just under 1.2 million 
tonnes of waste Δ this year which is  
a 16% increase on 2016. 71% of this  
was recycled and therefore diverted  
from landfill. We have also increased  
the amount of recycled waste by 6%  
and non-hazardous waste increased  
by 55% this year.
Environmental compliance
In 2017, we received 80 environmental 
complaints about our operations,  
18 more than last year. We also  
received ten environmental fines Δ 
totalling £187,000 Δ; the same number  
of fines as last year. The fines were 
mainly related to the treatment of  
waste water and the complaints were 
largely due to noise and odour from  
our factories. The sites continue to  
liaise and engage with relevant 
stakeholders to address the issues 
promptly and maintain good relations  
with their neighbours.
Keeping our people safe 
Our health and safety performance
During 2017, we recorded 768 Lost Time 
Injuries to employees Δ which is a 20% 
increase over last year. When increases 
in headcount are taken into account,  
this equates to a Lost Time Injury rate  
of 0.76%. The number of Reportable 
Injuries to employees also increased  
this year from 454 to 594 which equates 
to 0.59% of our employees sustaining  
a Reportable Injury. We are pleased  
to report no work-related fatalities  
this year.
At an aggregated group level our annual 
trend in injuries has increased. In most 
cases we have delivered a good level  
of safety performance this year with 
reporting thresholds being lower in  
some of our more recent countries of 
operation. Our businesses have targeted 
action plans to reduce injuries and we 
continue to review performance regularly 
throughout the year to identify trends 
which need specific attention.

Health and safety fines
During 2017, we received six fines Δ 
totalling £74,000 Δ for breaches of safety 
regulations. This is an increase of four 
over last year which is unsatisfactory. 
The businesses involved are required  
to report to the Group Safety and 
Environment Manager on their remedial 
actions and are now either compliant  
or are on track to remedy the issues.
Promoting gender diversity
Gender diversity
We remain committed to attracting and 
retaining the best talent and are proud  
of the fact that the proportion of men  
and women in our business is almost 
equal. The split varies by business but,  
last year, the percentage of women  
in the workforce was 48%.
Gender Pay Gap reporting
The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017 were 
introduced in Great Britain in April 2017 
and we have collected data, as defined 
by those regulations, for all of our relevant 
employees. This provides a high level 
indication of men and women’s relative 
earning power due to seniority. It is not 
the same as equal pay for work of equal 
value. For each of our UK legal entities 
that is required to report, data will be 
published online and submitted to the 
Government’s Gender Pay Reporting 
website in accordance with the 
legislation in due course. We have 
chosen to report data here that relates  
to our total employee population in  
Great Britain as at 5 April 2017 in order  
to demonstrate our commitment to the 
gender diversity agenda. It is important  
to note that our group operates in  
50 countries with over 50% of our 
workforce employed outside Great 
Britain who are therefore not included 
within this analysis.
The data is reported with reference to 
quartiles, with each quartile representing 
25% of the total reported population 
when ranked in order of pay, from 
highest to lowest.

Gender pay and bonus gaps are calculated by comparing the mean (average) and median (central value  
in the data list) measures  for women to that of men and identifying the percentage difference between  
the two.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
52 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Gender balance at the top of the group 
changes slowly because we have a 
stable senior team, who are mostly men, 
with long tenure. Our data includes a 
large number of retail staff, on relatively 
lower pay. A higher proportion of these 
retail staff are women. We remain 
committed to gender diversity and our 
focus on numerous initiatives in this 
area has had a positive impact, 
particularly amongst middle management. 
This is also reflected in our reporting for 
the Hampton Alexander report 2017, 
which saw a rise in the proportion of 
women in our global executive pipeline 
to 23% (from 21% in 2016). It should  
be noted that Hampton Alexander 
specifically reports on the gender 
balance of the population that report  
to the executive committee. This 
population differs from that shown  
in the table above.
As more of our current senior leaders  
are male, more men than women receive 
a bonus. The presence of these senior 
men in the bonus pool has a distorting 
effect on the mean bonus gap. 
Encouragingly, the median bonus 
demonstrates a gap in favour of women. 
This difference also reflects the varying 
composition of bonuses across our 
different businesses.
We focus on attracting and retaining  
the best talent, both men and women,  
to run and work in our businesses and 
the continued promotion of gender 
diversity, through a variety of initiatives 
(see page 24 of our 2016 Corporate 
Responsibility Report for further 
information), is an important element  
in ensuring a strong pipeline of talent.
Human rights
Being a responsible company means 
respecting the human rights of all  
the people with whom we interact. 
Whether they are direct employees, 
temporary workers or those in our  
supply chain, we know we can play  
a role in enhancing their lives. Our full 
human rights principles are set out  
on pages 94 and 95.
We recognise that the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human 
Rights (UNGPs) require businesses to 
address actual and potential adverse 
human rights impacts, prioritising  
those that are most severe or where  
a delayed response would make them 
irremediable. Forced and trafficked 
labour is recognised as having a severe 
impact on human rights and this has 
been reflected in the increase in, and 
revision of, regulations that attempt  
to address the issue, including:  
the California Transparency in Supply  
Chains Act, EU regulations on reporting, 
the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and 
the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Protocol on Forced Labour.
Our approach to human rights and  
the steps we take to try and ensure  
that modern slavery, in any of its forms, 
is not present within our operations  
or our supply chains are set out in  
our full 2017 Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement at www.abf.co.uk/ 
modern_slavery_statement_2017. Many 
of our businesses have compiled their 
own statement. All published statements 
can be found at www.abf.co.uk/
responsibility/cr_downloads.
Our comprehensive groupwide Supplier 
Code of Conduct sets out the values and 
standards we expect of our suppliers, 
representatives and the other people 
with whom we deal. It is based on the 
ILO Fundamental Conventions and the 
Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) Base Code. 
We engaged with NGOs in the creation 
of this code and periodically update  
it to ensure its relevance. Last year,  
we updated it to include a statement  
of our intolerance of forced or bonded 
labour. Our suppliers are expected  
to sign and abide by this code.
We know that addressing modern 
slavery and our human rights impacts is  
a journey of continuous improvement. 
This year, we have focused our energy 
on training to empower our people with 
knowledge. Many of our businesses 
have also invested in developing robust 
risk assessment processes to ensure  
we are focusing on areas where we  
are likely to have the greatest impact. 
Our businesses are also working 
together to generate methods  
of monitoring and evaluating the  
process and impact of our work.
We have recently participated in two 
benchmarking initiatives: The Corporate 
Human Rights Benchmark and Know  
the Chain. In these assessments, our 
commitment and performance on human 
rights was ranked in the mid-range in 
relation to peer companies. We respect 
the work that these organisations are 
doing and are pleased to be recognised 
for operating in a responsible way.  
We will continue to drive forward the 
agenda of respecting human rights 
within our business and play our role  
in tackling modern slavery.

Strategic report EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS 
CENTRAL TO THE BOARD’S ROLE IN 
PROVIDING STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT
Our approach to risk management
The delivery of our strategic objectives 
and the sustainable growth (or long-term 
shareholder value) of our business, is 
dependent on effective risk management. 
We regularly face business uncertainties 
and it is through a structured approach  
to risk management that we are able  
to mitigate and manage these risks, and 
embrace opportunities when they arise. 
The diversified nature of our operations, 
geographical reach, assets and 
currencies are important factors in 
mitigating the risk of a material threat  
to the group’s balance sheet and  
results. Effective risk management is 
nevertheless central to the board’s role  
in providing strategic oversight and 
stewardship of the group. The board  
is accountable for ensuring that risk is 
successfully managed and undertakes  
a robust annual assessment of the 
principal risks, including those that  
would threaten the business model, 
future performance, solvency or  
liquidity, together with the internal  
control procedures and resources 
devoted to them. 
The board also monitors the group’s 
exposure to risks as part of the 
performance reviews conducted at  
each board meeting. Financial risks  
are specifically reviewed by the Audit 
committee which also reviews the 
effectiveness of the group’s risk 
mitigation processes. 
Our decentralised business model 
empowers the management of our 
businesses to identify, evaluate and 
manage the risks they face, on a timely 
basis, to ensure compliance with relevant 
legislation, our business principles and 
group policies. The risk assessments 
consider materiality, risk controls and the 
likely impact against a range of criteria 
such as business objectives, health  
and safety, financial performance, the 
environment and community, regulation 
and reputation. The collated risks from 
each business are shared with the 
respective divisional chief executives 
who present their divisional risks to  
the group executive. 
The group’s Director of Financial  
Control receives the risk assessments  
on an annual basis and, with the Group 
Finance Director, reviews and challenges 
them with the divisional chief executives. 
These risks and their impact on business 
performance are reported during the  
year and are considered as part of the 
monthly management review process.
Group functional heads including  
Legal, Treasury, Tax, IT, Pensions,  
HR and Insurance also provide input to 
this process, sharing with the Director  
of Financial Control their view of key  
risks and what activities are in place or 
planned to mitigate them. A summary  
of these risk assessments is then  
shared and discussed with the Group 
Finance Director and Chief Executive  
at least annually. 
The Director of Financial Control holds 
meetings with each of the non-executive 
directors seeking their feedback on  
the reviews performed and discussing 
the key risks and mitigating activities. 
Once all non-executive directors have 
been consulted, a board report is 
prepared summarising the full process 
and providing an assessment of the 
status of risk management across the 
group. The key risks, mitigating controls 
and relevant policies are summarised.
This report also details when formal 
updates relating to the key risks will  
be provided to the board throughout  
the year.
Key areas of focus this year 
Effective risk management  
processes and internal controls
We aim to maintain a practical approach 
to effective risk management which 
allows our businesses the scope to 
address their current and potential risks. 
We continued to seek improvements  
in our risk management processes  
to ensure the quality and integrity of 
information and the ability to respond 
swiftly to direct risks.
During the year, the board conducted 
reviews on the effectiveness of the 
group’s risk management processes  
and internal controls in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
Our approach to risk management and 
systems of internal control is in line with 
the recommendations in the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) revised 
guidance ‘Risk management, internal 
control and related financial and business 
reporting’ (the Risk Guidance). The board 
is satisfied that internal controls were 
properly reviewed and key risks are being 
appropriately identified and managed. 
Brexit
Last year, we identified the UK’s decision 
to leave the European Union as having 
had some immediate impact on our 
results as a consequence of the effect on 
currency markets. As the UK government 
continues its negotiations, uncertainty 
remains as to the extent to which our 
operations and financial performance will 
be affected in the longer term. At a group 
and business level, we have continued  
to prepare for changes in legislation, 
trade agreements and working practices 
in order to take advantage of the changing 
commercial landscape and to mitigate 
risk. We have contributed to government-
led consultations on the potential changes 
and their likely impact on businesses and 
markets to help inform the exit strategy.

54 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES EXTERNAL RISKS
Risk trend Mitigation Changes since 2016
MOVEMENT IN EXCHANGE RATES  
AND INFLATION
Context and potential impact
Associated British Foods is a 
multinational group with operations  
and transactions in many currencies.
Changes in exchange rates give rise  
to transactional exposures within  
the businesses and to translation 
exposures when the assets,  
liabilities and results of overseas  
entities are translated into sterling  
upon consolidation.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Businesses impacted by exchange rate 
volatility, specifically those manufacturing  
or purchasing in one currency and selling  
in another, constantly review their  
currency-related exposures.
Board-approved policies require businesses  
to hedge all transactional currency exposures 
and long-term supply or purchase contracts 
which give rise to currency exposures,  
using foreign exchange forward contracts.
Cash balances and borrowings are largely 
maintained in the functional currency of  
the local operations.
Cross-currency swaps are used to align 
borrowings with the underlying currencies  
of the group’s net assets (refer to note 24 to 
the financial statements for more information).
Sterling has weakened against most of  
our major trading currencies this year.
The net impact on adjusted operating profit 
for 2016/17 from the translation of overseas 
results into sterling was a gain of £85m.
Although Primark covers its currency 
exposure on purchases of merchandise 
denominated in foreign currencies when 
orders are placed, this hedging activity 
typically covers a period of only six months. 
Sterling weakness against the US dollar,  
since its decline following the UK referendum 
in June 2016, had an adverse transactional 
effect on Primark’s largely dollar-denominated 
purchases this year. However, the euro’s 
strength in the second half had a beneficial 
effect on British Sugar’s margin.
FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY  
AND ENERGY PRICES
Context and potential impact
Changes in commodity and energy  
prices can have a material impact 
on the group’s operating results, 
asset values and cash flows.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
We constantly monitor the markets  
in which we operate and manage certain  
of these exposures with exchange traded 
contracts and hedging instruments.
The commercial implications of commodity 
price movements are continuously assessed 
and, where appropriate, are reflected in the 
pricing of our products.
EU and world sugar prices were higher  
than last year which had a positive effect  
on Sugar profitability.
Lower ethanol prices and higher wheat  
costs adversely affected margins at  
Vivergo Fuels.
Higher agricultural commodity prices 
adversely affected margins in our China  
and UK compound feed businesses  
although firmer grain pricing benefited 
Frontier Agriculture.
Our principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten  
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Outlined below are the group’s principal risks and uncertainties and  
the key mitigating activities in place to address them. These are the principal risks of the group as a whole and are not in any order  
of priority. Associated British Foods is exposed to a variety of other risks but we report those we believe are likely to have the 
greatest current or near-term impact on our strategic and operational plans and reputation. 
They are grouped into external risks, which may occur in the markets or environment in which we operate, and operational risks, 
which are related to internal activity linked to our own operations and internal controls.
The ‘Changes since 2016’ highlight the significant variations in the profile of our principal risks or describe our experience  
and activity over the last year.

Strategic report Risk trend Mitigation Changes since 2016
OPERATING IN GLOBAL MARKETS
Context and potential impact
Operating in 50 countries with  
a supply chain covering even more,  
we are exposed to: global market  
forces; fluctuations in national 
economies; societal and political 
changes; a range of consumer  
concerns; and evolving legislation.
Failure to recognise and respond  
to any of these factors could  
directly impact the profitability  
of our operations.
Entering new markets is a risk  
to any business.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Our approach to risk management 
incorporates potential short-term market 
volatility and evaluates longer-term  
socio-economic and political scenarios.
The group’s financial control framework  
and board-adopted tax and treasury policies 
require all businesses to comply fully with 
relevant local laws.
Provision is made for known issues based  
on management’s interpretation of country-
specific tax law, EU cases and investigations 
on tax rulings, and their likely outcome.
We engage with governments, local 
regulators and community organisations  
to contribute to, and anticipate important 
changes in, public policy.
We conduct rigorous due diligence when 
entering, or commencing business activities 
in, new markets.
In preparing for the abolition of EU sugar 
quotas from October 2017, AB Sugar 
continued to reduce its cost base  
with the benefit of its performance  
improvement programme.
We acquired two small businesses in  
the sports nutrition market this year but 
neither is of sufficient scale to represent  
a material risk to the group’s profitability  
in the event of failure. Other acquisitions 
were in market sectors or countries  
very familiar to the group. In all cases 
thorough due diligence was undertaken.
HEALTH AND NUTRITION 
Context and potential impact
Failure to respond appropriately to  
health and nutrition concerns in the 
formulation of our products could  
result in adverse consumer reaction.
Failure to keep pace with changing 
consumer tastes, choices and  
shopping behaviours could  
impact business performance.
We must also act responsibly  
across the spectrum of food poverty  
and malnutrition to obesity.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Consumer preferences and market trends  
are monitored continuously.
Recipes are regularly reviewed and 
reformulated to improve the nutritional  
value of our grocery products, all of which  
are labelled with nutritional information.
We develop partnerships with other 
organisations to help educate consumers 
about making healthy choices.
Our businesses continued to review their 
products and to partner with others to  
enable a swift and innovative response  
to changing consumer needs.
Our Sugar and Grocery businesses have 
supported healthy eating campaigns  
during the year to help consumers make 
informed choices about their food.
SOCIO-POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
Context and potential impact
Geopolitical uncertainty, the threat  
of terrorism and social unrest could  
all have a direct impact on our  
operations, our suppliers and our  
people. Such events may also  
impact consumer confidence.
  Risk trend 
Increased
By their nature these events mean they  
are largely unpredictable. Nonetheless  
our businesses have prepared detailed 
contingency plans which include  
site-level emergency responses and 
improved security for employees.
We reviewed and upgraded contingency  
plans across our businesses.

56 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Risk trend Mitigation Changes since 2016
WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY
Context and potential impact
Many of our operations, by their  
nature, have the potential for injuries  
and fatal accidents to employees, 
contractors and visitors.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Safety continues to be the number one 
priority for our businesses with active 
endorsement and accountability from  
the chief executives of each business.
Our Health and Safety policy and  
practices are firmly embedded in each 
business, supporting a strong ethos  
of workplace safety.
Independent audits are conducted  
to verify implementation and support 
continuous improvement.
Best practice safety and occupational  
health training and guidance are shared 
across the businesses, co-ordinated  
from the corporate centre, to supplement  
the delivery of their own programmes.
During the year there has been a 15% 
increase in our employee lost time injury  
rate to 0.76%. Our businesses conduct 
thorough root cause analysis to learn  
from accidents and implement  
safety changes.
PRODUCT SAFETY AND QUALITY
Context and potential impact
As a leading food manufacturer  
and retailer, it is fundamental that  
we manage the safety and integrity  
of our products throughout the  
supply chain.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Across the group, product safety is  
put before economic considerations.
Our businesses employ quality control 
specialists and operate strict policies within  
an organisational culture of hygiene and 
product safety to ensure that consistently  
high standards are maintained in our 
operations and in the sourcing and  
handling of raw materials and garments.
We monitor the regulatory environment  
and emerging scientific research while 
reviewing our food safety systems for 
efficacy and legal compliance.
A programme of independent food quality  
and safety audits is undertaken across all  
our manufacturing sites and a due diligence 
programme is in place to ensure the safety  
of our retail products.
No significant changes this year.
OUR USE OF NATURAL  
RESOURCES AND MANAGING  
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Context and potential impact
Our businesses rely on a stable supply  
of natural resources some of which are 
vulnerable to external factors such as 
natural disasters and climate change. 
Our operations give rise to a range of 
emissions including dust, waste water 
and waste which, if not controlled,  
could lead to a risk to the environment 
and our local communities. Many of our 
sites are surrounded by other businesses 
or residential areas.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
We aim to go beyond environmental 
compliance.
Our businesses employ environmental 
specialists who use the best available 
technologies and techniques to reduce  
our use of consumables, adapt operations  
to climate change and reduce our 
environmental footprint.
We monitor developments and engage  
with governmental bodies on climate  
change; we limit reliance on certain  
resources such as fossil fuels and respond  
to changes such as carbon pricing and  
energy supply. 
Our businesses are mindful of being  
good neighbours through local community 
engagement and the monitoring and 
management of noise pollution  
and odours.
The environmental performance of the  
group, with updates by division, is reported  
in the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Update 
at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
We annually report our approach to climate 
change, water and deforestation risk via  
CDP at www.cdp.org.
Some of our businesses have started to 
develop a structured approach to ‘being a 
good neighbour’ in order to evaluate their 
positive effect on the community and to 
mitigate any potential adverse impact.
OPERATIONAL RISKS

Strategic report Risk trend Mitigation Changes since 2016
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND  
ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
Context and potential impact
Our suppliers are essential to the 
successful operation of the group.
We therefore work with them to  
ensure reliability and to help them  
meet our standards of product  
quality and safety, financial stability, 
ethics, technical competence and  
people safety.
Potential supply chain and ethical 
business practice risks include:
• reputational damage through  
supply chain weaknesses e.g. poor 
conditions for workers;
• unacceptable and unethical behaviour, 
including bribery, corruption and 
slavery risk;
• impact on reliability of supply  
and business continuity due to 
unforeseen incidents e.g. natural 
disasters; and
• long-term sustainability  
of key suppliers.
  Risk trend 
Unchanged
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is designed  
to ensure suppliers, representatives and all 
with whom we deal, adhere to our values  
and standards.
The full Code is available at: www.abf.co.uk/
supplier_code_of_conduct.
Adherence to the Code is verified  
through our supplier audit system with  
our procurement and operational teams 
establishing strong working relationships  
with suppliers to help them meet  
our standards.
All businesses are required to comply  
with the group’s Business Principles  
including its Anti-Bribery and  
Corruption Policy.
Our businesses have continued to engage 
with key suppliers on a range of shared 
issues such as maximising environmental  
and cost efficiencies, maintaining safe 
workplaces, supporting steady employment 
and increasing transparency across the  
wider supply chain.
All our businesses have undertaken risk 
assessments to identify supply chains at  
high risk from modern slavery. Over the  
year, we have focused on embedding  
our work in this area through training and  
sharing learning across the businesses.
Our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking 
Statement 2017 and the steps we take to  
try to ensure that any forms of modern 
slavery are not present within our own 
operations or our supply chain are reported  
in detail in the 2017 Corporate Responsibility 
Update www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
BREACHES OF IT AND  
INFORMATION SECURITY
Context and potential impact
Our delivery of efficient and effective 
operations is enhanced by the use of 
relevant technologies and the sharing  
of information. We are therefore subject 
to potential internal and external cyber 
threats such as computer viruses and  
the loss or theft of data.
We are increasingly interacting with 
customers, consumers and suppliers 
through technology and therefore  
greater emphasis is placed on secure  
and reliable IT systems, enabling  
careful management of information.
There is also the potential for disruption 
to operations from unforeseen IT and 
system malfunctions or external attack.
  Risk trend 
Increased
We seek to understand the changing  
cyber risks faced by our businesses  
and take appropriate action.
We have established processes, group  
IT security policies and technologies in  
place, all of which are subject to regular 
internal audit.
Access to sensitive data is restricted  
and closely monitored.
Robust disaster recovery plans are in  
place for business-critical applications.
Technical security controls are in place  
over key IT platforms with the Head of  
IT Security tasked with identifying and 
responding to potential security risks.
We instigated regular security scanning  
of all websites in 2016 and developed 
incident management plans for potential  
IT attacks; both approaches yielded  
positive outcomes in 2017.
We enhanced the security assessments  
and due diligence required for new  
IT projects.
OPERATIONAL RISKS CONTINUED
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
58 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The directors have determined that  
the most appropriate period over which 
to assess the Company’s viability,  
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, is three years. This  
is consistent with the group’s business 
model which devolves operational 
decision-making to the businesses,  
each of which sets a strategic planning 
time horizon appropriate to its activities 
which are typically of three years 
duration. The directors also considered 
the diverse nature of the group’s 
activities and the degree to which the 
businesses change and evolve in the 
relatively short term.
The directors considered the group’s 
profitability, cash flows and key financial 
ratios over this period and the potential 
impact that the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties set out on pages 54 to 58 
could have on the solvency or liquidity  
of the group. Sensitivity analysis was 
applied to these metrics and the projected 
cash flows were stress tested against  
a range of scenarios.
The directors considered the level  
of performance that would cause the  
group to breach its debt covenants,  
the financial implications of making any 
strategic acquisitions and a variety of 
factors that have the potential to reduce 
profit substantially. These included  
the rate and success of Primark’s 
expansion; actions which could damage 
the group’s reputation for the long term; 
and macro-economic influences such  
as fluctuations in world currency and 
commodity markets and the implications 
of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Such is the diversity of the group,  
with operations across 50 countries  
and sales in more than 100, that none  
of the principal risks or uncertainties 
individually is considered likely to have  
a material impact on the group’s 
profitability or extensive cash resources. 
Furthermore, the group’s business model 
means that no significant reliance is 
placed on any one group of customers  
or suppliers and its diversity reduces  
the risk that issues affecting a particular 
sector will have a material impact on  
the group as a whole.
At 16 September 2017, £1.2bn of 
committed borrowing facilities available 
to the group were undrawn and the 
directors are of the opinion that substantial 
further funding could be secured at 
relatively short notice should the need 
arise. The revolving credit facility is not 
due for renewal until July 2021 and  
over £300m of the private placement 
funding matures beyond the period 
under consideration.
The group has a sound track record of 
delivering strong cash flows, with well  
in excess of £1bn of operating cash  
being generated in each of the last  
seven years. This has been more than 
sufficient to fund expansionary capital 
investment and, specifically, has  
enabled the development of Primark  
in continental Europe and the US.  
The group’s cash flows have supported 
7% compound annual growth in the 
dividend over the last ten years.
Even in a worst case scenario, with risks 
modelled to materialise simultaneously 
and for a sustained period, the likelihood 
of the group having insufficient resources 
to meet its financial obligations is remote. 
Based on this assessment, the directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet  
its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period to 12 September 2020.

London Stock Exchange, the Company 
is reporting in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published  
in April 2016 (the ‘Code’) which sets out 
standards of good practice in relation  
to board leadership and effectiveness, 
remuneration, accountability and  
relations with shareholders. The  
Code is published by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’) and a copy  
of the Code is available from the FRC 
website (www.frc.org.uk). 
An updated version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code was published in April 
2016 and first applies to companies with 
financial years commencing on or after 
17 June 2016 (‘the 2016 Code’). The 
Company has already taken account of 
the small number of changes required 
and now reports formally in accordance 
with the 2016 Code in this annual report. 
The board considers that the Company 
has, throughout the year ended  
16 September 2017, applied the  
main principles and complied with  
the provisions set out in the Code,  
with the following exception: 
Code provision 
D.2.1 – The Chairman should not  
chair the Remuneration committee 
Status 
Charles Sinclair is both Chairman of  
the Company and chairman of the 
Remuneration committee. 
Explanation 
The board of Associated British Foods plc 
continues to consider that Charles Sinclair, 
due to his experience, is best suited  
to chair this committee. No director has  
any involvement in the determination of  
his own remuneration. The board believes  
that the Company has maintained  
robust governance while at the same  
time benefiting from having Charles  
Sinclair as the chairman of the 
Remuneration committee. 
Leadership 
The board 
The board of directors is collectively 
responsible to the Company’s 
shareholders for the direction and 
oversight of the Company to ensure  
its long-term success. The board met 
regularly throughout the year to approve 
the group’s strategic objectives, to  
lead the group within a framework of 
effective controls which enable risk to  
be assessed and managed and to ensure 
that sufficient resources are available  
to meet the objectives set. 
There are a number of matters which  
are specifically reserved for the board’s 
approval. These are set out in a clearly 
defined schedule and include: matters 
relating to the group’s strategic plan; 
approving the annual business strategy 
and objectives; the nature and extent of 
principal risks to be taken to achieve the 
strategic objectives; changes relating to 
structure and capital; approval of trading 
statements, interim results, final results 
and annual report and accounts; declaring 
interim dividends and recommending 
final dividends; the group’s policies and 
systems of internal control and risk 
DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS 
I am pleased to present the Associated British Foods corporate governance 
report for 2017. We have structured our report once again to reflect the themes  
of the Code. In the following pages, we set out details of our approach to corporate 
governance and the activities of the board and its committees during the year. 
The role of the board is to lead the Company and to oversee its governance.  
The directors also recognise the board’s pivotal role in shaping the group’s culture 
and values. Associated British Foods is an organisation built upon solid ethical 
foundations with a strong, constant culture, known internally as the essence  
of Associated British Foods. The members of the board, together with senior 
management, continue to work closely with the businesses to promote the  
ethical culture and standards across the group through a robust governance 
framework. This is seen as an important factor in protecting and delivering 
sustainable long-term value for shareholders.  
As Chairman, my focus has been on managing the board to ensure that  
it operates effectively, has the right balance of independence, experience,  
diversity and skill and demonstrates a healthy culture of scrutiny and challenge. 
This year, succession planning has continued to be a priority for the board and 
Nomination committee. We are continuing to phase the refreshing of the  
board. As discussed in my Chairman’s statement on page 4, we are delighted  
to welcome Michael McLintock as an independent non-executive director with 
effect from 1 November 2017. As I also mentioned, Tim Clarke will retire from  
the board on 30 November 2017 and will be succeeded in the role of Senior 
Independent Director by Javier Ferrán. We recognise that Javier has been  
a member of the board for longer than the nine years advocated by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. However, the continuity offered by Javier, combined 
with his extensive experience of consumer brands and international retailing,  
make his continuing contribution to the mix of skills and knowledge on the  
board highly valuable. We are therefore delighted that Javier has agreed to  
serve a further term as a non-executive director and, on page 65, we explain  
our reasoning in determining his continued independence. 
Last year, the Remuneration committee undertook a complete review of the 
group’s incentive arrangements. We consulted extensively with our largest 
shareholders and their representative bodies and this resulted in our revised 
remuneration policy receiving a 97% vote of approval at the AGM held in 
December 2016. Details of the new policy are set out in the Remuneration 
committee report which starts on page 75. 
I am pleased that we have continued to make good progress with a number  
of actions identified from previous board evaluation exercises. During 2017,  
with external support, we undertook our annual effectiveness evaluation of the 
board, its principal committees and individual directors. The results confirmed  
that Associated British Foods has a very effective board. Information on our 
performance evaluation review this year is provided on pages 65 and 66. 
As always, we welcome any feedback on this report through the website 
www.abf.co.uk or in person at the AGM in December.

management; approving capital projects, 
acquisitions and disposals valued at over 
£30m; provision of adequate succession 
planning; approving major group policies 
and matters relating to the compliance 
with the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement between the Company  
and its controlling shareholders dated  
14 November 2014. The schedule of 
matters reserved is available to view on 
the corporate governance section of the 
Company’s website (www.abf.co.uk). 
Certain specific responsibilities are 
delegated to the board committees, 
notably the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination committees, which operate 
within clearly defined terms of reference 
and report regularly to the board. For 
further details, please see ‘Board 
committees’ section below. 
Authority for the operational  
management of the group’s business  
has been delegated to the Chief 
Executive for execution or further 
delegation by him for the effective  
day-to-day running and management  
of the group. The chief executive of  
each business within the group has 
authority for that business and reports 
directly to the Chief Executive. 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are separately held and the 
division of their responsibilities is clearly 
established, set out in writing, and agreed 
by the board to ensure that no one has 
unfettered powers of decision. The 
Chairman, Charles Sinclair, is responsible 
for the operation and leadership of the 
board, ensuring its effectiveness and 
setting its agenda. The Chief Executive, 
George Weston, is responsible for leading 
and managing the group’s business within 
a set of authorities delegated by the  
board and for the implementation of  
board strategy and policy. 
Senior Independent Director 
Tim Clarke is currently the Company’s 
recognised Senior Independent Director. 
Tim will be retiring from the board  
on 30 November 2017. He will be 
succeeded in the role of Senior 
Independent Director by Javier Ferrán. 
The purpose of this role is to act as  
a sounding board for the Chairman and  
to serve as an intermediary for other 
directors where necessary. He is also 
available to shareholders should a need 
arise to convey concerns to the board 
which they have been unable to convey 
through the Chairman or through the 
executive directors. During the  
year, led by the Senior Independent  
Director, the non-executive directors 
have met without the presence of the 
Chairman (including to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance). 
The non-executive directors 
In addition to their responsibilities for 
strategy and business results, the non-
executive directors play a key role in 
providing a solid foundation for good 
corporate governance and ensure that no 
individual or group dominates the board’s 
decision-making. They each occupy,  
or have occupied, senior positions in 
industry, bringing valuable external 
perspective to the board’s deliberations 
through their experience and insight from 
other sectors enabling them to contribute 
significantly to board decision-making. 
The formal letters of appointment of  
non-executive directors are available  
for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. 
Election and re-election of directors 
In accordance with the Code’s 
recommendations, all directors  
currently in office, with the exception  
of Tim Clarke who retires with effect 
from 30 November 2017, will be 
proposed for election or re-election,  
as appropriate, at the 2017 AGM to  
be held in December. 
Board meetings 
The board held eight meetings during  
the year. Periodically, board meetings  
are held away from the corporate  
centre in London. During the year under  
review, the November meeting was  
held at the Allied Bakeries premises in 
Walthamstow, where the board met local 
management and were given a tour of 
the factory. In May, the board meeting 
was held at Primark’s regional office at 
Créteil, Paris and included a visit to the 
local Primark store. The board also held 
its July meeting away from the corporate 
centre and made a visit to Primark’s 
distribution centre at Islip. 
Senior executives below board level  
are invited, when appropriate, to  
attend board meetings and to make 
presentations on the results and 
strategies of their business units.  
Papers for board and committee 
meetings are generally provided  
to directors a week in advance  
of the meetings. 
The attendance of the directors at  
board and committee meetings during 
the year to 16 September 2017 is shown  
in the table below. Where a director  
was unable to participate in a meeting 
either in person or remotely, the 
Chairman solicited their views on key 
items of business in advance of the 
relevant meeting and shared these with 
the meeting so that they were able  
to contribute to the debate. 
Board committees 
The board has established three  
principal board committees, to  
which it has delegated certain of  
its responsibilities. These are the  
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
committees. The membership, 
responsibilities and activities of these 
committees are described later in this 
corporate governance report and, in the 
case of the Remuneration committee,  
in the Remuneration report which  
starts on page 75. Membership of these 
committees is reviewed annually. Minutes 
of committee meetings are made available 
to all directors on a timely basis. 
The chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration committees were 
present at the 2016 AGM and intend  
to be present at this year’s AGM to 
answer questions on the work of their 
respective committees. 
The written terms of reference for the 
Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
committees are available on the 
Company’s website (www.abf.co.uk)  
and hard copies are available on request.

Board composition 
At the date of this report, the board 
comprises the following directors: 
Chairman 
Charles Sinclair 
Executive directors  
George Weston (Chief Executive) 
John Bason (Finance Director) 
Non-executive directors 
Emma Adamo 
Ruth Cairnie  
Tim Clarke  
Javier Ferrán 
Wolfhart Hauser 
Michael McLintock (appointed  
1 November 2017) 
Richard Reid 
Tim Clarke will retire as a director  
on 30 November 2017. 
Emma Adamo is not considered by  
the board to be independent in view  
of her relationship with Wittington 
Investments Limited, the Company’s 
majority shareholder. She was appointed 
in December 2011 to represent this 
shareholding on the board of the 
Company. The board considers that  
the other non-executive directors are 
independent in character and judgement 
and that they are each free from any 
business or other relationships which 
would materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement.  
Richard Reid was appointed as an 
independent non-executive director  
in April 2016. The board considered 
Richard’s independence by reference  
to the relevant provisions of the Code  
and concluded that he is independent 
notwithstanding his past relationship  
with KPMG, which was formerly the 
group’s auditor. KPMG LLP ceased to  
be the Company’s auditor in November 
2015, following a competitive tender for 
the external audit. Richard was formerly  
a partner at KPMG, retiring from that  
role in September 2015. He had no 
personal engagement with any business 
within the Associated British Foods 
group during the four years prior to  
his appointment by the Company. 
Previously, before the four-year period, 
Richard was client liaison partner  
on behalf of KPMG for Associated  
British Foods, but at no time did he  
have responsibility for signing  
an audit report on the Company.  
Directors’ insurance 
The Company has in place appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance  
cover in respect of legal action against its executive and non-executive directors, 
amongst others. 
The work of the board during the year  
During the financial year, key activities of the board included:

His prior knowledge of the diversity and 
complexity of the group is of significant 
value to the board. Although the audit 
relationship between the Company and 
KPMG and the employment relationship 
between Richard Reid and KPMG ended 
within the last three years, the board 
concluded and is satisfied that, on the 
basis of the facts outlined above, the 
former KPMG relationship does not  
in any way compromise Richard’s 
independence. 
The Code requires that, if a director  
has served on the board for more than 
nine years, the board should state its 
reasons why it considers the director, 
notwithstanding his or her length of 
service, to be independent. Accordingly, 
the board has considered the 
independence of Javier Ferrán who, as at 
1 November 2017, had served 11 years 
as a director of the Company. Javier’s 
service and consequent knowledge and 
experience of the group, together with 
the invaluable retail experience he brings 
to the role, are highly regarded by the 
board. Notwithstanding his length of 
service and, having given due deliberation 
to the matter, the board is satisfied that 
Javier continues to demonstrate the 
qualities of independence and objectivity 
in carrying out his role as a non-executive 
director. The board considers that he 
continues to be independent in character 
and judgement and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, 
his judgement. Javier is offering himself 
for re-election at the annual general 
meeting and the board will continue to 
keep his independence under review. 
As at the date of this report, the  
board comprises the Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Finance Director and seven 
non-executive directors. Biographical and 
related information about the directors  
is set out on pages 60 and 61. 
Appointments to the board 
There is a formal and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of  
new directors to the board. Details are 
available in the Nomination committee 
report on page 69 which also provides 
details of the committee’s role  
and activities. 
Commitment 
The letters of appointment for the 
Chairman and the non-executive directors 
set out the expected time commitment 
required of them and are available  
for inspection by any person during 
normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office and at the AGM.  
Other significant commitments of the 
Chairman and non-executive directors  
are disclosed on appointment and  
require approval thereafter. 
Board development 
The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for 
the induction of new directors and the 
continuing development of directors. 
Board induction 
The Company provides all non-executive 
directors with a tailored and thorough 
programme of induction, which is 
facilitated by the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary and which takes 
account of prior experience and  
business perspectives and the 
committees on which he or she serves. 
Michael McLintock, who joined the board 
on 1 November 2017, will undertake an 
induction over the coming months.  
The aim of the programme will be to 
familiarise him with the way the group 
operates through its five strategic 
business segments, with its governance 
policies and procedures, with the legal 
and regulatory duties as a director of  
a listed company and with the group’s 
approach to corporate responsibility. 
Michael will be encouraged, as all new 
directors are, to accelerate his knowledge 
of the group by visiting a variety of its 
businesses and operations.  
Following his appointment in April 2016, 
Richard Reid’s induction programme 
continued during the year under review 
with meetings with members of 
operational and group management 
which included the Group Pensions 
Director, Head of HR at AB Sugar, 
Managing Director of British Sugar, the 
Head of Executive Development at the 
corporate centre and Primark’s Director 
of Ethical Trade. Richard also attended 
the British Sugar glasshouse opening  
at Wissington in April 2017. 
Training and development 
The Chairman has overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the directors receive 
suitable training to enable them to carry 
out their duties and is supported in this 
by the Company Secretary. Directors are 
also encouraged personally to identify 
any additional training requirements that 
would assist them in carrying out their 
role. Training is provided in briefing 
papers, such as the regular update from 
the Company Secretary as part of the 
board pack ahead of each meeting 
covering developments in legal, 
regulatory and governance matters, and 
by way of presentations and meetings 
with senior executives or other external 
sources. During the year, this included  
a briefing and update on the group’s  
anti-bribery and corruption policies  
and procedures. 
Information flow 
The Company Secretary manages the 
provision of information to the board at 
appropriate times in consultation with the 
Chairman and Chief Executive. In addition 
to formal meetings, the Chairman and 
Chief Executive maintain regular contact 
with all directors. The Chairman holds 
informal meetings with non-executive 
directors, without any of the executives 
being present, to discuss issues affecting 
the group, when appropriate. Regular 
management updates are sent to 
directors to keep the non-executive 
directors informed of events throughout 
the group between board meetings and 
to ensure that they are kept fully advised 
of the latest issues affecting the group. 
Board performance evaluation 
An evaluation to assess the performance 
of the board as a whole, its committees 
and the individual directors is conducted 
annually with the aim of improving  
the effectiveness of the board and  
its members and the performance  
of the group. 
Progress from 2016 evaluation 
During the year, the Chairman oversaw 
the implementation and progression  
of various recommendations arising  
from the 2016 and earlier evaluations, 
which included the actions set out in  
the table on page 66. 
   Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Progress on 2016 objectives 
Board support and meetings 
The use of electronic board papers was 
trialled and adopted for use at board and 
committee meetings.  
More time was allocated for reflective 
discussion and debate following  
divisional presentations. 
Non-executive directors 
The non-executive directors took up a 
number of opportunities to engage with  
the businesses, attending various key  
group events with staff to enable them  
to build a deeper understanding of the 
group’s businesses and people.  
In recognition of the fact that more 
involvement by the non-executive  
directors, with their collective broad 
business experience, could be of  
benefit to individual businesses, details 
of their respective areas of expertise  
and experience were collated and made 
available to the businesses to call upon 
where helpful. 
Risk management 
Following a request by the non-executive 
directors for greater visibility of emerging 
strategic risk, divisional presentations  
now include more detail in this regard.  
Succession and talent 
Greater emphasis and discussion time  
was given to the future shape of the board 
with input sought from all board members. 
Audit committee 
A few practical changes were implemented, 
following the appointment of a new 
chairman of the Audit committee in 2016, 
such as the introduction of a rolling calendar 
of agenda items, which have enhanced the 
running of the meetings and functioning of 
the committee.  
2017 evaluation 
Following the internal review carried  
out in 2016, this year the board 
commissioned an externally-facilitated 
performance evaluation. The review was 
carried out during the final quarter of  
the financial year with the assistance  
of Lintstock Limited (‘Lintstock’), a 
London-based corporate advisory firm 
which has no other connection to 
Associated British Foods. 
The 2017 review involved each board 
member and the Company Secretary 
responding to a web-based questionnaire 
designed by Lintstock together with the 
Chairman. The topics covered included 
the following: 
 The board – composition,  
expertise, dynamics, management  
of meetings, support, focus, strategic 
and operational oversight, risk 
management and internal control, 
succession planning and human 
resource management, and priorities 
for change; 
 Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration committees – time 
management, composition, processes 
and support, leadership, work  
and effectiveness of each of the 
committees during the year and 
opportunities to improve performance 
of the respective committee in the 
year ahead; and 
 Individual directors – assessment  
of individual contributions and 
opportunities for personal 
development, including a review  
of the Chairman’s performance. 
Lintstock prepared a written report  
based on the completed questionnaires 
which was discussed with the Chairman, 
with the review of the Chairman’s own 
performance being sent to the Senior 
Independent Director. The report was 
subsequently sent to board members 
and was discussed at the September 
board meeting.  
A list of recommended actions arising 
from this year’s evaluation is being 
implemented under the direction of the 
Chairman and includes those identified  
in the table below. 
Priorities for change identified from the  
2017 evaluation  
Board succession 
A continued focus on succession planning 
for board members was identified as  
a priority, with emphasis on the need  
for open discussion on the subject.  
Retail business 
Particular attention to be given to the retail 
business, including maintaining regular 
board time for discussing key projects, 
challenges and opportunities facing Primark. 
Risk 
Continuing to develop and enhance  
the understanding at board level of the 
group’s approach to risk management  
and the ongoing risk factors affecting  
group businesses.  
Based on the outcome of the 2017 
review, it was concluded that the board 
and its committees were continuing to 
function very effectively with a good 
balance of support, challenge and mutual 
trust between the executives and the 
non-executives. The directors were each 
considered to be making a valuable 
contribution and demonstrating proper 
commitment, including of time, to their 
respective roles.  
Conflicts of interest procedure 
The Company has procedures in place to 
deal with the situation where a director 
has a conflict of interest. As part of this 
process, the board: 
 considers each conflict situation 
separately on its particular facts; 
 considers the conflict situation in 
conjunction with the rest of the 
conflicted director’s duties under  
the 2006 Act; 
 keeps records and board minutes as to 
authorisations granted by directors and 
the scope of any approvals given; and 
 regularly reviews conflict authorisation. 
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting 
The board is required by the Code  
to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. In  
relation to this requirement, reference  
is made to the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities for preparing the financial 
statements set out on page 98 of  
this annual report and accounts. The  
board recognises that its responsibility  
to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment extends  
to interim and other price-sensitive  
public reports, reports to regulators, 
and information required to be  
presented by statutory requests. 
Business model 
A description of the Company’s business 
model for sustainable growth is set out  
in the group business model and strategy 
section on pages 8 and 9 and in the 
business strategies section on pages  
12 and 13. These sections provide an 
explanation of the basis on which the 
group generates value and preserves  
it over the long term and its strategy  
for delivering its objectives.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Going concern and viability 
After making enquiries the directors  
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for a period of at least  
12 months from the date of approval  
of these annual financial statements. 
Accordingly, and consistent with the 
guidance contained in the document 
titled ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial  
and Business Reporting’ published by 
the FRC in 2014, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing  
the annual financial statements. 
The Code requires the directors to 
assess and report on the prospects  
of the group over a longer period. This 
longer term viability statement is set  
out on page 59. 
Risk management and internal control  
The board acknowledges its overall 
responsibility for monitoring the group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems to facilitate the identification, 
assessment and management of risk, the 
protection of shareholders’ investments 
and the group’s assets. The directors 
recognise that they are responsible  
for providing a return to shareholders,  
which is consistent with the responsible 
assessment and mitigation of risks. 
The directors confirm that there is a 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the group 
and the operational effectiveness of the 
related controls, which has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report  
and accounts. They also confirm that 
they have regularly monitored the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems (which  
cover all material controls including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls) utilising the review process  
set out below. 
Standards 
There are guidelines on the minimum 
groupwide requirements for health and 
safety and environmental standards. 
There are also guidelines on the 
minimum level of internal control that 
each of the divisions should exercise over 
specified processes. Each business has 
developed and documented policies and 
procedures to comply with the minimum 
control standards established, including 
procedures for monitoring compliance 
and taking corrective action. The board  
of each business is required to confirm 
twice yearly that it has complied with 
these policies and procedures. 
High level controls 
All businesses prepare annual operating 
plans and budgets which are updated 
regularly. Performance against budget  
is monitored at operational level and 
centrally, with variances being reported 
promptly. The cash position at group and 
business level is monitored constantly 
and variances from expected levels are 
investigated thoroughly. 
Clearly defined guidelines have been 
established for capital expenditure and 
investment decisions. These include the 
preparation of budgets, appraisal and 
review procedures and delegated 
authority levels. 
Financial reporting 
Detailed management accounts are 
prepared every four weeks, consolidated 
in a single system and reviewed by senior 
management and the board. They include 
a comprehensive set of financial reports 
and key performance indicators covering 
commercial, operational, environmental 
and people issues. Performance against 
budgets and forecasts is discussed 
regularly at board meetings and at 
meetings between operational and  
group management. The adequacy and 
suitability of key performance indicators  
is reviewed regularly. All chief executives 
and finance directors of the group’s 
operations are asked to sign an annual 
confirmation that their business has 
complied with the Group Accounting 
Manual in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements and specifically to 
confirm the adequacy and accuracy of 
accounting provisions. 
Internal audit 
The group’s businesses employ internal 
auditors (both employees and resources 
provided by major accounting firms other 
than the firm involved in the audit of the 
group) with skills and experience relevant 
to the operation of each business.  
All of the internal audit activities are  
co-ordinated centrally by the group’s 
Director of Financial Control, who is 
accountable to the Audit committee. 
All group businesses are required  
to comply with the group’s financial 
control framework that sets out 
minimum control standards. A key 
function of the group’s internal audit 
resources is to undertake audits to 
ensure compliance with the financial 
control framework and make 
recommendations for improvement  
in controls where appropriate. Internal  
audit also conducts regular reviews to 
ensure that risk management procedures 
and controls are observed. The Audit 
committee receives regular reports on 
the results of internal audit’s work and 
monitors the status of recommendations 
arising. The committee reviews annually 
the adequacy, qualifications and 
experience of the group’s internal audit 
resources and the nature and scope  
of internal audit activity in the overall 
context of the group’s risk management 
system. The Director of Financial Control 
meets with the chairman of the Audit 
committee as appropriate but at least 
quarterly, without the presence of 
executive management, and has direct 
access to the Chairman of the board.  
Assessment of principal risks 
The directors confirm that, during the 
year, the board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that could 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. A 
description of the principal risks and how 
they are being managed and mitigated  
is set out in the Strategic report on  
pages 54 to 58.  
Annual review of the effectiveness  
of the systems 
During the year, the board reviewed the 
effectiveness of the group’s systems  
of risk management and internal control 
processes embracing all material 
systems, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, to ensure that 
they remain robust. The review covered 
the financial year to 16 September 2017 
and the period to the date of approval of 
this annual report and accounts. The 
review included: 
 the annual risk management review,  
a comprehensive process identifying 
the key external and operational risks 
facing the group and the controls and 
activities in place to mitigate them, the 
findings of which are discussed with 
each member of the board individually 
(refer to the risk management section 
on page 54 of the Strategic report for 
details of the process undertaken); 
 the report presented to the board 
during the year by the group’s Director 
of Financial Control on food safety and 
product recall procedures; and  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

68 
 the annual assessment of internal 
control, which, following consideration 
by the Audit committee, provided 
assurance to the board around  
the control environment and  
processes in place around the  
group, specifically those relating  
to internal financial control. 
The board evaluated the effectiveness  
of the management’s processes  
for monitoring and reviewing risk 
management and internal control.  
No significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified by the review and the 
board is satisfied that, where areas of 
improvement were identified, processes 
are in place to ensure that remedial 
action is taken and progress monitored. 
The board confirmed that it was satisfied 
that the systems and processes were 
functioning effectively and complied with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.  
Remuneration 
A separate Remuneration report is  
set out on pages 75 to 93 which  
provides details of our remuneration 
policy and how it has been implemented, 
together with the activities of the 
Remuneration committee. 
Articles of association  
and share capital 
Information in relation to share capital, 
the appointment and powers of directors, 
the issue and buy back of shares and 
significant interests in share capital is  
set out in the Directors’ report on  
pages 94 to 97. 
Relations with shareholders 
Shareholder engagement 
The board recognises its responsibility  
for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue 
takes place with shareholders. During  
the year, the board has maintained an 
active programme of engagement with 
investors, the purpose of which is both  
to develop shareholders’ understanding 
of the Company’s strategy, operations 
and performance and to provide the 
board with an awareness of the views  
of significant shareholders. At each  
board meeting, the directors are briefed 
on shareholder meetings that have taken 
place and on feedback received, including 
any significant concerns raised.  
The Chairman issues an invitation  
each year to the Company’s largest 
institutional shareholders to hear  
their views and discuss any issues  
or concerns. During the year, the 
Chairman held meetings with a  
number of institutional shareholders  
and discussed a range of topics  
including the Company’s strategy  
and approach to governance and 
remuneration-related matters. 
On the day of the announcement  
of the final and interim results, the 
Company’s largest shareholders, 
together with financial analysts, are 
invited to a presentation with a question 
and answer session by the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director, with 
webcast presentations of the results 
available for all shareholders through  
the Company’s website. Following the 
results, the executive team hold one-to-
one and group meetings with institutional 
shareholders and potential investors. 
The Company Secretary acts as a focal 
point for communications on matters of 
corporate responsibility. During the year, 
the Company responded to requests  
for meetings, telephone meetings  
or written information from both  
existing and potential shareholders  
and research bodies on a broad  
range of environmental, social and 
governance risk matters including  
climate change-related matters, water 
and greenhouse gas risk management, 
supply chain management, animal 
welfare, sustainable agriculture, human 
rights, gender balance and human  
capital development. 
The Senior Independent Director is 
available to shareholders in the event  
that communication with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Finance Director has 
failed to resolve concerns or where  
such contact is inappropriate. The Senior 
Independent Director attended sufficient 
meetings with major shareholders  
to listen to their views in order to  
develop a balanced understanding  
of their concerns. 
The Company reports formally to 
shareholders in a number of ways. 
Significant matters relating to trading or 
development of the business, and routine 
reporting obligations, are disseminated by 
way of Stock Exchange announcements 
and by press releases. Interim results are 
announced in April each year and full year 
results in November, followed by the 
publication of the formal annual report 
and accounts. 
In line with best practice, the Company’s 
default means of communication is 
online although shareholders can opt  
to receive documents in paper form  
at any time. The Company’s website 
www.abf.co.uk provides current and 
historical financial information, including 
trading statements, news releases, 
financial results presentations, and a 
wealth of other information regarding 
Associated British Foods. 
Annual general meeting  
The 2017 AGM will be held on Friday,  
8 December 2017 at 11.00 am at the 
Congress Centre in London. The board 
considers that the AGM provides a 
valuable opportunity to communicate 
with private shareholders in particular 
about the general development of the 
business, enabling them to ask questions 
of the Chairman and, through him, the 
chairmen of the key committees and 
other directors. All members of the  
board are available to talk to shareholders 
after the meeting. 
A trading update is provided at the 
meeting and each year the Company 
shows a short film at the meeting 
highlighting a particular area of the 
group’s business. At this year’s AGM, 
the film will focus on the Ovaltine brand 
around the world. 
The Notice of AGM, which sets out in  
full the resolutions for consideration by 
shareholders together with explanatory 
notes, has been sent to shareholders  
and is also available on the Investors 
section of the Company’s website 
(www.abf.co.uk).

During the year and at the date of  
this report: 
Charles Sinclair (Chairman) 
Ruth Cairnie 
Tim Clarke 
Javier Ferrán 
Wolfhart Hauser  
 
 Primary responsibilities  
 
In accordance with its terms of 
reference, the Nomination committee’s 
primary responsibilities include: 
 leading the process for board 
appointments and making 
recommendations to the board; 
 regularly reviewing the board 
structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and 
diversity), recommending any 
necessary changes;  
 considering plans for orderly 
succession for appointments to  
the board and to senior management 
to maintain an appropriate balance  
of skills and experience within the 
Company and to ensure progressive 
refreshment of the board;  
 keeping under review the leadership 
needs of the group, both executive 
and non-executive, to ensure the 
continued ability of the group 
organisation to compete efficiently  
in the marketplace; and 
 being responsible for identifying and 
nominating, for the approval of the 
board, candidates to fill board 
vacancies as and when they arise. 
 
Governance 
Members of the Nomination committee 
are appointed by the board from  
amongst the directors of the Company,  
in consultation with the Chairman. The 
committee comprises a minimum of 
three members at any time, a majority  
of whom are independent non-executive 
directors. A quorum consists of two 
members being either two independent 
non-executive directors or one 
independent non-executive director  
and the Chairman. 
Only members of the committee  
have the right to attend committee 
meetings. Other individuals such as  
the Chief Executive, members of  
senior management, head of human  
resources and external advisors may  
be invited to attend meetings as and 
when appropriate. 
The Chairman does not chair the 
Nomination committee when it is  
dealing with the appointment of his 
successor. In these circumstances the 
committee is chaired by an independent 
non-executive director elected by the 
remaining members. 
The committee may take independent 
professional advice on any matters 
covered by its terms of reference at 
the Company’s expense. 
The committee chairman reports the 
outcome of meetings to the board. 
The terms of reference of the 
Nomination committee are available on 
the Investors section of the Company’s 
website (www.abf.co.uk). 
Board appointments process 
The process for making new 
appointments is led by the Chairman. 
Where appropriate, external, independent 
consultants are engaged to conduct a 
search for potential candidates, who  
are considered on the basis of their  
skills, experience and fit with the existing 
members of the board. The Nomination 
committee has procedures for appointing 
a non-executive or an executive director 
and these are set out in its terms  
of reference. 
Meetings 
The committee met three times during 
the year under review. 
Diversity policy 
As a board, we recognise that diversity  
is essential for introducing different 
perspectives into board debate and 
decision-making. We recognise  
moreover that a genuinely diverse board 
comprises individuals with a range of 
personal attributes, perspectives, skills, 
experience and backgrounds, who  
also represent differences in nationality, 
race and gender. The board has decided 
not to set any measurable objectives in 
relation to its diversity policy. However, 
candidates for future board appointments 
are considered from the widest possible 
pool. Gender remains an important 
aspect of the overall diversity, and it is 
our policy to ask any executive search 
agencies engaged to ensure that half  
of the candidates they put forward for 
consideration are women. 
Looking beyond the board to the group’s 
wider workforce we recognise that true 
diversity can only be achieved when  
the entire workforce is committed to 
delivering it. Given the decentralised 
nature of the group, policies to promote 
diversity in the workforce are developed 
and implemented locally within each  
of the businesses. However there are  
a number of ongoing initiatives across 
Associated British Foods which aim  
to promote diversity: 
 a groupwide gender diversity task 
force includes representation from 
across the businesses and has,  
as one of its principal objectives,  
the aim of ensuring that there are no 
barriers preventing talented people 
from succeeding; 
 senior and high-potential women are 
invited to join the Women’s Business 
Forum, which meets several times a 
year providing a chance for networking, 
learning and support for personal 
career development; 
 the ABF Two-way Mentoring 
Programme aims to grow the talent 
pipeline by matching high potential 
women, nominated by their business 
units, with senior leaders around  
the group who support their career 
development and broaden their 
business experience. In return the 
senior leaders have the opportunity  
to learn about another business or 
function, understand the perspectives 
of women working within them  
and develop their own listening  
and coaching skills; and 
 training in ‘unconscious bias’,  
which aims to build awareness and  
challenge commonly-held myths 
around diversity, has been included  
in the group’s leadership development 
programme for a number of years and 
has now been extended to a wider 
group of managers. 
Committee activities during the year 
Appointment of new independent 
non-executive director 
During the year, the Chairman led the 
process for the appointment of a new 
non-executive director as part of the 
progressive refreshing of the board.  
The services of external executive  
search consulting firm Spencer  
Stuart were engaged to help identify 
potential candidates. Spencer Stuart is 
independent, with no other connection   Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
70 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
70 
to the Company and is a signatory  
to the ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms’ on gender 
diversity and best practice. 
Potential candidates were considered  
on the basis of their skills and experience 
in the context of the range of skills  
and experience of the existing board  
as a whole. 
Following a rigorous process of 
interviews and assessments and, on  
the recommendations of the Nomination 
committee, the board approved the 
appointment of Michael McLintock  
with effect from 1 November 2017. 
Re-election of non-executive directors 
The committee reviewed the results of 
the annual board performance evaluation 
that related to the composition of the 
board and the time needed to fulfil the 
roles of Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and non-executive director.  
It was satisfied that all members of  
the board are devoting sufficient time  
to their duties. 
The committee considered the  
re-election of directors prior to their 
recommended approval by shareholders 
at the annual general meeting. The non-
executive directors who have been on 
the board for more than six years were 
subject to particularly rigorous review. 
Performance evaluation 
The committee’s effectiveness was 
reviewed as part of the board’s 
performance evaluation process which 
was carried out during the final quarter  
of the year under review. This evaluation 
concluded that the committee was 
continuing to function effectively.

Governance
 
 
71
Governance 
The Audit committee comprises a 
minimum of three members, all of  
whom are independent non-executive 
directors of the Company. Two members 
constitute a quorum. Appointments are 
for a period of three years after which 
they are subject to annual review, 
extendable by two further three-year 
periods so long as members continue  
to be independent. No members of the 
committee have served a term of more 
than six years. 
The committee structure requires  
the inclusion of at least one financially 
qualified member (as recognised by the 
Consultative Committee of Accountancy 
Bodies) with recent and relevant financial 
experience and competence in 
accounting or auditing (or both).  
The committee chairman fulfilled  
this requirement during the year. All 
committee members are expected to  
be financially literate and to have an 
understanding of the following areas: 
 the principles of, and developments  
in, financial reporting including the 
applicable accounting standards and 
statements of recommended practice; 
 key aspects of the Company’s 
operations including corporate  
policies and the group’s internal  
control environment; 
 matters which may influence  
the presentation of accounts and  
key figures; 
 the principles of, and developments  
in, company law, sector-specific laws 
and other relevant corporate legislation; 
 the role of internal and external  
auditing and risk management; and 
 the regulatory framework for the 
group’s businesses. 
The committee as a whole has 
competence relevant to the sectors  
in which the group operates. 
The committee invites the Group  
Finance Director, Group Financial 
Controller, Director of Financial Control 
and senior representatives of the external 
auditor to attend its meetings in full, 
although it reserves the right to request 
any of these individuals to withdraw. 
Other senior managers are invited to 
present such reports as are required for 
the committee to discharge its duties. 
During the year, the committee held  
four meetings with the external auditor 
without any executive members of the 
board being present. 
The committee has unrestricted access 
to Company documents and information, 
as well as to employees of the Company 
and the external auditor. 
The committee may take independent 
professional advice on any matters 
covered by its terms of reference at  
the Company’s expense. 
The committee chairman reports the 
outcome of meetings to the board. 
The committee’s effectiveness was 
reviewed during the final quarter of the 
year as part of the board’s performance 
evaluation process. A description of how 
the evaluation was conducted is set  
out on page 66 of the corporate 
governance report. 
The terms of reference of the Audit 
committee can be viewed on the 
Investors section of the Company’s 
website (www.abf.co.uk). 
Meetings 
The Audit committee met four times 
during the year. The committee’s  
agenda is linked to events in the  
group’s financial calendar. 
Activities during the year 
In order to fulfil its terms of reference, 
the Audit committee receives and 
reviews presentations and reports  
from the group’s senior management, 
consulting as necessary with the  
external auditor. 
Monitoring the integrity of  
reported financial information 
Ensuring the integrity of the  
financial statements and associated 
announcements is a fundamental 
responsibility of the Audit committee. 
During the year it formally reviewed  
the group’s interim and annual reports, 
including the associated pre-close period 
trading updates, and the trading updates 
issued for the first and third quarters. 
These reviews considered: 
 the description of performance to 
ensure it was fair, balanced and 
understandable; 
 the accounting principles, policies  
and practices adopted in the group’s 
financial statements, any proposed 
changes to them, and the adequacy  
of their disclosure; 
 important accounting issues or areas of 
complexity, the actions, estimates and 
judgements of management in relation 
to financial reporting and in particular 
the assumptions underlying the going 
concern and viability statements; 
 any significant adjustments to financial 
reporting arising from the audit; 
 litigation and contingent liabilities 
affecting the group; and  
 tax contingencies, compliance with 
statutory tax obligations and the 
group’s tax policy. 
In view of the increased risk to the 
control environment associated with 
Primark’s change of general ledger 
system, the committee reviewed the 
project plan and governance process  
pre-implementation; received regular 
updates from management and the 
project team before and after 
implementation; and reviewed the 
performance of the finance function  
post-implementation, including an 
evaluation of the robustness of the 
financial statement close process,  
with management, internal and  
external auditors. 
Significant accounting issues 
considered by the Audit  
committee in relation to the  
group’s financial statements 
A key responsibility of the committee  
is to consider the significant areas of 
complexity, management judgement and 
estimation that have been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements. 
The committee has, with support from 
Ernst & Young as external auditor, 
reviewed the suitability of the accounting 
policies which have been adopted and 
whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. 
Set out below are the significant areas  
of accounting judgement or management 
estimation and a description of how  
the committee concluded that such 
judgements and estimates were 
appropriate. These are divided between 
those that could have a material impact 
on the financial statements and those 
that are less likely to have a material 
impact but nevertheless, by their nature, 
required a degree of estimation.

72 
Areas of significant accounting judgement  
and estimation material to the group  
financial statements Audit committee assurance 
Impairment of goodwill, intangible  
and tangible assets 
Assessment for impairment involves 
comparing the book value of an asset with 
its recoverable amount (being the higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs to sell). 
Value in use is determined with reference to 
projected future cash flows discounted at an 
appropriate rate. Both the cash flows and the 
discount rate involve a significant degree of 
estimation uncertainty. 
The committee considered the reasonableness of cash flow projections which were  
based on the most recent budget approved by the board and reflected management’s 
expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margins based on past experience  
and external sources of information. Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by 
the annual budget were challenged to ensure they were appropriate for the products, 
industries and countries in which the relevant cash generating units operate. The 
committee also reviewed and challenged the key assumptions made in deriving these 
projections: discount rates, growth rates, and expected changes in production and sales 
volumes, selling prices and direct costs. The committee also considered the adequacy  
of the disclosures in respect of the key assumptions and sensitivities. Refer to notes  
8 and 9 to the financial statements for further details. 
The committee was satisfied that the discount rate assumptions appropriately reflected 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with  
the particular assets. The other key assumptions were all considered to be reasonable. 
The external auditor undertook an independent audit of the estimate of value in use, 
including a challenge of management’s underlying cash flow projections, long-term growth 
assumptions and discount rates. On the basis of their audit work, and their challenge of  
the key assumptions and associated sensitivities, they concurred with management that 
no impairments were required. 
Tax provisions 
The level of current and deferred tax 
recognised in the financial statements is 
dependent on judgements as to the 
outcome of decisions by tax authorities in 
various jurisdictions around the world and 
the ability of the group to use tax losses 
within the time limits imposed by the various 
tax authorities. See also reference to  
taxation on page 48. 
The committee reviews the Company’s tax policy and principles for managing  
tax risks annually. 
The committee reviewed and challenged the provisions recorded at the balance sheet  
date and management confirmed that they represent their best estimate of the likely 
financial exposure faced by the group. 
The external auditor described to the committee the work they had conducted during  
the year, including how their audit procedures were focused on those provisions requiring  
the highest degree of judgement. The committee discussed with management and the 
external auditor the key judgements which had been made. It was satisfied that the 
judgements were reasonable and that, accordingly, the provision amounts recorded  
were appropriate. 
Other accounting areas requiring management 
judgement or estimation Audit committee assurance 
Post-retirement benefits 
Valuation of the group’s pension schemes 
and post-retirement medical benefit 
schemes require various subjective 
judgements to be made including mortality 
assumptions, discount rates, general and 
salary inflation, and the rates of increase  
for pensions in payment and those  
in deferment. 
Actuarial valuations of the group’s pension scheme obligations are undertaken every three 
years by independent qualified actuaries who also provide advice to management on the 
assumptions to be used in preparing the accounting valuations each year. Details of the 
assumptions made in the current and previous year are disclosed in note 11 of the financial 
statements together with the bases on which those assumptions have been made. 
The committee reviewed the assumptions by comparison with externally-derived data and 
also considered the adequacy of disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the surplus or 
deficit to changes in these key assumptions.

Misstatements 
Management reported to the committee 
that they were not aware of any material 
or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular 
presentation. The auditor reported to  
the committee the misstatements they 
had found in the course of their work. 
After due consideration the committee 
concurred with management that these 
misstatements were not material and 
that no adjustments were required. 
Internal financial control  
and risk management  
The committee is required to assist the 
board to fulfil its responsibilities relating 
to the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the control environment, controls over 
financial reporting and the group’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. To fulfil these duties, 
the committee reviewed: 
 the external auditors’ management 
letters and their Audit committee 
reports; 
 internal audit reports on key audit  
areas and significant deficiencies in  
the financial control environment; 
 reports on the systems of internal 
financial control and risk management; 
 reports on fraud perpetrated against 
the group; 
 the group’s approach to IT, cyber 
security and whistleblowing; and 
 reports on significant systems 
implementations. 
Internal audit 
The Audit committee is required to assist 
the board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
for ensuring the capability of the internal 
audit function and the adequacy of its 
resourcing and plans. It reviews annually 
internal audit’s Guidelines and Operating 
Standards that outline the function’s 
unrestricted scope, its purpose and 
responsibilities to ensure they are 
appropriate for the Company’s needs.  
To fulfil its duties, the committee  
also considered: 
 internal audit’s reporting lines and 
access to the committee and all 
members of the board; 
 internal audit’s plans and its 
achievement of the planned activity; 
 the results of key audits and other 
significant findings, the adequacy  
of management’s response and  
the timeliness of their resolution; 
 statistics on staff numbers, 
qualifications and experience and 
timeliness of reporting; 
 the nature and extent of non-audit 
activity performed by internal audit; and 
 changes since the last annual 
assessment of the significant financial 
risks and the group’s ability to respond 
to changes in its business and the 
external environment. 
Whistleblowing and fraud 
The group’s whistleblowing policy 
contains arrangements for an 
independent external service provider  
to receive, in confidence, complaints on 
accounting, risk issues, internal controls, 
auditing issues and related matters for 
reporting to the Audit committee as 
appropriate. The Audit committee 
reviewed reports from internal audit  
and the external service provider and  
the actions arising therefrom. 
The group’s anti-fraud policy has been 
communicated to all employees and 
states that all employees have a 
responsibility for fraud prevention and 
detection. Any suspicion of fraud should 
be reported immediately and will be 
investigated vigorously. The Audit 
committee reviewed all instances of 
fraud perpetrated against the Company 
and the action taken by management 
both to pursue the perpetrators and to 
prevent recurrences. 
External audit 
Auditor independence 
The Audit committee is responsible for 
the development, implementation and 
monitoring of policies and procedures  
on the use of the external auditor for  
non-audit services, in accordance with 
professional and regulatory requirements. 
These policies are kept under review to 
ensure that the group benefits, in a cost-
effective manner, from the cumulative 
knowledge and experience of its auditor 
whilst also ensuring that the auditor 
maintains the necessary degree of 
independence and objectivity. The 
committee’s policy on the use of the 
external auditor to provide non-audit 
services is in accordance with applicable 
laws and takes into account the relevant 
ethical guidance for auditors. Any non-
audit work to be undertaken by the 
auditor requires authorisation by the 
Group Finance Director and the Audit 
committee prior to its commencement. 
The committee also ensures that  
fees incurred, or to be incurred, for non-
audit services both individually and in 
aggregate, do not exceed any limits in 
applicable law and take into account the 
relevant ethical guidance for auditors. 
The committee is required to approve  
the use of the external auditor to provide: 
accounting advice and training; corporate 
responsibility and other assurance 
services; financial due diligence in 
respect of acquisitions and disposals;  
and will consider other services when it 
is in the best interests of the Company  
to do so, provided they can be 
undertaken without jeopardising  
auditor independence. With effect  
from 18 September 2016, tax services 
including tax compliance, tax planning 
and related implementation advice may 
not be undertaken by the external 
auditor. The aggregate expenditure  
with the group auditor is reviewed by  
the Audit committee. No individually 
significant non-audit assignments  
that would require disclosure were 
undertaken in the financial year.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
74 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
74 
The Company has a policy that any 
partners, directors or senior managers 
hired directly from the external auditor 
must be pre-approved by the Group HR 
Director, and the Group Finance Director 
or Group Financial Controller, with the 
chairman of the Audit committee being 
consulted as appropriate. 
The Audit committee has formally 
reviewed the independence of its auditor. 
Ernst & Young LLP has provided a letter 
confirming that it believes it remained 
independent throughout the year,  
within the meaning of the regulations  
on this matter and in accordance with  
its professional standards. 
To fulfil its responsibility to ensure the 
independence of the external auditor,  
the Audit committee reviewed: 
 a report from the external auditor 
describing arrangements to identify, 
report and manage any conflicts of 
interest, and policies and procedures 
for maintaining independence and 
monitoring compliance with relevant 
requirements; and 
 the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor. 
The total fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP 
for the year ended 16 September 2017 
were £6.8m of which £0.5m related  
to non-audit work. Further details are 
provided in note 2 to the financial 
statements. 
Consideration is also given by the Audit 
committee to the need to include the risk 
of the withdrawal of the external auditors 
from the market in its risk evaluation  
and planning. 
Auditor effectiveness 
To assess the effectiveness of the 
external auditor, the committee 
reviewed: 
 the external auditor’s fulfilment of the 
agreed audit plan and variations from it;  
 reports highlighting the major issues 
that arose during the course of  
the audit;  
 feedback from the businesses 
evaluating the performance of  
each assigned audit team; and 
 a report from the Audit Quality Review 
Team of the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). 
The Audit committee holds private 
meetings with the external auditor after 
each committee meeting to review key 
issues within their sphere of interest  
and responsibility. 
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight  
of the external audit process, the Audit 
committee reviewed: 
 the terms, areas of responsibility, 
associated duties and scope of the 
audit as set out in the external auditor’s 
engagement letter; 
 the overall work plan and fee proposal; 
 the major issues that arose during the 
course of the audit and their resolution; 
 key accounting and audit judgements; 
 the level of errors identified during the 
audit; and 
 recommendations made by the 
external auditor in their management 
letters and the adequacy of 
management’s response. 
Auditor appointment 
The Audit committee reviews annually 
the appointment of the auditor, taking 
into account the auditor’s effectiveness 
and independence, and makes  
a recommendation to the board 
accordingly. Any decision to open the 
external audit to tender is taken on the 
recommendation of the Audit committee. 
There are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the Company’s current choice  
of external auditor. 
In accordance with the requirements  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and other changes to the EU and UK 
regulatory framework, the Audit 
committee undertook a comprehensive 
competitive tender for the external audit 
during 2015 and the appointment of 
Ernst & Young LLP to replace the 
Company’s previous auditors was 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
AGM and it was reappointed as  
auditor at the AGM in December 2016. 
Andrew Walton, the audit partner, has 
held his role since Ernst & Young LLP’s 
appointment in 2015. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied with the auditor’s 
effectiveness and independence and  
has recommended to the board that 
Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed  
as the Company’s external auditor for 
2017/2018. The Company has no current 
retendering plans. 
Compliance with the CMA Order 
The Company confirms that, during the 
period under review, it has complied  
with the provisions of The Statutory  
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.  I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration report for the year  
ended 16 September 2017 on behalf  
of the board.
This Remuneration report is split into 
two sections:
• our directors’ remuneration policy  
(as approved in December 2016); and
• the annual implementation report  
on remuneration.
Remuneration policy and 
shareholder engagement
In 2016 we revised our remuneration 
policy to better align with our business 
strategy. As a result of volatility in  
world and European sugar prices,  
we introduced an additional earnings 
per share measure into the long term 
incentive plan (LTIP). We also adopted  
a return on average capital employed 
modifier on the LTIP which adjusts the 
calculated LTIP outcome downwards  
if ROCE targets are not delivered.  
We increased shareholding requirements 
for our executive directors and 
introduced a deferred award of shares 
connected with the short term incentive 
plan (STIP). We consulted extensively 
with our largest shareholders and  
their representative bodies on our 
remuneration structure and, at last 
year’s AGM, we received a 98.35% 
vote in favour of our remuneration 
report and a 97.19% vote in favour  
of our remuneration policy. I would  
like to thank our investors for their 
constructive input and voting support.
We believe that the changes we made 
to the policy are working well. Ongoing 
volatility in sugar prices reinforces the 
rationale for the approach that we have 
taken on the LTIP and we are not 
proposing to make any further changes 
to our remuneration policy for either 
2017/18 or 2018/19.
2014/15 STIP performance range
In setting our incentive targets  
we have regard to the performance 
potential of the different parts of  
the business and of the whole.  
The on-target performance level for 
STIP is set at the start of each financial 
year and is at, or close to, the budgeted  
level of performance. The committee 
then sets a range around the target to 
both incentivise delivery of a stretching 
performance and allow for limited under 
performance due to events beyond 
management control. The range itself 
varies each year, taking into account  
the risks and opportunities facing  
the business.
Recognising that investors are keen  
to understand the degree of stretch  
in our incentive performance ranges, 
but mindful of the competitive 
sensitivity of such disclosure, we 
decided in 2016 to disclose the 
performance ranges that applied  
to our STIP on a retrospective basis. 
Targets relating to the 2014/15  
award are detailed in this year’s 
implementation report on page 88.
In 2014/15 Grocery, Agriculture, 
Ingredients and Retail all increased their 
profits. Sugar profit was substantially 
lower than in the previous year as a 
result of much weaker euro-denominated 
EU sugar prices but the business made 
great progress in reducing operating 
costs. The financial element of the  
STIP paid out at 38% of maximum and  
the individual performance element  
was just ahead of ‘on target’ for  
both the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director.
2016/17 performance  
and incentive outcomes
This year our performance has been 
strong, with good operating profit 
growth being delivered by the Retail, 
Sugar and Ingredients businesses and 
the Grocery and Agriculture businesses 
performed well in challenging conditions. 
Primark, in particular, delivered stronger 
profit growth than expected when  
STIP targets were set. Working capital 
was also well managed throughout  
the year. This is reflected in the 2016/17 
STIP outcome, where both financial 
performance measures were achieved 
at maximum as defined under the plan.
Our LTIP target range for allocations 
made in 2014 and vesting this year was 
set before a further decline in EU sugar 
prices resulted in a substantial fall in 
profit from our sugar business in 2015. 
This led to a fall in the group’s adjusted 
earnings per share that year making 
achievement of the three-year growth 
target by 2017 considerably more 
challenging. Some recovery in sugar 
prices in 2017, a focus on continuous 
improvement and excellent underlying 
trading performances across the group 
have driven growth in adjusted eps  
over the three-year performance  
period which has resulted in 51.02%  
of allocated shares vesting to the 
executive directors. We are pleased  
that our performance this year has 
resulted in this level of vesting after  
the low and zero vesting outcomes  
of the last two years.
2017/18 STIP and 2017-20 LTIP 
performance ranges
The performance range for 2017/18 
incentives has been set against a 
background of much lower EU sugar 
prices, an expectation of further growth 
for Primark and no material benefit from 
currency translation. Sterling weakness 
against the US dollar will continue to 
have an adverse transactional effect  
on Primark’s margin in the first half 
although a strengthening of the euro 
against the US dollar will benefit margin 
in the second half if current exchange 
rates prevail. The STIP performance 
range will be disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2020.
When setting the LTIP targets,  
the committee conducts an analysis  
of the challenges and growth 
opportunities across the group over  
the performance period. We believe  
the target eps ranges detailed on  
page 92 are stretching and that 
achieving the on-target level of 
performance will represent a good 
performance for our shareholders  
by the executive directors.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Annual statement by the Remuneration committee chairman This report
This report sets out:
• the remuneration policy that applies to executive and non-executive directors;
• how the policy, approved in 2016, was implemented;
• the amounts earned by our executive and non-executive directors in the year; and
• how we expect to implement the proposed remuneration policy in 2017/18.
The committee chairman’s letter, this introduction and the annual implementation report on directors’ remuneration  
(set out on pages 86 to 93) will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM. The vote will have advisory status in  
respect of overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration.
Compliance
Where information in this report has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP it has been clearly indicated. The report has been 
prepared in line with the requirements of The Large and Medium-sized Companies Regulations, the recommendations  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.
Role of the Remuneration committee
The committee is responsible to the board for determining:
• the remuneration policy for the executive directors and the Chairman taking into account remuneration trends across  
the Company;
• the specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual director;
• the overall policy for remuneration of the Chief Executive’s first and second line reports;
• the design and monitoring of the operation of any Company share plans;
• stretching incentive targets for executive directors to encourage enhanced performance;
• an approach that fairly and responsibly rewards contribution to the Company’s long-term success; and
• other provisions of the executive directors’ service agreements and ensuring that contractual terms and payments made  
on termination are fair to the individual and the Company, and that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated.
The committee’s remit is set out in detail in its terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and were last updated in 
September 2015. They are available at www.abf.co.uk/investorrelations, or from the Company Secretary’s office on request.
Members of the Remuneration committee
During the financial year and as at 7 November 2017, the committee comprised the Chairman, who was independent  
on appointment, and the following members, all of whom are independent non-executive directors:

 Michael McLintock joined the Remuneration committee on 1 November 2017.
George Weston (Chief Executive), Des Pullen (Group HR Director) and Julie Withnall (Group Head of Reward) attended all  
of the meetings of the committee. No individual was present when their own remuneration was being considered.
Remuneration committee advisors and fees
Following a competitive tender in 2003, Willis Towers Watson (WTW, then Towers Perrin) was selected to provide independent 
advice to the committee. The committee has retained WTW in this role because it values the robust data and continuity of  
advice provided over the long term. The committee remains satisfied that the advice from WTW is independent, thoughtful  
and challenging and so has not put this out to tender. The committee will keep this position under review.
WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting. The only other advice that WTW provides to the Company is in survey provision, job evaluation and remuneration 
benchmarking. The fees paid to WTW for committee assistance over the past financial year totalled £50,848.

76 REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration principles
Our remuneration approach takes into account our portfolio model, our market positioning for executive remuneration and our 
remuneration principles.
Alignment, accountability  
and doing the right thing
Our board is accountable for ensuring that the portfolio that we operate is the right one to  
deliver optimal returns to shareholders and for ascertaining that the businesses are well run.
Our remuneration policy aims to align executive rewards with shareholder value creation.
Line of sight We aim to align remuneration and business objectives through performance measures  
to which individuals have line of sight.
Clarity and simplicity We believe that executive pay should be clear and simple for participants to understand.  
The best way to achieve this is through alignment with business performance.
Fairness Total remuneration should fairly reflect the performance delivered and efforts made  
by executives.
Alignment to strategy
Our remuneration structure is directly aligned with our strategic goals so that pay supports what we are trying to achieve.
Operating model Strong balance  
sheet and investments
Role of corporate  
centre
Do the right thing Organic growth
The corporate centre 
agrees strategy and 
budgets with our 
businesses and closely 
monitors performance. 
Operational decisions  
are made locally.  
The corporate centre 
creates the framework 
for leaders to have 
freedom in decision-
making and ensures 
activities are supported 
and monitored.
The STIP personal 
targets for executive 
directors are aligned 
with the above.  
The ROCE and eps 
measures on the LTIP  
will be achieved if the 
divisions deliver on  
their strategies.
We manage our  
balance sheet to deliver 
long-term financial 
stability. We ensure 
capital funding is 
available to all of our 
businesses where 
returns meet or exceed 
defined criteria.
The robust management 
of the balance sheet 
ensures that we are  
able to deliver a  
strong performance.
The LTIP eps and  
ROCE targets hold 
executives to account 
for the performance 
outcomes of their 
investment decisions.
The corporate centre 
provides selected 
services and value- 
adding capabilities  
to the businesses.
Retention of the 
individuals with these  
key skills at the centre  
is critical to our success.
STIP and LTIP 
performance measures 
under the policy should 
ensure that outcomes 
are linked with 
successful performance 
outcomes resulting from 
management effort.
We manage the 
business for the  
long term.
In the short term we 
may make decisions 
that reduce profit  
or increase working 
capital. This impacts 
STIP outcomes.
The deferred awards 
mean that making the 
right decisions in the 
short term will deliver 
value through share  
price growth in the 
following years.
We will disclose the 
STIP performance range 
when the deferred 
awards vest. We will 
then be in a position to 
describe the short-term 
outcome in the context 
of its long-term impact.
We look for long-term 
opportunities to invest  
in the business.
We are committed to 
increasing shareholder 
value through  
sound commercial 
responsibility and 
sustainable business 
decisions that deliver 
steady growth in 
earnings and dividends.
The STIP deferred  
awards and LTIP shares 
will benefit from a 
dividend equivalent,  
paid at vesting. This 
gives closer TSR 
alignment. The number 
of shares vesting will 
reflect the outcomes  
of the decisions made in 
the performance period.

Governance REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
This report sets out our remuneration policy, which applied from the close of the AGM on 9 December 2016. The committee 
does not expect to revise the remuneration policy until 2019. For unvested share awards only, the provisions of the remuneration 
policy presented in the 2013 and 2014 Remuneration reports will continue to apply until such time as all long-term incentive 
awards granted under those policies have vested or lapsed.
BASE SALARY  
(100% CASH)
Element and purpose
To provide core reward  
for the role, recognising 
responsibility for setting  
and delivering the strategy.
Operation and link to business strategy
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following  
a significant change in responsibilities. Factors taken into account 
include market pay movements, the level of increases awarded  
to UK employees across the group and the impact of any increase  
on the total remuneration package. If there is a significant change  
in role scope, remuneration will be adjusted to reflect this.
Maximum opportunity
Increases will be aligned  
with those available for  
other UK employees.
BENEFITS  
(EXCLUDING RELOCATION  
AND PENSION)
Element and purpose
To provide a competitive  
and cost-effective benefits 
package appropriate to  
the role.
Operation and link to business strategy
Benefits are restricted to typical UK market levels for executive 
directors and include, but are not limited to, death in service payment, 
permanent health insurance, company car plus private fuel,  
family healthcare and, where relevant, fees to maintain  
professional memberships.
Maximum opportunity
The cost of benefits is not 
expected to exceed 10%  
of salary but is dependent  
on factors that can vary.
PENSION
Element and purpose
To provide a competitive 
retirement benefit in  
line with best practice 
standards adopted by  
major companies in the  
UK and continental Europe.
Operation and link to business strategy
Defined benefit (DB) pension arrangements – closed to  
new members
The current executive directors are members of the Company’s  
DB pension scheme. The scheme is designed to provide retirement 
benefits of around two-thirds of final remuneration at age 65  
(62 for John Bason). Both executive directors opted out of the 
scheme on 5 April 2006, but retain their accrued benefits. Since then 
they have earned benefits in an EFRBS. The EFRBS is designed to 
broadly mirror the provisions of the DB pension scheme.
Defined contribution pension arrangements
Future executive directors, who are not already entitled to DB pension 
arrangements at the time of appointment, will benefit from a defined 
contribution arrangement, with a Company contribution of 25%  
of base salary.
Cash alternative
Where a UK-based pension arrangement is not possible, or is not  
tax-efficient, a cash supplement equivalent to the normal pension 
contribution may be paid in lieu of pension contributions.
Maximum opportunity
For directors entitled to  
benefits under the DB scheme 
and/or EFRBS, a retirement 
benefit target of circa two-thirds  
of final remuneration is payable 
at normal retirement age.
Otherwise, executives may 
receive Company contributions 
(or cash equivalent) up to a 
maximum of 25% of base salary.
CASH SHORT TERM

over a one-year period.
Operation and link to business strategy
Performance measures and target-setting
Group financial performance is assessed against prime financial and 
strategic measures used across the group on a day-to-day basis to 
drive and monitor performance. The personal element of the STIP  
is based on personal targets aligned to our strategic goals.
The on-target performance level is set at the start of each financial 
year and is at or around the budgeted level of performance, taking  
into account any early re-forecasts. The committee then sets a range 
around the target to incentivise delivery of stretching performance.
Retrospective disclosure of targets
Achievement against financial targets will be disclosed after the  
end of the relevant financial year in that year’s Remuneration report 
and the performance range that applied to financial targets will be 
disclosed when the deferred awards vest.
Discretion, clawback and malus
Please refer to the notes that follow this table.
Maximum opportunity
STIP cash of 150%  
of base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, 
such as the appointment  
of a new Chief Executive,  
this could be increased to  
200% of base salary to correct 
any shortfall against market.  
Any increase would take into 
account adjustments in other 
elements of the package  
to ensure that the total was  
not excessive.

Governance NON-EXECUTIVE  
DIRECTORS’ FEES
Element and purpose
To attract and retain a 
high-calibre chairman and 
non-executives by providing  
a competitive core reward  
for the role.
Operation and link to business strategy
Non-executives
The Chairman and executive directors review non-executive directors’ fees every other year in the light  
of fees payable in comparable companies and by reference to the time commitment, responsibility and 
technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective board. Fees are paid in cash on  
a quarterly basis and are not varied for the number of days worked. Non-executive directors receive  
no other benefits and take no part in any discussion concerning their own fees.
The Senior Independent Director and committee chairmen are each paid an additional fee to reflect 
their extra responsibilities and greater time commitment. As the chair of the Remuneration committee 
and the Nomination committee is currently the Company Chairman, no fee is paid for these roles  
at present.
Chairman
The Remuneration committee (under the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director) reviews  
the Chairman’s fees, which are paid monthly in cash. In addition to his fee, the Chairman also receives 
private medical insurance for himself and his spouse.
Shareholding
We encourage our non-executive directors to build up a shareholding of at least 100% of their annual fee.
Expenses
We reimburse reasonable expenses incurred in travelling on behalf of the business. As HMRC regards 
travel to the head office as a benefit in kind, we pay any tax due on such expenses on a grossed-up basis.
Notes to the remuneration policy table
Malus and clawback
The committee may, at any time within two years of an LTIP vesting or STIP being paid, determine that clawback shall apply if  
the committee determines that performance outcomes were misstated or an erroneous calculation was made in assessing the 
extent to which performance targets were met. LTIP and STIP payments can be clawed back if the participant is found at any 
time prior to vesting/payment, including prior to grant, to have committed an act or omission which, in the opinion of the 
committee, would have justified summary dismissal.
As a condition of participating in the STIP and LTIP , all participants are required to agree that the committee may cause any STIP  
or LTIP award in which they participate to lapse (in whole or in part); and/or operate clawback under any LTIP or STIP in which 
they participate; and/or reduce any amounts otherwise payable to them; and/or require the participant to immediately transfer 
shares or cash back to the Company.
Discretion
The committee will apply discretion, where necessary and by exception, to ensure that there are no unintended consequences 
from the operation of the remuneration policy. The committee applies a robust set of principles to ensure that incentive outcomes 
are consistent with business performance and aligned with shareholder interests. Any material exercises of discretion by the 
committee in relation to the STIP and LTIP will be in line with scheme rules, or other applicable contractual documentation, and 
will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year’s annual implementation report.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
To encourage self-development and allow external insight and practice, the committee has determined that, with the consent  
of both the Chairman and the Chief Executive, executive directors may serve as non-executive directors of other companies  
in an individual capacity, retaining any fees earned.
How pay and conditions of employees were taken into account when setting the directors’ remuneration policy
The group is geographically dispersed and therefore subject to very different pay markets. As a result, it is difficult to make 
sensible comparisons with all employees across the group and the salaries of executive directors are therefore reviewed in line 
with the group’s UK employees. In December 2016, when the on-target salary increase for employees in the UK was between 
1.25% and 3%, the Chief Executive received a salary increase of 2%.
As outlined in the policy table, the committee limits the range of salary increases for executive directors to the range of increases 
available to UK-based employees unless there has been a change of role.
The executive directors have a greater proportion of their total reward package at risk than other employees. This means that  
in years of very good performance, the Chief Executive’s package increases proportionately more than that of other employees 
and conversely in years of lower performance it may be proportionately less.
The structure and principles of incentives are consistent further down the organisation. The committee is provided with data  
on the remuneration structure for two tiers of senior management below the executive directors and uses this information to 
work with the Company to ensure consistency of approach. In addition, the committee approves all share-based LTIP awards 
across the group.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
82 REMUNERATION REPORT The Company did not consult with employees when drafting this remuneration policy. Employees are able to feed back  
their opinions through employee opinion surveys or directly to the Company’s management.
Statement of consideration of shareholders’ views
Each year the chairman of the committee invites our larger institutional shareholders to discuss with him their views on  
the group’s remuneration, strategy and governance. The feedback received and our response is detailed in the letter from  
the Chairman at the start of this report.
The committee chairman is available to discuss with shareholders any remuneration matters that will help shape our policy  
and practice.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
Area Policy and operation
Overall As we may need to recruit future executive directors from outside the UK or from companies with  
more aggressive incentive policies than our own, the arrangements below are intended to provide  
the necessary flexibility to recruit the right individuals.
For internal appointments, awards in respect of the prior role may be allowed to vest according to  
the terms of the scheme, adjusted as relevant to take account of the new appointment. In addition, 
ongoing prior remuneration obligations may continue.
The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the subsequent annual implementation report.
We apply the same policy for new joiners as for existing executive directors.
Salary Salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate, based on their skills, 
experience and current remuneration, taking into account market data and internal salary relativities.
Relocation If a new executive director needs to relocate, the Company may pay:
• actual relocation costs and other reasonable expenses relating to moving house;
• disturbance allowance of up to 5% of salary, some of which may be tax-free for qualifying expenditure;
• school fees for dependent children where there are cultural or language considerations;
• medical costs for the overseas family, where relevant;
• one business class return fare per annum each for the executive, his/her partner and dependent 
children in order to maintain family or other links where an executive is recruited from outside the UK;
• reasonable fees and taxes for buying and/or selling a family home and/or appropriate rental costs; and
• any tax due, grossed up, on any relocation-related payments listed above.
Buy-out awards In addition to normal incentive awards, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited through 
an individual leaving their current employer. If a buy-out award is required, the committee would aim  
to reflect the nature, timing and value of awards foregone in any replacement awards. Awards may  
be made in cash or shares. Where performance conditions applied to a forfeited award, they will be 
applied to the replacement award.
In establishing the appropriate value of any buy-out, the committee would also have regard to the value  
of the other elements of the new remuneration package. The committee would aim to minimise the 
cost to the Company, however, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal maximum. Any awards 
would be broadly no more valuable than those being replaced.
Where possible, we would specify that 50% of any vested buy-out awards should be retained until  
the shareholding requirement is met.
Other elements Benefits, pension, cash STIP, deferred awards, LTIP and shareholding requirements will operate in line 
with the remuneration policy.
Non-executives Fees would be in line with the remuneration policy.
We would not pay to relocate a non-executive director to the head office location.

Governance Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Provision Policy and operation
Notice period 12 months’ notice by either the director or the Company.
Contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s offices. Contracts and service agreements are not reissued 
when base salaries or fees are changed. Pension arrangements have been amended, as described in the policy table, 
without reissuing contracts.
Non-compete During employment and for 12 months thereafter.
Executive  
directors – 
contractual 
termination 
payments
Resignation
No payments on departure, even if, by mutual agreement, the notice period is cut short.
Departure not in the case of resignation
Service contracts allow for the Company to terminate employment by paying the director in lieu of some or all of 
their notice period. The Company may determine that such a payment is made in monthly instalments or as a lump 
sum. A payment in lieu of notice will comprise the salary, benefits and pension provision that the director would 
otherwise have received during the relevant period. The Company is committed to the principle of mitigation and 
would reduce monthly instalments to take account of amounts received from alternative employment.
In limited circumstances, the Company may permit an executive director to work for us as a contractor or employee 
after the end of their notice period for a limited period to ensure an effective hand-over and/or to allow time for a 
successor to be appointed.
Settlement agreement
The committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This may include an 
entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the  
UK or in other jurisdictions. The committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of 
professional fees in connection with such agreements.
In this, or the above scenario, the committee may make reasonable payments in respect of outplacement and may 
also agree to provide other ancillary or non-material benefits in connection with departure (including for a defined 
period after departure) not exceeding a value of £5,000 in aggregate.
Relocation support Good leaver*
If an executive was recruited from overseas and relocated to the UK at the start of his/her employment, his/her 
repatriation may be paid.
Leaver due to resignation/misconduct/poor performance
No payment would be made.
STIP Good leaver*
The committee will consider making a payment pro rata for time and performance, for the financial year in which  
the termination/death took place. Any agreed payment will be made in the December following the year end.  
In the case of death, payment may be accelerated. This is consistent with the approach for other STIP participants.
Resignation
If an executive director ceases to be employed before, or is under notice when, full year results are published,  
no award will be made.
Leaver due to misconduct/poor performance
No payment will be made.
LTIP and deferred 
awards (shares)
Good leaver*
Where the performance condition on deferred awards has already been achieved and the award is subject to  
a service condition, it will vest at the usual vesting date.
For other allocations, the committee will decide the extent to which they vest having regard to the extent to which 
any performance condition is satisfied and, unless the committee determines otherwise, pro-rating to reflect the 
period from the start of the performance period until the date of cessation.
Such awards will vest on the normal vesting date or at such other date as the committee determines.
In the case of death, vesting may be accelerated. Awards or portions of awards that do not vest will lapse.
Leaver due to resignation/misconduct/poor performance
All conditional awards lapse.
Change of control of the Company
In the event of a change of control, all unvested awards under the LTIP would vest, subject to the committee taking 
into account the extent that any performance conditions attached to the relevant awards have been achieved and, 
unless the committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the performance period worked by the director prior 
to the change of control. For deferred awards, all will vest on the event of a change of control.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
84 REMUNERATION REPORT Provision Policy and operation
Non-executive 
directors – 
contractual 
termination 
payments
Appointment is for three years unless terminated by either party on six months’ notice. Continuation of the 
appointment is contingent on satisfactory performance and re-election at annual general meetings. Non-executive 
directors are typically expected to serve two three-year terms, although the board may invite them to serve for  
an additional period.
Our Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the 
preceding two annual general meetings. In any event, at this year’s annual general meeting, all directors are 
standing for election or re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Where an individual retires at the annual general meeting and does not stand for re-election, they are not paid  
in lieu of notice.
*  Good leavers are those leaving by reason of ill health/injury/disability/death, redundancy, retirement or because their employing company is being transferred 
outside the group or for any other reason determined by the committee.

  For all directors, the salary or fee shown reflects the fact that in the 2016 financial year there was a 53rd week. These numbers are disclosed on an accruals 
basis, consistent with the calculation of financial results. The actual cash amounts paid were in line with the annual amounts stated in the policy and 
implementation reports.
2
  For executive directors, the salary in the year is not the same as a weighted average of the headline salaries, since salary actually paid is reduced for pension-
related salary sacrifices. The benefit of these salary sacrifices is captured in the increase in pension entitlements for which a remuneration value is shown in the 
pensions column.
3
 The value of George Weston’s benefits comprised £14,161 taken in cash and £1,871 taxed as benefits-in-kind.
4
 The value of John Bason’s benefits comprised £14,161 taken in cash and £3,782 taxed as benefits-in-kind.
5
 The value of Charles Sinclair’s benefits is taxed as a benefit-in-kind.

  Comprises the annual bonus, which is paid in December in respect of the preceding financial year, and the value of deferred share awards calculated based on 
the average mid-market closing price over the last quarter of the 2016/17 financial year of 3060.82p. These shares are now subject to a two-year deferral period. 
For George Weston this comprises a cash element of £1,553,650 and a deferred award value of £624,989. For John Bason this comprises a cash element  
of £1,023,700 and a deferred award value of £411,619.
7
  No shares vested under the LTIP for 2013–16. 51.02% of the shares under the LTIP for 2014–17 will vest in November 2017. George Weston will receive 32,969 
shares and John Bason will receive 21,716 shares. As required by UK regulations, vesting under the LTIP for 2014–17 has been estimated using the average 
mid-market closing price over the last quarter of the 2016/17 financial year of 3060.82p. Vesting will be on 24 November 2017 and a figure recalculated for the 
actual share price on that date will be presented in the 2018 report.

Our financial performance has been strong this year, with good operating profit growth in the Retail, Sugar and Ingredients 
businesses. Primark, in particular, delivered stronger profit growth than expected when STIP targets were set. Working capital 
was also well managed throughout the year. This is reflected in the 2016/17 STIP outcome shown above.
Following a review of personal performance against specific objectives for the 2016/17 financial year, the committee determined 
that George Weston will receive 14.93% of salary in relation to performance that was good against set objectives, with our 
businesses performing well and a strong business response to the risks and opportunities that Brexit presents. John Bason will 
receive 15% of base salary for the individual element of the annual bonus, reflecting strong progress against objectives and in 
shaping the finance function for the future. Personal objectives set for each of the executive directors were closely aligned to  
the overall strategy of the group but additional details will not be disclosed because of commercial sensitivity.
Retrospective disclosure of STIP performance range
We will disclose the target ranges that applied to 2016/17 STIP awards once the deferred awards are released in November 2019, 
two years from the end of the annual performance period. We expect the directors to make the right decisions for the long-term 
performance of the business, even if this reduces their incentive pay-out under the STIP. This timing is deemed appropriate  
as when we do disclose the performance target ranges that applied, we wish to be able to add any commentary that will help 
investors to understand the performance outcomes. In most cases, this is not appropriate immediately following the end of the 
performance year as the information remains commercially sensitive at this time. For these reasons, we believe that this delayed 
disclosure is appropriate and in shareholders’ interests.

Governance STIP performance range 2014/15
The table below details the financial performance ranges that applied in 2014/15 and the calculated outcome, which was 
equivalent to 38.03% of maximum on the financial element. Personal performance outcomes were disclosed in 2014/15  
and were just ahead of target.

B = Working Capital as a % of sales 16.16% 15.10% 14.04% 15.16% x0.9887
A x B 49.44%
When this range was set, performance in the prior year had benefited from high European sugar prices. The committee spent 
considerable time determining what the appropriate approach to STIP target-setting was in an environment where budgeted 
performance was expected to decline slightly compared with the prior year outturn. Previously the committee had held a view 
that incentives should not be paid for performance that lagged the prior year. They concluded that, whilst this was a good 
approach, it should not hold in exceptional circumstances where external circumstances, such as sugar pricing, impacted on 
budget expectations. The threshold was set at a level that the committee felt was right for the business and fair to investors.
Long Term Incentive Plan – 2014–17
The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the committee. Awards are made annually, at the discretion  
of the committee, and eligible executives receive shares at the end of the performance period, subject to achievement of the 
performance measures.
For the 2014–17 cycle, after adjustment for a change in the way that sugar cane roots are accounted for, the adjusted EPS 
performance range was 120.11p for threshold vesting, 130.67p for target vesting and 141.94p for maximum vesting.
The board encourages management to take action, at the most appropriate time, for the long-term benefit of the business  
and the Remuneration committee reviews any impact this may have on incentive outcomes. This includes the restructuring  
and reorganisation of our businesses to ensure the optimisation of performance for the long term.
This year our executives have taken right and prudent action in restructuring some of the businesses but the cost of this 
restructuring, which has been charged in arriving at adjusted earnings per share, was greater than usual.
The Remuneration committee has examined the relevant costs in detail and decided that, in line with the discretion afforded  
to them under our remuneration policy, the measure used for LTIP purposes this year should not be reduced by the cost of  
this restructuring, over and above the typical annual level of such costs. The committee last exercised its discretion on the  
LTIP in 2013 when incentive outcomes were reduced.

LTIP allocations in 2016
Under the remuneration policy that was approved in 2016, conditional share awards were granted under the LTIP on  
12 December 2016. In addition, further awards were made during the year, following approval by the committee, to new  
starters or newly-promoted individuals who were eligible to participate. The share price used to determine the number of  
shares in an allocation was the average of the closing share prices on the five trading days immediately preceding the award  
date. All awards are settled using shares bought in the market.
The table below details the conditional share interests awarded to the executive directors during the year in respect of the 
2016-19 LTIP. The awards made were in line with the existing remuneration policy and are subject to performance conditions

88 REMUNERATION REPORT In setting this target, the committee took into account:
• the volatility present in many of the non-sugar markets in which the group operates;
• the scale of investment made in the pursuit of long-term growth;
• the results of the long-term incentives to date;
• market expectations;
• internal forecasts for the next few years; and
• advice from their appointed remuneration advisors.
As outlined in the remuneration policy, there will be a further two-year holding period in place for the net of tax shares after vesting.
Deferred award allocations in 2016
On 12 December 2016, the executive directors were allocated conditional deferred share awards. These were subject to  
the same financial performance measures as the 2016/17 STIP with vesting in November 2019, subject to continued service.  
As the STIP financial performance target was met in full, all of the shares will now be subject to the service period, ending in 
November 2019.

The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the eight years from September 2009 to 
September 2017, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.  
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
In addition, the table below the graph provides a summary of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive over the same period. 
For the purpose of calculating the value of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent 
with the ‘single figure’ methodology as defined in the applicable UK directors’ reporting regulations.

90 REMUNERATION REPORT At close of business on 15 September 2017, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of  
the Company’s ordinary shares was 3158p. During the previous 12 months, the market value ranged from 2361p to 3322p.
Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive
Between 2016 and 2017, the increase in the Chief Executive’s salary was 2% and the average increase in salaries for our  
UK employees was 2%–3%.
The total reward for the Chief Executive has increased since last year because the performance of the group has been particularly 
strong this year, resulting in a maximum payment on the financial element of the STIP.
The overall increase in expenditure on reward for all employees was 15%. This number is based on aggregate data presented  
in the table below, which include increases in headcount, as it is neither practical nor worthwhile, in a decentralised group of  
our size, to separate the increase in expenditure on incentives and taxable benefits.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received  
no compensation.
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received  
a fee of £111,000 in the 2016/17 financial year. He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas until 6 July 2017 and  
as chairman of the charity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.

94 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
94 
Introduction 
The directors of Associated British Foods 
plc (the ‘Company’) present their report 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 
2017, in accordance with section 415  
of the Companies Act 2006. The UKLA’s 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules and Listing Rules also require the 
Company to make certain disclosures, 
some of which have been included in 
other appropriate sections of the annual  
report and accounts. 
The information set out on page 98 and 
the following cross-referenced material, 
is incorporated into this Directors’ report: 
 likely future developments in the 
group’s business (pages 14 to 47); 
 greenhouse gas emissions  
(page 51); and 
 the board of directors and the 
Corporate governance report  
(pages 60 to 74). 
Results and dividends 
The consolidated income statement is  
on page 107. Profit for the financial year 
attributable to equity shareholders 
amounted to £1,198m. 
The directors recommend a final dividend 
of 29.65p per ordinary share to be paid, 
subject to shareholder approval, on  
12 January 2018. Together with the 
interim dividend of 11.35p per share  
paid on 7 July 2017, this amounts to  
41.0p for the year. Dividends are detailed 
on page 122. 
Directors 
The names of the persons who were 
directors of the Company during the 
financial year and as at 7 November 2017 
appear on pages 60 and 61. Subsequent 
to the year end, Michael McLintock was 
appointed as a director on 1 November 
2017 and Tim Clarke will retire as a 
director on 30 November 2017.  
Appointment of directors 
The Company’s articles of association  
(the ‘Articles’) give directors the power  
to appoint and replace directors. Under  
the terms of reference of the Nomination 
committee, any appointment must be 
recommended by the Nomination 
committee for approval by the board  
of directors. A person who is not 
recommended by the directors may  
only be appointed as a director where 
details of that director have been 
provided at least seven and not more 
than 35 days prior to the relevant  
meeting by at least two members of the 
Company. The Articles require directors  
to retire and submit themselves for 
election at the first AGM following 
appointment and all directors who held 
office at the time of the two preceding 
AGMs and, in any event, not less  
than one-third of the relevant directors 
(excluding those directors who retire 
other than by rotation), to submit 
themselves for re-election. The Articles 
notwithstanding, all directors, other  
than Tim Clarke, will stand for election  
or re-election at the AGM this year  
in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Details of unexpired 
terms of directors’ service contracts  
are set out in the Remuneration report  
on page 92. 
Power of directors 
The directors are responsible for 
managing the business of the Company 
and may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of 
relevant statutes, to any directions  
given by special resolution and to the 
Company’s Articles. The Articles, for 
example, contain specific provisions and 
restrictions concerning the Company’s 
power to borrow money. Powers relating 
to the issuing of shares are also included 
in the Articles and such authorities are 
renewed by shareholders at the AGM 
each year. 
Directors’ indemnities 
Three directors of operating subsidiaries, 
benefited from qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions provided by the 
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, 
ABF Investments plc, during the financial 
year and at the date of this report. 
The directors of a subsidiary company  
that acts as trustee of a pension scheme 
benefited from a qualifying pension 
scheme indemnity provision during the 
financial year and at the date of this report. 
Directors’ share interests 
Details regarding the share interests of 
the directors (and their persons closely 
associated) in the share capital of the 
Company, including any interests under 
the long term incentive plan and any 
deferred awards, are set out in 
the Remuneration report on pages  
88 and 89. 
Employees 
During the year under review,  
the group employed an average of 
132,590 people worldwide (2016 – 
129,916) of whom 46,299 were 
employed in the UK. The group’s 
business priority is to safeguard the 
wellbeing, development and safety  
of its employees and those who work 
with it. It also wants employees to have 
opportunities to grow and progress as 
part of an enjoyable career. While the 
group’s approach to human resource 
management is decentralised,  
with flexibility given to each of the 
businesses, as a group it abides by  
the following principles: 
 equal opportunities – the group is 
committed to offering equal 
opportunities in recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion 
to all people, including those with 
disabilities, having regard for their 
particular aptitudes and abilities.  
As a matter of policy, full and fair 
consideration is given to applicants 
with disabilities and every effort is 
made to give employees who become 
disabled whilst employed by the  
group an opportunity for retraining  
and for continuation in employment.  
It is group policy that the training, 
career development and promotion  
of disabled persons should, as far  
as possible, be the same as that  
of other employees;

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
94 
Introduction 
The directors of Associated British Foods 
plc (the ‘Company’) present their report 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 
2017, in accordance with section 415  
of the Companies Act 2006. The UKLA’s 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules and Listing Rules also require the 
Company to make certain disclosures, 
some of which have been included in 
other appropriate sections of the annual  
report and accounts. 
The information set out on page 98 and 
the following cross-referenced material, 
is incorporated into this Directors’ report: 
 likely future developments in the 
group’s business (pages 14 to 47); 
 greenhouse gas emissions  
(page 51); and 
 the board of directors and the 
Corporate governance report  
(pages 60 to 74). 
Results and dividends 
The consolidated income statement is  
on page 107. Profit for the financial year 
attributable to equity shareholders 
amounted to £1,198m. 
The directors recommend a final dividend 
of 29.65p per ordinary share to be paid, 
subject to shareholder approval, on  
12 January 2018. Together with the 
interim dividend of 11.35p per share  
paid on 7 July 2017, this amounts to  
41.0p for the year. Dividends are detailed 
on page 122. 
Directors 
The names of the persons who were 
directors of the Company during the 
financial year and as at 7 November 2017 
appear on pages 60 and 61. Subsequent 
to the year end, Michael McLintock was 
appointed as a director on 1 November 
2017 and Tim Clarke will retire as a 
director on 30 November 2017.  
Appointment of directors 
The Company’s articles of association  
(the ‘Articles’) give directors the power  
to appoint and replace directors. Under  
the terms of reference of the Nomination 
committee, any appointment must be 
recommended by the Nomination 
committee for approval by the board  
of directors. A person who is not 
recommended by the directors may  
only be appointed as a director where 
details of that director have been 
provided at least seven and not more 
than 35 days prior to the relevant  
meeting by at least two members of the 
Company. The Articles require directors  
to retire and submit themselves for 
election at the first AGM following 
appointment and all directors who held 
office at the time of the two preceding 
AGMs and, in any event, not less  
than one-third of the relevant directors 
(excluding those directors who retire 
other than by rotation), to submit 
themselves for re-election. The Articles 
notwithstanding, all directors, other  
than Tim Clarke, will stand for election  
or re-election at the AGM this year  
in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Details of unexpired 
terms of directors’ service contracts  
are set out in the Remuneration report  
on page 92. 
Power of directors 
The directors are responsible for 
managing the business of the Company 
and may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of 
relevant statutes, to any directions  
given by special resolution and to the 
Company’s Articles. The Articles, for 
example, contain specific provisions and 
restrictions concerning the Company’s 
power to borrow money. Powers relating 
to the issuing of shares are also included 
in the Articles and such authorities are 
renewed by shareholders at the AGM 
each year. 
Directors’ indemnities 
Three directors of operating subsidiaries, 
benefited from qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions provided by the 
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, 
ABF Investments plc, during the financial 
year and at the date of this report. 
The directors of a subsidiary company  
that acts as trustee of a pension scheme 
benefited from a qualifying pension 
scheme indemnity provision during the 
financial year and at the date of this report. 
Directors’ share interests 
Details regarding the share interests of 
the directors (and their persons closely 
associated) in the share capital of the 
Company, including any interests under 
the long term incentive plan and any 
deferred awards, are set out in 
the Remuneration report on pages  
88 and 89. 
Employees 
During the year under review,  
the group employed an average of 
132,590 people worldwide (2016 – 
129,916) of whom 46,299 were 
employed in the UK. The group’s 
business priority is to safeguard the 
wellbeing, development and safety  
of its employees and those who work 
with it. It also wants employees to have 
opportunities to grow and progress as 
part of an enjoyable career. While the 
group’s approach to human resource 
management is decentralised,  
with flexibility given to each of the 
businesses, as a group it abides by  
the following principles: 
 equal opportunities – the group is 
committed to offering equal 
opportunities in recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion 
to all people, including those with 
disabilities, having regard for their 
particular aptitudes and abilities.  
As a matter of policy, full and fair 
consideration is given to applicants 
with disabilities and every effort is 
made to give employees who become 
disabled whilst employed by the  
group an opportunity for retraining  
and for continuation in employment.  
It is group policy that the training, 
career development and promotion  
of disabled persons should, as far  
as possible, be the same as that  
of other employees; 
 health and safety – health and  
safety are considered to be equal in 
importance as any other function of the 
group and its business objectives, and 
the group is committed to providing a 
safe and healthy workplace to protect 
all employees, visitors and the public 
from foreseeable work hazards. The 
health and safety policy is available  
on the Company’s website at 
www.abf.co.uk; 
 harassment – sexual, mental or 
physical harassment in the workplace 
will not be tolerated. It is expected  
that incidents of harassment are 
reported to the appropriate human 
resources director; 
 
 
95
 human rights – the group provides 
opportunities that promote human 
rights and dignity every day through 
the employment created, both directly 
and indirectly in its global supply chains 
and through the positive contribution 
its products make to people’s lives. 
Ongoing engagement and collaboration 
with a broad range of interested and 
concerned stakeholder groups is 
valued and Associated British Foods  
is active in its collaborative approach, 
seeking to remain sensitive to the  
risks of adverse human rights impacts 
resulting from its products, services 
and operations. While respecting all 
human rights throughout the business, 
six priority areas of focus to mitigate 
risk have been highlighted, namely: 
workplace safety; gender and diversity; 
slavery and human trafficking; supply 
chain; use of commodities; and access 
to water. It is, however, acknowledged 
that these may change over time due 
to the constantly evolving nature of the 
businesses and environments in which 
they operate. Further details on the 
group’s approach to human rights  
can be found in the 2017 Corporate 
Responsibility Update and our Modern 
Slavery Act statement which is 
available on the Company’s website 
at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility; 
 communication – employees and  
their representatives are briefed and 
consulted on all relevant matters on 
a regular basis in order to take their 
views into account with regard to 
decision-making and to achieve  
a common awareness of all the 
financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the 
group. Information relevant to  
the employees will be provided 
systematically to employees; and 
 security – the security of our staff and 
customers is paramount and the group 
will, at all times, take the necessary 
steps to minimise risks to their safety. 
Employees are provided with information 
on the performance of their local business 
and their involvement is encouraged  
in a variety of ways, such as through 
engagement surveys, business forums, 
executive leadership programmes and 
management presentations. At the group 
corporate centre during the year, a series 
of focus groups, confidential interviews 
and telephone discussions were held to 
explore ways to maximise the benefits  
of a diverse, inclusive centre. Key themes, 
findings and actions were subsequently 
shared with all departments, levels and 
centre locations. 
The group encourages an open culture in 
all its dealings between employees and 
people with whom it comes into contact. 
Effective and honest communication is 
essential if malpractice and wrongdoing 
are to be dealt with effectively. The 
group’s whistleblowing procedures set 
out guidelines for individuals who feel they 
need to raise certain issues in confidence 
with the Company or their own business. 
Every effort is made to protect the 
confidentiality of those who raise 
concerns, and employees may come 
forward without fear for their position.

Rule 9.8.4R

Relationship agreement with 
controlling shareholders 
Any person who exercises or controls,  
on their own or together with any person 
with whom they are acting in concert, 
30% or more of the votes able to be  
cast at general meetings of a company 
are known as a ‘controlling shareholder’ 
under the Listing Rules. The Listing  
Rules require companies with controlling 
shareholders to enter into an agreement 
which is intended to ensure that the 
controlling shareholders comply with 
certain independence provisions in the 
Listing Rules and which must contain 
undertakings that: 
 transactions and arrangements with 
the controlling shareholder (and/or any 
of its associates) will be conducted at 
arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms; 
 neither the controlling shareholder  
nor any of its associates will take any 
action that would have the effect of 
preventing the listed company from 
complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and 
 neither the controlling shareholder nor 
any of its associates will propose or 
procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears 
to be intended to circumvent the 
proper application of the Listing Rules. 
Wittington Investments Limited 
(‘Wittington’) and, through their control  
of Wittington, the trustees of the Garfield 
Weston Foundation (the ’Foundation’) are 
controlling shareholders of the Company. 
Certain other individuals, including certain 
members of the Weston family who hold 
shares in the Company (and including  
two of the Company’s directors, George 
Weston and Emma Adamo) are, under  
the Listing Rules, treated as acting in 
concert with Wittington and the trustees 
of the Foundation and are therefore also 
treated as controlling shareholders of the 
Company. Wittington, the trustees of the 
Foundation and these individuals together 
comprise the controlling shareholders of 
the Company and, at 16 September 2017, 
had a combined interest in approximately 
59.15% of the Company’s voting rights. 
The board confirms that, in accordance 
with the Listing Rules, on 14 November 
2014 the Company entered into a 
relationship agreement with Wittington 
and the trustees of the Foundation 
containing the required undertakings  
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’). Under 
the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
Wittington has agreed to procure 
compliance with the undertakings by  
the other individuals who are treated as 
controlling shareholders (the ‘Non-signing 
Controlling Shareholders’). The board 
confirms that, during the period  
under review: 
 the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in 
the Relationship Agreement;  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 so far as the Company is aware,  
the independence provisions included  
in the Relationship Agreement have  
been complied with by the controlling 
shareholders and their associates; and 
 so far as the Company is aware,  
the procurement obligation included  
in the Relationship Agreement  
as regards compliance with the 
independence provisions by the  
Non-signing Controlling Shareholders 
and their associates, has been 
complied with by Wittington.

Company’s ordinary shares are set  
out above. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s share capital 
and the rights attached to the Company’s 
shares are set out in note 20 on page 135. 
The Company has one class of share

/22p. The 
rights and obligations attaching to these 
shares are governed by English law and 
the Company’s Articles. 
No shareholder holds securities carrying 
special rights with regard to the control  
of the Company. There are no restrictions 
on voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the holding 
or transfer of the ordinary shares other 
than the standard restrictions for an 
English incorporated company set out  
in article 32 of the Company’s Articles. 
Authority to issue shares 
At the last AGM, held on 9 December 
2016, authority was given to the directors 
to allot unissued relevant securities in the 
Company up to a maximum of an amount 
equivalent to two-thirds of the shares in 
issue (of which one-third must be offered 
by way of rights issue). This authority 
expires on the date of this year’s AGM  
to be held on 8 December 2017. No such 
shares have been issued. The directors 
propose to renew this authority at the 
2017 AGM for the forthcoming year. 
A further special resolution passed at the 
2016 meeting granted authority to the 
directors to allot equity securities in the 
Company for cash, without regard to the 
pre-emption provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. This authority also expires  
on the date of the 2017 AGM and the 
directors will seek to renew this authority 
for the forthcoming year. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
The Companies Act 2006 empowers  
the Company to purchase its own shares 
subject to the necessary shareholder 
approval. The Company has no existing 
authority to purchase its own shares. 
Amendment to Company’s  
articles of association  
Any amendments to the Articles may be 
made in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 by way of 
special resolution of the shareholders. 
Significant agreements –  
change of control 
The group has contractual arrangements 
with many parties including directors, 
employees, customers, suppliers 
and banking groups. The following 
arrangements are considered to be 
significant in terms of their potential 
impact on the business of the group  
as a whole and could alter or terminate  
on a change of control of the Company: 
 the group has a number of borrowing 
facilities provided by various banking 
groups. These facility agreements 
generally include change of control 
provisions which, in the event of a 
change in ownership of the Company, 
could result in their renegotiation or 
withdrawal. The most significant of 
these are the £1.2bn syndicated loan 
facility signed on 15 July 2014 which 
was undrawn at the year end; and 
 in addition to these bank facilities,  
the Company has in issue £558m of 
private placement notes to institutional 
investors. In accordance with the 
scheduled maturities, £15m private 
placement notes were repaid in  
March 2017. In the event of a change  
in ownership of the Company, the 
Company is obliged to make an  
offer of immediate repayment to  
the remaining note holders. 
There are no agreements between  
the Company and its directors or 
employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs as a result of a takeover bid. 
Political donations 
During the year, the Company did not 
make any political donations or incur any 
political expenditure in the UK or EU. 
At the AGM this year, shareholders will 
be asked to give authority under Part 14 
of the Companies Act, for the period of 
one year, for the Company (and its 
subsidiaries) to make political donations 
and incur political expenditure up to a 
maximum aggregate sum of £100,000. 
The Company has a longstanding policy 
not to make political donations or to incur 
political expenditure (within the ordinary 
meaning of those words) and the 
directors have no intention of changing 
that policy. However, as the definitions 
used in the Companies Act 2006 are 
broad, it is possible that normal activities 
which might not be thought to be political 
expenditure in the usual sense could be 
caught. The authority is therefore being 
sought purely as a precaution.  
Financial risk management 
Details of the group’s use of financial 
instruments, together with information 
on our risk objectives and policies, 
including the policy for hedging each 
major type of forecasted transaction  
for which hedge accounting is used,  
and our exposure to price, credit, liquidity, 
cash flow and interest rate risks, can  
be found in note 24 on pages 138 to 147. 
Research and development 
Innovative use of existing and emerging 
technologies will continue to be crucial  
to the successful development of new 
products and processes for the group.

The directors are responsible for

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. 
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report and accounts, in relation to which the  
ISAs (UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to: 
 the disclosures in the annual report and accounts, set out on pages 55 to 58, that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated; 
 the directors’ confirmation, set out on page 67 in the annual report and accounts, that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; 
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 67 in the financial statements, about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; 
 whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or  
 the directors’ explanation, set out on page 59 in the annual report and accounts, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over  
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due  
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context  
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  
these matters. 
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations 
communicated to the  
Audit committee  
Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill, 
other intangible assets and property,  
plant and equipment (£6,884 million, 2016: 
£6,493 million) 
The group has a significant value of goodwill, 
other intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment that has arisen from acquisitions  
and capital investments. The UK Bakeries  
(£260 million), AB Mauri (£745 million) and 
Australian meat (£157 million) businesses  
have all experienced challenging trading 
environments in recent years.  
The UK Bakeries and Australian meat businesses 
operate in environments of significant retailer 
pressure on price and competitor activity. 
AB Mauri’s profitability has been impacted by 
competitive pricing pressures in some of its 
businesses compounded by macro-economic 
conditions, including high inflation rates and 
currency devaluations.  
There is a risk that these cash generating  
units (‘CGUs’) may not achieve the anticipated 
business performance to support their carrying 
value, leading to an impairment charge that  
has not been recognised by management. 
Significant judgement is required in forecasting 
the future cash flows of each CGU, together  
with the rate at which they are discounted. 
Refer to the audit committee report (page 72); 
accounting policies (page 115); accounting 
estimates and judgements (page 116); and notes 
8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements  
(pages 124 to 127). 
We understood the methodology applied by management 
in performing its impairment test for each of the relevant 
CGUs and walked through the controls over the process. 
For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which the  
key inputs and assumptions would need to fluctuate 
before an impairment was triggered and considered  
the likelihood of this occurring. We performed our own 
sensitivities on the group’s forecasts and determined 
whether adequate headroom remained. 
For CGUs where there were indicators of impairment  
or low levels of headroom, including the three  
CGUs described, we performed detailed testing to 
critically assess and corroborate the key inputs to  
the valuations, including: 
 analysing the historical accuracy of budgets to actual 
results to determine whether forecast cash flows  
are reliable based on past experience; 
 for certain CGUs, visiting factories to better understand 
the operations and to assess the ability to achieve 
forecast volume growth, operational improvements  
and production yields; 
 corroborating the discount rate used by obtaining  
the underlying data used in the calculation and 
benchmarking it against market data and comparable 
organisations; and 
 validating the growth rates assumed by comparing 
them to economic and industry forecasts. 
We assessed the disclosures in notes 8 and 9 against  
the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, in 
particular in respect of the requirement to disclose  
further sensitivities for CGUs where a reasonably possible 
change in a key assumption would cause an impairment.  
For the AB Mauri CGU, the audit procedures performed 
to address this risk were performed by the group audit 
team. The Australian meat and UK Bakeries operating 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were 
subject to full scope audit procedures by the respective 
component teams, and reviewed by the group team. 
We agreed with 
management’s conclusion 
that no impairments were 
required, based on the 
results of our work. Of  
the group’s assets, the 
portion relating to the UK 
Bakeries business is very 
sensitive to reasonably 
possible changes in key 
assumptions. Management 
describes these 
sensitivities appropriately  
in the property, plant and 
equipment note to the 
group financial statements, 
in accordance with IAS 36. 
Similar disclosures have 
also been made for the AB 
Mauri and Australian meat 
businesses given their 
levels of sensitivities.   Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

101
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations 
communicated to the  
Audit committee  
Tax provisions (included within the income  
tax liability of £170 million, 2016: £147 million) 
The global nature of the group’s operations 
results in complexities in the payment of and 
accounting for tax.  
Management applies judgement in assessing  
tax exposures in each jurisdiction, many of  
which require interpretation of local tax laws.  
Given this judgement, there is a risk that tax 
provisions are misstated.  
Refer to the audit committee report (page 72); 
accounting policies (page 114); accounting 
estimates and judgements (page 116); and  
note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 
(page 122). 
 
We understood: 
 the group’s process for determining the completeness 
and measurement of provisions for tax; 
 the methodology for the calculation of the tax  
charge; and 
 management’s controls over tax reporting.  
The group audit team, including tax specialists, evaluated 
the tax positions taken by management in each significant 
jurisdiction in the context of local tax law, correspondence 
with tax authorities and the status of any tax audits.  
Our work utilised additional support from country tax 
specialists in Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Spain  
and the US. 
We assessed the group’s transfer pricing judgements, 
considering the way in which we observed the group’s 
businesses operating and the correspondence and 
agreements reached with tax authorities. 
We consider the amounts 
provided to be within  
an acceptable range in  
the context of the group’s 
overall tax exposures  
and our materiality. 
Revenue recognition, including the risk  
of management override (£15,357 million,  
2016: £13,399 million) 
There continues to be pressure on the group  
to meet expectations and targets. Management 
reward and incentive schemes based on 
achieving profit targets may also place  
pressure to manipulate revenue recognition. 
The majority of the group’s sales arrangements 
are generally straightforward, being on a point  
of sale basis and requiring little judgement to  
be exercised. However, in the Grocery segment, 
management estimates the level of trade 
promotions and rebates to be applied to its  
sales to customers, adding a level of judgement  
to revenue recognition. Approximately 3%  
(2016: 4%) of the group’s gross revenue  
is subject to such arrangements. 
There is a risk that management may override 
controls to intentionally misstate revenue 
transactions, either through the judgements  
made in estimating rebates in the Grocery 
segment or by recording fictitious revenue 
transactions across the business.  
Refer to the accounting policies (page 113);  
and note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements (pages 117 to 119). 
 
We understood each business’s revenue recognition 
policies and how they are applied, including the relevant 
controls, and tested controls over revenue recognition 
where appropriate.  
We discussed key contractual arrangements with 
management and obtained relevant documentation, 
including in respect of rebate and returns arrangements. 
Where rebate arrangements existed, we obtained  
third party confirmations or performed appropriate 
alternative procedures, including review of contracts  
and recalculation of rebates. We also performed hindsight 
analysis over changes to prior period rebate estimates  
to challenge the assumptions made, including assessing 
the estimates for evidence of management bias.  
For a number of businesses, including Primark, as part  
of our overall revenue recognition testing we used data 
analysis tools on 100% of revenue transactions in the 
year to test the correlation of revenue to cash receipts  
to verify the occurrence of revenue. This provided us  
with a high level of assurance over £10.8 billion (71%)  
of revenue recognised. For those in-scope businesses 
where we did not use data analysis tools, we  
performed appropriate alternative procedures  
over revenue recognition. 
We performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue 
transactions around the period end date, to check that 
they were recognised in the appropriate period. 
Other audit procedures specifically designed to address 
the risk of management override of controls included 
journal entry testing, applying particular focus to the 
timing of revenue transactions.  
We assessed the disclosures against the requirements  
of IAS 18 Revenue, in particular in respect of the 
requirement to disclosure rebate and returns 
arrangements. 
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures 
over this risk area in 94 locations, which covered 89%  
of the group’s revenue. 
Based on the procedures 
performed, including  
those in respect of trade 
deductions and rebates  
in the Grocery segment, 
we did not identify any 
evidence of material 
misstatement in the 
revenue recognised  
in the year.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations 
communicated to the  
Audit committee  
Changes in finance systems and processes, 
including the capitalisation of system 
implementation costs (New in 2017) 
We focused on this area as Primark, the group’s 
largest business, implemented a new general 
ledger system across its business. During any 
period of significant system change, there is  
an increased risk to the internal financial control 
environment. In addition, certain costs will be 
eligible for capitalisation as an intangible asset.  
The audit team focused its procedures on the 
following risks:  
 Data migration and integrity of financial reporting; 
 Inappropriate capitalisation of costs as an 
intangible asset;  
 Inconsistent capitalisation of costs from  
year to year; and  
 Potential impairment of the total intangible 
asset capitalised in respect of the system 
implementation.  
Refer to the Audit committee report (page 71); 
accounting policies (page 114); and note 8  
to the consolidated financial statements  
(pages 124 to125) 
We performed the following procedures in respect of  
the implementation: 
 We inspected evidence, including reports to the group’s 
Audit committee, in respect of project governance, 
particularly in relation to key gateway decisions. 
 We understood the data cleansing process undertaken  
by management prior to migration and tested the  
data migration, including associated reconciliations. 
 We discussed and assessed the appropriateness  
of IT access and segregation of duties for all users. 
 We performed walkthroughs of new processes and 
understood the key IT dependent manual and IT 
application controls in the Oracle Financials system. 
 Whilst our audit strategy did not seek to rely on 
controls over the processes impacted by the change 
in finance system, in performing our substantive audit 
procedures we evaluated the robustness of Primark’s 
financial statement close process and tailored the 
extent of our procedures accordingly.  
We performed the following procedures in respect  
of the capitalisation of system implementation costs: 
 We evaluated whether the costs incurred were  
either expensed or capitalised in line with the 
group’s accounting policy and IAS 38. We also 
evaluated whether the policy has been applied 
consistently with prior years. 
 We tested a sample of costs, both expensed and 
capitalised, to third party evidence. 
 We assessed the useful lives of capitalised costs in  
the context of the group’s accounting policy and industry 
benchmarks. We also checked that the timing of 
commencement of amortisation was appropriate. 
 We evaluated management’s assessment as to 
whether there were any indicators of impairment  
for the costs capitalised. 
The audit procedures to address this risk were performed 
principally by the full scope component team in Ireland 
with oversight from the group audit team. 
Based on the procedures 
performed, we were 
satisfied that financial 
balances are appropriately 
stated following the  
new finance system 
implementation.  
In performing these 
procedures, we identified  
a number of control 
observations which  
are being addressed  
by management. 
We are also satisfied  
that the costs capitalised  
in respect of the system 
implementation

Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations 
communicated to the  
Audit committee  
Changes in finance systems and processes, 
including the capitalisation of system 
implementation costs (New in 2017) 
We focused on this area as Primark, the group’s 
largest business, implemented a new general 
ledger system across its business. During any 
period of significant system change, there is  
an increased risk to the internal financial control 
environment. In addition, certain costs will be 
eligible for capitalisation as an intangible asset.  
The audit team focused its procedures on the 
following risks:  
 Data migration and integrity of financial reporting; 
 Inappropriate capitalisation of costs as an 
intangible asset;  
 Inconsistent capitalisation of costs from  
year to year; and  
 Potential impairment of the total intangible 
asset capitalised in respect of the system 
implementation.  
Refer to the Audit committee report (page 71); 
accounting policies (page 114); and note 8  
to the consolidated financial statements  
(pages 124 to125) 
We performed the following procedures in respect of  
the implementation: 
 We inspected evidence, including reports to the group’s 
Audit committee, in respect of project governance, 
particularly in relation to key gateway decisions. 
 We understood the data cleansing process undertaken  
by management prior to migration and tested the  
data migration, including associated reconciliations. 
 We discussed and assessed the appropriateness  
of IT access and segregation of duties for all users. 
 We performed walkthroughs of new processes and 
understood the key IT dependent manual and IT 
application controls in the Oracle Financials system. 
 Whilst our audit strategy did not seek to rely on 
controls over the processes impacted by the change 
in finance system, in performing our substantive audit 
procedures we evaluated the robustness of Primark’s 
financial statement close process and tailored the 
extent of our procedures accordingly.  
We performed the following procedures in respect  
of the capitalisation of system implementation costs: 
 We evaluated whether the costs incurred were  
either expensed or capitalised in line with the 
group’s accounting policy and IAS 38. We also 
evaluated whether the policy has been applied 
consistently with prior years. 
 We tested a sample of costs, both expensed and 
capitalised, to third party evidence. 
 We assessed the useful lives of capitalised costs in  
the context of the group’s accounting policy and industry 
benchmarks. We also checked that the timing of 
commencement of amortisation was appropriate. 
 We evaluated management’s assessment as to 
whether there were any indicators of impairment  
for the costs capitalised. 
The audit procedures to address this risk were performed 
principally by the full scope component team in Ireland 
with oversight from the group audit team. 
Based on the procedures 
performed, we were 
satisfied that financial 
balances are appropriately 
stated following the  
new finance system 
implementation.  
In performing these 
procedures, we identified  
a number of control 
observations which  
are being addressed  
by management. 
We are also satisfied  
that the costs capitalised  
in respect of the system 
implementation  
are appropriate. 
The key audit matters as set out in the table above are consistent with those reported in 2016, with the exception of the inclusion 
of ‘Changes in finance systems and processes, including the capitalisation of system implementation costs’ to reflect the Primark 
finance system implementation in the year.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope  Involvement with component teams 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of 
materiality and our allocation of performance materiality 
determine our audit scope for each entity within the 
group. Taken together, this enables us to form an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
take into account the level of revenue and normalised 
profit before taxation, risk profile (including country risk, 
controls and internal audit findings and the extent of 
changes in management, systems and processes and 
the business environment) and other known factors 
when assessing the level of work to be performed  
at each entity. 
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the 
group financial statements and to achieve adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the 
financial statements, of the 605 reporting components  
of the group, we selected 184 components, which 
represent the principal business units within the group. 
Of the 184 components selected, we performed an 
audit of the complete financial information of 126 
components (“full scope components”) which were 
selected based on their size or risk characteristics.  
For the remaining 58 components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit procedures on 
specific accounts within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the greatest impact  
on the significant accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these accounts or their  
risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed full  
and specific scope procedures accounted for 92% of 
the group’s normalised profit before taxation (2016: 
93%), 89% of the group’s revenue (2016: 91%) and 
86% of the group’s total assets (2016: 92%). For the 
current period, the full scope components contributed 
82% of the group’s normalised profit before taxation 
(2016: 87%), 80% of the group’s revenue (2016: 81%) 
and 75% of the group’s total assets (2016: 76%). The 
specific scope components contributed 11% of the 
group’s normalised profit before taxation (2016: 6%), 
9% of the group’s revenue (2016: 10%) and 11% of  
the group’s total assets (2016: 16%). The audit scope  
of these components may not have included testing of 
all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant accounts 
tested for the group. 
Of the remaining 421 components (2016: 411) that 
together represent 7% of the group’s normalised  
profit before taxation (2016: 7%), none are individually 
greater than 1% of the group’s normalised profit before 
taxation. For these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, testing of 
consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations 
and foreign currency translation recalculations to 
respond to any potential risks of material misstatement 
to the group financial statements. 
The charts illustrate the coverage obtained from the 
work performed by our audit teams.  
 In establishing our overall approach 
to the group audit, we determined  
the type of work that needed to  
be undertaken at each of the 
components, by us as the group audit 
team, or by component auditors from 
other EY global network firms or by 
other auditors operating under our 
instruction. Of the 126 full scope 
components, audit procedures were 
performed on 77 of these directly  
by the group audit team and 49 by 
component audit teams. For the 58 
specific scope components, where 
the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined 
the appropriate level of involvement 
to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion  
on the group as a whole. 
During the period the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or other members of the 
group audit team visited 31 full and 
specific scope components in the UK, 
Ireland, Australia, the US, China, 
Germany, India, Mexico, South Africa 
and Spain. 
These visits involved meeting with 
our component team to discuss and 
direct its audit approach, reviewing 
and understanding the significant 
audit findings in response to the risk 
areas including asset impairment,  
tax provisions and revenue 
recognition, holding meetings with 
local management, undertaking 
factory tours and obtaining updates  
on local regulatory matters including 
tax, pensions and legal. For our visits  
to our Primark component team in 
Ireland we also discussed, directed 
and inspected key audit evidence  
in respect of the finance system 
implementation. The group audit  
team interacted regularly with the 
component teams where appropriate 
during various stages of the audit, 
reviewed key working papers and 
were responsible for the scope  
and direction of the audit process.  
This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at group  
level, gave us appropriate evidence 
for our opinion on the group financial 
statements.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements  
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.  
Materiality – “The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the  
nature and extent of our audit procedures.” 
We determined materiality for the group to be £60 million, which is 5% of profit before taxation, adjusted for the £293 million of 
profits less losses on sale and closure of businesses (‘normalised profit before taxation’). We believe that normalised profit before 
taxation provides us with the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the group, as the profits less losses on 
sale and closure of businesses are non-recurring and not related to the ongoing trading of the group. In 2016, we used a materiality 
level of £50 million, based on 5% of profit before taxation. 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and the actual normalised profit before taxation was 6% higher 
than the group’s initial estimates. However, due to the status of our procedures we did not change our materiality assessment  
to reflect this. 
Performance materiality – “The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce  
to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.” 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% of our planning materiality, namely £45 million. This is an increase from 50%  
(£25 million) in 2016 to reflect the fact that 2016 was our first period as auditor of Associated British Foods plc. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current period, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £1 million to £20 million 
(2016: £1 million to £11 million).  
Reporting threshold – “An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.” 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1 million  
(2016: £1 million), which is set at 2% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light  
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and accounts set out on pages 1 to 98,  
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated

consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained  
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a  
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

 Audit Committee reporting, set out on pages 70 to 74 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or 
 Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, set out on page 62 – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly  
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and  
 the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report  
to you if, in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 
Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, set out on page 98, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as  
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.  
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement  
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected  
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both  
those charged with governance of the entity and management.  
   Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
106 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
106 
Our approach was as follows:  
 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the 
most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate  
to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant  
tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain 
significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety, 
employee matters, food standards and food safety. 
 We understood how the group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit,  
those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through  
our review of board minutes, papers provided to the Audit committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies. 
 We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, 
by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility  
to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings  
or influence the perceptions of analysts. We considered the programs and controls that the group has established to address 
risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs and 
controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. 
These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements were free from fraud or error. 
 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations 
identified in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals 
and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, 
group management, internal audit, divisional management and all full and specific scope management; and focused testing,  
as referred to in the key audit matters section above. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 
Other matters we are required to address 
Following the recommendation of the Audit committee, we were appointed as auditor by the shareholders and signed an 
engagement letter on 20 April 2017. We were appointed by the Company at the AGM on 9 December 2016 to audit the financial 
statements for the 52 weeks ending 16 September 2017 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is two years, covering the 53 weeks ending 17 September 2016  
and the 52 weeks ending 16 September 2017. 
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the Company and we remain 
independent of the group and the Company in conducting the audit.  
The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit committee.

112 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2017
 
112
Associated British Foods plc (‘the 
Company’) is a company domiciled in  
the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company  
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 
2017 comprise those of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as ‘the group’) and the group’s interest  
in joint ventures and associates. 
The consolidated financial statements 
were authorised for issue by the directors  
on 7 November 2017. 
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared and approved by the 
directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’). 
The Company has elected to prepare  
its parent company financial statements 
under Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework. These 
are presented on pages 158 to 164. 
Basis of preparation 
The going concern basis has been 
applied in these accounts. The 
consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling, rounded to the 
nearest million. They are prepared on the 
historical cost basis except that current 
biological assets and certain financial 
instruments are stated at fair value. 
Assets classified as held for sale are 
stated at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. 
The preparation of financial statements 
under Adopted IFRS requires 
management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses and the disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities. The 
estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on experience. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. 
Judgements made by management  
in the application of Adopted IFRS that 
have a significant effect on the financial 
statements, and estimates with a 
significant risk of material adjustment 
next year, are discussed in Accounting 
estimates and judgements detailed  
on page 116. 
The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on a regular 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised from the period in which 
the estimates are revised. 
The accounting policies set out  
below have been applied to all  
periods presented, except where  
detailed otherwise. 
Details of new accounting standards 
which came into force in the year are  
set out at the end of this note. 
The consolidated financial statements  
of the group are prepared to the Saturday 
nearest to 15 September. Accordingly, 
these financial statements have been 
prepared for the 52 weeks ended  
16 September 2017 (2016 – 53 weeks 
ended 17 September 2016). To  
avoid delay in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements,  
the results of certain subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates are included  
up to 31 August each year. Adjustments 
are made as appropriate for significant 
transactions or events occurring between 
16 September and these other balance 
sheet dates. 
The group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Strategic report on 
pages 6 to 47. The financial position  
of the group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on 
pages 48 and 49. In addition, the Principal 
risks and uncertainties on pages 54 to 58 
and note 24 on pages 138 to 147 provide 
details of the group’s policy on managing 
its financial and commodity risks. 
The group has considerable financial 
resources, good access to debt markets, 
a diverse range of businesses and a  
wide geographic spread. It is therefore 
well-placed to manage business  
risks successfully. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements 
include the results of the Company and 
all of its subsidiaries from the date that 
control commences to the date that 
control ceases. The consolidated financial 
statements also include the group’s 
share of the after-tax results, other 
comprehensive income and net assets  
of its joint ventures and associates on  
an equity-accounted basis from the 
point at which joint control or significant 
influence respectively commences,  
to the date that it ceases. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by  
the Company. Control exists when the 
Company has the power, directly or 
indirectly, to direct the activities of an 
entity so as to significantly affect the 
returns of that entity. 
Changes in the group’s ownership 
interest in a subsidiary that do not result 
in a loss of control are accounted for 
within equity. 
All the group’s joint arrangements  
are joint ventures, which are entities  
over whose activities the group has  
joint control, typically established by 
contractual agreement and requiring  
the venturers’ unanimous consent for 
strategic financial and operating 
decisions. 
Associates are those entities in which  
the group has significant influence, being 
the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the 
entity, but which does not amount to 
control or joint control. 
Where the group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in a joint venture  
or associate, the carrying amount is 
reduced to zero and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of an investee. 
Control, joint control and significant 
influence are generally assessed by 
reference to equity shareholdings and 
voting rights. 
Business combinations 
On the acquisition of a business, fair 
values are attributed to the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired, reflecting conditions at the date 
of acquisition. Adjustments to fair values 
include those made to bring accounting 
policies into line with those of the group. 
Provisional fair values are finalised within 
12 months of the business combination 
date and, where significant, are adjusted 
by restatement of the comparative period 
in which the acquisition occurred. Non-
controlling interests are measured at the 
proportionate share of the net identifiable 
assets acquired. 
Existing equity interests in the acquiree 
are remeasured to fair value as at the 
date of the business combination, with 
any resulting gain or loss taken to the 
income statement.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
113
Financial statements
 
 
113
Goodwill arising on a business 
combination is the excess of the 
remeasured carrying amount of any 
existing equity interest plus the fair value 
of consideration payable for the additional 
stake over the fair value of the share  
of net identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired (including separately identified 
intangible assets), net of non-controlling 
interests. Total consideration does not 
include transaction costs, which are 
expensed as incurred. Contingent 
consideration is measured at fair value  
at the date of the business combination, 
classified as a liability or equity (usually as 
a liability), and subsequently accounted 
for in line with that classification. 
Changes in contingent consideration 
classified as a liability resulting other  
than from the finalisation of provisional 
fair values are accounted for in the 
income statement. 
Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of sales 
made to customers after deduction of 
discounts, sales taxes and a provision for 
returns. Discounts include sales rebates, 
price discounts, customer incentives, 
certain promotional activities and similar 
items. Revenue does not include sales 
between group companies. Revenue is 
recognised when the risks and rewards 
of the underlying products have been 
substantially transferred to the customer 
and when it can be measured reliably. 
In the food businesses, revenue from  
the sale of goods is generally recognised 
on dispatch or delivery to customers, 
dependent on shipping terms. Discounts 
and returns are provided for as a 
reduction to revenue when sales are 
recorded, based on management’s best 
estimate of the amount required to meet 
claims by customers, taking into account 
contractual and legal obligations, 
historical trends and past experience. 
In the retail business, revenue from  
the sale of goods is recognised when  
the customer purchases goods in store. 
Returns are provided for as a reduction  
to revenue when sales are recorded, 
based on management’s best estimate 
of the amount required to meet claims by 
customers, taking into account historical 
trends and past experience. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are accounted for  
using the effective interest method.  
The group capitalises borrowing costs  
directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying 
items of property, plant and equipment 
as part of their cost. Interest capitalised  
is taxed under current or deferred tax  
as appropriate. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are defined as items  
of income and expenditure which are 
material and unusual in nature and which 
are considered to be of such significance 
that they require separate disclosure  
on the face of the income statement. 
Adjusted profit and earnings 
measures 
Adjusted operating profit is stated before 
amortisation of non-operating intangibles, 
transaction costs and profits less losses 
on disposal of non-current assets. 
Adjusted profit before tax is stated before 
amortisation of non-operating intangibles, 
transaction costs, profits less losses  
on disposal of non-current assets and 
profits less losses on sale and closure of 
businesses. Both measures are shown 
on the face of the income statement. 
Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings 
per share are shown in the notes and  
are stated before amortisation of non-
operating intangibles, transaction costs, 
profits less losses on disposal of non-
current assets and profits less losses  
on sale and closure of businesses 
together with the related tax effect. 
Items as defined above which arise in  
the group’s joint ventures and associates 
are also treated as adjusting items for  
the purposes of adjusted operating profit 
and adjusted profit before tax. These 
items are identified in the relevant notes.  
Constant currency 
Constant currency is derived by 
translating the prior year results at current 
year weighted average exchange rates. 
Foreign currencies 
In individual companies, transactions  
in foreign currencies are recorded at  
the rate of exchange at the date of  
the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities in foreign currencies  
are translated at the rate prevailing  
at the balance sheet date. Any  
resulting differences are taken to  
the income statement. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense 
items are translated into sterling at 
average rates of exchange. 
Differences arising from the retranslation 
of opening net assets of group 
companies, together with differences 
arising from the restatement of the  
net results of group companies from 
average rates to rates at the balance 
sheet date, are taken to the translation 
reserve in equity. 
Pensions and other post- 
employment benefits 
The group’s pension arrangements 
comprise defined benefit plans, defined 
contribution plans and other unfunded 
post-employment liabilities. For defined 
benefit plans, the amount charged in the 
income statement is the cost of benefits 
accruing to employees over the year, 
plus any benefit improvements granted 
to members by the group during the 
year. It also includes net interest expense 
or income calculated by applying the 
liability discount rate to the net pension 
asset or liability. For each plan, the 
difference between market value of 
assets and present value of liabilities  
is disclosed as an asset or liability in  
the balance sheet. 
Any related deferred tax (to the extent 
recoverable) is disclosed separately in  
the balance sheet. Remeasurements  
are recognised immediately in other 
comprehensive income. Surpluses  
are recognised only to the extent that 
they are recoverable. Movements in 
irrecoverable surpluses are recognised 
immediately as remeasurements in  
other comprehensive income. 
Contributions payable by the group in 
respect of defined contribution plans are 
charged to operating profit as incurred. 
Other unfunded post-employment 
liabilities are accounted for in the same 
way as defined benefit pension plans. 
Share-based payments 
The fair value of share awards at grant 
date is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase  
in equity, spread over the period during 
which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the shares.  
The amount recognised is adjusted to 
reflect expected and actual levels of 
vesting except where the failure to  
vest is as a result of not meeting  
a market condition.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
114 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2017

Income tax 
Income tax on profit or loss for the period 
comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items taken directly to equity. 
Current tax is the tax expected to be 
payable on taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted during the period, together with 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the 
balance sheet liability method, providing 
for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes.  
The following temporary differences  
are not provided for: initial recognition  
of goodwill; initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities affecting neither accounting nor 
taxable profit other than those acquired in 
a business combination; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries  
to the extent that they will probably not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation  
or settlement of the carrying amount  
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only  
to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. 
Additional income taxes that arise  
from the distribution of dividends are 
recognised at the same time as the 
liability to pay the related dividend. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, 
except for other non-current investments 
and derivatives, are measured initially  
at fair value, plus directly attributable 
transaction costs, and thereafter at 
amortised cost. Other non-current 
investments (classified under non-current 
other receivables) comprise available-for-
sale investments measured at market 
prices where available. Where quoted 
market prices in an active market are  
not available, and where fair value  
cannot be reliably measured, unquoted 
equity instruments are measured at  
cost less impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
bank and cash balances, call deposits  
and short-term investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.  
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the 
group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the  
cash flow statement. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are used to manage the 
group’s economic exposure to financial 
and commodity risks. The principal 
instruments used are foreign exchange 
and commodity contracts, futures, swaps 
or options (the ‘hedging instrument’).  
The group does not use derivatives  
for speculative purposes. 
Derivatives are recognised in the balance 
sheet, at fair value, based on market 
prices or rates, or calculated using  
either discounted cash flow or option 
pricing models. 
Changes in the value of derivatives are 
recognised in the income statement 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting, 
when recognition of any change in fair 
value depends on the nature of the item 
being hedged. 
The purpose of hedge accounting is 
to mitigate the impact on the group’s 
income statement of changes in  
foreign exchange or interest rates  
and commodity prices, by matching  
the impact of the hedged risk and  
the hedging instrument in the  
income statement. 
Changes in the value of derivatives  
used as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised through other comprehensive 
income in the hedging reserve, with  
any ineffective portion recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
When the future cash flow results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or 
liability, the gains and losses previously 
recognised in the hedging reserve are 
included in the initial measurement of 
that asset or liability. Otherwise, gains 
and losses previously recognised in the 
hedging reserve are recognised in the 
income statement at the same time  
as the hedged transaction. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the hedging instrument expires or is  
sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on  
the hedging instrument recognised in  
the hedging reserve is retained in the 
hedging reserve until the forecast 
transaction occurs. Gains or losses  
on hedging instruments relating  
to an underlying exposure that  
no longer exists are taken to the  
income statement. 
Hedges of the group’s net investment  
in foreign operations principally comprise 
borrowings in the currency of the 
investment’s net assets. 
The group economically hedges foreign 
currency exposure on recognised 
monetary assets and liabilities but does 
not normally seek hedge accounting.  
Any derivatives that the group holds  
to hedge this exposure are classified as 
‘held for trading’ within derivative assets 
and liabilities. Changes in the fair value  
of such derivatives and the foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising on  
the related monetary items are 
recognised within operating profit. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill 
Non-operating intangible assets are 
intangible assets that arise on business 
combinations and typically include 
technology, brands, customer 
relationships and grower agreements. 
Operating intangible assets are acquired 
in the ordinary course of business and 
typically include computer software, land 
use rights and emissions trading licences. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill  
are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges. 
Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets from the date they are available 
for use. The estimated useful lives are 
generally deemed to be no longer than: 
Technology and brands – up to 15 years 
Customer relationships – up to 5 years 
Grower agreements – up to 10 years  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Goodwill 
Goodwill is defined under ‘Business 
combinations’ on page 112. Certain 
commercial assets associated with the 
acquisition of a business are not capable 
of being recognised in the acquisition 
balance sheet. In such circumstances, 
goodwill is recognised, which may 
include, but is not necessarily limited  
to, workforce assets and the benefits  
of expected future synergies. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject 
to an annual impairment review. 
Research and development 
Research expenditure is expensed as 
incurred. Development expenditure  
is capitalised if the product or process  
is technically and commercially feasible  
but is otherwise expensed as incurred. 
Capitalised development expenditure  
is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges. 
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the group’s 
intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill,  
and intangibles without a finite life,  
the recoverable amount is estimated  
at least annually. 
An impairment charge is recognised  
in the income statement whenever  
the carrying amount of an asset or its 
cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds  
its recoverable amount. 
Impairment charges recognised in 
respect of CGUs are allocated first  
to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to that CGU and  
then to reduce the carrying amount  
of the other assets in the unit on  
a pro rata basis. 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of assets is  
the greater of their fair value less costs  
to sell and their value in use. In assessing 
value in use, estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to present value using a  
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. For an asset that does not 
generate largely independent cash 
inflows, recoverable amount is 
determined for the CGU to which  
the asset belongs. 
Reversals of impairment 
An impairment charge in respect of 
goodwill is not subsequently reversed. 
For other assets, an impairment charge 
is reversed if there has been a change  
in the estimates used to determine  
the recoverable amount, but only to  
the extent that the new carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net  
of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment charge had been recognised. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment 
are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment charges. 
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of items of 
property, plant and equipment sufficient 
to reduce them to estimated residual 
value. Land is not depreciated. Estimated 
useful lives are generally deemed to 
be no longer than: 
Freehold buildings up to 66 years 
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings 
– sugar factories, yeast 
plants, mills and 
bakeries up to 20 years 
– other operations up to 12 years 
Vehicles up to 10 years 
Sugar cane roots up to 10 years 
Leases 
A lease is an agreement whereby the 
lessor conveys to the lessee, in return for 
a payment or a series of payments, the 
right to use a specific asset for an agreed 
period of time. 
Where the group is a lessee and has 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset, the arrangement 
is considered a finance lease. Finance 
leases are recognised as assets of  
the group within property, plant and 
equipment at the inception of the lease  
at the lower of fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. 
Depreciation on leased assets is charged 
to the income statement on the same 
basis as owned assets. Payments made 
under finance leases are apportioned 
between capital repayments and interest 
expense charged to the income 
statement. Other leases where the  
group is a lessee are treated as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating 
leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease, as is the benefit  
of lease incentives. 
Where the group is a lessor under an 
operating lease, the asset is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment and 
depreciated over its useful economic  
life. Payments received under operating 
leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. 
Current biological assets 
Current biological assets are measured  
at fair value less costs to sell. 
The basis of valuation for growing cane  
is estimated sucrose content valued at 
estimated sucrose price for the following 
season, less estimated costs for 
harvesting and transport. 
When harvested, growing cane is 
transferred to inventory at fair value  
less costs to sell. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower  
of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
includes raw materials, direct labour and 
expenses and an appropriate proportion 
of production and other overheads, 
calculated on a first-in first-out basis. 
Inventories for the retail businesses  
are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value using the retail method, 
calculated on the basis of selling price 
less appropriate trading margin. All retail 
inventories are finished goods.

The three new standards with the  
most significant potential effect on the 
group’s financial statements are: IFRS 9, 
IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. 
Impact assessments and implementation 
planning is already underway for  
these standards. 
Further details of the group’s transitional 
approach to their implementation and 
their expected impact will be provided  
in the 2018 consolidated financial 
statements. 
The impact of the other standards is 
currently under review, but is expected  
to be much less significant. 
In applying the accounting policies 
detailed on pages 112 to 116, 
management has made estimates in a 
number of areas and the actual outcome 
may differ from those calculated. Key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
balance sheet date, with the potential for 
material adjustment to the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are set out below. 
Forecasts and discount rates 
The carrying values of a number of items 
on the balance sheet are dependent on 
estimates of future cash flows arising 
from the group’s operations which,  
in some circumstances, are discounted  
to arrive at a net present value. 
Assessment for impairment involves 
comparing the book value of an asset 
with its recoverable amount (being the 
higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell). Value in use is determined 
with reference to projected future cash 
flows discounted at an appropriate rate. 
Both the cash flows and the discount 
rate involve a significant degree of 
estimation uncertainty. 
The realisation of deferred tax assets  
is dependent on the generation of 
sufficient future taxable profits. The 
group recognises deferred tax assets to 
the extent that it is considered probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available in the future. Deferred tax 
assets are reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer considered probable that  
the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes and similar arrangements are 
assessed annually in accordance with  
IAS 19. The accounting valuation, which 
has been assessed using assumptions 
determined with independent actuarial 
advice, resulted in a net asset of £126m 
being recognised as at 16 September 
2017. The size of this net asset is 
sensitive to the market value of the 
assets held by the schemes, to the 
discount rate used in assessing liabilities, 
to the actuarial assumptions (which 
include price inflation, rates of pension 
and salary increases, mortality and other 
demographic assumptions) and to the 
level of contributions. Further details  
are included in note 11. 
Biological assets 
In valuing growing cane, estimating 
sucrose content requires management to 
assess expected cane and sucrose yields 
for the following season considering 
weather conditions and harvesting 
programmes. Estimating sucrose price 
requires management to assess into 
which markets the forthcoming crop will 
be sold and assess domestic and export 
prices as well as related foreign currency 
exchange rates. The carrying value of 
growing cane is disclosed in note 15. 
Taxation 
The group makes provision for open  
tax issues including, in a number of 
jurisdictions, routine tax audits which  
are by nature complex and can take  
a number of years to resolve.  
Provisions are based on management’s 
interpretation of tax law in each country 
and ongoing monitoring of the outcome 
of EU cases and investigations on tax 
rulings, and reflect the best estimate  
of the liability. The group believes it  
has made adequate provision for  
such matters.

1. Operating segments 
The group has five operating segments, 
as described below. These are the 
group’s operating divisions, based on  
the management and internal reporting 
structure, which combine businesses 
with common characteristics, primarily in 
respect of the type of products offered 
by each business, but also the production 
processes involved and the manner  
of the distribution and sale of goods.  
The board is the chief operating  
decision-maker. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on 
an arm’s length basis. Segment result is 
adjusted operating profit, as shown on 
the face of the consolidated income 
statement. Segment assets comprise  
all non-current assets except employee 
benefits assets, income tax assets and 
deferred tax assets, and all current assets 
except cash and cash equivalents. 
Segment liabilities comprise trade and 
other payables, derivative liabilities  
and provisions.  
Segment results, assets and liabilities 
include items directly attributable to  
a segment as well as those that can  
be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly 
corporate assets and expenses, cash, 
borrowings, employee benefits balances 
and current and deferred tax balances. 
Segment non-current asset additions are 
the total cost incurred during the period 
to acquire segment assets that are 
expected to be used for more than one 
year, comprising property, plant and 
equipment, operating intangibles and 
biological assets. 
The group is comprised of the following 
operating segments: 
Grocery 
The manufacture of grocery products, 
including hot beverages, sugar & 
sweeteners, vegetable oils, bread  
& baked goods, cereals, ethnic  
foods, and meat products, which  
are sold to retail, wholesale and 
foodservice businesses. 
Sugar 
The growing and processing of sugar 
beet and sugar cane for sale to industrial 
users and to Silver Spoon, which is 
included in the grocery segment. 
Agriculture 
The manufacture of animal feeds and  
the provision of other products and 
services for the agriculture sector. 
Ingredients 
The manufacture of bakers’ yeast, bakery 
ingredients, enzymes, lipids, yeast 
extracts and cereal specialities. 
Retail 
Buying and merchandising value clothing 
and accessories through the Primark  
and Penneys retail chains. 
 
 
Geographical information 
In addition to the required disclosure for operating segments, disclosure is also given of certain geographical information about  
the group’s operations, based on the geographical groupings: United Kingdom; Europe & Africa; The Americas; and Asia Pacific. 
Revenues are shown by reference to the geographical location of customers. Profits are shown by reference to the geographical 
location of the businesses. Segment assets are based on the geographical location of the assets.

7. Earnings per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 16 September 2017 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders  
of £1,198m (2016 – £818m), and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million (2016 – 791 
million). The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership 
Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived. 
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and the sale 
and closure of businesses, transaction costs, amortisation of non-operating intangibles and any associated tax credits, is shown to 
provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group. 
Transaction costs of £5m and amortisation of non-operating intangibles of £28m (2016 – £5m and £21m) shown as adjusting items 
below include £2m and £3m respectively (2016 – £nil and £nil respectively) incurred by joint ventures. 
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives. The diluted, weighted average 
number of shares is 790 million (2016 – 791 million). There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Impairment 
As at 16 September 2017, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of £1,131m (2016 – £1,220m of which £118m was 
classified as held for sale). Goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows:

8. Intangible assets continued 
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently  
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each 
of the CGUs or group of CGUs. These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the board 
and reflects management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external 
sources of information. Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries  
and countries in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate. 
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess 
of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region. In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, 
generally to between three and five years, using specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks. 
The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs. 
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country, 
industry and market risk. The rates used were between 10.2% and 20.1% (2016 – between 8.6% and 18.3%). 
The growth rates to perpetuity beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated 
to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% 
and 4%, consistent with the inflation factors included in the discount rates applied (2016 – between 0% and 4%). 
Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market. 
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions 
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of 
future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates. Each of the group’s CGUs had significant 
headroom under the annual impairment review. 
Notwithstanding a further substantial improvement in profit in the current year, AB Mauri continued to experience competitive 
pricing pressure in a number of markets around the world as well as challenging macroeconomic conditions in some markets, 
including high inflation rates and currency devaluations. Accordingly, management has again undertaken an impairment review. 
Detailed forecasts for a period of ten years to reflect the time required for completion of the business plan were prepared and 
management concluded that the assets were not impaired. Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance include 
achievement of price increases in high inflation environments, improved reach and competitiveness in the global dry yeast market, 
implementation of a number of margin improvement initiatives, particularly in cost reduction, and continuing growth in the global 
bakery ingredients business. Headroom was $340m on a CGU carrying value of $954m (2016 – headroom of $551m on a CGU 
carrying value of $911m). The geographic diversity and varying local economic environments of AB Mauri’s operations mean  
that the critical assumptions underlying the detailed forecasts used in the impairment model are wide-ranging. It is therefore 
impractical to provide meaningful sensitivities to these assumptions other than the discount rate. The discount rate used was 
13.5% (2016 – 12.1%) and would have to increase to more than 19% (2016 – 17.0%) before value in use fell below the CGU 
carrying value. Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2%–3% (2016 – 2%–3%) per annum 
dependent on location. 
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions on  
which it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to materially exceed value in use.

9. Property, plant and equipment continued 
Impairment 
The methodology used to assess property, plant and equipment for impairment is the same as that described for impairment 
assessments of goodwill. See note 8 for further details. 
An impairment of A$150m (£98m) was recorded in 2012 in the Australian meat business. Further progress was made in the 
current year with further reduction in manufacturing costs, efficiency improvement and a general focus on cost reduction across 
the business. Following a detailed assessment, management has concluded that the carrying value of the assets in the meat  
business is not further impaired. Headroom was A$38m on a CGU carrying value of A$270m (2016 – headroom of A$78m on a  
CGU carrying value of A$273m). The discount rate used was 10.5% (2016 – 9.7%). Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond  
the forecast periods were 2.0% (2016 – 2.0%) per annum. A sensitivity of plus or minus 1% applied to the discount rate impacts 
headroom by plus or minus A$38m. 
Low bread prices and strong continuing competition in the UK bakery sector led to a loss at Allied Bakeries and resulted in the 
need for an assessment of impairment. Headroom was £87m on a CGU carrying value of £260m (2016 – headroom of £43m on a 
CGU carrying value of £281m). The discount rate used was 10.2% (2016 – 10.4%). Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond 
the forecast periods were 0.4%. A sensitivity of plus or minus 1% applied to bread prices impacts headroom by plus or minus £27m. 
A sensitivity of plus or minus 1% applied to bread volumes impacts headroom by plus or minus £13m.

11. Employee entitlements 
The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the UK and overseas.  
The defined benefit schemes expose the group to a variety of actuarial risks including demographic assumptions such as mortality 
and financial assumptions such as discount rate, inflation risk and market (investment) risk. The group is not exposed to any 
unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks. All schemes comply with local legislative requirements. 
UK defined benefit scheme 
The group’s principal UK defined benefit scheme is the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which is  
a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members. Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees. 
The UK defined benefit schemes represent 91% (2016 – 91%) of the group’s defined benefit scheme assets and 89%  
(2016 – 88%) of defined benefit scheme liabilities. The Scheme is governed by a trustee board which is independent of the  
group and which agrees a schedule of contributions with the Company each time a formal funding valuation is performed. 
The previous triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2014, using the current unit method, and 
revealed a surplus of £79m. The market value of Scheme assets was £3,085m, representing 103% of members’ accrued benefits 
after allowing for expected future salary increases. The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as  
at 5 April 2017, was agreed by the trustees after the group’s year end and revealed a surplus of £176m. 
The Scheme’s assets are managed using a risk-controlled investment strategy, which includes a liability-driven investment policy 
that seeks to match, where appropriate, the profile of the liabilities. This includes the use of derivative instruments to hedge 
inflation, interest and foreign exchange risks. The Scheme utilises both market and solvency triggers to develop the level of hedges 
in place. To date, the Scheme is fully hedged for 56% of inflation sensitivity and 35% of interest rate risk. It is intended to hedge 
80% of total exposure. 
The Scheme is forbidden by the trust deed from holding direct investments in the equity of the Company, although it is possible 
that the Scheme may hold indirect interests through investments in some equity funds. 
Overseas defined benefit schemes 
The group also operates defined benefit retirement schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded final 
salary schemes, as well as a small number of unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes, which are accounted for in the 
same way as defined benefit retirement schemes. 
Defined contribution schemes 
The group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the charge was £35m in the UK and £44m overseas, 
totalling £79m (2016 – UK £36m, overseas £38m, total £74m). 
Actuarial assumptions 
The principal actuarial assumptions for the group’s defined benefit schemes at the year end were: 
 
2017 
UK 
% 
2017 
Overseas 
% 
2016 
UK 
% 
2016 
Overseas 
% 
Discount rate 2.7 0.7–16.5 2.5 0.2–16.2 
Inflation 2.3–3.3 0–9.5 2.1–3.1 0–9.2 
Rate of increase in salaries 3.3–4.3 0–12.0 3.1–4.2 0–12.0 
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.1–3.1 0–5.7 2.2–2.9 0–6.5 
Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided) 2.3 0–2.0 2.1 0–2.0 
The UK inflation assumption includes assumptions on both the Retail Price Index and Consumer Price Index measures of inflation 
on the basis that the gap between the two measures is expected to remain stable in the long term.

The mortality assumptions used to value the UK defined benefit schemes in both years are derived from the S2 mortality tables 
with improvements in line with the 2015 projection model (2016 – 2015 projection model) prepared by the Continuous Mortality 
Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and a +0.7-year rating down for females, both with a long-term 
trend of 1.25% (2016 – 1.25%). These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further 
improvements in life expectancy of scheme members. Examples of the resulting life expectancies in the UK defined benefit 
schemes are as follows: 
Life expectancy from age 65 (in years) 
2017  2016 
Male Female  Male Female 
Member aged 65 in 2017 (2016) 22.3 24.9 
 
22.2 24.8 
Member aged 65 in 2037 (2036) 24.0 26.8  23.9 26.7 
An allowance has been made for cash commutation in line with emerging scheme experience. Other demographic assumptions 
for the UK defined benefit schemes are set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.  
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic funding valuation of the schemes. 
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions for mortality, financial and demographic factors have been used. 
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure UK defined benefit scheme liabilities at 16 September 2017 is: 
 
Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities 
Discount rate decrease/increase by 0.5% increase/decrease by 9.0% 
Inflation increase/decrease by 0.5% increase/decrease by 7.7% 
Rate of real increase in salaries  increase/decrease by 0.5% increase/decrease by 1.5% 
Rate of mortality reduce by one year increase by 3.6% 
A sensitivity to the rate of increase in pensions in payment and pensions in deferment is represented by the inflation sensitivity,  
as all pensions increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation. 
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions occurring 
at the end of the period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in the specific assumption 
while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivities, the same method used to calculate scheme 
liabilities recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The method and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis 
have not changed since the prior year.

11. Employee entitlements continued 
Included within the group’s 2016 overseas net pension liabilities analysed above was a deficit of £13m (£25m of assets and  
£38m of liabilities) which was classified as held for sale. 
Corporate and other bonds relating to UK schemes of £562m (2016 – £558m) include £55m (2016 – £52m) of assets whose 
valuation is not derived from quoted market prices. The valuation for all other equity assets, government bonds, corporate and 
other bonds is derived from quoted market prices. The carrying value of UK property assets is based on a 31 March market 
valuation, adjusted for purchases, disposals and price indexation between the valuation and the balance sheet dates. Cash and 
other assets contains £312m (2016 – £296m) of assets whose valuation is not derived from quoted market prices. 
For financial reporting in the group’s financial statements, liabilities are assessed by actuaries using the projected unit method.  
The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis, mainly due to different assumptions used to 
project scheme liabilities. 
The defined benefit scheme liabilities comprise 26% (2016 – 30%) in respect of active participants, 22% (2016 – 24%) for deferred 
participants and 52% (2016 – 46%) for pensioners. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at the end of the year is 18 years for both UK and overseas 
schemes (2016 – 20 years for both UK and overseas schemes).

Cash flow 
Group cash flow in respect of employee benefits schemes comprises contributions paid to funded schemes of £35m  
(2016 – £38m) and benefits paid in respect of unfunded schemes of £1m (2016 – £nil). Contributions to funded defined benefit 
schemes are subject to periodic review. Contributions to defined contribution schemes amounted to £79m (2016 – £74m). 
Total contributions to funded schemes and benefit payments by the group in respect of unfunded schemes in 2018 are currently 
expected to be approximately £31m in the UK and £11m overseas, totalling £42m (2016 – UK £26m, overseas £8m, totalling £34m).

Experience gains on scheme liabilities 243 6

Remeasurements of the net pension asset/(liability) 438 (258) 
The primary reason for the significant experience gains in the year is the latest scheme membership information gathered  
during the 2017 triennial valuation, which identified that there had been more exits from the scheme than expected over the  
past three years.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) 
for financial reporting purposes:

£m  
2016 
£m  
Deferred tax assets (143) (139) 
Deferred tax liabilities 231 139 
 88 – 
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned. Other 
deferred tax assets totalling £97m (2016 – £99m) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit  
is uncertain. 
In addition, there are temporary differences of £2,995m (2016 – £2,645m) relating to investments in subsidiaries. No deferred tax 
has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

assets held for sale. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of receivables approximates fair value. 
For details of credit risk exposure on trade and other receivables, see note 24. 
Trade and other receivables include £48m (2016 – £36m) in respect of finance lease receivables, with £45m in non-current loans 
and receivables and £3m in current other receivables (2016 – £33m in non-current loans and receivables and £3m in current  
other receivables). Minimum lease payments receivable are £3m within one year, £15m between one and five years and £36m  
in more than five years (2016 – are £4m within one year, £5m between one and five years and £28m in more than five years). 
The finance lease receivables relate to property, plant and equipment leased to a joint venture of the group (see note 27).

Growing cane 
The fair value of growing cane is determined using inputs that are unobservable, using the best information available in the 
circumstances for valuing the growing cane, and therefore falls into the level 3 category of fair value measurement. The following 
assumptions were used in the determination of the estimated sucrose tonnage at 16 September 2017: 
 South Africa Malawi Zambia Swaziland Tanzania Mozambique 
Expected area to harvest (hectares) 6,475 19,802 15,999 8,588 9,678 6,091 
Estimated yield (tonnes cane/hectare) 68.8 91.0 118.6 96.7 70.3 81.0 
Average maturity of growing cane 46.4% 68.2% 65.7% 67.7% 46.2% 71.6% 
The following assumptions were used in the determination of the estimated sucrose tonnage at 17 September 2016:

Financial liabilities within provisions comprised deferred consideration in both years (see note 24). 
Restructuring 
Restructuring provisions relate to the cash costs, including redundancy, associated with the group’s announced reorganisation plans. 
Deferred consideration 
Deferred consideration comprises estimates of amounts due to the previous owners of businesses acquired by the group which 
are often linked to performance or other conditions. 
Other 
Other provisions mainly comprise litigation claims and warranty claims arising from the sale and closure of businesses. The extent 
and timing of the utilisation of these provisions is more uncertain given the nature of the claims and the period of the warranties. 
20. Share capital and reserves 
Share capital 
At 17 September 2016 and 16 September 2017, the Company’s issued and fully paid share capital comprised 791,674,183 ordinary 
shares of 5
15
⁄22p, each carrying one vote per share. Total nominal value was £45m. 
Other reserves 
£173m of other reserves arose from the cancellation of share premium account by the Company in 1993. The remaining £2m 
arose in 2010 as a transfer to capital redemption reserve following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par. Both are 
non-distributable. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises all changes in the value of derivatives to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges,  
net of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur.

21. Acquisitions and disposals 
Acquisitions 
2017 
During the year the group acquired two small Grocery businesses in the UK and an Ingredients business in the US. Total 
consideration was £85m, comprising cash of £83m and deferred consideration of £2m. Net assets acquired comprised intangible 
assets of £69m, cash of £5m and other operating assets and liabilities of £11m. The cash outflow of £79m on the purchase of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the cash flow statement comprises cash consideration of £83m less cash acquired 
with the businesses of £5m and £1m of deferred consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions. 
After the year end, on 12 October 2017 the group completed the acquisition of 100% of Acetum S.p.A., the leading Italian 
producer of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena for €317m including debt assumed. In the year ended 31 December 2016, the business 
generated net sales of €102m and profit after tax of €3m. Given the timing of the acquisition after the group’s financial year end 
and its proximity to the date of approval of the group’s financial statements, completion of the initial accounting for the acquisition 
has not yet been undertaken. Consequently, the disclosures relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles, and the fair values of other 
assets and liabilities acquired have not been made. These disclosures will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim 
financial statements for the 24 weeks ending 3 March 2018. 
2016 
Last year the group acquired two small European Agriculture businesses which, together, increased net assets by £8m satisfied  
in cash. Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from a £2m non-operating 
intangible asset recognised in respect of brands. The acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of £13m and no adjusted  
profit before tax for the period between the dates of acquisition and 17 September 2016. Aggregate contributions to revenue  
and adjusted profit before tax, had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period, were not disclosed as appropriate 
financial information, prepared under adopted IFRS, was not available. 
The £8m of cash consideration differed by £2m from the cash outflow of £10m on the purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures  
and associates in the cash flow statement. The difference comprised payment of deferred consideration in respect of prior  
year acquisitions. 
In June 2016 the group paid £252m, including costs, to acquire the minority shareholdings in Illovo Sugar Limited. As Illovo and  
its subsidiaries had been consolidated in the group financial statements since the acquisition of the original controlling interest  
in 2006, this was treated as a transaction with owners and recorded in equity rather than as an acquisition. The cash flow was 
shown within financing activities. 
Disposals 
2017 
The group disposed of its US herbs and spices business, reported within the Grocery segment. Cash proceeds amounted to 
£294m, net assets disposed were £26m and the associated goodwill was £124m. Provisions for transaction and associated 
restructuring costs were £33m, with a loss of £1m on recycling foreign exchange differences. The pre-tax gain on disposal  
was £110m. The group also disposed of its south China cane sugar operations for cash proceeds of £194m. The purchaser  
also assumed £103m of debt resulting in total proceeds of £297m. Net assets disposed were £120m. Provisions for transaction  
and associated restructuring costs were £24m, offset by a gain of £29m on recycling of foreign exchange differences and  
£1m of non-controlling interests. The pre-tax gain on disposal was £183m. 
The cash inflow of £452m on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the cash flow statement comprises  
cash proceeds of £488m less cash disposed with the businesses of £26m and £10m of transaction costs. 
2016 
The group closed a small number of Ingredients businesses during the year, incurring closure costs of £4m in the Asia Pacific 
segment and £1m in Europe & Africa. The group also charged a £9m onerous lease provision to sale and closure of business  
(in the Central segment) as a result of lease reversions following the administration of the BHS retail chain in the UK.

22. Share-based payments 
The group had the following principal equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: 
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 (‘the Share Incentive Plan’) 
The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003. 
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are  
satisfied, typically over a three-year performance period. The Share Incentive Plan expired in December 2013, with the last grant  
of allocations made in November 2013. Conditional shares allocated under the Share Incentive Plan will vest under the terms  
of that plan. 
Associated British Foods Long Term Incentive Plan (‘the LTIP’) 
The LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 6 December 2013. It takes the form 
of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over  
a three-year performance period. 
Associated British Foods 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘the 2016 LTIP’) 
The 2016 LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 9 December 2016. It takes the 
form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically 
over a three-year performance period. 
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 75 to 93. 
Total conditional allocations under the group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are as follows:

Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
Ordinary shares subject to allocation under the group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate  
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust. The Trust is funded by the Company. Voting rights attached to shares held by the Trust  
are exercisable by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company. At  
16 September 2017 the Trust held 1,531,998 (2016 – 1,513,339) ordinary shares of the Company. The market value of these shares 
at the year end was £48m (2016 – £41m). The Trust has waived its right to dividends. Movements in the year were releases of 
331,341 shares and purchases of 350,000 shares (2016 – releases of 626,879 shares and purchases of 650,000 shares). 
Fair values 
The weighted average fair value of conditional grants made was determined by taking the market price of the shares at the time  
of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of the 
conditional shares allocated during the year was 2,449 pence (2016 – 3,185 pence) and the weighted average share price was 
2,633 pence (2016 – 3,425 pence). The dividend yield used was 2.5%.

24. Financial instruments continued 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 
Financial asset/liability Fair value determination 
Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, 
other receivables and accrued income, trade 
payables, other payables and accruals 
Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities or otherwise 
immediate or short-term access and realisability. 
Other non-current investments (recorded 
within other non-current receivables) 
These comprise minority shareholdings in privately-owned, unquoted companies 
where there is no active market available to value them. Where the fair value of 
the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost. 
Other non-current receivables, loans and 
overdrafts and finance leases 
Fair values for these level 2 financial instruments have been estimated by 
discounting expected future cash flows (see below). 
Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party valuations 
(usually from a bank), or by reference to readily observable market prices. 
The group’s derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from 
the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is almost 
always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives. 
Deferred consideration Deferred consideration is measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, discounted 
to present value where material. Fair value is therefore equivalent to book value. 
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value 
Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives. The group 
classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence 
and subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: 
 Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market 
for identical instruments. An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted 
market price. 
 Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. market prices and 
rates) or indirectly (i.e. derived from market prices and rates). An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, 
where forward exchange rates and yield curve data, which are observable in the market, are used to derive fair value. 
 Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs. 
b) Derivatives 
All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet. The table below analyses the carrying amount of 
derivatives and their contractual/notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy 
into which their fair value measurement method is categorised.

and £(1)m to non-controlling interests (2016 – £11m attributable to equity shareholders and £(1)m to non-controlling interests). 
d) Financial risk identification and management 
The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: 
 market risk; 
 credit risk; and 
 liquidity risk. 
The group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of 
key risks facing the business. Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the group’s activities. The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a 
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. 
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world. These operations expose the 
group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets. Trading and risk management teams have 
been established in the group’s major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical 
and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options. These teams work closely with group Treasury and report 
regularly to executive management. 
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and 
guidelines to manage the group’s financial and commodity risks. Treasury works closely with the group’s procurement teams to 
manage commodity risks. Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, 
for the management and development of the group’s businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.  
The group’s risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives (outside its risk management 
framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks) for speculative purposes.

e) Foreign currency translation 
The group presents its financial statements in sterling. As a result of its worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign 
currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling. Changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations. 
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations. This reduces 
net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates on translation. 
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not  
in sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation 
of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against  
the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations. 
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement (other 
than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings). 
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21. The effect of the 
designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and/or the lending entity is accounted for 
directly within other comprehensive income. 
At year end, the group had $160m of borrowings (2016 – $160m) that were designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign 
operations in US dollars. 
A net foreign exchange gain of £3m (2016 – loss of £26m) on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve 
on consolidation, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders. The group also held currency forwards and cross currency 
swaps that have been designated as hedges of its net investments in Australian dollars and euros, whose change in fair value of 
£12m has been debited to the translation reserve, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders (2016 – £46m debited to the 
translation reserve). 
f) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as 
underlying market prices change. The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates. These risks are known as ‘transaction’ (or recognised) exposures and ‘economic’ (or forecast) exposures. 
(i) Commodity price risk 
Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices. 
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business. Exposure to changes in the market price of 
certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed 
through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to 
convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices. The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the 
group’s risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury. Commodity derivatives also provide a way to 
meet customers’ pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the group’s overall pricing strategy. 
Some of the group’s commodity forward contracts are classified as ‘own use’ contracts, since they are both entered into, and 
continue to be held, for the purposes of the group’s ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity 
concerned. ‘Own use’ contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises. Where 
possible commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but there are some commodity derivatives for which  
the strict requirements of hedge accounting cannot be satisfied. Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business 
believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure. These instruments are classified as held for trading and are 
marked to market through the income statement. 
The majority of the group’s forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year. 
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts.

24. Financial instruments continued 
(ii) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: 
 interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates. Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect 
the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments; and 
 interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates. Changes in floating interest rates affect cash 
flows on interest receivable or payable. 
The group’s policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses 
its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk. 
At 16 September 2017, £599m (68%) (2016 – £625m and 70%) of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest, the majority  
of which is the US private placement loans of £558m (2016 – £588m). 
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months,  
by reference to official market rates (e.g. LIBOR). 
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of 
interest rates on floating rate borrowings. 
(iii) Foreign currency risk 
The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies. As a result, it is exposed to movements  
in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the group’s transaction costs. The group also publishes its financial statements  
in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net 
assets of its foreign operations into sterling. 
Translation risk is discussed in section e) on page 141. 
Transaction risk 
Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional 
currency. It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and 
where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas. The group’s policy is to match transaction exposures wherever 
possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts. 
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group 
Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance. 
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business. 
The group uses derivatives (principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options) to hedge its exposure to movements in 
exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables. The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting 
for such transaction hedges. Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income 
statement. This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables. 
Economic (forecast) risk 
The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly 
probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12-month basis. The group does not formally define the 
proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis 
with each business by reference to the group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. The group documents 
currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that cash flow hedges are 
effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are 
recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired. 
The majority of the group’s currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year. 
The group’s most significant currency transaction exposures are: 
 sugar prices in British Sugar to movements in the sterling/euro exchange rate; 
 sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand/US dollar/euro exchange rates; and 
 sourcing for Primark – costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars. 
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies (primarily US  
dollars and euros), giving rise to transaction exposures. In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their  
functional currencies.

Sensitivity analysis 
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the group’s operating currencies against  
local functional currencies would have had on profit and equity. The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on 
businesses’ financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses. A similar but 
opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the group’s main operating currencies weakened against local functional 
currencies by a similar amount. 
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not 
included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly 
in the translation reserve in equity (see below for a separate sensitivity). This sensitivity is presented before taxation and non-
controlling interests.

A second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on the group’s profit before tax if the average rates used to translate the results 
of the group’s foreign operations into sterling were adjusted to show a 10% strengthening of sterling. A similar but opposite 
impact would be felt on profit before tax if sterling weakened against the other currencies by a similar amount.

g) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or 
instrument. The group’s businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain 
financing activities. 
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive  
fair value by counterparty at 16 September 2017. The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be:

Loans and receivables 24a 1,219 1,206

Derivative assets in designated net investment hedging relationships  – 1 
Derivative assets in designated cash flow hedging relationships  75 90 
  2,848 1,892 
The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions. 
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial 
profile of its counterparties.

Trade and other receivables 
Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the group’s large and diverse customer base. The group has an established 
credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced. 
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are established for all 
significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional 
approval from the appropriate level of management. Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business. Credit limits 
are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually. Customers that fail to meet the group’s benchmark creditworthiness may 
only transact with the group on a prepayment basis. Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level. 
Many of the group’s customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low. 
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured 
claim. The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. 
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes  
a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data. The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was:

Provision for doubtful debts (25) (25) 
  1,035 1,032 
Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are 
not past due. 
Trade receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts:

£m 
2016

Amounts provided for during the year 5 4

Amounts utilised during the year (3) (3) 
Effect of movements in foreign exchange – 4 
Closing balance 25 25 
No trade receivables were written off directly to the income statement in either year. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group. These banks are 
selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses’ day-to-day banking requirements. The credit 
ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot  
be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with 
group Treasury. The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues  
been identified with such balances. Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.

Other financial assets 
Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date. No impairment issues 
have been identified with respect to other non-current investments. 
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging 
relationship, or otherwise through the hedging or net investment hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified. 
h) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities  
as they fall due. Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient 
headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements. The group also has access to uncommitted 
facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements. 
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed  
at least quarterly, or more often, as required. Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances 
investigated and explained. Particular focus is given to management of working capital. 
Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are given in section i) on page 147. 
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date

The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at  
16 September 2017. 
The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments  
on the fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the group’s finance leases, and cash 
flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

In addition to the above facilities there are also £520m (2016 – £296m) of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes  
of issuing letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business. 
The group also has £14m (2016 – £14m) of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are 
included in the group’s loans and overdrafts in note 17. 
The group has a £1.2bn syndicated facility which matures in July 2021. In addition to the bank debt, the Company has £558m  
of private placement notes in issue to institutional investors in the US and Europe. At 16 September 2017, these had an average 
remaining duration of 3.5 years and an average fixed coupon of 4.6%. The other significant core committed debt facilities comprise 
local committed facilities in Illovo. 
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn 
at any time. 
Refer to note 9 for details of the group’s capital commitments and to note 26 for a summary of the group’s guarantees.  
An assessment of the group’s current liquidity position is given in the Financial review on page 49. 
j) Capital management 
The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet. The statement of changes in equity provides details on equity 
and note 17 provides details of loans and overdrafts. Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of 
loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities. Longer term funding 
is sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities. 
The board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable 
successful future development of the business. The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level  
of dividends payable to shareholders. 
From time to time the trustee of the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust purchases the Company’s shares in the market to 
satisfy awards under the group’s incentive plans. Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market. The group does not 
have a defined share buy-back plan. 
There were no changes to the group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries are subject to externally-imposed capital requirements.

25. Lease commitments 
Operating leases 
The group acts as a lessee, lessor and sub-lessor for land and buildings, and plant and machinery, under operating leases. 
Rental receipts of £8m (2016 – £9m) were recognised in the income statement in the period relating to operating leases. The total 
of future minimum rental receipts expected to be received is £48m (2016 – £53m). 
Under the terms of the lease agreements, no contingent rents are payable.

26. Contingencies 
Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial 
statements. 
Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other group companies, the 
group considers these to be insurance arrangements and has elected to account for them as such in accordance with IFRS 4.  
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant 
group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. 
As at 16 September 2017, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to £1,866m 
(2016 – £1,912m).

1. The Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) is an English charitable trust, established in 1958 by the late W Garfield 
Weston. The Foundation has no direct interest in the Company, but as at 16 September 2017 was the beneficial owner of 
683,073 shares (2016 – 683,073 shares) in Wittington Investments Limited representing 79.2% (2016 – 79.2%) of that 
company’s issued share capital and is, therefore, the Company’s ultimate controlling party. At 16 September 2017 trustees  
of the Foundation comprised two children and two grandchildren of the late W Garfield Weston and five children of the late 
Garry H Weston. 
2. Details of the directors are given on pages 60 and 61. Their interests, including family interests, in the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings are given on pages 89 and 90. Key management personnel are considered to be the directors,  
and their remuneration is disclosed within the Remuneration report on page 86. 
3. Members of the Weston family who are employed by the group and are not directors of the Company or Wittington 
Investments Limited and are not trustees of the Foundation. 
4. The fellow subsidiary undertakings are Fortnum and Mason plc and Heal & Son Limited. 
5. The companies with common key management personnel are the George Weston Limited group, in Canada, and Selfridges 
& Co. Limited. 
Amounts due from joint ventures include £48m (2016 – £36m) of finance lease receivables (see note 13). The remainder of the 
balance is trading balances. All but £3m (2016 – £3m) of the finance lease receivables are non-current.

28. Group entities  
Control of the group 
The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Wittington Investments Limited 
(‘Wittington’), the accounts of which are available at Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CF14 3UZ. It is the ultimate holding 
company, is incorporated in Great Britain and is registered in England. 
At 16 September 2017 Wittington, together with its subsidiary, Howard Investments Limited, held 431,515,108 ordinary shares 
(2016 – 431,515,108) representing in aggregate 54.5% (2016 – 54.5%) of the total issued ordinary share capital of Associated 
British Foods plc. 
Wittington, and, through their control of Wittington, the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) are 
controlling shareholders of the Company. Certain other individuals, including certain members of the Weston family who hold 
shares in the Company (and including two of the Company’s directors, George Weston and Emma Adamo) are, under the Listing 
Rules, treated as acting in concert with Wittington and the trustees of the Foundation and are therefore also treated as controlling 
shareholders of the Company. Wittington, the trustees of the Foundation and these individuals together comprise the controlling 
shareholders of the Company and, at 16 September 2017, have a combined interest in approximately 59.15% (2016 – 59.16%)  
of the Company’s voting rights. Information on the relationship agreement between the Company and its controlling shareholders 
is set out on page 95 of the Directors’ report. 
Subsidiary undertakings 
A list of the group’s subsidiaries as at 16 September 2017 is given below. The entire share capital of subsidiaries is held within  
the group except where the group’s ownership percentages are shown. These percentages give the group’s ultimate interest 
and therefore allow for the occasional situation where subsidiaries are owned by partly-owned intermediate subsidiaries. Where 
subsidiaries have different classes of shares, this is largely for historical reasons and the effective percentage holdings given 
represent both the group’s voting rights and equity holding. Shares in ABF Investments plc are held directly by Associated British 
Foods plc. All other holdings in subsidiaries are owned by members of the Associated British Foods plc group. All subsidiaries are 
consolidated in the group’s financial statements.

Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) regulations require all listed companies in Zambia to have a minimum of 25% of their shares held 
by public investors to constitute a free float. As a result, Illovo Sugar was required to reduce its shareholding in Zambia Sugar plc  
by 6.6%. Effective 26 September 2014, 5.1% of the shares were sold to local Zambian institutional investors. As agreed with 
LuSE, the remaining 1.5% will be held in a separate account in the LuSE Central Securities Depository. While Illovo will waive  
its voting rights on these shares, it will still be entitled to receive dividends thereon. 
The results and balance sheet of Primark Mode Ltd. & Co. KG are included in these financial statements and these financial 
statements will be filed in Germany. As a consequence, Primark Mode Ltd. & Co. KG is exempt from the requirement to file  
its own financial statements under section 264b HGB. 
Associated British Foods plc has irrevocably guaranteed all commitments entered into by each of the Irish incorporated  
subsidiary undertakings listed below, including amounts shown as liabilities in the statutory financial statements of these 
companies, in respect of the financial year ended 16 September 2017. As a consequence, these subsidiary undertakings may 
qualify for the exemption under section 357 of the Companies Act 2014 (Ireland) from the provisions of sections 347 and 348  
of that Act.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
for the 52 weeks ended 16 September 2017 
 
160 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared under the historical cost basis, 
except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 
to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain 
assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and certain related party 
transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements. 
As permitted by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income for the Company has not been included in these financial statements. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
described below. They have all been applied consistently to all years presented. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on business combinations and operating intangibles. Goodwill is defined under 
‘Business combinations’ on page 112 of the consolidated financial statements. The Companies Act 2006 requires goodwill to be 
amortised on a systematic basis over its useful economic life. Under FRS 101 goodwill is not amortised, but is instead reviewed  
for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment. The Company is therefore invoking a ‘true and 
fair view override’ to overcome the requirement to amortise goodwill in the Companies Act 2006. Had the Company amortised 
goodwill, a period of three years would have been chosen as its useful life from the date of transition. The loss for the year  
would have been £4m higher had goodwill been amortised in the year. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Amortisation is 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets from the 
date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are generally deemed to be no longer than five years. 
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction 
costs, and thereafter at amortised cost. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are used to manage the Company’s economic exposure to financial risks. The principal instruments used are foreign 
exchange contracts and swaps. Derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value based on market prices or rates, or 
calculated using either discounted cash flow or option pricing models. Changes in the value of derivatives are recognised in the 
income statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any change in fair value depends on the nature  
of the item being hedged. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The Company operates one defined contribution and two defined benefit pension schemes. The Company is the principal 
employer of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members, 
as well as a small unfunded final salary scheme. For the defined benefit plans, the amount charged in the income statement is the 
cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members by the Company during 
the year. It also includes net interest expense or income calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net pension asset  
or liability. The difference between market value of assets and present value of liabilities is disclosed as an asset or liability in the 
balance sheet. Any related deferred tax (to the extent recoverable) is disclosed separately in the balance sheet. Remeasurements 
are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Surpluses are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable. 
Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred.

Financial statements
  
 
 
161
Income tax 
Income tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items taken directly to equity. 
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 
Share-based payments 
The fair value of the share awards at grant date is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares. The amount recognised is adjusted to 
reflect expected and actual levels of vesting except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition. 
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as 
allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with 
a corresponding increase in equity. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, call deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of 
three months or less.

shares of 5
15
⁄22p, each carrying one vote per share. Total nominal value was £45m.

Dividends 
Details of dividends paid and proposed are provided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Share-based payments 
Details of the Company’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are provided in note 22 to the consolidated financial

net of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur. 
8. Contingent liabilities 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The guarantee contract is treated  
as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under  
the guarantee. 
The Company had provided £857m of guarantees in the ordinary course of business as at 16 September 2017 (2016 – £709m).
