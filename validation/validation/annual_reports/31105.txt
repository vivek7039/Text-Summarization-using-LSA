BUILDING VALUE 
TOGETHER
I am delighted to introduce Sumo Group’s first Annual Report 
as a quoted company, which shows the material progress 
made by the business in 2017.
The year under review was a significant one. Having 
completed a secondary management buyout, backed by 
Perwyn LLP, in September 2016, the business entered 2017 
energised and with a clear plan to deliver strong organic and 
acquisitive growth. Not only were both these objectives met 
but the year culminated with the successful admission of 
shares in Sumo Group plc to AIM on 21 December 2017. 
The listing route was chosen to provide a new and ready 
source of capital with which to deleverage the balance sheet, 
raise the profile of the Company, enable the incentivisation 
of its people and allow the management to execute its 
growth strategy. Y ou will see from the rest of this Annual 
Report how those objectives have been achieved or are being 
advanced. I thank my Board colleagues and pay tribute to 
the wider management team for their dedication and hard 
work, throughout the year, which has allowed us to complete 
the highly time-consuming admission process while at the 
same time delivering an excellent operating performance.
Sumo Group plc’s flotation also enabled private equity 
investor, Perwyn, to realise some of its investment, 
while keeping a significant shareholding in the newly 
quoted business going forward. We are grateful for their 
ongoing support.
In preparation for IPO, we welcomed David Wilton as Chief 
Financial Officer and, upon admission, Michael Sherwin 
also joined the Board as Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director . Their profiles, which appear on page 20 and are 
available on www.sumogroupplc.com/about/board-of-
directors/, demonstrate the breadth of relevant experience 
they bring to the PLC Board.
2017 PROGRESS
Management team and Board strengthened.
Successful IPO: new structure to facilitate 
further growth.
Since IPO, the Board has begun a process 
to enable widescale employee participation 
in the Group’s shares.  Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT

We completed the acquisition of Atomhawk 
Design Limited, a multi award winning visual 
design company, servicing the video games, 
film and visual effects industries, in June 2017, 
extending the range of premium services 
Sumo Group provides. Atomhawk had a 
very strong second half, out-performing our 
pre-acquisition expectations. Immediately 
after the year end, Sumo Group also took 
on the Newcastle studio of CCP Games, 
bringing a number of talented colleagues into 
the business and increasing our capacity to 
deliver high quality services to our clients.
As well as expanding and deepening client 
relationships throughout the year, Sumo Digital 
successfully launched its first own-IP game, 
Snake Pass, generating revenue of £1.7m in 
2017. On the back of this success, the Group 
intends to continue the selective development 
of independent games based on original IP .
One of the important functions of any board 
is governance. Y ou will see, in this, our first 
Annual Report, the structure and processes 
that have been put in place or extended by the 
Board, as part of the move to becoming a listed 
company. These will continue to develop over 
the coming year .
The source of our success is our people; 
we value them highly and are committed to 
providing a positive working environment. We 
have invested significantly in our premises in 
Sheffield and recently moved the Atomhawk 
Canada operations into a larger site in 
Vancouver . Since IPO, the Board has begun 
a process to enable widescale employee 
participation in the Group’s shares. 
In summary, we made great progress 
during 2017 and Sumo Group is well-
positioned to repeat this in 2018 and beyond. 
Our success is due to the skill and dedication 
of colleagues across the Group and, on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank them all 
for their contribution.

ACQUISITION OF ATOMHAWK
In June 2017 Sumo Digital acquired 
Atomhawk, a multi-award winning 
visual design company servicing the

Atomhawk now has studios in Newcastle 
and Vancouver (Canada), employing 36 
people as at 31 March 2018. Key services 
include visual development (concept art), 
marketing art as well as motion graphics 
and user interface design. 
The business helps its clients to define 
the visual style of a product, delivering art

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Sumo Digital remains focused on 
investing in its key relationships 
to develop and deliver high quality 
video games, while maintaining a 
high level of staff utilisation. This 
proven model gives Sumo Digital 
high quality and visible earnings.
Carl Cavers
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
This is my first statement as CEO of Sumo Group plc and 
it gives me great pleasure to update our shareholders on 
what has been a momentous year for the Group. 
In June 2018 we will celebrate the 15th anniversary of 
the foundation of Sumo Digital. The business has grown 
consistently throughout its history and it is now one of 
Europe’s largest independent video games developers. 
In June 2017 we acquired Atomhawk Design Limited, a multi 
award-winning visual design company, servicing the games, 
film and visual effects industries. This acquisition expanded 
our integrated video game service offering and strengthens 
the Group's position in offering premium services to 
our clients. 
Just prior to the close of the financial year, the Group 
achieved one of its key strategic ambitions and, following 
a successful IPO, was admitted to the London Stock 
Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on 
21 December 2017. Having been through three changes 
of ownership in the last three years, we are looking forward 
to the stability that this platform brings and the opportunity 
to focus wholly on the development of the business. Sumo 
Group is a people business offering premium video game 
development services to its clients. Following the IPO, we 
have a strong balance sheet and a structure with which we 
can incentivise our people, as we continue to drive growth 
in the business. 
We entered 2017 with 382 people operating from three 
locations in two countries. The year concluded with Sumo 
Group plc employing 489 people operating at five locations 
in three countries. Post year end, the Group extended its 
operations further when it took over the Newcastle studio 
of CCP Games, bringing a further 34 people to the business 
and an additional studio location.
Joining AIM is a significant step forward 
in Sumo Group's journey to becoming a 
global leader in premium development and 
creative services to the video game and 
wider entertainment industries. We had an 
overwhelmingly positive response to the 
Placing and, on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all our investors for their support and 
our advisers for helping us make this happen.
STRONG ST ART

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
SNAKE PASS TAKES HOME 
THE AWARD FOR BEST ARCADE 
GAME AT THE TIGA AWARDS
A unique, physics-based puzzle platform 
game, Snake Pass challenges players to 
‘think like a snake’ as they tackle precarious 
puzzles as only a snake can. Slither through 
long grass, coil around bamboo and climb 
out of trouble in the latest game from award 
winning independent studio Sumo Digital.
The winner of Sumo Digital’s inaugural 
Game Jam, Snake Pass was created 
by Seb Liese as a love-letter to both the 
favourite games of his youth and his 
childhood pet snake.
After winning, a full demo was produced 
and taken around various public shows 
where it was met with great enthusiasm 
by gamers of all ages.
Buoyed by its success, full production 
began when the team returned home 
to Sumo HQ.
We acquired an additional 11,000 sq ft of office 
space in Sheffield during the year and began 
a significant refurbishment programme in 
September 2017 to provide a larger and better 
working environment for our people. This work 
is ongoing and completion is expected shortly. 
We also acquired a further 2,700 sq ft of space 
in Nottingham in May 2017, which gives us the 
capacity to deliver headcount growth, although 
we are constantly reviewing opportunities to 
accelerate growth by opening studios in other 
key locations.
In January 2017, Sumo Digital celebrated ten 
years of operating in India. Our India studio was 
founded to provide additional skilled resources. 
Pune offered an appealing cost base to help 
underpin EBITDA performance. This part of 
the business has grown consistently since its 
foundation, relocating to larger premises in 
December 2016, which allows for growth in line 
with our other territories. This studio continues 
to perform strongly.
It is always pleasing when a business’ 
strengths are recognised externally. In January 
2017, Sumo Digital was awarded a 1 star 
rating in the Best Companies™ Survey. This 
accreditation demonstrates “very good levels 
of workplace engagement”. We shall continue 
to strive for excellence and the associated 3 
star rating. In November, Sumo Digital’s first 
revenue generating own-IP game, Snake Pass, 
won the industry accolade of Best Arcade 
Game at the much coveted TIGA Awards. 
TIGA is The Independent Game Developers’ 
Association, a network for games developers 
and digital publishers and a trade association 
representing the video games industry. 
Throughout the year under review, Sumo 
Digital continued to work with some of the 
largest publishers in the world. Over the 
past few years, we have worked with Sony, 
Microsoft, Sega, Deep Silver, IO Interactive 
and CCP Games, who announced their co-
development relationship with Sumo Digital 
in October 2017.
Sumo Digital remains focused on investing in 
its key relationships to develop and deliver high 
quality video games, while maintaining a high 
level of staff utilisation: in excess of 95% in the 
UK over recent years. This proven model gives 
Sumo Digital high quality and visible earnings. 
During the year, the shift towards more 
royalty arrangements as part of our contracts 
continued. We are always keen to align our 
interests with those of our clients and see the 
opportunity for financial out-performance on 
new iterations of proven games.
Atomhawk Design
Atomhawk Design Limited was acquired 
on 29 June 2017, at which time it was 
operating from a single studio in Newcastle. 
We announced the opening of Atomhawk’s 
new Vancouver studio in September and, 
in February 2018 the team moved to larger 
premises in the city.
This business provides visual development 
(concept art) and marketing art, as well as 
motion graphics and user interface design. 
Its expertise is in helping customers define a 
visual look for their products, from inception 
through development and, at the final point of 
sale, through marketing imagery, videos and 
box packaging design. Atomhawk primarily 
serves the creative industries, working 
with video games studios, as well as in 
film and television.
Results
In the year ended 31 December 2017, revenue 
rose by 27% to £30.6m (unaudited pro forma 
2016: £24.1m). This was driven by continuing 
strong organic growth at Sumo Digital, the 
release of its first own IP title, Snake Pass, and 
the acquisition of Atomhawk, which contributed 
revenue of £1.3m in the six months following 
its acquisition on 29 June 2017. Development 
fees for the year were £28.4m (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: £23.8m), an increase of 19.5% 
on the prior year and an increase of 33.5% on 
a like for like basis excluding pass-through 
revenue. The Group generated own intellectual 
property title revenue for the first time in 2017 
of £1.7m (2016: nil) and royalty income was 
£0.5m (unaudited pro forma 2016: £0.3m). 
Gross profit for the year was £13.3m 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: £9.0m), an increase 
of 47.2% on the prior year, and we achieved a 
gross margin of 43.3% (unaudited pro forma 
2016: 37.4%).
The Group achieved Adjusted EBITDA
1
 of 
£8.4m in 2017, a substantial increase on the 
unaudited pro forma £6.0m reported in 2016. 
Cash flow was strong during the year with cash 
generated from operations of £3.3m (unaudited 
pro forma 2016: £3.3m). Cash balances at the 
year end were £12.4m, following the repayment 
of bank and shareholder debt with the 
proceeds of the IPO. 
Further details of the Group’s financial results 
including the non-cash cost arising on the 
amortisation of intangible assets are set 
out in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review, 
which follows.
Operational review
Sumo Digital
Sumo Digital, the Group’s largest business 
representing 96% of revenue, is a developer 
of AAA-rated video games, providing both 
turnkey and co-development solutions to an 
international blue-chip client base. Its full-
service development solution includes initial 
concept and pre-production, production and 
development and post release support. 
Following the post year end takeover of 
CCP’s Newcastle studio on 1 January 2018, 
the business now operates from studios in 
Sheffield, Nottingham, Newcastle and Pune 
in India.
1 Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit before finance 
 costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items, 
 is a non GAAP metric used by management and is not an 
 IFRS disclosure. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 12
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
OUR BUSINESS MODEL 
AND STRATEGY 
Sumo Digital’s core strategy is 
to continue to grow organically as 
one of the leading co-developers 
of AA/AAA-rated gaming titles in the 
world, primarily using its contracted 
development fee model to minimise 
risk, and taking advantage of the 
forecast growth in the global 
gaming market.
Lower risk co-development 
operating model
Sumo Digital operates a lower risk contracting 
model than the majority of other developers 
and publishers who are more exposed to the 
commercial success or failure of the game. 
The Directors believe these long-term 
contracts de-risk the Group’s model by 
securing that payment is made in accordance 
with the achievement of a number of key 
milestones, during and following release  
of the game which are agreed prior to the 
start of the project, rather than on completion 
and/or sales performance.
Deliver and expand
•  Well placed to deliver significant growth 
through developing new franchise titles 
as the demand for creative content 
continues to grow;
•  Develop downloadable content for 
existing titles that can be used to extend 
further the revenue generating capability 
of games for publishers; and
•  Continue to recruit, retain, incentivise 
and develop the Group’s talent pool 
in order to increase the Group’s core 
development capacity and capability.
New strategic partners
•  Continue to win new clients and extend 
the Group's publisher portfolio;
•  Collaboration with other co-developers 
and extending existing co-development 
relationships; and
•  Potential to open or acquire new studios 
to enable recruitment from further 
pools of talent and gain exposure to new 
publishers and game genres.
Atomhawk has been involved in the creation 
of many high profile projects, including the 
movies Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor II and 
Avengers II, as well as the games Mortal 
Kombat, Injustice, RYSE and Killzone. 
Atomhawk also provides creative design and 
content for J.K. Rowling’s Pottermore and is a 
regular creative vendor for global brands such 
as Lego, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Marvel and 
Warner Bros.
Atomhawk’s customers include a number 
of high profile video game developers, movie 
studios and product designers, including 
NetherRealm Studios, CCP, Rebellion, Deep 
Silver, Rock Steady Studios, Square Enix, Ninja 
Theory, BBC, Rare and Ubisoft.
Atomhawk delivered a strong performance 
in the six months to 31 December 2017, well 
ahead of the Board’s original expectations at 
the time of acquisition.
Strategy
There are four parts to Sumo Group’s strategy: 
to deliver and expand, to win new clients, 
to add complementary revenue streams and 
to develop our own IP .
•  We plan to deliver and expand by developing 
subsequent franchise titles, by developing 
downloadable content, managing online 
communities (collectively referred to as 
‘games as a service’) and generating 
royalties, where our interests are clearly 
aligned with our clients; 
•  We plan to win new clients through the 
expansion of our publisher portfolio, 
collaborating with other developers and 
extending our co-development relationships, 
and also through selective acquisitions; 
•  We seek to develop complementary revenue 
streams through moving into new premium 
services, possibly through acquisition, as we 
have successfully done with Atomhawk; and 
•  Following the highly successful release 
of Snake Pass in 2017, we will continue 
to develop our own-IP through applying 
AAA mentality to indie games, although no 
releases are planned in 2018. It is important 
to emphasise that own-IP is expected to 
remain a relatively small part of the Group’s 
overall activities. It is, however, a useful 
activity that provides an additional, creative 
outlet for our highly talented people, 
while generating a significant return on 
investment. In 2017, Snake Pass received 
critical acclaim and became No.1 on the 
Nintendo e-shop charts in Europe.
Acquisitions
We are very pleased with Atomhawk, which 
performed strongly in the six months following 
its acquisition. This was the first acquisition 
completed by Sumo Digital and has provided a 
useful template for future acquisitions which 
complement Sumo Digital’s proven organic 
growth model. 
The Board is particularly keen to acquire 
owner-managed businesses, where the 
vendors remain with the business post 
acquisition and where we can use our quoted 
share structure to provide suitable ongoing 
incentive arrangements.
The IPO
We were delighted to achieve a successful 
IPO and join AIM in December 2017. This was 
a longstanding objective and an important 
milestone in the development of Sumo Group. 
The management team holds a significant 
shareholding in the business and I am 
grateful to our people and our advisers, 
who worked so hard to make the IPO happen, 
and also to Perwyn and our new investors  
for their support.
People
Sumo Group is a people business and we 
are investing in our people and will continue 
to do so. This investment includes recruiting 
new joiners and incentivising our staff. 
During the year, our headcount increased 
by 107, appointing new people in each of our 
operating locations. The management team 
was strengthened to address our market 
opportunities and to prepare for the IPO. 
New roles were created, including Portfolio 
Director, Senior Development Director and 
General Counsel & Company Secretary. 
Own intellectual property
•  Following the successful launch of 
Snake Pass, which has generated a 
return on investment in excess of 83% 
since launch, the Directors intend to 
continue to operate Group-wide Game 
Jams and selectively develop ‘Indie 
Games’.
Acquisition of complementary 
revenue streams
•  Consider earnings enhancing 
acquisitions of premium video game 
service providers and complementary 
video game developers. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 13

MARKET DRIVERS 
Shift to digital 
The proliferation of online distribution 
platforms has resulted in significant growth 
in the sale of digitally distributed games. 
Historically, games have been sold through 
physical retail channels. An increase in digital 
downloads has resulted in a reduced cost of 
distribution, greater ease of self-publishing 
and promotion, the potential for dynamic 
pricing and the potential for games to move 
from a product to a service. A ‘games-as-a-
service’ role allows us to extend the lifespan 
and revenue generation of a game title.
Embedded user base
Historically, there has been a clearly defined 
console hardware cycle, which in turn defined 
the software cycle. Third party publishers 
would wait for the market to be in a favourable 
position before investing in software. Gamers 
would also be less inclined to purchase 
new games at the end of one console’s life 
cycle. The current installed console base has 
seen an increase in the ability to play games 
from previous generation consoles on new 
generation consoles.  
This increased backward compatibility has 
substantial benefits for developers and 
provides the opportunity for constant mass 
market penetration.
Geographic expansion
The video games market is benefiting from 
global emerging markets. In China, the sale 
of games consoles was banned in 2000 but 
the ban was lifted in January 2014. There 
is also huge potential demand from South 
America (+15% CAGR for retail sales,  
FY16-21), the fastest of all geographies.¹ 
Broadening demographics
The age demographics of video gamers 
continues to broaden. Consumers remain 
engaged past adolescence due to continued 
innovation. Video games attract a wide mix 
of consumers, who are typically ‘sticky’ over 
time. The current average video game player 
is 35 years old. The video games market has 
also become non-gender specific with over 
40% being female gamers.² 
We expect to continue 
our organic growth and 
are also keen to acquire 
suitable, complementary 
businesses. My Board 
colleagues and I are 
confident about the 
outlook for the Group 
in the year ahead.
Since IPO, we have taken steps to incentivise 
our staff, which include providing opportunities 
to participate in our newly listed equity, and 
we are investing in our premises to provide a 
quality working environment.
It was pleasing for Darren Mills, a co-founder 
of Sumo Digital, and me to feature in Games 
Industry.biz’s Top 100 Most Influential in 2017 
and I was particularly gratified to receive an 
honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam 
University. Sheffield is a burgeoning tech hub 
in the UK and we take our local heritage 
very seriously.
I would like to extend my personal thanks and 
appreciation to all our people for their hard 
work in 2017. In August, we had our regular 
Sumo Big Day Out, which is a celebration event 
for all the families involved with making Sumo 
great! I am already looking forward to our next 
Big Day Out this coming summer .
The market 
2017 lived up to expectations, proving to be 
a productive year for video game developers 
and publishers. The launch of the Nintendo 
Switch
TM
 and Microsoft’s Xbox One X 
demonstrated the buoyancy of the premium 
console market and demand for premium 
content on these devices reached an all-time 
high. Xbox One X, the third release of new 
hardware under the Xbox One name, confirms 
Microsoft’s commitment to iterative hardware. 
Nintendo Switch
TM
 has proved to be a prime 
target for ‘indie developers’. 25 of the Top 30
1
 
most downloaded titles were developed by 
‘Indies’. Sumo Digital directly benefited from 
this platform, being rewarded with a No.1 for 
Snake Pass on Nintendo Europe’s eShop.
2017 was also the first full year of sales for 
Sony’s Playstation® VR, for which Sumo 
Newcastle, under its previous owners CCP 
Games, saw the release of their critically 
acclaimed title “Eve Valkyrie”. Sumo Digital 
is well positioned to pursue opportunities 
in this space as the installed base grows to 
what will eventually become a mass-market 
proposition. Another exciting platform for 
Sumo Digital is Esports, where we were part 
of the team that developed Forza Motorsport 
in 2017. 
With the global video games market worth 
over $113bn in 2017 (up c.8% on 2016) with 
a forecast CAGR of c. 8% to 2021
2
, this is 
an exciting time to be providing video game 
development services. 
Outlook
The new financial year ending 31 December 
2018 has started strongly. Whilst it is still early 
in the year, the Board already expects to deliver 
results slightly ahead of market expectations. 
We are continuing to see strong demand 
for the Group’s services and we are well 
placed to take advantage of the considerable 
opportunities. Those of us who were at GDC 
(Game Developers Conference) in March 
2018 saw at first hand the strength of growth 
in our chosen markets, with the associated 
opportunities this brings, and the Group’s 
business development pipeline reflects this.
We expect to continue our organic growth and 
are also keen to accelerate this by acquiring 
suitable, complementary businesses. My 
Board colleagues and I are confident about 
the outlook for the Group in the year ahead.

GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW
These financial statements are the first to be prepared since Sumo Group's IPO 
in December 2017. They cover the period in which the Group transitioned from 
the previous ownership structure, when it was majority owned by funds under 
the management of Perwyn LLP for more than 11 months, to the new status as 
a listed company 10 days before the financial year end. Accordingly, the financial 
information reflects the leveraged structure in place for most of the year and also 
the reorganisation of the Group in preparation for the IPO, together with the significant 
costs incurred in this process and also the non-cash and non-recurring amortisation 
charge from a change of accounting estimate regarding the useful economic life 
of intangible assets arising on the transaction with Perwyn in September 2016.
 
GROUP FINANCIAL 
REVIEW
Basis of preparation 
of the financial statements 
Sumo Group plc was incorporated as a private 
limited company with the name Aghoco 
1611 Limited on 20 November 2017; was re-
registered as a public limited company with the 
name Sumo Group plc on 14 December 2017 
and was inserted as a new holding company 
by way of a share for share exchange which 
constituted a Group reorganisation.
The transaction is accounted for as a capital 
reorganisation and merger accounting applied. 
Accordingly, the financial statements present 
12 months' results for the year ended 31 
December 2017 with a comparative period 
for the four months from 26 August 2016, 
the date shortly before the transaction with 
Perwyn, to 31 December 2016. For the purpose 
of providing full year information for 2016 and 
to help users of this information to assess the 
underlying financial performance of the Group, 
we have set out in note 30 unaudited pro forma 
information derived from Part Three: Historical 
Financial Information of the Admission 
Document dated 15 December 2017.
Results overview
The underlying trading of the Group was strong 
in the year under review. Revenue for the 
year was £30.6m (unaudited pro forma 2016: 
£24.1m), which includes £2.0m (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: £3.6m) of pass-through revenue 
on which Sumo Digital does not charge 
a margin.
These figures reflect continuing strong organic 
growth at Sumo Digital and the acquisition 
of Atomhawk on 29 June 2017. Atomhawk 
contributed £1.3m and £0.4m of revenue 
and EBITDA respectively in the period since 
acquisition. The like for like increase in 
revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, was 
£6.9m, an increase on the prior year of 33.5%.
Adjusted EBITDA was £8.4m on revenue of 
£30.6m. This was in line with the Board’s 
expectation at the time of the IPO and was 
significantly ahead of the unaudited pro forma 
Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 of £6.0m. 
The underlying adjusted profit before tax, 
exceptional items and amortisation of customer 
contracts and relationships for the year was 
£7.5m (2016: £5.3m) and reported loss before 
tax was £28.0m (2016: loss of £2.1m), as set out 
in the table opposite.
Cash flow was strong with cash generated from 
operations of £3.3m (unaudited pro forma 2016: 
£3.3m). Cash balances at the year end were 
£12.4m, following the repayment of bank and 
shareholder debt from the proceeds of the IPO. 
Trading
Development fees for the year were £28.4m, 
an increase of 19.5% on the unaudited pro 
forma figure of £23.8m in 2016. In 2017 Sumo 
Digital successfully released its first own 
intellectual property title, Snake Pass, which 
generated £1.7m of revenue in the year . Sumo 
Group also received £0.5m (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: £0.3m) of royalty income.
Gross profit for the year was £13.3m, an 
increase of 47.2% on the unaudited proforma 
gross profit of £9.0m in the prior year . We 
include Video Game Tax Relief (‘VGTR’) within 
our cost of sales and accordingly, for both 
years, our gross profit and gross margin 
reflect these amounts. We believe this is the 
appropriate treatment of these credits, as 
gross margin is best considered after taking 
account of the effect of VGTR.
Gross margin was 43.3% (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: 37.4%). If we exclude pass-
through revenue the gross margin was 46.4% 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: 44.0%).
Operating expenses for the year were £35.8m 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: £8.1m). Included 
within operating expenses were amortisation 
and depreciation of £27.6m and £0.7m 
respectively (unaudited pro forma 2016: 
£3.7m and £0.6m respectively). The non-cash 
amortisation charge is explained below. The 
overall increase in operating expenses other 
than amortisation and depreciation was 
primarily due to investment in people and 
systems ahead and in anticipation of the IPO, 
the inclusion of Atomhawk for the second six 
months of the year and increased premises 
costs on the newly acquired leasehold units 
in Sheffield. The Group spent £0.9m on 
research and development, all of which 
has been expensed.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group’s strategy is aligned to its overall 
financial goal to deliver increasing returns to 
shareholders over the long term. We present 
the key KPIs the Board reviews during the year:

43.3%
Audited 2016: 41.9%

Unaudited pro forma 2016: £6.0m
Operating cash flow
£3.3m
Audited 2016: £2.7m
Unaudited pro forma 2016: £3.3m
The net finance charge for the year was £5.4m 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: £3.0m), arising on 
the debt structure in place until the receipt of 
the proceeds of the IPO. The Corporation Tax 
credit for the year was £4.5m (unaudited pro 
forma 2016: £0.9m credit).
Treatment of IPO and acquisition costs
Transaction costs were incurred in a number 
of areas in relation to the IPO and raising 
of new financing. The accounting treatment 
is governed by IFRS 3. Accordingly, £1.9m 
and £2.5m of transaction costs were charged 
to equity and through the income statement 
respectively.
The consideration of £2.9m paid for the 
acquisition of Atomhawk has been capitalised 
and goodwill and other intangibles of £2.2m 
are carried on the balance sheet as at 31 
December 2017. £0.2m of transaction costs 
were charged through the income statement.
Cash flow
The cash performance in the year was strong. 
Cash generated from operations was £3.3m 
(unaudited pro forma 2016: £3.3m). Capital 
expenditure in the year was £1.6m (unaudited 
pro forma 2016: £0.9m) most of which related 
either to the refitting of the premises in 
Sheffield, which was ongoing over the year 
end, or to the purchase of IT equipment and 
systems. The cash cost of the acquisition 
of Atomhawk was £2.9m and it had cash 
balances of £0.6m at the date of acquisition.
Balance sheet
Sumo Group is a people business and as such 
has a relatively simple balance sheet. The 
balance sheet has been dominated by the 
intangible assets arising from the acquisition 
by Perwyn in September 2016, more than 
15 months before the accounting reference 
date. These intangible assets consisted of 
client contracts, client relationships and 
goodwill. In the past the intangible assets 
held in respect of the former two categories 
were amortised over five years and ten years 
respectively while goodwill was tested annually 
for impairment. The assets arose in respect of 
contracts and relationships as at September 
2016 and do not reflect contracts signed or 
relationships developed since that date.

The unaudited pro forma 2016 figures are extracted from note 30.
The adjustment to revenue is in respect of pass-through revenue on which Sumo Digital does not charge a margin.
The adjustment in respect of interest cost is to reflect the ungeared structure of the Group as it is following the IPO in December 2017.
The amortisation charge in respect of software in 2016 is extracted from Historical Financial Information in the Admission Document dated 15 December 2017.
This table is presented to help users of this information to assess the underlying financial performance of the Group in a period of significant change, mainly arising from the IPO and where the comparative period is 
unusual. At the time of the IPO, the pass-through revenue was separately identified in the Admission Document and hence consistent disclosure is considered appropriate. The adjustment in respect of net finance 
costs is to illustrate how the results may have been impacted if the Group had operated with no net debt as was the position at 31 December 2017 following the IPO. Sumo Group plc Annual Report 2017 16
GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
As a public listed company, we have reviewed 
the policy for these historical intangible 
assets in respect of client contracts and client 
relationships. Following the review, we now 
value these intangible assets by reference to 
the specific time period for each of the client 
contracts in place at September 2016 and an 
assessment of the appropriate time period for 
the client relationship from that date which we 
now consider to be two years. We have also 
taken account of changes in the scope of the 
client contracts and client relationships.
These amendments constitute a change 
in accounting estimate, not a change in 
policy, and the effect is to amortise the 
historical intangible assets arising on the 
September 2016 change of ownership over 
a shorter period. 
Goodwill and other intangibles reduced by 
£25.3m, reflecting the non-cash goodwill 
and amortisation charge of £27.6m less the 
increase in other intangibles arising from the 
acquisition of Atomhawk in the period.
Current assets increased to £22.6m (2016: 
£14.6m). Cash increased from £4.5m at 31 
December 2016 to £12.4m at 31 December 
2017. Trade and other receivables were 
£10.2m (2016: £10.1m).
The Group used some of the proceeds of the 
IPO to repay its bank borrowings and finished 
the year with net cash of £12.4m. At the prior 
year end, it had borrowings of £56.7m. On 
15 December 2017, the Group entered into 
a £13m revolving credit facilities agreement 
with Clydesdale Bank plc. 
Interest is payable on amounts drawn down 
at the rate of one and a half to two percent 
above LIBOR and the term of the agreement 
is five years. As at the date of these financial 
statements, this facility remains undrawn.
Trade and other payables increased by £3.4m 
from £7.4m at 31 December 2016.
Dividend
In line with the strategy set out at the time 
of the flotation, the Directors intend to 
reinvest a significant portion of the Group’s 
earnings to facilitate plans for future growth. 
Accordingly, the Directors do not propose a 
dividend at the present time but it remains the 
Board’s intention, should the Group generate 
a sustained level of distributable profits, to 
consider a dividend policy in future years. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As part of the process for admission to AIM, the Group reviewed and updated its principal risks and 
uncertainties and associated mitigation activity. These risks were considered again by the Board in 
preparing this Annual Report and those considered most important are set out below. As part of the 
Group’s structured risk management process, the Board will regularly consider those risks that might 
impact performance of the Group and will monitor mitigating actions being taken.
EFFECTIVEL Y 
MANAGING OUR RISKS
The key business and financial risks for the Group are set out below:
Risk Description and mitigation
STRATEGIC Dependence on the video games development market 
The Group derives a significant proportion of its revenues from the co-development work it carries out for video games 
developers and publishers. The success of the Group will continue to depend on its ability to be engaged to develop 
video games for such third parties. There can be no assurance that these client relationships will continue, or that the 
revenue that the Directors expect to generate from these relationships will materialise. 
T o mitigate this risk, the Group places considerable emphasis on maintaining positive working relationships with its 
existing clients and on its strategic intent of extending the number of key client relationships.
Dependence on a concentrated client base 
In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group generated the majority of its revenue from three clients who each 
accounted for at least 10% of total revenues. This included revenue from multiple projects with different entities within 
each client’s group. The loss of any of the key clients could have a material impact on the Group’s financial results. 
The Group is reliant on the long-term commercial success of its clients. The performance of such clients will have a 
significant bearing on the success of the Group in terms of the requirement for future video games to be developed and 
released, however their performance cannot be guaranteed. Underperformance of the Group’s clients could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, operations, revenues or prospects. The Group looks to mitigate such 
risks through having strong relationships with some of the world’s largest publishers who have a strong track record of 
launching successful games and by attracting new clients.
Market growth, new developments and technological trends
The global video games market has seen consistent growth for many years. There is, however, a risk to the Group that 
trends may reverse or continue at slower rates than expected. The video games market is competitive and selective 
and is subject to concentration and economic fluctuations, with rapid technological changes requiring significant 
research and development investment.
The industry also faces challenges such as the shift towards digital online distribution, a second-hand market, piracy 
and emerging competitors. In order to remain competitive, the Group will need to continue to select the projects it 
works on and their target format(s) carefully and adapt how it derives revenues from its games and technology. If the 
Group is not successful in doing so, this could have a material adverse effect on the financial and trading position of 
the Group.
FINANCIAL Video Game Tax Relief (‘VGTR’)
The Group benefits from the VGTR regime that came into force in 2014 and to date the majority of games the Group 
works on qualify for VGTR. There can be no guarantee that future games will qualify for VGTR or that all current claims 
will be successful. If changes to VGTR policy were made in the future, it could potentially restrict how the Group could 
work with its clients and remain eligible for VGTR. If current or future games were not able to benefit from VGTR, this 
could materially impact the Group’s financial performance.
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group has certain contracts priced in foreign currencies and also has employees based overseas paid in foreign 
currencies. It is therefore exposed to the risk that adverse exchange rate movements could cause its costs to increase 
relative to its reporting currency resulting in reduced profitability. The Group, where deemed relevant, takes steps to 
mitigate this risk by putting in place hedging arrangements to reduce exposure to currency risk, however these may 
not always be entirely effective and residual currency risk may exist. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 19
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
Risk Description and mitigation
OPERATIONAL Ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel
The Company’s operational and financial performance is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain effective 
personnel. The Directors believe that the Group is putting in place the appropriate remuneration and other 
incentivisation structures and processes to attract and retain the calibre of employees necessary to ensure the efficient 
management and development of the Group. However, any difficulties encountered in hiring and retaining appropriate 
employees and the failure to do so may have a detrimental effect upon the trading performance of the Group. The ability 
to attract and retain employees with the appropriate expertise and skills cannot be guaranteed. This risk  
may be exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
Overseas operations
The Group currently has two overseas operations, one in Pune (India) and the other in Vancouver (Canada). These 
jurisdictions have different regulatory, financial and legal environments that could change in the future and could affect 
how the Group conducts its business in these countries. If the Group fails to comply with the laws and regulations 
applicable to its overseas operations, it could be subject to reputational and legal risks, including government 
enforcement action and/or fines.
COMPLIANCE IT security risks
The video game industry is subject to the threat of IT security breaches, unauthorised copying and software piracy. 
The Group’s hardware and software are typically subject to copy protection technology or other technological protection 
measures intended to prevent software piracy but these measures may not be adequate to do so. Unauthorised copying 
of the Group’s own intellectual property games, or games produced by the Group for which the Group may be entitled to 
revenue-based royalties, could have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to generate revenues and profits. Complete 
protection cannot be guaranteed and an IT security breach could cause significant disruption to the Group’s operations.
Intellectual property
The Group relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright, non-disclosure laws and other contractual agreements 
and technical measures to protect its own and its clients’ intellectual property. The Group has entered into 
confidentiality provisions as part of its arrangements with its employees and consultants. Despite the Group’s efforts 
to protect its and its clients’ proprietary rights, unauthorised third parties may attempt to copy or use information from 
the video games the Group is working on. If the Group cannot successfully enforce its intellectual property rights or if 
a client’s intellectual property is damaged, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial 
condition and prospects.
BREXIT
There are significant uncertainties in relation to the terms and timeframe within which the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the European Union will be effected, and there are significant uncertainties as to what the impact will be on the fiscal, 
monetary and regulatory landscape in the UK, including inter alia, the UK’s tax system, the conduct of cross-border 
business and export and import tariffs. There is also uncertainty in relation to how, when and to what extent these 
developments will impact on the economy in the UK and the future growth of its various industries and on levels of 
investor activity and confidence, on market performance and on exchange rates. There is also a risk that the vote by  
the UK to leave could result in other member states re-considering their respective membership of the European 
Union. Although it is not possible to predict fully the effects of the UK’s exit from the European Union, any of these risks 
could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, profitability and share price of the Group.
The Strategic Report, which includes the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, Our business model and strategy, 
the Group financial review and the Principal risks and uncertainties, was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee Report for the year ended 31 December 2017. As the Committee was only established shortly before 
the year end, and only held its first meeting during early 2018, this report necessarily includes some actions taken since the year end or planned 
to occur during 2018.
The Audit Committee is chaired by myself as an independent Non-Executive Director and consists of all three Non-Executive Directors.
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial statements and external announcements of the Group’s results and approving the appointment and remuneration of the 
Group’s external auditor, reviewing their reports and ensuring their independence is maintained, in all cases having due regard to the interests 
of shareholders. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on all these matters and meets at least three times a year .
Experience
I am a qualified chartered accountant and the Chief Financial Officer of another listed company and my Committee colleagues have considerable 
experience in senior financial or operational roles.
External audit
The Audit Committee approves the appointment and remuneration of the Group’s external auditor and satisfies itself that they maintain their 
independence regardless of any non-audit work performed by them. The Group has adopted a formal policy governing the performance of non-
audit work by the auditor . The auditor is permitted to provide non-audit services which are not, and are not perceived to be, in conflict with auditor 
independence, providing it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work and is considered to be the most appropriate to undertake 
such work in the best interests of the Group. All assignments are monitored by the Committee.
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and external auditor in connection with the Group financial statements are explained in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 32 and the Auditor's Report on pages 33 to 36. Details of services provided by and fees payable 
to the auditor are shown in note 10 of the Group financial statements.
Whilst the Audit Committee has not adopted a formal policy in respect of the rotation of the external auditor, one of its principal duties is to make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external auditor . Various factors would be taken into account by the Committee 
in this respect, including the quality of the reports provided to the Committee and the level of understanding of the Group’s business. 
Internal control and risk management
The Audit Committee supports the Board in reviewing the risk management methodology and the effectiveness of internal control. Regular internal 
control updates will be provided to the Audit Committee. These will include reviewing and updating the risk register and assessing the mitigating 
actions in place and updates to action plans agreed in previous meetings.
Internal audit
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function but acknowledges the importance that internal audit can play in establishing an effective 
control environment. A formal Internal Audit function, including either internal or outsourced external support, is being considered and will be put in 
place during the 2018 financial year .
Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee considered whether the 2017 Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable and whether 
it provided the necessary information for Shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. The Committee was 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 2017 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether appropriate estimates and judgements have 
been made by management. The Committee also reviews accounting papers prepared by management, and reviews reports by the external auditor . 
The specific areas reviewed by the Committee in respect of the year were:
• appropriateness of the merger accounting principles in the preparation of the Group financial statements,
• appropriateness of the treatment of costs in relation to the IPO and the presentation in the Group financial statements,
• appropriateness of the disclosure in the financial statements, given the first period as a listed Group,
• the recognition of contract revenue,
• the useful economic lives of intangible assets,
• the accounting treatment of Video Games Tax Relief Credits.

23 April 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 23
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, but the Board has chosen to apply the 
Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies 2013 published by the Quoted Companies Alliance (the ‘QCA Code’), as far as 
it considers appropriate for a company of the Company’s size and nature. 
The Company and its current Board and Board Committees were constituted in December 2017 as part of the preparation for admission to AIM and 
therefore this report relates to the few days to the end of 2017 and makes reference to actions planned for the current year and therefore does not 
specifically disclose non-compliance with the adopted code.
Board composition and operation
The Board comprises three Non-Executive and two Executive Directors. The Board has an annual schedule of meetings and, to enable the Board 
to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all Directors in advance of 
Board meetings.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures are 
followed, and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, the Company’s Articles of Association allow Directors to obtain 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board will conduct an appraisal of its own performance and that of each Director during the 2018 financial year . This is expected to include 
the use of prescribed questionnaires that are completed by all Directors. The results will be reviewed, and individual feedback will be given by an 
independent Non-Executive Director in respect of assessments of the Chairman, and by the Chairman in respect of assessments of each of the 
other Directors and the Board as a whole.
Board Committees 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Michael Sherwin and has primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the 
financial performance of the Group is properly measured and reported on and reviewing reports from the Group’s auditor, in all cases having due 
regard to the interests of Shareholders. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on all these matters and will meet at least three times a year . 
The Audit Committee has terms of reference in place which have been formally approved by the Board. Ken Beaty and Ian Livingstone are the other 
members of the Audit Committee. Further information is set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 22.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Ian Livingstone and determines the terms and conditions of service of the Executive Directors and other 
senior management, including their remuneration and annual and long-term incentive arrangements. The Remuneration Committee meets at least 
twice a year and has terms of reference in place that have been approved by the Board. Michael Sherwin is the other member of the Remuneration 
Committee. Further information is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 29.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Ken Beaty, and its primary purpose is to identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill board vacancies as and when they arise. The Nomination Committee will meet as required, and at least once a year . Michael Sherwin and 
Ian Livingstone are the other members of the Nomination Committee. The Committee has terms of reference in place which have been formally 
approved by the Board.
The Committee also reviews the structure, size, diversity and composition of the Board and makes recommendations concerning the annual re-
appointment of any Non-Executive Director and the identification and nomination of new Directors. The Committee will retain external search and 
selection consultants as appropriate.
In respect of new appointments, following an evaluation, it will prepare, in conjunction with the Board, a detailed job description of the role with a 
candidate profile and the capabilities required for a particular appointment. In drafting this, consideration will be given to the existing experience, 
knowledge and background of board members as well as the strategic and business objectives of the Group. It determines the scope of the role of a 
new Director, the skills and time commitment required and is actively involved in the recruitment process. 
On appointment, new Directors will receive a full, formal and tailored induction. Training sessions are organised during the year for the Board on 
matters considered relevant to the discharge of the Directors’ duties and Directors may take additional training where necessary as part of their 
continuing development at the expense of the Company.
The Board is committed to effective corporate governance as the basis for delivering long-term 
value growth and for meeting shareholder expectations for proper leadership and oversight 
of the business. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 24
Attendance at meetings
In future years, the Company intends to report the number of scheduled meetings of the Board (excluding such ad hoc meetings as were necessary 
during the year to address specific matters arising) and of each of the Board Committees, together with a record of the attendance of the current 
Directors who are their respective members. During 2017 all meetings of the Board that took place were specifically in respect of preparations for 
the admission of the Company to AIM and there were no meetings of any of the Board Committees.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control, to provide it with reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial information that is used within the business and for publication and the safeguarding of assets. There are 
inherent limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Some examples of internal controls operated by the Group are given below.
During the year the Group’s financial information, system of controls, risks and risk management were subject to significant scrutiny by a number 
of professional advisers as part of the process for admission to AIM. This included:
• The preparation of a Financial Prospects and Procedures Memorandum which included a full assessment of internal controls;
• A report on the Group’s financial history and on its unaudited interim financial information by reporting accountants;
• Legal, commercial and IT due diligence reports;
• The preparation and issue of the Admission Document following a rigorous verification process.
The Financial Prospects and Procedures Memorandum included a number of recommendations, most of which were implemented prior to 
Admission. The few remaining recommendations have now been, or are very nearly completed. 
The Board has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks. The process includes:
• Preparation and approval of budgets and regular monitoring of actual performance against budget;
• Preparation of monthly consolidated management accounts;
• Preparation of updated profitability and cash flow forecasts to reflect actual performance and revised outlook as the year progresses, 
 including an assessment of the adequacy of funds for the foreseeable future;
• Monitoring the status of projects in development and future development opportunities.
During the year the Board adopted a risk management framework and a risk register and both will be kept under regular review by the Audit 
Committee.
The Group will continue to take steps to embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the business and to deal with 
areas for improvement which come to the attention of management and the Board. 
Shareholders
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors will always make themselves available to meet with shareholders. Each AGM is a particular 
opportunity for this. In addition, the Executive Directors are in frequent contact with the Company’s shareholders and brief the Board on shareholder 
issues. The Board believes that the disclosures set out on pages 02 to 19 of this Annual Report provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Share capital structure
Details of the Company’s share capital can be found in the Directors’ Report and in note 24 of the Group financial statements.
Going concern basis
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Group 
financial review, together with the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities. Financial projections 
have been prepared to December 2019 which show positive earnings and cash flow generation and project compliance with banking covenants at 
each testing date. Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual Group 
financial statements. 
Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The Group’s actual results could differ materially from 
those estimated or anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Information contained in this Annual Report and 
Accounts relating to the Company should not be relied upon as a guide to future performance.
Annual General Meeting 
The business to be conducted at the Annual General Meeting of the Company is set out in the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting which 
accompanies this Annual Report.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017.
I chair the Remuneration Committee as an Independent Non-Executive Director and Michael Sherwin, who is also an independent Non-Executive 
Director is the other member of the Committee. We are supported by Steven Webb as Company Secretary and, since the end of the year, the 
Committee has appointed PwC to provide it with external remuneration advice. During the financial year, PwC advised the Company on all aspects 
of remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the associated drafting for the Admission Document. PwC also provided advice to the Company 
in relation to the drafting and implementation of Executive and all-employee incentives. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice 
received was objective and independent. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is 
designed to ensure objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. PwC received a fee of £59,750 for their advice during the 
year to 31 December 2017. 
The aim of this report is to provide shareholders with information to understand our remuneration strategy and its linkage to the Group’ s financial 
performance. As this is our first Annual Report, there are some elements of remuneration reporting, such as multi-year share price performance against 
a comparator group, that are not possible to include. Our intention is to add these in future years once they become meaningful for shareholders.
In preparing the report, we have taken account of the guidance issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance, as the Company has chosen to apply 
the Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies published by the QCA, so far as the Directors consider appropriate for 
a company of the Company’s size and nature.
Responsibilities
The Committee’s terms of reference are to review the performance of the Executive Directors and of the members of the Operating Board and 
determine their terms and conditions of service, including their short and long-term rewards, having due regard to the interests of shareholders 
and to any risks that might arise to the Company. In doing so, the Committee will have regard to the position of employees across the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee will meet at least twice a year . 
Our performance in 2017
The successful IPO was a major achievement during the year and this signalled the achievement of several performance objectives which had 
been set under the Group’s previous ownership structure for the purposes of annual bonuses. The design and detail of the post-IPO remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors and Operating Board members reflect the needs of the Company as a member of AIM and the growth strategy 
described in the Admission Document.
Key pay out-turns for 2017
Each of the Executive Directors was entitled to receive an accrued bonus on their pre-IPO terms equating to 50% of annual salary. In the case of 
David Wilton, this was based on a pro-rated amount to reflect that he was not with the Group for the full year .
Looking forward to 2018
The key terms of the remuneration policy are set out on pages 26 to 28 and the key components of Executive packages are summarised as follows:
• Base salary, pension and benefits positioned competitively to the market in which the Company operates.
•  Annual bonus – an annual bonus with performance criteria based on a mixture of profit-based and personal objectives as set by the 
Remuneration Committee.
•  Long-term incentive plan (‘L TIP’) – share-based awards with three-year performance criteria based on EPS growth and total shareholder 
return over the performance period, with a further one year holding period for 50% of the grant.
I do hope that this Report clearly explains our approach to remuneration and enables you to appreciate how it underpins our business 
growth strategy.

• The Remuneration Committee will consider annually whether 
 further awards will be made to Executive Directors.

the Company shortly before Admission, 
has a significant interest in the Company’s 
performance aligned with shareholders.

The table below provides more detail on the key features of our remuneration policy:
Element Policy Purpose and link to strategy
Pension • Both Executive Directors are entitled to receive pension 
 contributions from the Company which are equal to 5% 
 of the base salary delivered as:
 – Money purchase benefits; or
 – A cash equivalent
Not included as salary for the purposes of annual bonus or 
L TIP awards.
To recruit and retain the right people to deliver 
the strategy.
Benefits The Executives are entitled to a standard Director benefits package 
including a car allowance, private medical expenses insurance and 
life assurance cover .
To recruit and retain the right people to deliver 
the strategy.
Termination Information on the service contracts for Executive Directors 
and letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors is 
provided below.
On a termination, the Company would be obliged to meet its 
contractual obligations, but would apply a robust approach  
to the relevant individual mitigating any losses.
Honour contractual commitments while not 
paying more than is necessary.
Recruitment remuneration arrangements
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will set the director’s ongoing remuneration in a manner consistent with the policy described 
above. To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required, the Committee may make an award to ‘buy-out’ variable remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer . In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form of award, 
any performance conditions and the time over which the award would have vested. Recruitment awards will normally be liable to forfeiture or 
‘clawback’ on early departure.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
Communication with Shareholders
The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and will seek the views of significant shareholders when 
formulating and implementing any changes to the remuneration policy, including when any major changes are being made to remuneration 
arrangements. The Remuneration Committee Chair will be available to answer questions from shareholders regarding remuneration at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Executive Director contracts and loss of office payments
Both Executive Directors entered into service agreements on 15 December 2017, which became effective upon Admission. The agreements require a 
notice period of one year from the Company and from the Executive. It is the Committee’s intention that any future service contracts will be subject to 
similar notice periods. 
Other than payment of salary and benefits in lieu of notice, the Directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment do not provide for benefits 
on termination of employment.
Outstanding awards made under the L TIP would normally lapse on an Executive leaving employment. However, there are specific rules of the plan 
dealing with the treatment of awards on leaving. In summary, if an Executive were a ‘good leaver’, he or she may be entitled to retain his or her 
award, although, for unvested awards:
• the number of shares under an award may be reduced to reflect any unexpired performance period (referred to as pro rating); and
• the award would normally remain subject to any applicable performance condition.
A ‘good leaver’ is someone who leaves by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, on the sale or transfer out of the Group of his or her employing 
business, on retirement with the agreement of the Committee or in other special circumstances at the Committee’s discretion. (Someone dying in 
service would also be a good leaver, with their personal representatives assuming their rights in respect of their awards).
Terms and conditions for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but appointment letters setting out their terms of appointment. Ken Beaty and Ian Livingstone 
were appointed on 15 December 2017 and Michael Sherwin on 21 December 2017. The appointments may be terminated on one month’s notice by 
either party. 
The Board considers that Michael Sherwin and Ian Livingstone are independent Non-Executive Directors.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
for the year ended 31 December 2017 Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 33
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
Opinion
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Sumo Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) for the year ended  
31 December 2017 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement, the Company balance 
sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosures Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the 
Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s 
or the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
• Overall materiality: £333,000, which represents approximately 4% of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA;
• Key Audit Matters were identified as the recognition of contract revenue, the useful economic lives of intangible assets, and the accounting 
treatment of Video Games Tax Relief Credits; and
• A full scope audit was performed of the financial statements of the Company, and all components determined to be significant. Full scope 
procedures were performed for entities comprising 100% of total revenues. A targeted approach was adopted for components not considered 
to be significant.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Sumo Group plc Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 34
Key Audit Matters
Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
The recognition of contract revenue 
There is a risk that revenue may be misstated due to the improper 
recognition of revenue.
Specifically in respect of the Group’s contractual arrangements with 
clients there is a risk that revenue is misstated as each contract’s 
outcome and stage of completion requires significant management 
judgement. 
We therefore identified the recognition of contract revenue as a 
significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Assessing whether the Group’s revenue recognition accounting 
policy is in accordance with International Accounting Standard  
(IAS) 11 ‘Construction Contracts’;
• Comparing a sample of contract revenue to the Group’s accounting 
policy to verify it was in line with the policy, and challenging the 
percentage of completion assessment made by management;
• Selecting a sample of contracts and agreeing to original signed 
documentation to confirm that a client agreement exists; and
• Agreeing a sample of revenue transactions to invoice and  
client confirmations. 
The Group’s accounting policy on the recognition of contract revenue  
is shown in note 2 to the financial statements and related disclosures 
are included in note 4. 
 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we have not found any indication that revenue 
has not been recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy and the requirements of IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’.
The useful economic lives of intangible assets 
In accordance with (IAS) 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, management have 
performed a review of the amortisation periods of the Group’s 
intangible assets. This review concluded that it would be appropriate to 
reduce the useful economic lives of customer contracts and customer 
relationships. This constitutes a change in accounting estimate, 
resulting in an increased amortisation charge for the year .
The determination of intangible assets’ useful economic lives is often a 
matter of significant judgement, as was the case in this situation.
We therefore identified the useful economic lives of intangible assets 
as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Assessing whether the Group’s accounting policy for the 
amortisation of intangible assets is in line with International 
Accounting Standard (IAS) 38 ‘Intangible Assets’;
• Understanding the justification provided by management for the 
revised useful economic lives, the key assumptions underpinning the 
assessment, agreeing to supporting documentation where relevant, 
and challenging the useful lives management have arrived at, based 
on our understanding of the Group’s business operations; and
• Re-performing the calculation of the amortisation charge, and 
investigating any differences identified.
The Group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is shown in  
note 2 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included 
in note 13. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we have not found any indication that the 
useful economic lives of intangible assets are not in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policies and in line with the requirements of 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Sumo Group plc Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 35
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
The accounting treatment of Video Games Tax Relief Credits 
The directors are of the opinion that Video Games Tax Relief Credits 
(VGTCs) are most appropriately recognised as a deduction from direct 
cost, rather than an element of taxation within the consolidated income 
statement. VGTCs are material to the Group financial statements and 
key to the financial structuring of the Group’s games development 
contracts.
There is currently diversity in practice regarding the financial  
reporting of VGTCs. As this is a tax credit, it may be expected that the 
accounting treatment is set out in IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’. However,  
a key judgement is whether VGTCs constitute investment tax credits, 
which are not defined within IFRS yet are specifically excluded from the 
scope of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and IAS 20 ‘ Accounting for Government 
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’.
We therefore identified the accounting treatment of VGTCs as one  
of the matters of most significance in the audit of the Group  
financial statements.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• Understanding the technical arguments relating to the accounting 
treatment of VGTCs;
• Assessing and challenging the appropriateness of management’s 
inclusion of VGTCs as a deduction from direct costs in the light of the 
nature of the Group’s business; 
• Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policy 
relating to VGTCs to ensure disclosures are in line with relevant 
accounting standards; and
• Using tax specialists to perform an assessment of the treatment  
of qualifying costs within the VGTC computations. 
The Group’s accounting policy for VGTCs is shown in note 2 to the 
financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 3  
and note 6.
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we have found that the accounting treatment 
for VGTCs is in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies and in 
line with the requirements of relevant accounting standards.
No Key Audit Matters were identified that are unique to the Company.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of  
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our  
audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Company
Financial statements as a whole £333,000 which is approximately 4% of 
adjusted EBITDA. This benchmark is 
considered the most appropriate because, 
whilst the Group is focused on delivering 
a profit, it has incurred disproportionate 
interest and amortisation charges during 
the year having spent over 11 months of the 
year as a Private Equity backed operation.
The Group was formed in December 2017, 
and therefore a comparison to prior year 
materiality is not relevant.
£300,000 which is based on 1% of total 
assets, capped to 90% of Group materiality. 
This benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because the Company acts  
as a holding company and does not trade.
The Company was incorporated in 
November 2017, and therefore a 
comparison to prior year materiality  
is not relevant.
Performance materiality used to drive  
the extent of our testing
75% of financial statement materiality. 75% of financial statement materiality.
Specific materiality £5,000 has been used for directors’

transactions.

threshold that, in our view, warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
£15,000 and misstatements below that 
threshold that, in our view, warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business, its environment and risk profile  
and in particular included:
• evaluation by the Group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine the planned audit 
response based on a measure of materiality. For example, significance as a percentage of the Group’s total assets, revenues and profit before 
taxation or significance based on qualitative factors, such as specific use is or concerns over specific components;  Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 36
• we performed a full scope audit of the financial statements of the Company, and all components determined to be significant based on their 
relative materiality to the Group and assessment of audit risk. Full scope procedures were performed for entities comprising 100% of total 
revenues;
• a targeted approach was adopted for components with no external revenue and not considered to be significant.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is 
a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 
Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 32, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1 General information
Sumo Group plc (‘the Company’) was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 20 November 2017 as a private company limited  
by shares under the Companies Act 2006 with the name Aghoco 1611 Limited and with the registered number 11071913. The Company was  
re-registered as a public limited company with the name Sumo Group plc on 14 December 2017. The address of its registered office is  
32 Jessops Riverside, Brightside Lane, Sheffield S9 2RX. 
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) is that of video games development.
The Group financial statements present 12 months results for the year ended 31 December 2017, with a comparative period for the four months 
from 26 August 2016 to 31 December 2016, and were approved by the Directors on 23 April 2018.
26 August 2016 is the date shortly before ownership of the former Sumo Group, then headed by Sumo Digital Holdings Limited, passed to its new 
owners. At the date of the reorganisation the ownership of the new entity was the same as the previous group. Because of this, the accounts have 
been prepared as if the Group had existed in its current form from the date (26 August 2016) shortly before ownership last changed. Therefore, the 
Group is presented as if it had existed from 26 August 2016. To help users understand the performance of the operating business, proforma details 
for the operating activities are shown in note 30.
The Company financial statements are on pages 66 to 71.
Initial public offering (‘IPO’)
The Company’s shares were admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange, on 21 December 2017. These Group 
financial statements are the Company’s first subsequent to its admission to AIM and followed a Group reorganisation to facilitate the IPO.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under merger accounting principles because the transaction under which the Company became 
the holding company of Project Republica Topco Limited (‘Topco’), the previous parent undertaking of the Sumo trading operations, was a group 
reorganisation with no change in the ultimate ownership of the Sumo trading operations. All the shareholdings in Project Republica Topco Limited 
were exchanged via a share-for-share transfer on 13 December 2017. The Company did not actively trade at that time.
The result of the application of the capital reorganisation is to present the financial statements as if the Company had always owned the Sumo 
trading operations. Topco was incorporated on 26 August 2016 and itself acquired the Sumo companies on 8 September 2016 and therefore the 
comparative information presented is for the four months trading post acquisition.
Group reorganisation
The principal steps of the group reorganisation were as follows:
The Company was incorporated on 20 November 2017 as a private company limited by shares in England and Wales, with share capital  
of £390 divided into 39,000,000 Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each.
The Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group with Topco becoming the Company’s direct subsidiary on 13 December 2017  
by the issue of 3,900 Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each to the existing shareholders of Topco in return for the entire issued share capital of Topco.  
The shares were issued to each of the shareholders in proportion to the relative value of each of their shareholdings in Topco. 
On 13 December 2017 the Company capitalised amounts of £1,065,216 standing on the share premium account and utilised the amount for 
distribution amongst the shareholders of the Company in proportion to the number of shares held by them respectively on the basis of 2,731 bonus 
shares for every 1 share held, such that an aggregate of 106,521,617,940 new Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each were issued. Following this issue and 
allotment, all the issued Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each were then consolidated into 106,554,131 Ordinary Shares of £0.010000609158926 each.
On 13 December 2017, the Company undertook a reduction of share capital in accordance with Section 643 of the Companies Act, in which the 
nominal value of the Ordinary Shares was reduced to £0.01 each, which had the effect of reducing the share premium to £nil, with the balance 
credited to retained earnings.
The insertion of the Company as a new holding company by way of a share-for-share exchange constitutes a group reorganisation and the 
transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganisation.
Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are consolidated at book value in the Group financial statements 
and the consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and reverse acquisition reserve of the 
Company as if it had always existed.
On 21 December 2017 the Company issued 38,445,869 Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each, for consideration of £38,445,869 in an IPO, with the balance 
recorded as share premium. £1,940,000 of the IPO costs have been charged to the share premium account. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 42
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies 
The Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently to all the periods presented, are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the  
European Union (‘IFRS’), International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations and those provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been prepared on the going  
concern basis and on the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates, which are outlined  
in the critical accounting estimates and judgements section of these accounting policies. It also requires management to exercise its judgement  
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
Going concern
These Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors have reviewed the forecasts for the years ending 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 and consider the forecasts to be prudent 
and have assessed the impact of them on the Group’s cash flow, facilities and headroom within its banking covenants. Furthermore, the Directors 
have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and compared them with the level of available borrowing facilities. Based on this work, 
the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations which are not effective or early adopted:
At the date of authorisation of the Group financial statements, the following new standards and interpretations which have not been applied in this 
financial information were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 9 – Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16 – Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
The adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial information of the Group in the period of initial 
application when the relevant standards come into effect. The Directors have reviewed the Group’s activities using the five-step model set out in 
IFRS 15 and as a result consider that adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact.
The Directors are still assessing the impact of IFRS 16 which is expected to increase the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment, and lease 
liabilities by a range of £3.5m to £4.5m. There are other standards in issue which are not expected to have an impact on the Group and therefore have 
not been included in the list above.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed 
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business 
and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and 
volume rebates.
Where a contract is executed or where reasonable certainty exists that a contract will be executed for the provision of professional services, then 
revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, if this can be reliably estimated. Revenue for such contracts is stated as a proportion  
of the contract revenue appropriate to the stage of completion, less amounts recognised in previous years.
Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably and work is at the Group’s risk then costs will be expensed. Royalties are recognised in the period  
in which they are earned as designated in the contract.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (‘EBITDA ’) and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures used by management to 
assess the operating performance of the Group. Exceptional items are excluded from EBITDA to calculate Adjusted EBITDA.
The Directors primarily use the Adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s activities. As these are non-GAAP measures, 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence may not be directly comparable. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 43
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the Group’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling  
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average 
rates applicable in the period. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and documented in a separate 
component of equity.
Classification of instruments issued by the Group
Instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following  
two conditions:
• they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities 
with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
• where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation  
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed 
amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the items are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form  
of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude 
amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property,  
plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment. Depreciation is provided on the following basis:
Leasehold improvements Over period of lease
Fixtures and fittings 25% straight line
Computer hardware 50% straight line
It has been assumed that all assets will be used until the end of their economic life. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Intangible assets 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition 
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal or 
contractual rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and are initially recognised at fair value.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Computer software purchased separately, that does not form an integral part of related hardware, is capitalised at cost. Amortisation is charged 
to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite and is presented within 
operating expenses. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives, which were reviewed and amended in the year resulting in an accelerated amortisation charge, are as follows:
Customer relationships 2 years
Customer contracts Over period of contract
Software 2 years Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 44
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
Impairment
For goodwill that has an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. For other assets, the recoverable amount is only 
estimated when there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.  
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  
to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit  
is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets  
or groups of assets.
Inventories
Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs plus attributable overheads based on normal levels of activity on a first in first out basis. 
Provision is made for any foreseeable losses where appropriate. No element of profit is included in the valuation of work in progress.
Post-employment benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Operating lease payments
Operating leases are leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership related to the asset are not transferred to the Group.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received 
are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable and interest receivable on funds invested. Interest income and interest payable are recognised  
in profit or loss as they accrue using the effective interest method. Foreign exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities are also 
presented within financing.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates  
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or in  
equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes, except to the extent that it arises on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Video Games Tax Relief Credits
Video Games Tax Relief Credits have only been recognised where management believe that a tax credit will be recoverable based on their experience 
of obtaining the relevant certification and the success of similar historical claims. Such credits are recognised as part of direct costs in order to 
reflect the substance of these credits to the Group and cash flows are presented within operating activities. The debit is recorded on the balance 
sheet as ‘VGTC recoverable’ within current assets. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 45
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank borrowings that are repayable on demand and form an integral part  
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value and thereafter are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.  
A provision for impairment is made where there is objective evidence (including clients with financial difficulties or in default on payments) that 
amounts will not be recovered in accordance with the original terms of the agreement. A provision for impairment is established when the carrying 
value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flow discounted using the original effective interest rate. The carrying value  
of the receivable is reduced through the use of an allowance account and any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial derivatives
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to risks arising from operational activities, principally foreign exchange risk. 
In accordance with treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group does not hedge 
account for these items. Any gain or loss arising from derivative financial instruments is based on changes in fair value, which is determined by direct 
reference to active market transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists. At certain times the Group has foreign currency 
forward contracts that fall into this category.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of 
the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially recorded at fair value and thereafter at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Segmental reporting
The Group reports its business activities in one area: video games development, which is reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
to the Board of Directors, which has been identified as the chief operating decision maker . The Board of Directors consists of the Executive Directors 
and the Non-Executive Directors. 
Exceptional costs
The Group presents as exceptional costs on the face of the income statement, those significant items of expense, which, because of their size, nature 
and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial 
performance in the period. This facilitates comparison with prior periods and trends in financial performance more readily. Such costs include 
professional fees and other costs, directly related to the change in ownership during the period, including those advisor fees paid as a result of the 
IPO which have not been included within Share Premium.
Share capital
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium
Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted 
from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
Reverse acquisition reserve
The reverse acquisition reserve was created as a result of the share for share exchange under which Sumo Group plc became the parent 
undertaking prior to the IPO. Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries were consolidated at book value  
in the Group financial statements and the consolidated reserves of the Group were adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium  
and other reserves of the Company as if it had always existed, with the difference presented as the reverse acquisition reserve.
Foreign currency translation reserve
Represents the exchange differences on retranslation of foreign operations.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings includes all current period retained profits.
Direct costs
Included within direct costs are all costs in connection with the development of games, including an allocation of studio management costs.  
Video Games Tax Relief Credits are presented within direct costs as they are directly related to the level of expenditure incurred. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 46
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
Share based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration plans for its employees. None of the Group’s plans are cash-settled.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black Scholes model.
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair value of employees’ services is determined indirectly by reference to the  
fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions 
(for example profitability and sales growth targets and performance conditions).
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. Where vesting 
periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of 
share options expected to vest.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are 
subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any adjustment 
to cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period. The number of vested options ultimately 
exercised by holders does not impact the expense recorded in any period.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are allocated to share capital up to the 
nominal (or par) value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium.
3 Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
Accounting estimates
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
The carrying amount of goodwill is £20,791,000 (2016: £19,225,000) and the carrying amount of other intangible assets is £7,422,000  
(2016: £34,245,000) as at 31 December 2017. The Directors are confident that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets  
is fairly stated, and have carried out an impairment review. The forecast cash generation for each Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) and the  
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’) represent significant assumptions and should the assumptions prove to be incorrect there would  
be a significant risk of a material adjustment within the next financial year . 
The cash flows are based on a three-year forecast with growth between 9.7% and 36.1%. Subsequent years are based on a reduced growth rate  
of 2% into perpetuity. 
The discount rate used was the Group’s pre-tax WACC of 9.75%.
Given the significant headroom in the carrying value of goodwill compared to the calculation of the net present value of the future cash flows, 
and bearing in mind the market value of the Group, the Directors cannot foresee a reasonable downside scenario in which the goodwill would be 
impaired in the foreseeable future and hence detailed sensitivity disclosures have not been presented.
Accounting judgements
Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the preparation of the Group financial statements, the Directors, in applying the accounting policies of the Group, make some judgements and 
estimates that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. The following are the areas requiring the use of judgement and estimates 
that may significantly impact the financial statements.
Goodwill and Intangible assets arising on acquisition
The process of estimating the value of customer contracts and customer relationships on acquisition includes an element of forecasting and 
judgement. The Directors review customer contracts and customer relationships on an annual basis which also involves an element of judgement 
as to the length of the contract and relationship. These judgements concerning the length of customer contracts and relationships will largely be 
resolved during 2018 as the balances naturally unwind through the amortisation charge, given the relatively short length of the customer contracts. 
Details of the period end impairment review of Goodwill have been disclosed in note 13 to the Financial statements.
Revenue recognition on development contracts
The recognition of revenue on development contracts requires judgement and estimates on the overall contract margin and percentage of 
completion of the contract at each period end. These judgements are based on contract value, historical experience and forecasts of future 
outcomes. These include specific judgement in respect of contracts for which variations may be in the process of being negotiated, and so the 
contracts are accounted for on the basis of the best estimate of the revenue expected to be received on the contract, which are all expected to be 
resolved relatively shortly after the financial year end.
Video Games Tax Relief Credits
The process of claiming Video Games Tax Relief Credits requires estimates to be accrued at the period end. Whilst the Company undertakes a 
detailed exercise involving external professional support in calculating the accrual, these claims are subject to review and approval by HMRC prior  
to payment. It is also in the Directors’ judgement that presenting Video Games Tax Relief Credits as a deduction from direct costs best reflects the  
substance and nature of these Credits.

Mistral Entertainment Limited, Sumo Video Games Private Limited, Cirrus Development Limited, Sumo Digital (Genus) Limited, Sumo Digital 
(Atlantis) Limited, Atomhawk Design Limited and Atomhawk Canada Limited. The central activities, comprising services and assets provided to 
Group companies, are considered incidental to the activities of the Group and have therefore not been shown as a separate operating segment but 
have been subsumed within video games development. All assets of the Group reside in the UK, with the exception of non-current assets with a net 
book value of £400,000 (2016: £242,000) which were located in India and Canada.
Major clients
In 2017 there were three major clients that individually accounted for at least 10% of total revenues (2016: four clients). The revenues relating to these 
clients in 2017 were £9.7m, £4.7m and £3.2m (2016: £3.4m, £1.6m, £1.4m, and £1.0m).

12 Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue from the date of the IPO to 31 December 2017. The weighted average number of shares for both the current and preceding 
years has been stated as if the Group reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the comparative period. 
When calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted to assume conversion of 950,000 of potentially 
dilutive shares. These represent share options granted to employees.
The calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is based on the following data:

These financial statements are the first to be prepared since Sumo Group’s IPO in December 2017. They cover the period in which the Group 
transitioned from the previous ownership structure when it was majority owned by funds under the management of Perwyn for more than  
11 months of 2017 to its new status as a listed company 10 days before the financial year end. The intangible assets on the balance sheet arise  
from the acquisition by Perwyn in September 2016, more than 15 months before the December 2017 accounting reference date. These intangible 
assets consisted of customer contracts, customer relationships and goodwill. The intangible assets held in respect of the former two categories 
were being amortised over useful economic lives of five years and ten years respectively, while goodwill was tested annually for impairment.  
The assets arose in respect of contracts and relationships as at September 2016 and do not reflect contracts signed or relationships developed  
since that date. As a public listed company Sumo Group has decided to change the approach to these historical intangible assets by reference to the 
length of each customer contract in place at September 2016 and an assessment of the appropriate time period for the customer relationship from 
that date. The time periods are between four and 37 months for customer contracts and 24 months for customer relationships. This is a change to 
an accounting estimate, not policy, and the effect is to amortise the historical intangible assets arising on the September 2016 change of ownership 
over a shorter period from 1 January 2017. The impact of this change in the useful lives of the assets is to accelerate the amortisation charge in the 
year ended 31 December 2017 by £22,099,000.
The cost of customer relationships was determined as at the date of the respective changes in ownership by reference to expected future contracts. 
The valuations used the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate applied at that time to the future cash flows was 9.75%.
The customer contracts represent contracted revenues. The valuation used the discounted cash flow method, based on estimated profit margins 
considered on a contract by contract basis. The discount rate applied at that time to the future cash flows was 9.75%. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets have been tested for impairment. The method, key assumptions and results of the impairment review are 
detailed below:
Goodwill is attributed to the only CGU within the Group, video games development. Goodwill and other intangible assets have been tested for 
impairment by assessing the value in use of the cash generating unit. The value-in-use calculations were based on projected cash flows in 
perpetuity. Budgeted cash flows for 2017 to 2019 were used. These were based on a three-year forecast with growth rates of 9.7% to 36.1% applied 
for the following years. Subsequent years were based on a reduced rate of growth of 2.0% into perpetuity.
These growth rates are based on past experience and market conditions and discount rates are consistent with external information. The growth 
rates shown are the average applied to the cash flows of the individual cash generating units and do not form a basis for estimating the consolidated 
profits of the Group in the future. 
The discount rate used to test the cash generating units was the Group’s pre-tax WACC of 9.75%. 
On the basis of this review, it has been concluded that there is no need to impair the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
All amortisation charges have been treated as an expense and charged to operating expenses in the income statement.  Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 53

The Performance Share Plan (the ‘LTIP’)
The Group operates a performance share plan for senior executives, further details of which can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
in the Group financial statements.
Under the L TIP, the Group has made awards over 950,000 conditional shares to certain Directors and employees.
The maximum charge in respect of the L TIP’s equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 31 December 2017 is immaterial 
and hence has not been recognised.
Management are in the process of obtaining a full valuation, under IFRS 2, and the impact of current and future awards will be recognised in next 
year’s financial statements.

23 Financial risk management
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash, forward foreign exchange contracts, issued equity investments and various 
items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors 
review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Market risk
Market risk encompasses three types of risk, being currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk. In this instance price risk has been ignored  
as it is not considered a material risk to the business. The Group’s policies for managing interest rate risk are set out in the subsection entitled 
‘interest rate risk’ below.
Currency risk
The Group contracts with certain clients in Euros and US Dollars and manages this foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts 
which match the expected receipt of foreign currency income. As at 31 December 2016 this covers the period up to June 2018.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs by closely managing the cash 
balance and by investing cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group policy throughout the period has been to ensure continuity of funding. Short-term flexibility is achieved by revolving working capital 
facilities. The maturity of borrowings is set out in note 19.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period 
at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are 
essential for an understanding of the timing of cash flows. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017
23 Financial risk management continued
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and loan notes. The Directors’ policy to manage interest 
rate fluctuations is to regularly review the costs of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital, and to maintain an appropriate mix 
between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations
As the debt was settled as part of the IPO proceeds there is minimal interest rate risk, and therefore sensitivity to interest rate disclosures have not 
been made.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The credit risk associated with cash is limited, as the counterparties have high 
credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from the Group’s trade receivables. In order 
to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for clients based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are 
reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The Directors consider that the Group’s trade receivables were impaired for the period ended 31 December 2017 and, accordingly, a provision of 
£19,000 has been created. See note 16 for further information on financial assets that are past due.

Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• To ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
This is achieved through close management of working capital and regular reviews of pricing. Decisions on whether to raise funding using debt or 
equity are made by the Board based on the requirements of the business.
Capital for the reporting period under review is shown as total equity in the table above.

The Company was incorporated on 20 November 2017 as a private company limited by shares in England and Wales, with share capital of £390 
divided into 39,000,000 Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each.
The Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group with Project Republica Topco Limited (‘Topco’) becoming the Company’s direct 
subsidiary on 13 December 2017 by the issue of 3,900 Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each to the existing shareholders of Topco in return for the entire 
issued share capital of Topco. The shares were issued to each of the shareholders in proportion to the relative value of each of their shareholdings  
in Topco. 
On 13 December 2017 the Company capitalised amounts of £1,065,216 standing on the share premium account and utilised the amount for 
distribution amongst the shareholders of the Company in proportion to the number of shares held by them respectively on the basis of 2,731 bonus 
shares for every 1 share held, such that an aggregate of 106,521,617,940 new Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each were issued. Following this issue and 
allotment, all the issued Ordinary Shares of £0.00001 each were then consolidated into 106,554,131 Ordinary Shares of £0.010000609158926 each.
On 13 December 2017, the Company undertook a reduction of share capital in accordance with Section 643 of the Companies Act, in which the 
nominal value of the Ordinary Shares was reduced to £0.01 each, which had the effect of reducing the share premium to £nil, with the balance 
credited to retained earnings.
The insertion of the Company as a new holding company by way of a share-for-share exchange constitutes a Group reorganisation and the 
transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganisation. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 60

24 Share capital continued
Under merger accounting principles, the shares issued in this transaction were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the nominal value 
of the shares issued plus the fair value of any additional consideration, which was recorded as a reverse acquisition reserve in the Group financial 
statements. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are consolidated at book value in the Group financial statements and the consolidated 
reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and reverse acquisition reserve of the Company as if it had 
always existed.
On 21 December 2017 the Company issued 38,445,869 Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each, for consideration of £38,445,869 in an IPO, with the balance 
recorded as share premium. £1,940,000 of the IPO costs have been charged to the share premium account.
A reverse acquisition reserve of £60,623,000 was created during the year as a result of the share for share exchange under which Sumo Group plc 
became the parent undertaking prior to the IPO. Under merger accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries were consolidated 
at book value in the Group financial statements and the consolidated reserves of the Group were adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share 
premium and other reserves of the Company as if it had always existed, with the difference presented as the reverse acquisition reserve.
The foreign currency translation reserve of £27,000 as at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £43,000) comprises foreign currency translation 
differences arising from the translation of financial statements of the Group’s Indian operations into GBP .

The acquisition of Atomhawk was settled in cash amounting to £2,900,000. There is no contingent consideration.
Acquisition related costs amounting to £203,000 are not included as part of consideration transferred and have been recognised as an expense in the 
income statement as part of operating expenses – exceptional.
Following the acquisition a former key shareholder of Atomhawk invested £1,300,000 into the Sumo Group.
Goodwill
Goodwill of £1,566,000 is primarily related to growth, technical knowledge, and market diversification. 
Contribution to the Group results
Atomhawk generated a profit of £331,000 for the six months from acquisition. Revenue for the period was £1,276,000. If Atomhawk had been 
acquired at the beginning of the period then revenue would have increased by £916,000 and profit by £249,000. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 62

28 Prior year adjustment
The Group has adjusted the accounting disclosure of Video Games Tax Relief Credits. This has historically been shown in other operating income and  
is now shown within Direct costs (net) – see note 6.
The reason for the change is that Video Games Tax Relief Credits are closely related to the production of the games and therefore should be reflected  
in the gross margin reported.
The impact this has had on the income statement is to increase gross margin by £1,956,000 in the comparative period. There is no impact  
on the net profit.
The VGTC amounts recoverable which were previously presented within ‘Corporation tax recoverable’ on the balance sheet are now presented as 
‘VGTC recoverable’ within ‘Trade and other receivables’, and the cash flows are now presented as operating cash flows (previously tax cash flows). 
This has had no impact on the net assets of the Group.
29 Post balance sheet events 
On 1 January 2018, the Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sumo Digital Limited took on the Newcastle studio of CCP Games under an asset 
purchase agreement for nominal consideration. All 34 staff working at the studio became employees of the Group and the lease for the property in 
which the studio was located was assigned to Sumo Digital Limited.   Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 63

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
Sumo Group plc (‘the Company’) was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 20 November 2017 as a private company limited  
by shares under the Companies Act 2006 with the name Aghoco 1611 Limited and with the registered number 11071913. The Company was  
re-registered as a public limited company with the name Sumo Group plc on 14 December 2017. The address of its registered office is  
32 Jessops Riverside, Brightside Lane, Sheffield S9 2RX. 
The principal activities of Sumo Group plc and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) are that of video games development. The principal activity  
of the Company is that of a holding company.
The Company’s shares were admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange on 21 December 2017. These Group 
financial statements are the Company’s first subsequent to its admission to AIM and followed a Group reorganisation to facilitate the IPO.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the merger method of accounting principles because the transaction under which  
the Company became the holding company of Project Republica Topco Limited (‘Topco’), the previous parent undertaking of the Sumo Group,  
was a Group reconstruction with no change in the ultimate ownership of the Sumo Group. All the shareholdings in Topco were exchanged via  
a share-for-share transfer on 13 December 2017. The Company did not actively trade at that time.
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (‘FRS 101’), on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable Accounting Standards in the UK. The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently to all the years presented,  
are set out below.
The following exemptions from the requirements in IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with  
FRS 101:
• The following paragraphs of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
 – 10(d) (statement of cash flows);
 – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 – 11 (cash flow statement information); and
 – 134-136 (capital management disclosures)
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;
• IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’;
• IAS 24 (paragraphs 17 and 18a) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (key management compensation); and
• IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ – the requirement to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group.
As the Group financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has taken the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect  
of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of Group settled equity share-based payments; and
• Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
Company profit and loss account
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s loss after 
taxation for the year was £1.85m. There are no material differences between the profit after taxation in the current and prior year and its historical 
cost equivalent. Accordingly, no note of historical cost profits and losses has been presented.
Dividend distribution
The distribution of a dividend to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which 
it is approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost, unless their value has been impaired in which case they are valued at the lower of their 
realisable value or value in use.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable and recognised in the Group financial statements when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the timing differences can be deducted. The recoverability 
of tax losses is assessed by reference to forecasts which have been prepared and approved by the Board. No timing differences are recognised in 
respect of revalued tangible fixed assets or fair value adjustments to acquired tangible fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 69
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC  REPORT
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an  
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.
Share-based payments
In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company operated an equity-settled share-based payment plan. Equity-settled share-based payments  
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments issued to the Company’s employees is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments issued to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised  
as an addition to the cost of investment in subsidiary undertakings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by the use of a Black Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Employer social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of share awards are considered an integral part of the grant itself and  
the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction,  
net of tax, from the proceeds of issue.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Financial assets 
Classification
The Company classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at  
initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise principally through the provision of services 
to clients. They are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and receivables comprise 
mainly cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, including amounts owed by related entities. Trade and other receivables relate 
mainly to the sale of products to trade clients.
Impairment of financial assets 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty  
or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount  
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with  
the impaired receivable. 
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within  
cost of sales and administrative expenses in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross 
carrying value of the asset is written-off against the associated provision. 
Financial liabilities 
The Company initially recognises its financial liabilities at fair value net of transaction costs where applicable and subsequently they are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, amounts owed to Group undertakings, 
other liabilities and accruals and deferred income and are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing 
transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest.
Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.  
Other liabilities include payments in advance from clients and rebates.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The critical accounting estimates set out in the Group accounts also apply to the Company.  Sumo Group plc  Annual Report 2017 70
