I am pleased to be able to report on considerable progress made by your company during the last year. 
Overview 
During 2017, revenue more than doubled. We further extended and developed our UK distribution capability, 
expanded our direct to market sales and successfully established a technology and distribution relationship with 
Apple. Post year end we also completed our largest fundraising to date, which saw us add two major institutional 
investors to the shareholder list.  
We have built on the progress of the previous year with more market awareness, distribution led sales and through 
ensuring Lightwave products and technology continue to develop. In addition, we have developed our direct sales 
capability, supported by a dedicated customer services function. The smart home market is now becoming more 
clearly defined, which is helping Lightwave better communicate its proposition and capability.  
Offering access to the Lightwave platform either directly or through Amazon, Apple and Google as well as the growth 
of voice control, opens up many opportunities for the business. The broad challenge as ever will be to ensure we 
prioritise our strategic goals so that we bridge the gap between short term achievements and the long-term ambition 
to build a scaled business in the smart home sector.  
We are continuing to strengthen our management and technology capability. As well as welcoming new chief 
executive, Andrew Pearson, to the board in March, we have broadened our teams’ skill sets with the addition of new 
staff. This is all directed to putting solid building blocks in place for the much larger business we aim to create. I would 
like to take the opportunity to thank our staff, our suppliers and subcontractors for the effort they have applied during 
the year to achieve a further step change for the business.  
Financials 
Revenue for the 2017 financial year was £3.03 million, more than double last year (2016: £1.44 million). Gross margins 
further improved to 35.5% (2016: 32.5%) benefiting from the growth of direct sales. Administrative expenses were up 
to £2.12 million (2016: £1.49 million) as we spent more on marketing, research and development. Capitalised 
development expenditure was £0.69 million (2016: £0.51 million) in accordance with IAS38, reflecting the 
commitment to the development of our Generation 2 technology and devices. The loss before and after tax was £0.85 
million (2016: £0.84 million).  
Our balance sheet has now been considerably strengthened through our post financial year end fundraising, giving a 
strong and stable foundation upon which to develop our business. The pro-forma group statement of equity after this 
fundraising is as follows:

Outlook 
Completing a two-year long process of technology development which has met the exacting criteria of Apple and 
other major companies has been a major achievement for a small company. We now have the funds in place to further 
strengthen our management capability, marketing and sales as well as continuing to ensure our technology remains 
at the forefront of the smart home revolution. 
We very much look forward to upping the pace of our progress through 2018.

Introduction 
2017 has seen strong progress for Lightwave, with advances in, technology, products, marketing, sales and 
distribution. 
 
Technology and Products   
We design and develop hardware devices and software. Our range of almost 100 smart home devices now includes 
the recently launched Generation 2 which is also a part of the Apple HomeKit offering. Manufacturing is outsourced 
to Asia and mainland Europe. Platform hosting is with cloud based operators. We have continued to grow our 
technology team and intend to bring in more talent as we invest in the further product development necessary to 
scale the Company. 
 
As well as completing the development of the Generation 2 technology, launched just a few weeks ago, we also 
completed significant enhancements to our cloud-based platform. This included integration with Google Assistant 
voice control for the Google Home device. Consumer uptake of our Amazon Alexa integration has continued with over 
8,000 Lightwave customers now using our Amazon Alexa “Skill” for voice control. 
 
We have filed a series of patent applications to provide protection to our technology and plan further filings of new 
developments. 
 
Marketing  
Our marketing uses consumer oriented messages such as “Your Home. Smarter”. We recently launched a new website 
under the brand “Lightwave”. In addition to product description and guides, the website now offers full online 
ordering. We are now using various digital marketing techniques to generate direct sales demand, build market 
awareness and develop the Lightwave brand. This is supported by media relations programmes to secure coverage in 
both specialist and generalist outlets.   
 
Sales and Distribution 
We sell both our Generation 1 and 2 devices primarily through distribution partners. We have recently added Exertis 
as a distributor to enable us to supply Apple, who are retailing our Generation 2 devices both online and in UK and 
UAE stores. We will continue to develop our distribution strategy to ensure we market our devices effectively and 
generate increasing demand.   
 
A growing proportion of our sales are being made directly to consumers. As well as providing another route to market 
this has significant benefit for us to fully understand the customer experience and to be able to directly tap in to their 
feedback.  
 
Principal risks and uncertainties

 2017 Results 
The revenues for the year more than doubled to £3.03 million (2016: £1.44 million) through further stocking by our 
distributors and direct consumer sales. Gross profit also more than doubled to £1.08 million (2016: £0.47 million) in 
line with the increase in revenue. Gross margin rose to 35.5% (2016: 32.5%) with direct consumer sales starting to 
make a material contribution. We recognise the scope to improve margins as we scale operations. Administrative 
expenses increased to £2.12 million (2016: £1.49 million) as the Group invested further in sales, marketing, research 
and development. Capitalised development costs under IAS38 increased to £0.69 million (2016: £0.51 million) driven 
mostly by the investment in our Generation 2 technology. As anticipated, the amortisation of intangible assets 
increased substantially to £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) in line with our policy of amortising as projects reach 
completion. 
 
Research and development tax credits of £0.25 million (2016: £0.21 million) were recognised as other income before 
stated pre and post tax losses of £0.85 million (2016: £0.84 million). As we achieve financial progress through our 
increased revenue and gross profit, we  plan to invest more in technology and marketing for the medium to longer 
term. Our distributor order book, which at 30 November 2017 month end exceeded £700,000 at current exchange 
rates. As the smart home market becomes faster moving, we are seeing shorter lead times for orders and direct 
consumer sales have no order component. 
 
Cash absorbed from operations increased to £0.89 million (2016: £0.63 million) with inventories up in support of our 
direct consumer sales activity. Cash invested, mostly in the development of our technology increased to £0.72 million 
(2016 £0.52 million). Cash balances at 30 September 2017 were £220,000 (2016: £2,000) even as we approached the 
conclusion of the programme to launch Generation 2 into Apple HomeKit. 
 
The year end balance sheet saw shareholders’ equity much improved to £1.22 million (2016: deficit £0.17 million) 
after the December 2016 fundraising of £2.2 million met the cash outflow from operating losses and the continued 
investment in technology. Long and short term loans and borrowings were substantially reduced to £0.59 million 
(2016: £0.99 million). 
 
Key Performance Indicators 
The Group monitors revenue, gross margin, operating cash and also uses the following key indicators to measure the 
performance of the business in terms of progress against key strategic objectives;

Strategy 
We continue to believe there is an opportunity for a UK Company that offers a wide and deep range of integrated 
smart home solutions to achieve significant scale. The competitive environment remains broadly the same as it has 
done for some time, in that gadgets, single device and single market segment solutions prevail, while we offer a 
distinctive, stylish and affordable smart home experience. During 2018 we will focus on the following key steps: 
• Undertaking a rolling launch of a comprehensive range of new Generation 2 devices, from early 2018;
• Enhancing our recently redesigned app to give our customers increasing capabilities for the coordination and
control of their smart home;
• Broadening our cloud platform capabilities with further integration and interoperability features for non-
Lightwave devices and software;
• Continue building our marketing function and increase investment to build our brand, utilising product and
customer focused approaches;
• Expand our direct sales function, introducing a field based home visit sales team;
• Add further distributors that complement and extend our distribution capability;
• Launching an international device range, following an indication from Apple that they are actively considering
offering our Generation 2 sockets and switches to their online and retail customer base in 25 European countries.
Outlook 
2017 has been a pivotal year for the Group. Having launched Generation 2 devices into the market we are now moving 
to pursue our goal of creating a scaled Company able to compete with the major brands in the smart home market.  
In 2018 we will move to strengthen our management team in marketing, sales and technology, enhancing the talented 
group which has achieved considerable progress to date. We recognise the ability to retain and attract suitably 
qualified and experienced staff will be critical to our success and growth. 
Consumer awareness and understanding of the benefits of smart home technology continues to rise, and our market 
opportunity is increasingly large. Our relationship with Apple is a significant asset that supports our growth in the UK 
and which should also allow us to enter international markets efficiently. We look forward to building a great company 
in the rapidly growing smart home market.

The board is responsible for such key matters as the approval and monitoring of strategic business plans, the annual 
resource budget, rolling forecasts, major capital expenditure, treasury policies and overall financial performance. It 
delegates responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the business to the executive directors who are charged with

The remuneration committee, which meets at least twice a year comprises Steve Harris (Chairman), Barry Gamble and 
Mike Lord – the three non-executive directors. 
 
The remuneration committee reviews the executive directors’ remuneration based on best practice and so as to 
attract, motivate and retain key executives. Accordingly, its policy is to design remuneration packages which, through 
an appropriate combination of basic salary, performance related bonuses, share options, pension arrangements and 
benefits, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their individual contributions, whilst linking their potential 
earnings to the performance of the Company as a whole. The committee recognises its overall responsibility to ensure 
that executive compensation is aligned with the interests of shareholders.  
 
The remuneration committee consults with Andrew Pearson, the chief executive officer and as appropriate with Kevin 
Edwards the chief financial officer about its proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive directors. Details 
of Directors’ remuneration and share options are shown on page 11 and 12.

  Audit committee 
The Audit Committee, which meets at least twice a year comprises Barry Gamble (Chairman) and Steve Harris. The 
committee is responsible for ensuring the financial performance, position and prospects of the Group are properly 
monitored and reported on, and for meeting the auditors and reviewing their reports relating to accounts and internal 
controls. 
 
AIM Rule Compliance Report 
LightwaveRF plc is quoted on AIM and, as a result, the Company complies with AIM Rule 31 which requires that the 
Company: 
• Has in place sufficient procedures, resources and controls to enable its compliance with the AIM Rules for 
Companies; 
• Seeks advice from its Nominated Adviser ("Nomad") regarding its compliance with the AIM Rules for Companies 
whenever appropriate and takes that advice into account; 
• Provides its Nomad with any information it reasonably requests in order for the Nomad to carry out its 
responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, including any proposed changes to the Board and 
provision of draft notifications in advance;  
• Ensures that each of the Company's Directors accepts full responsibility, collectively and individually for 
compliance with the AIM Rules for Companies; and 
• Ensures that each Director discloses without delay all information which the Company needs in order to comply 
with AIM Rule 17 (Disclosure of Miscellaneous Information) insofar as that information is known to the Director 
or could with reasonable diligence be ascertained by the Director. 
 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks in the conduct of its normal business operations. Whilst it is not possible 
to either completely record or to quantify every material risk to which the Group might be exposed, those risks that 
the directors believe are most significant to the Group’s business and could have a material impact on future 
performance, causing it to differ materially from expected or historic achieved results, are as follows: 
 
Customer concentration and relationships 
By increasing the number of distributors, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk. The increase in direct consumer 
sales also  reduces  reliance on  distributors. 
 
Technological risk 
The directors recognise that the technology in the Internet of Things field is evolving rapidly which could pose 
competitive and other risks to the Group. The directors continue to evaluate competitors and changes in the 
industry to mitigate this risk where possible. The directors also recognise that the Group faces cyber threat-based 
risks. We actively monitor and assess these risks and undertake a continuous investment programme to seek to 
prevent adverse events and to mitigate any unforeseen events. 
 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
The directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements  
for the year ended 30 September 2017 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________ 
- 16 - 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs 
of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to 
prepare Financial Statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment Market.  
 
In preparing these Financial Statements the Directors are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; 
 
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Opinion 
We have audited the financial statements of LightwaveRF plc (the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the 
“Group”) for the year ended 30 September 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies At 2006. 
 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
• the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, 
and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
Conclusions relating to going concern 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate, or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised 
for issue. 
  
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matters (continued) 
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenues for the year increased significantly compared to the previous year totalling £3.03m for the year ended 30 
September 2017 (2016: £1.44m). We consider the risk of completeness of revenue to be high due to the volume of 
transactions undertaken by the Group and the significant increase in revenues compared to the previous period. 
 
In this area our audit procedures included: 
• We performed cut off procedures by testing items from revenue recognised during the year and subsequent to 
year end to gain assurance over the completeness of revenue recognised in the year. 
• We tested credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess appropriate revenue recognition in the 
period.  
• We looked for and tested journal entries within normal business processes relating to revenue transactions close 
to the year end to ensure they were valid, by agreeing the journals to originating documentation. 
• We performed other substantive, transactional testing and analytical procedures to validate that revenue 
transactions had been appropriately recognised at the right time, in line with the Group’s accounting policy. 
• We ensured that the financial statement disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards. 
 
Carrying value of intangible assets 
The Group’s intangible assets in respect of capitalised development costs and expenditure on platform software 
development represent the most significant asset on its Statement of Financial Position, totalling £1,210,071 as at 30 
September 2017. Management and the Directors are required to ensure that only costs which meet the IFRS criteria 
of an asset and accord with the Group’s accounting policy are capitalised. Given the significance of the assets on the 
Group’s Statement of Financial Position and the significant management judgement involved in the determination of 
the capitalisation of costs and the assessment of the carrying values of the assets there is an increased risk of material 
misstatement. 
 
In this area our audit procedures included: 
• We performed substantive testing on samples of the expenses and labour capitalised in the year in order to assess 
whether the expenses had been appropriately capitalised and the accounting treatment was in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy.  
• We evaluated Management’s and the Directors’ impairment reviews which assessed each sub category of asset 
held by the Group. We critically challenged the considerations made of whether or not there were any indicators 
of impairment identified. 
• We critically reviewed the disclosures included in the financial statements. 
  
Our application of materiality 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
 
We determined the materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be £45,000, calculated with reference 
to a benchmark of turnover, of which it represents 1.5%. This is the threshold above which missing or incorrect 
information in financial statements is considered to have an impact on the decision making of users. 
 
We reported to the Audit Committee all potential adjustments in excess of £1,350 being 3% of the materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
We considered the risk of the financial statements being misstated or not prepared in accordance with the underlying 
legislation or standards. We then directed our work toward areas of the financial statements which we assessed as 
having the highest risk of containing material misstatements.  
 
We tested and examined information using both analytical procedures and tests of detail, to the extent necessary to 
provide us with a reasonable basis to draw conclusions. These procedures gave us the evidence that we need for our 
opinion on the Group’s financial statements as a whole and, in particular, helped mitigate the risks of material 
misstatement mentioned above. 
 
We also documented and reviewed the Group’s systems, primarily to confirm that they form an adequate basis for 
the preparation of the financial statements, but also to identify the controls operated to ensure the completeness and 
accuracy of the data. 
 
Other information 
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. 
 
We have nothing to report in this regard. 
 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the strategic Report and the directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic Report and the directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained 
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ 
Report. 
 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities Statement set out on page 16, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

for the year ended 30 September 2017 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________

1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
a) STATUTORY INFORMATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
 
LightwaveRF plc (the “Company”) was incorporated on 5 September 2008 and is domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom and quoted on AIM.  Its registered office is Innovation Campus Birmingham, Faraday Wharf, Holt 
Street, Birmingham B7 4BB and its registered number is 06690180. 
 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017 consolidate the individual financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
 
The Group’s principal activity is the design and development of devices and software to remotely control commercial 
and domestic lighting, heating, power and security. 
 
 
b) ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
i) Basis of preparation of the financial statements 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  
 
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). The Financial Statements have also 
been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing Financial 
Statements in accordance with IFRS. 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. 
 
ii) Basis of consolidation 
Where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The company controls an investee if 
all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the 
investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed 
whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.  
 
De-facto control exists in situations where the company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee without holding the majority of the voting rights. In determining whether de-facto control exists the company 
considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: 
• The size of the company’s voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting 
rights; 
• Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties; 
• Other contractual arrangements; and 
• Historic patterns in voting attendance. 
 
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group") as if they 
formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated 
in full.

b) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
ii)  Basis of consolidation (continued) 
 
The Financial Statements have been prepared using the reverse accounting provisions that were incorporated in 
International Financial Reporting Standard 3 (as issued in 2004). 
 
Reverse acquisition accounting was determined to be required in accounting for the business combination of the 
Company and LightwaveRF Technology Limited because following the business combination; the Parent Company is 
effectively controlled by the Board and the former shareholders of LightwaveRF Technology Limited. In effect, the 
transaction is accounted for as though LightwaveRF Technology Limited was the acquiring Company rather than the 
acquired and LightwaveRF Plc has been treated as a subsidiary. The reverse acquisition reserve consists of amounts 
arising from the adjustment made to the equity instruments of the legal acquiree in reverse acquisition accounting. 
 
iii) Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sales of goods in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities excluding VAT and other sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts.  
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership to the buyer and it is probable that the Group will receive previously agreed payment. These criteria are 
considered to be met when the goods are delivered to the buyer. 
 
iv) Impairment 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Assets that 
have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose 
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
generating units. Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment 
at each reporting date. 
 
v) Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is provided for at 33% 
per annum straight line on all items of property, plant and equipment so as to write off their carrying values over their 
useful economic lives.  
 
Any gain or loss arising from disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the fair value 
of the sales proceeds and the amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

vi) Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for 
which the asset was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets held to maturity. 
 
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: 
 
Trade and other receivables 
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but 
also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. 
 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the 
present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which 
are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within 
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade 
receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value is written off against the associated provision. 
 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
consolidated statement of financial position.  
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise current and deposit account bank balances which are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value with deposit maturity of three months 
or less from inception. 
 
vii) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are 
assigned using the first in, first out cost formula. Costs principally comprise of materials and bringing them to their 
present location. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

1.   GENERAL INFORMATION (continued) 
b) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
viii) Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories, depending on the purpose for which the 
liability was acquired. 
 
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: 
 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly 
attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment 
is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position. Interest 
expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest 
or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding. 
 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
ix) Taxation 
The tax credit/expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable, research and development tax credits and 
deferred tax. 
 
Current tax 
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in different accounting periods and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date. 
 
Research and development  
Research and development tax credits are recognised on qualifying expenditure that meets the criteria set out by 
HMRC guidance in period in which the associated expenditure is incurred. R&D tax credits have been surrendered 
against tax losses brought forward and therefore treated as grant income and disclosed as other income in the Income 
Statement.  
 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial 
Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.   LightwaveRF plc

1. GENERAL INFORMATION (continued) 
b) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
ix)  Taxation (continued) 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary 
differences associated with such investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be 
sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each financial position date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the statement of financial position date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects 
the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover 
or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
 
x) Share capital 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, or contractually receivable, net of 
direct costs of issue.  
 
xi) Share based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each 
statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining 
vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where 
the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.  LightwaveRF plc

xii) Convertible debt 
The proceeds received on issue of the Group and Company’s convertible debt are allocated into their liability and 
equity components. The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a 
market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an option to convert. 
Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until 
extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond. Where the conversion component does not confer a fixed amount 
of shares for a fixed amount of cash this component is reflected as part of the financial liability. 
 
xiii) Extinguishing financial liabilities with shares 
When shares are issued to extinguish all or part of a financial liability, they are recognised initially at their fair value at 
the date of issue. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and fair value of 
the shares is recognised as a gain or loss in profit or loss within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
xiv) Foreign currency 
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the trading Company’s functional currency 
(Pounds Sterling) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each statement 
reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
reporting date. 
 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are 
recognised in profit or loss. 
 
xv) Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
 
xvi) Intangible assets 
Development expenditure on internally developed products and the platform software development is capitalised if 
it can be demonstrated that: 
 
• it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold; 
• adequate resources are available to complete the development; 
• there is an intention to complete and sell the product; 
• the Group is able to sell the product; 
• sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and 
• expenditure on the project can be measured reliably. 
 
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit. Capitalised platform 
software development costs are amortised on completion of specific projects. The amortisation expense is included 
within the administrative expenses line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The amortisation 
period will be monitored and re-assessed as the platform and products evolve although it is anticipated to be a period 
of three years on a straight line basis.

xvi)  Intangible assets (continued) 
 
Development expenditure that does not satisfy the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal 
projects are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
 
 
c) ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates 
and judgements that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the Financial Statements are discussed 
below: 
 
• The fair value of share based payments has been estimated using the binomial method and a reserve created in 
the accounts; 
 
• Research and development expenditure and the costs of building the platform have been allocated to individual 
projects and products in accordance with the requirements of IAS38. Intangible assets are amortised from the 
date of launch to market or in the case of the platform, when it is brought into use, over the period the group 
expects to benefit, currently anticipated to be a period of 3 years. The value of intangible assets has been reviewed 
for impairment and no provision is required; 
 
• Research and development tax credits are calculated using HMRC guidance regarding cash recoverable for 
research and development expenditure surrendered; 
 
• Intercompany loans have been reviewed for impairment using future estimated cash flows. The directors have 
concluded that no impairment is required;  
 
• Warranty provisions have been estimated based on product returned from customers.  This was estimated as 
zero at the 2017 and 2016 year ends and accordingly no warranty provisions have been made; and 
 
• Stock provision is based on slow moving stock items.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION (continued) 
 
New Standards 
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published which are mandatory, but 
are not effective for the year ended 30 September 2017. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these 
revised standards and interpretations will have a significant impact on the figures included in the financial statements 
in the period of initial application other than the following: 
  
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
  
The standard makes substantial changes to the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. There will only 
be three categories of financial assets whereby financial assets are recognised at either fair value through profit and 
loss, fair value through other comprehensive income or measured at amortised cost. On adoption of the standard, the 
Group will have to re-determine the classification of its financial assets based on the business model for each category 
of financial asset. This is not considered likely to give rise to any significant adjustments other than reclassifications.  
  
Most financial liabilities will continue to be carried at amortised cost, however, some financial liabilities will be 
required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers 
The standard has been developed to provide a comprehensive set of principles in presenting the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. The standard is based 
around the following steps in recognising revenue: 
1. Identify the contract with the customer; 
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
3. Determine the transaction price; 
4. Allocate the transaction price; and 
5. Recognise revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. 
  
On application of the standard the disclosures are likely to increase. The standard includes principles on disclosing the 
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, by providing 
qualitative and quantitative information. The Directors do not anticipate the changes to have a material impact on the 
reported results. 
  
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It was endorsed by the EU in September 
2016. 
 
IFRS 16 – Leases 
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, (and can be applied before that date if the 
Company also applies IFRS 15 revenue from Contracts with Customers). IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases 
as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee. Instead all leases are treated in a similar way to finance leases 
applying IAS 17. Leases are ‘capitalised’ by recognising the present value of the lease payments and showing them 
either as lease assets (right-of-use assets) or together with property, plant and equipment. If lease payments are made 
over time, a company also recognises a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments. 
IFRS 16 replaces the typical straight-line operating lease expense for those leases applying IAS 17 with a depreciation 
charge for lease assets (included within operating costs) and an interest expense on lease liabilities (included within 
finance costs). The Directors do not anticipate the changes to have a material impact on the reported results.

The Group has not amortised the development costs as the projects being capitalised have not been completed by 
the end of the financial year. The directors have undertaken an impairment review to confirm that the intangible 
assets are supported. The review has concluded that the value of the intangible assets and the tangible fixed assets in 
Note 12 are supported by the discounted future cash flows forecast by the Group. 
 
The Group categorises software development, such as firmware, server software and user apps, as a Platform asset 
essential to support the operation of the full range of hardware devices.

17.  SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (continued) 
 
The binomial option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the share options at the grant date. The 
assumptions used to determining the fair value of share options at the grant dates were as follows: 
 
The volatility assumption is based on a statistical analysis using the standard deviation of daily share prices over the 
three years to 30 September 2017, however this has been capped at 60%. 
 
The average expected term to exercise used in the models is based on management’s best estimate for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience. The risk free 
rate has been determined from market yields for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average 
expected term to exercise for each relevant grant. 
 
The amount recognised as a charge in respect of share-based payments was £18,918 (2016: £28,817).

(b) Risks
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow, 
interest rate risk and capital risk. The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions. 
i) Currency risk
The Group is subject to foreign exchange risk in respect of some of its normal trading activities. 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases from overseas suppliers. The Group receives/incurs 
revenues/costs in both British Pounds and US Dollars. The Group does not use currency derivatives to hedge future 
transactions or cash flows. Currency risk is managed by the chief financial officer by using currency received by 
customers to settle supplier debts where possible.  
The sensitivity on foreign exchange risk covers monetary financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in a 
foreign currency, i.e. in a currency other than the currency in which they are measured. The following tables indicate 
the approximate effect on the loss after tax and the effect on other components of equity in response to reasonably 
possible changes in an exchange rate at the financial position date to which the Group has significant exposure. This 
is the exposure relating to the two US dollar based loans.

ii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy to assess the 
credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. 
The Group monitor its credit risk by monitoring the creditworthiness of existing customers and through a monthly 
review of the trade receivables’ ageing analysis. 
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and 
financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum “AA” rating are accepted.  LightwaveRF plc

iii) Liquidity risk
The Directors regularly review both short and medium term cash flow projections in order to manage the Group’s 
cash flow. 
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they 
become due. The principal liabilities of the Group and Company arise in respect of administrative expenditure, trade, 
and other payables. Trade and payables are all payable within three months. 
The loans and borrowings repayments are factored into the group’s cash flows to ensure the group can meet these 
obligations as they fall due. The Board receives and reviews cash flow projections and information on cash balances 
on a regular basis. 
iv) Cash flow interest rate risk and interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from certain long-term borrowings. Long-term borrowings are all 
held on a fixed rate of interest. The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a monthly basis. 
v) Capital risk
The Group considers its capital to be ordinary share capital, unissued ordinary share capital, share premium, reverse 
acquisition reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders. The Directors regularly 
review both short and medium term forecasts to achieve this. 
21. RESERVES
The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity: 
Reserve Description and purpose 
Share capital Amount subscribed for share capital at nominal value. 
Share premium Amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value. 
Reverse acquisition reserve Amount reflecting the reverse acquisition of subsidiary 
undertakings. 
Share based payment reserve Amounts reflecting the cost reserved for share options issued. 
Profit and loss reserve Cumulative gains and losses through the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, other than amounts transferred directly 
from other reserves where required or permitted.  LightwaveRF plc
