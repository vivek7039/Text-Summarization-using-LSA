Non-GAAP measures
The Board believes that whilst statutory reporting measures provide a useful indication of the ﬁnancial 
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading 
transactions. These measures are deﬁned as follows:
(a)
Underlying proﬁt is calculated as proﬁt excluding proﬁt (or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, acquisition related
amortisation and external transaction costs.
(b)
Underlying earnings per share is calculated as proﬁt on ordinary activities after taxation, before proﬁt (or loss) 
on sale of ﬁxed assets, acquisition related amortisation, external transaction costs and exceptional taxation 
items (all net of tax), divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue in the period.
(c)
Cash generated from operations excludes external transaction costs.
The Group’s underlying measures of proﬁtability exclude proﬁt (or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, external transaction
costs, amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation. These items have
been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of proﬁtability as these underlying measures are those used 
in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods.
In 2017, following the commencement of amortisation of acquired intangible trade names and other crematoria 
related acquired intangibles, acquisition related amortisation of £1.8 million (2016: £nil) has also been excluded in
determining underlying proﬁtability measures. Acquisition related amortisation is deﬁned as being the amortisation
arising in respect of trade names, use of third party brand names and other crematoria related acquired intangibles.

04  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Overview 
2017 was another successful year. Our client service results
demonstrated that we continued to deliver for our clients
at one of the most diﬃcult times in their lives and we met
ﬁnancial expectations.
However, our ﬁnancial success was achieved against 
the backdrop of a rapidly changing and increasingly
competitive market and accelerating erosion of our market
share. It is clear that the pace of change and the ﬁerceness
of competition, particularly for our funeral business, will
continue to increase. For this reason, the Board took
decisive action in January 2018 to change our pricing
strategy and market positioning in order to protect market
share and recalibrate the Group for future growth.
This new pricing strategy is to protect market share by
oﬀering a range of new price points and services to our
clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of service. 
We have therefore signiﬁcantly reduced the price of some
funerals and frozen the price of others as part of this
evolving pricing strategy. As we have also stated clearly this
action will have a substantial impact on proﬁts in 2018 and
the new relationship between volumes and margins will
take time to become clear.
The combination of new price points and industry-leading
service levels means that we can now position ourselves 
as the best value service provider in the market. Delivering
excellent client service remains a key strategic priority. 
Our strong investment over the years means that we are
well positioned to provide the best quality service at each
price point and market segment we choose to compete in.
At the same time, the Group has embarked on a rigorous
review to ensure that our funeral operations are organised
to run more eﬃciently and eﬀectively in the light of this
change of pricing strategy and market positioning.
In meeting the challenges ahead, we will continue to build
on the strong strategic initiatives we developed in 2017, 
in particular, our digital marketing and brand strategies.
There are signiﬁcant opportunities to lead the industry 
in digital marketing and to leverage the Group’s scale 
to develop national recognition online to complement 
our existing physical national network. Dignity will also
continue to lead calls for greater regulation of the funeral
sector while continuing to set the standard for what
constitutes best practice in the industry.
Dividends
The Board is proposing to maintain the ﬁnal dividend at
15.74 pence per Ordinary Share bringing the total dividend
for the year to 24.38 pence, an increase of three per cent
on the previous year. If shareholders approve this payment
at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 7 June 2018, then
it will be paid on 29 June 2018 to members on the register
at close of business on 18 May 2018. 
Board change
In March 2017, Mary McNamara was appointed to the
Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and has
been Chair of the Remuneration Committee since the
beginning of 2018. In June 2017 we announced that our
It is clear that the pace of change and the
ﬁerceness of competition, particularly for our
funeral business, will continue to increase. 
For this reason, the Board took decisive action
in January 2018 to change our pricing strategy
and market positioning in order to protect
market share and recalibrate the Group for
future growth.

long-serving Operations Director, Andrew Davies would
retire in April 2018. He stepped down from the Board in
January 2018. His successor was appointed from within 
the Company and will not be a Main Board appointment.
On behalf of our shareholders and my Board colleagues 
I want to thank Andrew for his magniﬁcent service to the
Group and wish him a long and happy retirement.  
Alan McWalter retired in January 2018 having completed
nine years as an independent Non-Executive Director. 
In order to maintain a balanced Board he will not be
replaced as Andrew Davies’ replacement will not be a 
Main Board Director. Alan has provided wise counsel to the
Board during his time as a director. Whilst Alan is stepping
down as a director, given the challenges facing our funeral
business and his industry knowledge, I am delighted that
he has agreed to remain as a consultant to the Board until
the end of July 2018. 
Directors’ remuneration
The Group’s 2017 ﬁnancial performance was suﬃciently
strong to justify an award to Executive Directors of 95 per
cent of the maximum amount possible of their annual
bonus opportunity. However, in light of the signiﬁcant
reduction in ﬁnancial expectations for 2018 following the
trading update in January 2018, the current Executive
Directors have decided to voluntarily waive their
entitlement in full.
In addition, no Board member will receive an increase in
basic salary or fees in 2018.
Our people and culture
We are truly a people business because we help people 
at an extremely diﬃcult time in their lives. Meeting their
needs means that our employees must be caring,
thoughtful and truly engaged with those they serve.  
I want to thank all Dignity staﬀ for the continued care and
commitment they show their clients, demonstrating what 
I like to think of as ‘The Dignity Way’. This describes a
special culture and way of working that means delivering
the highest standards of service and going the extra mile.
Thank you once again for making this company what it is
and for your continued support in meeting the challenges
that the Group faces. 
Outlook for 2018 and beyond
The business model for the Group’s funeral business is
changing as the Board focuses on protecting market share
by introducing new service oﬀerings and price points. 
As indicated in January, the Board believes that whilst the
combination of action being taken will lead to substantially
lower proﬁts in 2018, it should create a new platform to
allow many years of further stable growth.
The Oﬃce for National Statistics anticipates approximately
580,000 deaths in 2018, a small decrease of 10,000 on the
actual deaths in 2017. However, the number of deaths in
the ﬁrst two months of 2018 are approximately seven per
cent higher than the prior year.
Committed to the highest standards 
of governance
Good governance is the basis on which we as a business
can build an environment of trust, transparency and
accountability. It also diﬀerentiates us from many
competitors in what is still, regrettably, an unregulated
industry. As such it provides assurance and conﬁdence
to our clients and fosters long-term investment,
ﬁnancial stability and business integrity. As a Board 
we are therefore committed to maintaining our high
standards of corporate governance and ensuring there
is a high level of cultural integrity embedded within the
way we operate.
Board priorities
The Board provides strategic leadership to the Group
within a framework of robust corporate governance and
internal control, setting values and standards that are
embedded throughout the business to deliver long-term
sustainable growth for the beneﬁt of our shareholders
and other stakeholders.
Compliance
Our governance framework, which is shaped by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act
2006 and secondary legislation and Financial Conduct
Authority rules and guidance, sets out standards of 
good practice in relation to Board leadership and
eﬀectiveness, remuneration, accountability and 
relations with shareholders.

06  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Overview
2017 was a successful year with good performances 
from our crematoria and pre-need businesses. However,
while our funeral business continued to set the standard 
at the premium end of the market, having commented 
on an acceleration in market share decline in our 2016
Annual Report, market share continued to decline at an
accelerated rate in 2017 reﬂecting further increases in
competition. As a consequence, the Board has taken
decisive action to change the Group’s pricing strategy 
and market positioning in our funeral business.
Underlying operating proﬁt increased three per cent to
£104.6 million (2016: £101.7 million), with each operating
division trading in line with the Board’s expectations.
Alongside this, we continued to invest to support the
existing network, acquire well reputed businesses and
develop new crematoria.
Change of pricing strategy and market positioning
As the Chairman has set out in his statement, the Board
took decisive action in January 2018 to protect market
share in our funeral business and reposition the Group 
for future growth.
In addition to the pricing changes already implemented, 
we will test a range of new price points and services to 
our clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of service.
Delivering excellent client service remains a key strategic
priority and means that we can oﬀer the best quality
service at each price point and market segment in which
we choose to operate. We are now positioning ourselves 
as the best value service provider in the market, leveraging
the strong investment in the funeral business that we have
made over the years. In addition to these changes, we have
also embarked on a rigorous review to ensure that our
funeral operations are organised to run more eﬃciently
and eﬀectively.
Having delivered the market’s ﬁnancial expectations for
2017 our results for 2018 are less certain as we gauge client
response to various pricing scenarios while maintaining our
high levels of professional service and care. This has meant
rebasing expectations for 2018. The key challenge for 2018
is to ﬁnd the optimum relationship between price, service
and demand for our funeral business going forward.
The changing market
Over the last 18 months we have consistently drawn
attention to the increasingly competitive environment in
which we operate. The internet is beginning to change the
nature of competition as the funeral industry enters the
digital age. Clients are increasingly price-conscious and in
an over-supplied industry, are shopping around more. 
This continues to have an increasing impact on the Group’s
market share, with a signiﬁcant reduction in the average
number of funerals per location noted since 2015. The
average reduction in the number of funerals per location
per one thousand deaths between 2004 and 2014 was 
3.6 per cent. This accelerated to 6.8 per cent per year
between 2015 and 2017. We have assumed that this will
continue into 2018, and the revised pricing strategy and
promotional activity is aimed at reducing the rate of 
decline as the year progresses. 
We are evolving our funeral business to be
able to oﬀer a range of new price points and
services to our clients while preserving our
unrivalled levels of service. Delivering excellent
client service remains a key strategic priority
and means that we can oﬀer the best quality
service at each price point and market
segment we choose.

New pricing strategy
This increasingly competitive market was the background
against which the decision to change our pricing strategy
and market positioning was made in early 2018. In 2017,
approximately 60 per cent of our funerals were traditional
full-service funerals, seven per cent were simple funerals
and approximately 27 per cent had been pre-arranged.
The remainder of the Group’s volumes were contract and
other low value funerals. Reﬂecting the trend towards
lower cost funerals we immediately reduced the price of
the Group’s simple funeral by an average of approximately
25 per cent and froze the price of our traditional funerals 
in the majority of our locations.  
As a result of reducing the simple funeral price and 
other initiatives to be progressively tested during the year,
it is likely that this changing mix of funeral services will
continue. The Group currently anticipates that as a result 
of changes to its pricing strategy, simple funerals may
represent approximately 20 per cent of all funerals
performed in 2018. However, this is clearly an estimate 
and the precise mix will emerge during the year. 
It should also be noted that ours is an evolving pricing
strategy and other price and service level options are being
actively considered as we review client response. We have
also extended the services available from our online
business, Simplicity Cremations. In all cases, we aim to
provide the best quality and value in each segment. The
high quality of our oﬀering, more competitively priced, is
how we will diﬀerentiate ourselves, locally and nationally.
Delivering these changes eﬀectively will require tools 
and training for our staﬀ and this work is in progress. 
In order to promote the new prices and the business 
more generally, the Group expects to spend an additional
£2 million in 2018 and in subsequent years compared to
2017 on digital and other promotional activities, building 
on the work started in 2017 . This additional cost is expected
to reoccur and is likely to increase in future years.
Opportunities
In a fragmented and increasingly online marketplace we
have a signiﬁcant opportunity to leverage our existing
physical national funeral and crematorium networks and
create a powerful national digital presence in both our
traditional premium service market and other emerging
market segments. The ﬁrst example of this was Simplicity
Cremations, launched in November 2016 and currently
averaging a run rate of 1,000 direct cremations per year. 
We also continue to view selective acquisitions of 
well-established funeral businesses as an appropriate 
use of capital despite the changing market. We will also
continue to develop our network of crematoria.
Investment and development momentum
Our future development builds on strong, Group-wide
fundamentals, reﬂected in our track record of good
operating performance, continued excellent client service
results and the further acquisition of established funeral
businesses. A core strength of the management team is 
its ability to spot quality acquisitions and integrate them
eﬀectively within the business. During the year the Group
has acquired 24 funeral locations and one crematorium for
an aggregate investment of £28.3 million and has opened
14 satellite locations. 
Leadership and standards
We have continued to call for regulation in the industry,
commissioning and launching a ground-breaking report
into the pre-paid market. We have further industry-leading
initiatives in the pipeline.
We believe the funeral industry will beneﬁt signiﬁcantly
from proper regulation to ensure that clients are not 
misled into accepting below-par service and standards. 
We pride ourselves in providing industry-leading standards.
It is a thread which has run through our business from 
the beginning and we are determined to maintain this
focus while augmenting our products and improving 
our channels to market. Reaching our desired goals,
operational and ﬁnancial, will require our staying focused
on excellent service and we are committed to ensuring 
that this is the case.
Alongside this, it is increasingly important to us that all
stakeholders, including policymakers and those outside 
the industry, understand what we stand for and why 
our goal of achieving a properly regulated industry is
important. We welcome fair scrutiny of the industry 
and our business.
Delivering excellent client service in an
evolving digital age and increasingly
competitive funeral sector
We have long been known for our high quality of service
and every year we have reported on exceptionally high
levels of client satisfaction. We are determined this will
not change. This total commitment to quality of service
and client satisfaction will now be applied to a wider
range of products and price points. Our aim is to be
recognised as the company that provides the best value
funeral service, regardless of how simple or traditional.  
Adjusting pricing is relatively straightforward, but the
greater challenge is building the infrastructure and
developing the staﬀ necessary to provide excellent
service. We believe this is where the years of investment
in our facilities and staﬀ training will pay dividends, for 
us as a company, but also for our clients. It means we 
can oﬀer them unrivalled service at each product and
service level they choose and at a price that is
competitive. This is the repositioned Dignity.

Market overview
The UK funeral market is getting more complex. 
The internet is beginning to play an increasing role and
consumer behaviour is beginning to change. After years 
of declining deaths and a signiﬁcant rise in the number 
of funeral directors, although deaths are now projected to
increase in the coming years, there are around 30 per cent
fewer deaths per funeral director in the UK compared to 
25 years ago. Clients are becoming more price-sensitive 
and are shopping around more.
The Group monitors and responds to the environment it
operates in, seeking to understand the implications for the
short, medium and long-term. Outlined below are some
basic facts about the marketplace as it currently stands.
Further on I describe in more detail the key drivers in the
marketplace and what we are doing to address these
challenges.
Scale and structure of the market 
The funeral director market remains very fragmented, with
approximately two thirds of funeral directors being small
owner managed businesses. There are approximately 290
crematoria in the UK, with circa 66 per cent owned by local
authorities. It is estimated that three quarters of all funerals
result in a cremation with the remainder being burials.
In 2017, the initial publication of recorded total estimated
deaths in Britain for 52 weeks was 590,000, the same
number as the 53 weeks in 2016. Some of the Group’s 
key performance indicators rely on the total number of
estimated deaths for each period and this information is
obtained from the Oﬃce for National Statistics (‘ONS’).
Although annual deaths have declined signiﬁcantly since
the early 1990s from 640,000 to a low of 539,000 in 2011,
the last ﬁve years have seen deaths above that level. The
ONS expects long-term increases in the number of deaths,
reaching approximately 700,000 per year by 2040. Deaths
have been elevated in the last few years. Whether this
marks the start of this longer-term trend or a temporary
anomaly is too early to conclude. 
  Dignity’s funeral market share
  11.5% (2016:11.8%)
  Funeral services:
Dignity has approximately 11.5 per cent of the funeral
market. This gives the Group suﬃcient size to operate 
its locations eﬃciently in a way that shares expensive
resources, such as mortuaries and specialist vehicles,
whilst providing very high levels of service to each family 
it looks after.
  This size still gives the Group good scope to acquire
owner managed businesses in areas where it is not 
well represented.
  Number of active pre-arranged funeral plans
  450,000 (2016:404,000)
  Pre-arranged funeral plans:
Dignity’s national network of funeral locations and strong
relationships with many different aﬃnity partners has
allowed it to sell signiﬁcant volumes of pre-arranged
funerals that should represent incremental activity for 
the funeral division in the future.
  Dignity’s crematoria market share
  10.7% (2016:10.1%)
  Crematoria:
With 45 crematoria, Dignity is the largest single 
operator in Britain. The cremations performed represent
approximately 10.7 per cent of deaths in Britain. There 
is still signiﬁcant scope to expand through acquisition 
or new builds where possible.

Price and affordability
The increased media and political interest in
the rising cost of funerals in the last few years
has aﬀected the marketplace. Consequently,
price and aﬀordability are rightly becoming
increasingly important factors for a growing
number of clients. Combined with the
internet which allows them to shop around,
prices are coming under growing pressure.
Clients want a funeral company that can
provide a range of pricing options while
guaranteeing a high quality and value-for-
money service.
Increasing competition
Whilst our single biggest source of business
remains previous experience and word 
of mouth, the chart below demonstrates 
the ongoing decline of this traditional source 
of business in the face of competition from 
an increasing trend towards pre-arranged
funerals and other competitors. 
Connecting digitally
According to ONS’ recent analysis, 90 per cent
of households have access to the internet, 
78 per cent of consumers have accessed it 
‘on the go’ via a device and 75 per cent of
those aged 55 to 64 now buy online. Given
this, it is not surprising that there is now
signiﬁcant use of the internet to ﬁll the
knowledge gap around funerals. Data from
Google indicates over 5.2 million searches 
in 2017 compared to 4.6 million in 2016 for
funeral related advice and information. The
most popular searches were for advice when
someone dies and what is involved with
arranging a funeral with searches for local
funeral directors also very high. Signiﬁcantly,
the providers of this advice online are more
frequently consumer websites, media sites
and comparison websites rather than funeral
directors. Consumers also now expect to 
be able to check or compare funeral prices
online. We also believe more people are
shopping around, talking to more than
one funeral director before making the
arrangements. 
Changing client demands
It is clear that direct cremations represent 
a small, but increasing proportion of all
funerals. Sun Life’s 2017 Cost of Dying report
also describes how, within their surveyed
population, nine per cent (compared to seven
per cent the year before) of funerals last 
year were eco, environmental or woodland
funerals. They also report 31 per cent of
funerals being described by funeral directors
as a “celebration of life funeral”, and note a
signiﬁcant increase in these types of service
on the previous year. They should be
interpreted as a direction of travel for
consumer behaviour rather than precise
metrics about the entire market.

Setting the standards for a modern funeral 
business through the quality of our services 
and competitive pricing.
10  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
The brand
With a growing emphasis on price there
is a risk that the industry becomes
commoditised, with consumers initially
choosing on price and assuming that all
funeral providers are the same. In such
a market an ability to leverage a strong
brand becomes crucial.  
In addition, our marketplace is
fragmented and increasingly online.
This provides a challenge, but also a
signiﬁcant opportunity to leverage 
our scale and create a powerful brand.
In the pre-digital world, the strength 
of our local trusted businesses, trading
on reputation and high-quality service
gave us a pre-eminent position. In the
digital age there is a compelling
requirement, and opportunity, to
leverage and build a national brand 
and add that to the mix, supporting 
and enhancing our strong local market
positions. The ﬁrst step has been to
create a new brand style and to begin
to develop brand awareness online.
This work is a strategic priority for 
the Group.
New products and service levels
The brand will be supported by a
growing suite of products, product
reﬁnements and price points. We 
are working on and trialling new
propositions for cremations and 
simple funerals, as well as developing
our pre-need packages. We are also
reviewing the advantages of launching
into other segments under diﬀerent
sub-brands, including a mid-market
oﬀering. We have already launched our
aﬀordable cremation service, Simplicity,
and subsequently oﬀered three new
packages and prices. 
Strengthening the competitiveness
of our funeral locations
The combination of a strong national
brand and a range of product and price
oﬀerings to clients will strengthen the
competitiveness of our branches.
However, more can and will be done at
a local level as part of a rigorous review
to ensure our operations are organised
to run more eﬃciently and eﬀectively.
Simplicity Cremations
Simplicity oﬀers low cost direct
cremations without any initial funeral
service that are both respectful and
digniﬁed. They are an aﬀordable
alternative to a full funeral or for those
wishing to have a simple cremation.
We have recently added a pre-need
option and will also be providing the
option in future to attend one of our 
45 crematoria for a committal service.

Good progress
We want to ensure that when individuals
are searching online for a funeral
director, we are well presented and are
at the top of the list. We have made
good progress so far on this front. 
We have set up websites for over 
800 of our funeral directors and
started to strengthen the online
presence and authority of our main
site. As at January 2018, it had the
highest domain authority on websites
of any provider. 
The Group has also launched a new
service for clients that makes it easier
for them to notify family members
through email, social media and the
internet of funeral arrangements. This
service also allows families to order
ﬂowers and make donations online.
We are piloting a number of other
client-supporting initiatives and
services. If successful this will be
followed by national roll outs. We are
also planning the second phase of
developments for our funeral director
websites and are developing industry-
leading content to support all funeral-
related guidance topics. 
In truth, the industry has been one 
of the last to embrace the digital and
online revolution. There is much
catching up to do but also major
opportunities for those leading players
who get it right. We are absolutely
determined to succeed and are making
the investment in terms of technology
and people to ensure that we do. In
today’s digitally enabled and data rich
world it is essential that we equip our
people with the latest technology and
tools to support their activities and the
services we provide to our clients.
Funeral notices online
The Group has launched a new online
funeral notices service that makes it
easier for clients to notify family
members of funeral arrangements
through social media and the internet.
The service also allows families to
arrange ﬂowers and make donations.

The internet is changing the
nature of competition as 
the funeral industry enters 
the digital age. The Group 
is well placed to respond and
lead as it is the only operator
with a national network of
funeral locations and
crematoria.
Engaging with clients online
Our ongoing digital investment is
aimed at making our products and
services more immediate, intuitive
and relevant, supporting and
assisting our clients at a diﬃcult time.
Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Chief Executive’s review continued
12  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
While increasing competition often
leads to higher standards, in an
unregulated industry this is far less
certain and the funeral industry is a
case in point. In addition, in the case 
of a service industry, the quality of
service being provided is not known 
in advance. Consequently, the
importance of reputation and, just 
as crucially, the need for regulation 
is paramount. 
We regret very much that the provision
of funeral services is not regulated and
have continued to lead calls for this 
to change. Dignity would welcome
regulation of the funeral industry which
set out minimum standards for core
activities such as the care of the
deceased, minimum standards of
facilities and also operating procedures
in crematoria. 
We therefore continue to support
legislative changes by the Scottish
Government enacted in 2016. This
provides it with the powers to regulate
the funeral industry. Dignity welcomes
this progress and anticipates making
further contributions to the discussion
on the service standards required
within the regulations.
Dignity also welcomed changes to 
the Funeral Planning Authority (‘FPA’),
which acts as a self-regulatory body 
for the sale of pre-arranged funeral
plans. The changes removed provider
representation from the Board of the
FPA and made them independent of
those selling plans. Registration with
the FPA and compliance with its
requirements will help to provide
further comfort to clients as to the
quality of the plan they are buying.  
For our part, in 2017 we commissioned
and published research into the pre-
paid funeral market, asking whether
this market was working well for
consumers. We are continuing to
engage with HM Treasury and the 
FCA on the topic of regulation. 
With regard to crematoria, these are
subject to environmental regulations 
in accordance with “The Secretary of
States Guidance Notes for Crematoria-
PG5/2(12)”, with emission levels being
monitored by Environmental Health
Oﬃcers in England and Wales and
Scottish Environment Protection
Agency in Scotland. The abatement of
mercury emissions has improved the
environmental position with Dignity
abating more than the current
legislative requirements.
Leading the call
for regulation
and higher
standards.
The pre-paid funeral market
Working with a respected and
independent partner, Fairer Finance,
we commissioned a well-received
report which asked whether this
market was working well for
consumers.  
Ground-breaking research 
into cremations
We wish to provide our clients with
the best possible service, one which
fully meets or exceeds their needs.
To do this we need to properly
understand them and this requires
research. At present we are
exploring issues around cremations
through two research projects. 
The ﬁrst is a study on the impact of
direct cremation funerals on grief,
working with bereavement specialists
and leading academics from home
and abroad. The aim is to produce
guidance for consumers and the
industry on the decisions to be 
made at the point of determining a
cremation, and their potential impact. 
The second project looks at what
consumers most value from a
cremation service. With this insight
we will be able to ensure that our
cremation services are giving clients
what they really want and value, as
well as providing useful insights for
the industry as a whole.  
Thought leadership from Dignity
External recognition
In 2017, Dignity Funeral Plans became
the ﬁrst ever organisation in the UK 
to be accredited the BSI Kitemark for
customer service. BSI produce technical
standards for various services and
across many industries and their
Kitemark is a widely recognised
symbol of quality and trust globally.
Defaqto 5 Star Rating

Defaqto has introduced a new ﬁve
star rating for pre-paid funeral plans
following research and analysis by

Diamond Funeral Plan was one of
only ﬁve out of 97 funeral plans from
26 providers in 2017 to receive the
prestigious Defaqto 5 Star Rating.

Chief Executive’s review – Outlook Q&A
   What has happened in your
market to trigger this change 
of strategy?
As we mentioned at our Q3 trading
update at the end of 2017, we continue
to see signiﬁcant competition across
the business. A fragmented market is
becoming more complicated. The
internet is belatedly bringing change 
to the funeral market, and consumer
behaviour is beginning to change.
Although deaths are now projected to
increase, we estimate that there are
around 30 per cent fewer deaths per
funeral director in the UK compared 
to 25 years ago. Clients are becoming
more price-sensitive and are shopping
around more. 
Due to these factors, the Group has
experienced a decline in its market
share. We have seen a rise in volume
erosion. The average reduction in the
number of funerals per location per
one thousand deaths between 2004
and 2014 was 3.6 per cent. This
accelerated to 6.8 per cent per year
between 2015 and 2017. The Board
has been considering alternative
pricing and strategic initiatives over 
the last 18 months and believed that
the time was right to reposition the
business and its pricing to protect
market share.
   What are the Group’s immediate
strategic priorities?
It is very clear. We as a management
team and Board have to deliver the
new strategy. This means promoting
our new oﬀerings and positioning to
the marketplace and providing an
unrivalled and competitively priced
service, to the marketplace. It means
considering new price points and
service oﬀerings as part of our evolving
pricing and product strategy. It means
rigorously reviewing our operations 
to ensure that they are more eﬃcient
and eﬀective. It also means we have 
to carefully monitor and review the
progress we are making through this
year. Our goal is to protect market
share and reposition the Group for
future growth, recognising that our
actions will have a substantial impact
on proﬁts in 2018 and that the new
relationship between volumes and
margins will take time to become clear.
   What opportunities do you see
for the Group in the changing
market environment?
We have the scale and strength to
leverage our brand. We have the
resources to ensure that we are 
the leading provider in the digital 
and online space. We have the
management team and Board that can
and is responding rapidly to changing
client demands in terms of product
and pricing. We have the vision for
what a modern funeral service
provider should be in the light of the
changes outlined above. We have 
the ambition to get ahead of the
competitive curve and continue to
provide sustainable growth and a
healthy future for all our stakeholders.
  Going forward, what are the
Group’s strongest assets?
There are a number. We have the
required expertise and experience 
to understand the marketplace and
respond to changing client needs. We
run high quality operations and believe
we set the highest standards within 
the industry. We have the ﬁnancial
strength and quality of management 
to deliver on our strategic priorities.
Most of all, we have the commitment
of our people on the ground, who
regularly go the extra mile for clients
and are expert and compassionate in
dealing with people at an extremely
diﬃcult time in their lives.
   How conﬁdent are you about 
the future of the Group in the
medium-term?
We saw that the funeral market was
changing and have now taken steps 
to respond to the challenges. We will
be performing further tests on pricing
and services oﬀered and these will
evolve as we analyse the results.
Alongside this, we are taking a detailed
look at our operational model.

address the challenges we faced.
We have taken that action and our
focus this year is on delivering our

to seek the regulated market that

New strategic objectives and 
a changing business model.
14  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
At the beginning of 2018 in light of continued and
increasing competition and market share erosion in 
our funeral business, the Board took decisive action 
and announced a change in strategy.
New strategic objectives
Protect market share and reposition the 
Group for growth.
In the short-term, our key strategic objective and priority 
is to protect market share and reposition the Group 
for growth. 
How:
• By oﬀering a wide choice of new price points and services
to our clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of
service.  
• By continuing to prioritise excellent client service
regardless of market segment which we believe will lead
to organic growth.
• At the same time we have embarked on a rigorous review
to ensure that our funeral operations are organised to run
more eﬃciently and eﬀectively in the light of this change
of strategy and positioning.
Establish new market positioning.  
We establish ourselves as the best value service provider 
in the market.
How:
• By combining our unrivalled service levels based on
historic, long-term investment, with a new, competitively
priced range of service and product options for clients.
Digital
Through our comprehensive digital strategy be the leading
online presence in the funeral sector.
Brand
Build our brand to stand out in an increasingly
commoditised and competitive market.
Re-base the business model and market expectations.
In 2018 ﬁnd the optimum relationship between price,
service and demand for our funeral business going forward.
How:
• By using 2018 to gauge the market response to various
pricing scenarios while maintaining our high levels of
professional service and care.
Our overall strategic approach
Our new strategic objectives and the means of delivering
them are based on the following four key elements:
           Continue to build on the strong fundamentals 
of the business and use these as a platform 
for change.
These strengths, which derive from our well established
and highly regarded local businesses, our proven ability 
to deliver exceptional service and strong corporate
governance allows us to remain robust and ﬂexible in 
the face of change.  
           Continue to be distinctive in the 
marketplace.
Deﬁne clear market positions and build on our positive
reputation, and business, by delivering a high-quality and
value for money service.
           Continue to make eﬃcient use of our balance
sheet to enhance shareholder returns.
Continue our successful strategy of acquiring and
integrating businesses.
           Continue to be a good corporate citizen.
Corporate responsibility is integral to our business as it
supports the delivery of our strategy and aligns with 
our values.
Our previous strategic objectives and our Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs)
For 2017 and previous years our strategic objectives 
were as follows:
       Continue to prioritise excellent client service which we 
       believe will lead to organic growth.
       Control our costs without compromising the quality 
of our service.
       Expand our funeral and crematoria portfolios.
       Gain new clients through the sale of pre-arranged 
funeral plans. 
       Increase our returns through eﬃcient capital management.
These ﬁve objectives are repeated here because they guided 
the Group in 2017 and underpin and relate directly to the long-
standing KPIs which appear in this Report and Accounts. They
form a crucial means of measuring performance. In the light 
of the change in pricing strategy announced in early 2018 it is
expected that the Group’s KPIs, as they relate to a newly stated 
set of strategic objectives, will be reviewed during the course of
this year to ensure they remain appropriate.

How we measure
performance
• We monitor our performance
by measuring and tracking KPIs
that we believe are important
to our longer-term success.
• Each KPI reﬂects a quantiﬁable
measure of different aspects 
of the Group’s strategy. They
act as headlines for the Board,
allowing them to use more
detailed management
information to consider the
Group’s strategy and ﬁnancial
performance in greater depth
where appropriate.
• Our KPIs and goals are set 
to measure our progress in
improving our ﬁnancial
performance and in
embedding sustainable 
long-term growth.
These KPIs are linked to our
2017 set of strategic objectives
Continue to prioritise excellent
client service which we believe
will lead to organic growth.
Control our costs without
compromising the quality 
of our service.
Expand our funeral and
crematoria portfolios.

Our objective is to lead the funeral sector in professional standards
and service. Our priorities and our success are determined by our
impact on our clients.
Client satisfaction in our funeral services
Objective
Ensuring the highest levels of client service is one of our key strategic
objectives and is fundamental to our continued success.
Deﬁnition
We closely monitor the results of our client surveys which are
conducted by our Funeral services division. In the last five years, we
have received approximately 160,000 responses. This is our measure
of how these services meet or exceed client expectations.
Maintaining client satisfaction
Our consistently high satisfaction scores reflect the strength of our
relationships with our clients and the stability and quality of our core
business. We listen to our clients and also use our survey responses
to focus on areas in which we can improve and add value. 
Our ongoing commitment to high levels of client satisfaction
continues to generate high levels of referrals as demonstrated in

Funeral services relate to
the provision of funerals 
and ancillary items, such 
as memorials and ﬂoral
tributes.
Performance
As at 29 December 2017, the Group
operated a network of 826 (2016: 792)
funeral locations throughout the United
Kingdom, generally trading under local
established names. 
During the period, the Group conducted
68,800 funerals compared to 70,700 
in 2016.
Approximately one per cent of all
funerals were conducted in Northern
Ireland. Excluding Northern Ireland,
these funerals represent approximately
11.5 per cent (2016: 11.8 per cent) of
total estimated deaths in Britain. Whilst
funerals divided by estimated deaths is a
reasonable measure of our market share,
the Group does not have a complete
national presence and consequently, this
calculation can only ever be an estimate.
Underlying operating proﬁt was £79.5
million (2016: £79.0 million), broadly ﬂat
on the previous year.
This ﬁnancial performance reﬂects the
lower number of funerals performed,
offset by some increases in average
income and acquisition activity. As
described in the trading announcement
in January 2018, market share was lower
than expected. The average reduction in
the number of funerals per location per
one thousand deaths between 2004 and
2014 was 3.6 per cent. This accelerated
to 6.8 per cent per year between 2015
and 2017 . 
Progress and Developments
Investment in the core portfolio
Signiﬁcant cash resources continue 
to be used to maintain the Group’s
locations and ﬂeet. In 2017 , £12.7 million
was invested in maintenance capital
expenditure.
Funeral location portfolio
The Group acquired 24 funeral locations
for a total investment of £26.3 million.
These acquisitions performed in line 
with expectations. £1.1 million was also
invested in our satellite location
programme, with 14 opening in the
period. Four locations were closed,
principally where it was considered
commercially appropriate not to 
renew leases.
Outlook 
The business model for the funeral
business is changing as the Board
focuses on protecting market share 
by introducing new service offerings 
and price points. The new relationship
between volumes and prices will take
longer to become clear and we expect 
to provide further updates on these
estimates when we release our ﬁrst
quarter trading update in May 2018. 
A further update will be provided in
August with the Group’s interim results,
which is also expected to provide an
update on the Group’s operating model.
The Group anticipates continuing to
acquire well-established funeral
businesses. The opening of further
satellite locations will be dependent 
on the Group’s assessment of the likely
impact of the changes to funeral pricing
and products.

Our funeral directors are there to
help our clients every step of the
way during their time of need. We
provide a caring and expert service,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Highest standards of care
We continually invest in our staff,
premises and vehicles to ensure
clients and their loved ones
receive the highest standards of
care in both client-facing areas
and behind the scenes. Many of
our funeral directors have a proud
heritage, serving their local
communities for generations.
National Association of 
Funeral Directors
All of our funeral directors are
accredited by the National
Association of Funeral Directors,
giving families conﬁdence and
comfort at the most diﬃcult of
times. We strive to set the highest
possible standards for funeral
services and it is this level of
compassion and attention to
detail that sets us apart.

Professional
Our clients rely on us to

always live up to the trust
they place in us.
Compassion
Every detail is of the utmost
importance and nothing is too
much trouble. Being there for
our clients in every way that
we can.
Respect
Being trusted with something
as important as a person’s 
ﬁnal wishes is an honour and 
a privilege that we never 
take lightly. 
Knowledge
Our heritage and expertise
combine to give us a unique
vantage point. We are
continually improving so 
we can make a diﬃcult time 
a little easier.

Crematoria services relate 
to cremation services and
the sale of memorials and
burial plots at the Group’s
crematoria and cemeteries.
Performance
The Group remains the largest single
operator of crematoria in Britain,
operating 45 (2016: 44) crematoria as 
at 29 December 2017. The Group
performed 63,400 cremations (2016:
59,500) in the period, representing 
10.7 per cent (2016: 10.1 per cent) 
of total estimated deaths in Britain.
Underlying operating proﬁt was £40.0
million (2016: £37.6 million), an increase
of 6.3 per cent.
This operating performance is driven 
by increasing average revenues per
cremation, which has been assisted 
by the increase in the number of
cremations performed in the year.
Recently acquired crematoria have also
assisted operating proﬁt growth. 
Sales of memorials and other items have
been stable, equating to approximately
£270 per cremation compared to £273 
in the previous period. More recently
acquired locations have a lower average
memorial sale than our more
established locations.
Progress and Developments
The Group has also invested £4.6 million
maintaining its locations in the period. 
The Group has three new crematoria
under construction, with one due to
open in 2018 and the other two in 
2019. The total capital commitment 
for these locations is expected to be
approximately £13 million to £14 million.
Each of the locations with planning
permission will take ﬁve to seven years
to reach maturity, performing 800 to
1,000 cremations per year. £3.5 million
of capital expenditure has been incurred
in the year on these projects.
The Group’s remaining two planning
applications have not been successful.
The Group is planning on appealing one
of these applications. 
Outlook
We remain conﬁdent about the future 
of our crematoria business. We aim to
build on the success of our affordable
Simplicity cremation service and will
consider further innovations over 
the year.
Crematoria Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 23
Leveraging scale and expertise
Our scale and experience sets us
apart and we continue to build 
on and reinforce the competitive
strengths in our business by
developing, managing and 
acquiring crematoria.
We also seek to add value and
differentiate through strong
partnerships with local authorities
and through the construction of
new build crematoria which
represent an opportunity to develop
and invest in new facilities in areas
that will beneﬁt the local community.
Trent Valley Crematorium 
This new build project (pictured
below) will provide a state of the 
art, single Chapel facility with
carefully landscaped gardens 
that complement the existing
countryside including an avenue of
new trees, a memorial park, a wild
ﬂower meadow and include the
planting of other native trees,
shrubs and existing hedgerows.
The building itself will be light and
welcoming with a large covered
waiting area to the main entrance.
The latest cremator technology will
be installed incorporating mercury
abatement systems that comply
with the environmental legislation.
The focus for the new crematorium
will very much be on superior client
service and visitor experience and is
scheduled to open in 2018.
45 Crematoria
The Group remains the largest
single operator of crematoria in
Britain, operating 45 crematoria.

Pre-arranged funeral 
plans represent the sale 
of funerals to customers
wishing to make their 
own funeral arrangements
in advance.
Performance
The Group continues to have a strong
market presence in pre-arranged funeral
plans. These plans represent potential
future incremental business for the
funeral division, as the Group expects to
perform the majority of these funerals.
Underlying operating performance in 
the period has been solid, with operating
proﬁt of £8.0 million (2016: £8.5 million).
The year on year reduction in proﬁtability
reﬂects the incremental costs incurred on
the Group’s digital and other promotional
activities. 
In overall terms, approximately 69,000
(2016: 49,000) new plan sales were made
and the number of active pre-arranged
funeral plans increased to 450,000 (2016:
404,000) as at 29 December 2017. 
Of these amounts, 35,000 (2016: 20,000)
of the sales represent plans linked to life
assurance plans with third parties rather
than trust based plan sales and 102,000
(2016: 68,000) active insurance plans are 
in place at 29 December 2017. Not all of
these insurance backed plans include 
an obligation to provide a guaranteed
funeral and we anticipate the cancellation
experience to be signiﬁcantly higher than
is witnessed on trust based sales.
Whilst the contribution to this year’s
operating proﬁt from the marketing
activity is reported at the time of sale, it is
important to recognise that the sales
made represent signiﬁcant potential
future revenues for the funeral division.
These amounts will be recognised as and
when the funerals are performed. As with
all the Group’s divisions, pre-arranged
funeral plan proﬁts broadly reﬂect the

Progress and Developments
The increase in the number of active plans
follows plans sold in the year. The market
has been particularly competitive, with 
the internet and ‘cold calling’ featuring
extensively in activity by competitors.
Dignity has remained focused on selling
high quality business, with low cancellation
rates, selling in ways that support the
strong reputation of the Group.
The Group has continued to work hard 
at developing its portfolio of aﬃnity
partners and has formed a number 
of new partnerships in the period with
organisations in the retail and ﬁnancial
services arena with further trials 
expected in 2018.
The ﬁnancial position of the independent
trusts holding members’ monies is crucial,
given the Group ultimately guarantees 
the promises made to members. At the
end of 2017, the Trusts held approximately
£940 million of assets in respect of
306,000 trust based funeral plans. 
Average assets per plan are greater than
the amount currently received for
performing a funeral. 
The latest actuarial valuations of the 
pre-arranged funeral plan trusts (at 29
September 2017) showed them to have a
surplus of £27.3 million, based on prudent
assumptions. If the discount rate used had
equalled the long-term investment target
of the trust funds of inﬂation plus two per
cent, then the trusts would have reported
aggregate surpluses of approximately
£160 million.
Crucially, each plan sold creates additional
headroom, since the funds paid in are
more at the point of sale than those
received by the Group if the member 
died immediately. 
The Trusts’ investment strategies are
expected to enhance investment returns
in the longer-term but will, however,
potentially result in greater volatility year
on year in the reported value of the 
Trusts’ assets. The current allocation 
that is subject to annual review by the
independent Trustees with support 
from their investment advisers, is
summarised below.

Outlook
Pre-arranged funerals represent a stable
source of incremental funerals for the
Group, providing certainty of cash ﬂows 
as existing plans mature. 
The Group intends to continue to sell as
many plans as is commercially possible
and economically sensible and anticipates
a signiﬁcant proportion to continue to be
insurance plans rather than being trust
based sales.

Central overheads
Overview
Central overheads relate to central
services that are not speciﬁcally attributed
to a particular operating division. These
include the provision of IT, ﬁnance,
personnel and Directors’ emoluments.  
In addition and consistent with previous
periods, the Group records the costs of
incentive bonus arrangements, such as
Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIPs’) and
annual performance bonuses, which are
provided to over 100 managers working
across the business centrally.
Developments 
Costs in the period were £22.9 million
(2016: £23.4 million), a reduction of 
2.1 per cent. 
Investment in central overheads continues
in order to respond to the activities of the
Group. Incentive costs, including LTIP costs
and cash bonuses, have reduced from
£8.3 million to £5.2 million. This reﬂects
current expectations of such costs given
the January trading update. Excluding
these bonus costs, central overheads
represent 5.4 per cent (2016: 4.8 per cent)
of revenues.
Maintenance capital expenditure of 
£2.9 million has been incurred on central
projects predominantly relating to IT that
will help the business as a whole operate
more eﬃciently. This includes £1.2 million
incurred to complete the update of the
Group’s accounting software described
last year and the implementation of 
a new HR system.
Outlook
The Group will continue to respond to 
the needs of the business, providing
additional central resource where
necessary to help growth or manage
compliance with appropriate laws 
and regulations.

The Board has proposed a dividend of 15.74 pence per
Ordinary Share as a ﬁnal distribution of proﬁts relating to 2017
to be paid on 29 June 2018, subject to shareholder approval.
Change in accounting estimates – Amortisation 
of intangibles
During the period, the Group reconsidered the indeﬁnite life
assumed for its trade names. Given the increasingly price
competitive market and its impact on the business, the Group
has concluded that an indeﬁnite life is no longer appropriate.
The estimate was updated in 2017 to a useful life of 35 years,
applicable from 1 October 2017.
Exceptional items and underlying reporting measures
The Group’s underlying measures of proﬁtability exclude proﬁt
(or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, external transaction costs,
amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional
items in respect of taxation. These items have been adjusted
for in determining underlying measures of proﬁtability as these
underlying measures are those used in the day to day
management of the business and allow for greater
comparability across periods. 
In 2017, following the commencement of amortisation of
acquired intangible trade names and other crematoria related
acquired intangibles, acquisition related amortisation of 
£1.8 million (2016: £nil) has also been excluded in determining
underlying proﬁtability measures. Acquisition related
amortisation is deﬁned as being the amortisation arising in
respect of trade names, use of third party brand names and
other crematoria related acquired intangible.  
Our challenge as a Board is to protect market
share and reposition the Group for growth. 
An important part of that equation is ensuring
that our operations are running more
eﬃciently and eﬀectively. To that end we have
implemented a rigorous review of our funeral
operations to ensure that they are able to fully
deliver our new strategic objectives.

Earnings per share
The Group’s statutory proﬁt after tax was £57.8 million (2016:
£57.2 million). Basic earnings per share were 115.8 pence per
share (2016: 115.3 pence per share). The Group’s measures 
of underlying performance exclude the effect (after tax) of the
proﬁt (or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, amortisation of acquisition
related intangibles, external transaction costs and exceptional
items in respect of taxation. Consequently, underlying proﬁt
after tax was £64.0 million (2016: £59.4 million), giving
underlying earnings per share of 128.3 pence per share 
(2016: 119.8 pence per share), an increase of 7 per cent.
The growth rate for underlying EPS exceeded the growth in
underlying operating proﬁt, reﬂecting the leveraging effect of
the Group’s capital structure and reduced tax charge.
External transaction costs
External transaction costs reﬂects amounts paid to external
parties for legal, tax and other advice in respect of the 
Group’s acquisitions.
In 2017, external transaction costs also include £2.1 million 
in respect of external advisers’ fees for a signiﬁcant potential
acquisition and £1.2 million for other development
opportunities that were aborted.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets was £27.0 million (2016: £22.8 million).

(a) 
Maintenance capital expenditure includes vehicle replacement programme,
improvements to locations and purchases of other tangible and intangible assets.
The Group will continue to invest in the maintenance of its
existing portfolio of vehicles and funeral and crematoria
locations. This is expected to result in similar capital
expenditure to 2017. 
Cash ﬂow and cash balances
Cash generated from operations was £115.4 million (2016:
£121.1 million) stated before external transaction costs of £2.9
million (2016: £3.9 million). The reduction year on year despite
an increase in operating proﬁt reﬂects timing differences of
working capital items year on year. The longer-term expectation
of proﬁts converting eﬃciently to cash is unchanged.

h h h Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 29
As a result of the strong year, the Group was able to fund 
all of its corporate activity from its cash reserves, spending
£28.3 million (net of cash acquired and excluding external
transaction costs) on the acquisition of 24 funeral locations and
one crematorium and balancing payments in respect of prior
year acquisitions. Cash balances at the end of the period were 
£49.3 million (2016: £67.1 million). In its planning, the Group
sets aside approximately £23.0 million for future corporation
tax and dividend payments expected to be spent in 2018.
Further details and analysis of the Group’s cash balances are
included in note 15 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Pensions
The balance sheet shows a deﬁcit of £24.0 million before
deferred tax (2016: deﬁcit of £25.9 million). The Group
concluded a consultation with employees in February 2017.
Following this consultation, the Group decided to close its
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme to any further accrual.
Affected employees will instead be able to contribute between
four and 10 per cent of salary into a deﬁned contribution
scheme, which will be matched by the Group.
The Group is currently in discussion with the Trustees of 
the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme with a view to
agreeing the April 2017 triennial valuation and consequential
schedule of contributions required to address the deﬁcit. 
This will be ﬁnalised by the statutory deadline of 5 July 2018
and the Group will report on the agreed position as part of 
its interim results.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate on underlying proﬁts in the
period was 17.7 per cent (2016: 21.0 per cent) excluding 
the exceptional rate change in the prior period.
The current period effective tax rate is lower due to prior 
year taxation items of £2.0 million which are not expected 
to recur.
In 2018, the Group expects its effective tax rate to be
approximately one per cent above the headline rate of
corporation tax. This translates to an effective rate of 
20.0 per cent.
The Group’s net cash tax payments were £11.9 million 
(2016: £10.6 million) in the period.
Capital structure and ﬁnancing
Secured Notes
The Group’s principal source of long-term debt ﬁnancing is the
Secured A Notes and the Secured B Notes. They are rated A and
BBB respectively by Fitch and Standard & Poor’s.
The principal is repaid completely over the life of the Secured
Notes and is therefore scheduled to be repaid by 2049. The
interest rate is ﬁxed for the life of the Secured Notes and
interest is calculated on the principal.
The key terms of the Secured Notes are summarised in the
table below:
                                                                                                 Secured A Notes                   Secured B Notes 
Total new issuance at par                            £238.9 million              £356.4 million
Legal maturity                                       31 December 2034    31 December 2049
Coupon                                                                       3.5456%                        4.6956%
Rating by Fitch and Standard & Poor’s                             A                                BBB
The Secured Notes have an annual debt service obligation
(principal and interest) of circa £33.2 million.
Given the duration of the Secured Notes, this structure is
capable of being used to periodically issue further Secured
Notes when deemed appropriate and subject to market
conditions. Given the trading update in January 2018, the Group
does not have any plans for such an issue in the immediate
future and does not need to take any remedial action in respect
of the Secured Notes in issue.
Financial Covenant
The Group’s primary ﬁnancial covenant under the Secured
Notes requires EBITDA to total debt service to be above 
1.5 times. The ratio at 29 December 2017 was 3.24 times 
(2016: 3.37 times).  
Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Rating Agency updates
Following the trading update in January 2018, both rating
agencies issued public aﬃrmations of the ratings applicable 
to the Secured Notes. However, in the case of Fitch, they
revised their outlook to negative from stable and S&P placed
the Group’s Class B Notes on credit watch negative. This has 
no impact on the ﬁnancial covenant or any other obligation 
of the Secured Notes from a Group perspective.
Revolving Credit Facility
As described in the Group’s 2017 interim results, the Group’s
£15.8 million Crematoria Acquisition Facility and undrawn
Funeral Acquisition Facility were replaced with a £50 million
Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’), provided by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, which is secured against certain trade and assets held
by legal entities outside of the Group’s securitisation structure.
The facility is available until July 2021, with the option to renew,
subject to the bank’s consent at the time, by a further year. 
The margin on the facility ranges from 150 to 225 basis points
depending on the resulting gross leverage.
This provides the Group ongoing ﬂexibility in a cost effective
manner, as if undrawn, the facility represents an annual cost 
of approximately £0.3 million. Given the Group’s healthy cash
balances, the RCF is undrawn at the time of the release of this
announcement and as at the year end. 
Net debt
The Group’s net debt is analysed as:
                                                                                                                               29 Dec             30 Dec

The Group’s gross debt outstanding was £565.7 million 
(2016: £590.4 million). Net debt was £516.9 million (2016:
£523.7 million). 
The market value of the Secured Notes at the balance sheet
date was £686.5 million (2016: £678.0 million).
Whilst the Group has no plans to do so, should it wish to repay
all amounts due under the Secured Notes, the cost to do so at
the year end would have been approximately £764 million.
Net ﬁnance costs
The Group’s underlying ﬁnance costs substantially consist of
the interest on the Secured Notes and ancillary instruments.
The net ﬁnance cost in the period relating to these instruments
was £25.1 million (2016: £25.4 million). 
Finance costs of £0.4 million (2016: £0.6 million) were incurred
in respect of the Crematoria Acquisition Facility.
Other ongoing ﬁnance costs incurred in the period 
amounted to £1.4 million (2016: £0.9 million), including the
unwinding of discounts on the Group’s provisions and 
other ﬁnancial liabilities.
Interest receivable on bank deposits was £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.4 million).

Financial review – Outlook Q&A
2018 will be a challenging year 
for the Group but I am conﬁdent
we have the ﬁnancial and
management strength to meet
these challenges head on.
Steve Whittern
Finance Director
   How long do you think it 
will take to see the reaction 
in volume terms to the 
new pricing?
We anticipate it will be towards the 
end of 2018 before we start to see 
a realistic picture.
   Will dividends be 
protected?
The dividend cover should still be
comfortable at the reduced level 
of earnings.
   How long will there be a price
freeze for?
We anticipate that this will be for 2018,
but will keep this under review.
   What implications does this 
new pricing model have on 
your cost base?
It is premature at this stage to say.  
The new price points will depress
margins but until we understand our
ability to improve our volumes and
have thoroughly reviewed how we
operate we cannot take a ﬁrm view.
   What scope is there for cost
savings and driving eﬃciencies
through the business?
There will be opportunities for
eﬃciencies which we expect to be 
able to quantify going into 2019. 
   How much more investment is
required in order to improve
Dignity’s online position?
In order to promote the new prices 
and the business generally, we expect
to spend an additional £2 million in
2018 in digital and other promotional
activities. This additional cost will
reoccur in future years and may
increase in future years.
   Over what timescale will 
you judge whether this new
strategy has been successful?
We should have reasonable evidence
of the funeral market’s reaction
towards the end of 2018.

Risk management is embedded throughout the business with 
all employees aware of the role they play.
Risk appetite
Risk appetite is the level of risk the Group is willing to take to
achieve its strategic objectives and is set by the Board. The
Board looks at the Group’s appetite to risk across a number 
of areas including market, ﬁnancing, operations, strategy and
execution, developments, cybersecurity and technology 
and brand.
The Group’s risk appetite is set in the context of our focus on
one sector – funeral services. As experts in this sector we are
able to mitigate the risk involved in growing the business by
acquisition, development and our active asset management
strategy. This focus on our core strengths is balanced by 
a more cautious approach to risk in other areas.
Whilst the Group’s structured approach to risk management
continues, given the changes in the market and the fact that 
we will be testing a number of pricing and services initiatives
during the year, the risk appetite of the Group has increased.
Our approach to risk management
The Group has a well established governance structure with
internal control and risk management systems. The risk
management process:
• Provides a framework to identify, assess and manage risks, 
both positive and negative, to the Group’s overall strategy and
the contribution of its individual operations.
• Allows the Board to fulfil its governance responsibilities by
making a balanced and understandable assessment of the
operation of the risk management process and inputs.
Responsibilities and actions
The Board
The Board is responsible for monitoring the Group’s risk and 
their mitigants.
Risk process
Every six months the Audit Committee formally considers the 
risk register and approves it for adoption by the Board.
Risk assessment
Executive Directors and senior management are responsible 
for identifying and assessing business risks.
Identify
Risks are identified through discussion with senior management
and incorporated in the risk register as appropriate.
Assess
The potential impact and likelihood of occurrence of each 
risk is considered.
Mitigating activities
Mitigants are identified against each risk where possible.
Review and internal audit
The link between each risk and the Group’s policies and
procedures is identified. Where relevant, appropriate work is
performed by the Group’s internal audit function to assist in
ensuring the related procedures and policies are appropriately
understood and operated where they serve to mitigate risks.

Risk status summary and new risks
The ongoing review of the Group’s principal risks focuses on how
these risks may evolve. Since the publication of last year’s Annual
Report, we consider the following key principal risks to have an
increased risk exposure.
Increasing and emerging risk trends
The focus of both the government and the media on the cost 
of funerals has increased which may aﬀect the ability to increase
average revenues per funeral or cremation. In addition, there
appears to be increased competition in both the funeral and 
pre-arranged funeral plan markets.  
Consumers are becoming more price conscious and prepared 
to shop around. This is driven to a considerable extent by the
internet which is changing the way that they seek information
and make decisions on funeral-related matters. The impact of
the Group’s digital and online presence on its risks therefore
needs to be considered. 
As a result of the changes in the competitive landscape, the
Group has recognised that its exposure to a number of its
principal risks has increased.
Cyber risk
The increasing prevalence of cyber attack across the world,
means that along with all large corporates, our business systems
are under increasing level of attack. Over the last few years we
have invested signiﬁcantly in this area both in upgrading all
aspects of our systems and our internal resources and also using
external consultants to perform regular external and internal
penetration tests and using the results to drive a continuous
improvement programme. 
Regulation
The increased focus on the whole sector may increase the
likelihood of regulation of funerals in the UK as a whole and not
just in Scotland. In addition, this could lead to regulation of the
funeral plan sector with the Funeral Planning Authorities being
re-constituted to be more of a regulatory body. Whilst the Group
believes that this would be beneﬁcial, there still remains a risk
that regulation could be imposed that may result in a signiﬁcant
cost burden to the Group.
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Outlined here are the principal risks facing the Group. 
In assessing which risks should be classiﬁed as principal, 
we assess the probability of the risk materialising and the
ﬁnancial or strategic impact of the risk.
Operational risk management
• Price competition
• Signiﬁcant reduction in the death rate
• Nationwide adverse publicity
• Ability to increase average revenues per funeral 
or cremation
• Signiﬁcant reduction in market share

• Regulation of pre-arranged funeral plans
• Regulation of the funeral industry
• Changes in the funding of the pre-arranged funeral

The principal risks we have identiﬁed
We maintain a detailed register of principal risks and
uncertainties covering strategic, operational, ﬁnancial and
compliance risks. We rate them according to likelihood 
of occurrence and their potential impact.
In the tables on pages 34 to 36 we provide a summary 
of each risk, a description of the potential impact and 
a summary of mitigating actions.

Mitigating activities
The proﬁle of deaths has historically 
followed a similar proﬁle to that predicted 
by the ONS, giving the Group the ability to 
plan its business accordingly. The risk is
mitigated by the geographical spread of
locations, the ability to control costs and 
the ability to acquire funerals.  
This risk is addressed by ensuring appropriate
policies and procedures are in place, which are
designed to ensure excellent client service and
careful selection of reputable partners.
The Group believes that its focus on excellent
client service helps to mitigate this risk.
However, the Group took decisive action to
reduce its funeral pricing in January 2018, 
which will be supported by an improved 
online presence.
The Group believes that this risk is mitigated 
for funeral operations by reputation and
recommendation being a key driver to the
choice of funeral director being used. In
addition the Group’s actions in January 2018 
on pricing and promotion seek to protect the
Group’s funeral market share. For crematoria
operations this is mitigated by diﬃculties
associated with building new crematoria.
In such situations, Dignity would seek to follow
the population shift. This is mitigated by the
geographical spread of locations coupled with
the ability to acquire funeral locations in areas
of higher demand.
Established local reputation continues to be
important in attracting clients, although this is
declining. In addition the Group is enhancing
and developing its digital presence.
There are barriers to entry in the crematoria
market due to the need to obtain planning
approval for new crematoria and the cost of
developing new crematoria.
There are a number of potential aﬃnity
partners who could replace existing ones or
add to existing relationships.
2017 Commentary
The number of deaths in 2017
was higher than expected.
There have been no such 
events in the period.
Average revenues increased 
in line with the Board’s
expectations but will be lower 
in 2018.
Market share was lower than
the Board’s expectations. 
There have been no material
changes, with satellites being
opened and businesses
acquired in appropriate areas.
We have commented on 
the increasingly competitive
environment across our
business.
Change Risk description and impact
Signiﬁcant reduction in the death rate
There is a risk that the number of deaths in any
year signiﬁcantly reduces. This would have a
direct result on the ﬁnancial performance of
both the funeral and crematoria divisions.
Nationwide adverse publicity
Nationwide adverse publicity for Dignity could
result in a signiﬁcant reduction in the number 
of funerals or cremations performed in any
ﬁnancial period. For pre-arranged funeral plans,
adverse publicity for the Group or one of its
partners could result in a reduction in the
number of plans sold or an increase in the
number of plans cancelled. This would have 
a direct and signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial
performance of that division and the Group 
as a whole.
Ability to increase average revenues 
per funeral or cremation
Operating proﬁt growth is in part attributable to
increases in the average revenue per funeral or
cremation. There can be no guarantee that
future average revenues per funeral or
cremation will be maintained or increased.
Signiﬁcant reduction in market share
It is possible that other external factors, such 
as new competitors and the increased impact 
of the internet on the sector, could result in 
a signiﬁcant reduction in market share within
funeral or crematoria operations. This would
have a direct result on the ﬁnancial 
performance of those divisions.
Demographic shifts in population
There can be no assurance that demographic
shifts in population will not lead to a reduced
demand for funeral services in areas where
Dignity operates.
Competition
The UK funeral services market and crematoria
market is currently very fragmented.
There can be no assurance that there will not 
be further consolidation in the industry or that
increased competition in the industry, whether 
in the form of intensiﬁed price competition,
service competition, over capacity or otherwise,
would not lead to an erosion of the Group’s
market share, average revenues or costs and
consequently a reduction in its proﬁtability.
The retention of aﬃnity partners who sell the
Group’s pre-arranged funeral plans is essential to
the long-term development of the pre-arranged
funeral plan division. The loss of an aﬃnity
partner could lead to a reduction in the amount
of proﬁt recognised in that division at the time of
sale. Failure to replenish or increase the bank of
pre-arranged funeral plans could affect market
share of the funeral division in the longer-term.

There are currently speciﬁc exemptions

Any changes would apply to the industry as 
a whole and not just the Group. This risk is
also mitigated through the high standards 
of selling and administration of pre-arranged
funeral plans operated by the Group.
The Group already operates at a very high
standard, using facilities appropriate for the
digniﬁed care of the deceased.
There is considerable regulation around
insurance companies which is designed,
amongst other things, to ensure that the
insurance companies meet their obligations.
The Trusts hold assets with the objective 
of achieving returns slightly in excess of
inﬂation. 
2017 Commentary
No significant changes noted 
in the period.
No significant changes noted 
in the period. 
We continue to seek regulation

The latest actuarial valuation 
of the pre-arranged funeral
plan Trusts demonstrates 
an actuarial surplus. This is
supported by robust average
assets per plan.
Change Risk description and impact
Taxes
There can be no assurance that changes will 
not be made to UK taxes, such as VAT. VAT is 
not currently chargeable on the majority of the
Group’s services. The introduction of such a tax
could therefore signiﬁcantly increase the cost 
to clients of the Group’s services.
Regulation of pre-arranged funeral plans
Pre-arranged funeral plans are not a regulated
product, but are subject to a speciﬁc ﬁnancial
services exemption. Changes to the basis of any
regulation could affect the Group’s opportunity
to sell pre-arranged funeral plans in the future
or could result in the Group not being able to
draw down the current level of marketing
allowances, which would have a direct impact 
on the proﬁtability of the Pre-arranged funeral
plan division.
Regulation of the funeral industry
During the period, the Scottish Government
recruited an Inspector of Funerals. Dignity
welcomes this progress.
Regulation could result in increased compliance
costs for the industry as a whole or other
unforeseen consequences.
Changes in the funding of the pre-arranged
funeral plan business
The Group has given commitments to pre-
arranged funeral plan members to provide
certain funeral services in the future.
Funding for these plans is reliant on either
insurance companies paying the amounts 
owed or the pre-arranged funeral plan Trusts
having suﬃcient assets.
If this is not the case, then the Group may
receive a lower amount per funeral than
expected and thus generate lower proﬁts.

Risks in the context of our strategic objectives
The Group has a proactive approach to measuring performance
and considers risk as an integral part of decision-making, both
about current and future performance, with the Board being
responsible for the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept.
The Board manages this by linking risk appetite to its strategic
objectives, being mapped against deﬁned impact and likelihood
scales, in order to deﬁne where the level of risk sits.

Mitigating activities
The nature of the Group’s debt means 
that the denominator is now ﬁxed unless
further Secured Notes are issued in the
future. This means that the covenant
headroom will change proportionately 
with changes in EBITDA generated by 
the securitised subgroup.
2017 Commentary
No significant changes noted
in the period. However,
following the trading update
and price changes in January
2018, covenant headroom in
2018 will be reduced.
Change Risk description and impact
Financial Covenant under the 
Secured Notes
The Group’s Secured Notes requires EBITDA 
to total debt service to be above 1.5 times. 
If this ﬁnancial covenant (which is applicable 
to the securitised subgroup of Dignity) is not
achieved, then this may lead to an Event of
Default under the terms of the Secured Notes,
which could result in the Security Trustee
taking control of the securitisation group on
behalf of the Secured Noteholders.
In addition, the Group is required to achieve a
more stringent ratio of 1.85 times for the same
test in order to be permitted to transfer excess
cash from the securitisation group to Dignity
plc. If this stricter test is not achieved, then 
the Group’s ability to pay dividends would 
be impacted.

Viability statement
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities, 
as they fall due, for the subsequent three years to December 2020.
The key consideration of viability is the Group’s ability to service its Secured Notes as and when those obligations fall due, twice 
a year. The Directors have fully considered severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions, on
the Group’s ability to generate funds to meet those obligations. Consistent with the prior period, three years has been selected
as the appropriate period of review. 
In making this statement the Directors have reviewed the overall resilience of the Group and have specifically considered:
• the Group’s current position and trading prospects;
• the current and ongoing strategy; 
• the Board’s appetite for risk; and
• a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future
performance, solvency or liquidity, and how they are managed, as explained in this Strategic Report (pages 32 to 36). Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 37
Corporate and social responsibility
Truly a people business
More than many businesses, we are truly a people
business. We have to be, as we help people at a diﬃcult
time in their lives. Meeting their needs means that our
employees have to be of the highest calibre and have
particular and special qualities. They must be caring,
thoughtful and truly engaged with the people they serve.
Human values
Our Company’s core values spring from the simple fact 
of being a truly people business. They are human values 
of decency, integrity and trust. This translates into an
overarching commitment to doing the right thing by
everyone we work with: respecting each other in the
workplace, working safely, behaving ethically and being a
positive force in the communities we serve. It also includes
working hard to minimise our environmental impact.
The Dignity Way
From these core values of decency, integrity and trust 
we have developed a special culture and way of working
what we call ‘The Dignity Way’. It encourages responsibility
and stimulates high performance, adding value to our
clients’, communities and all our stakeholders. Everyone 
at Dignity knows that he or she is an ambassador for the
Company and is aware of the high standards the Company
demands. More speciﬁcally, we must all adhere to our
Code of Conduct and maintain regulatory and legal
compliance. This culture is the means by which we will
continue to succeed as a business and behave as a good
corporate citizen.

Violets in Bloom Children’s Memorial
Garden, Lichﬁeld & District
Crematorium
In August, more than 100 people
gathered to witness the oﬃcial
opening of the Violets in Bloom
Children's Memorial Garden at
Lichﬁeld Crematorium. The garden is
named after Violet Mornington who
was just ﬁve years old when she died
of an extremely rare blood disorder in
July 2013. Her parents, Kerry and Ivan,
established the charity, Violets in
Bloom, to raise funds for a memorial
to their daughter and to provide a
sanctuary for other bereaved parents.
Prior to Dignity’s ownership of the
crematorium, the previous contractors
had left the original memorial garden
unﬁnished and the work they had
completed was not of an acceptable
standard. Dignity approached the
Mornington family and oﬀered to fund
the design and development of a new
garden that was a ﬁtting memorial 
to Violet. Dignity’s in-house Legal
Counsel took action to retrieve the
charity’s money so that it could be
used by other parents that had lost 
a child to fund a memorial and 
burial plot.
The garden was opened by Spandau
Ballet singer, Tony Hadley, who has 
a personal connection to the
Mornington family.

Fundraising initiatives included
sponsored walks, marathons, fun

Working safely in the workplace
Dignity is committed to protecting, 
as far as reasonably practicable, 
the health and safety of its employees
and visitors to its premises. Our
employees recognise this commitment
and that workplace safety remains 
a key priority. Working in a safe
environment allows our people to
focus on delivering excellent service 
to our clients. Protecting our people
also supports employee engagement
and retention.
Governance and management
Dignity has a full-time Head of Health
and Safety who is supported by nine
Health and Safety Oﬃcers with a
broad collective experience from
diﬀering organisational backgrounds.
Dignity’s head oﬃce, crematoria and
coﬃn manufacturing factory also
have their own managers with
responsibility for health and safety.  
In the last eight years the number of
accidents has reduced by 26 per cent.
Dignity continues to proactively
monitor health and safety through
quarterly analysis, inspection of
premises, surveillance and regular
reports to the Board and monitors
reactively by investigating accidents
and analysing statistics.
Health and safety performance
Our health and safety team have
worked diligently to reduce incidents
and have focused on improving our
safety culture, behaviours and risk
reduction. We continue to implement
and build on these activities, monitor
compliance and proactively identify
areas requiring action with the
intention of further risk reduction
across the business.
Driving continuous improvement
We have a strong culture of safety and
operational excellence and through
continuous improvement we focus on
delivering excellent client service. Our
aim is to continue providing excellent
leadership in the pursuit of safe and
environmentally responsible
workplaces.
Dignity’s coﬃn manufacturing facility
in East Yorkshire has OHSAS 18001
accreditation recognising the facility 
as a safe and healthy environment.
Managing our environmental impact
In 2017, our business continued to
have a low environmental impact 
and its activities are not expected 
to give rise to any signiﬁcant
environmental risk over the next 
12 months. All waste generated is
properly disposed of in accordance
with current legislation and steps are
taken to recycle waste wherever this 
is practical. Approximately 34,000
cremations at Dignity crematoria 
were mercury abated during 2017,
representing 54 per cent of the 
total number of cremations.
Dignity’s coﬃn manufacturing facility
has ISO 14001 accreditation, an
internationally accepted standard 
for an eﬀective environmental
management system that is designed
to address the balance between
maintaining proﬁtability and reducing
environmental impact. Our coﬃns 
are manufactured using raw materials
that are sourced from well-managed
and sustainable sources. 96 per cent

Setting the highest standards
behind the scenes
The funeral sector is unregulated
and there is no requirement for a
funeral business to have even basic
facilities. Dignity sets high standards
with professional mortuaries and
embalming facilities that meet
health and safety legislation. When
we buy funeral businesses we often
ﬁnd that the largest area for capital
expenditure is behind the scenes.
In 2017, Lorna Brierley-Davies, an

impact through a scoring process.
Scoring is based on a number 
of criteria designed to assess our
Energy Management practices and
Environmental Strategy, speciﬁcally
around Performance and Reporting,
Risk Management, and Business
Strategy in relation to Climate Change.
Dignity’s 2017 submission achieved a
‘B’ rating, with ‘A’ being the highest and
‘E’ being the lowest ratings. During the
period, Dignity also reported on water

Methodology
Our greenhouse gas emissions have been calculated on a per full time 
equivalent employee ratio. This intensity metric is the best measure available 
to the Group given the diversity of the property portfolio, the three separate
divisions of the business, and the absence of a similar business to benchmark
against. For the 2017 reporting period Dignity has calculated carbon emissions
using both the location-based and market-based methodology in accordance 
with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The
location-based methodology uses UK grid average emission factors whereas; 
the market-based methodology uses Dignity’s supplier speciﬁc emission factors.
Dignity’s lower market-based carbon emissions ﬁgure in Scope 2 reﬂects a larger
proportion of purchased electricity generated by low-carbon sources than the 
UK grid average. 
We have calculated our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions since 2010 and have
engaged with Ecometrica Ltd to assist with the carbon emissions reporting.
GHG emissions have been calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), using the location-

Case study:
Eco-hearse and matching car 
A Nissan Leaf Eco-hearse and
matching electric car have been 
added to our ﬂeet in London to oﬀer
an environmentally friendly alternative 
to traditional vehicles. In a heavily
congested area the use of an Eco-
hearse will help reduce our carbon
footprint and create a cleaner capital
for future generations. The Nissan
Leaf Eco-hearse has a radius of 100
miles whilst the electric car can seat
up to three passengers. Chairman’s introduction to governance
Good governance is the basis on 
which we as a business can build an 
environment of trust, transparency 
and accountability.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Dignity plc is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the ‘Code’) issued by the Financial Reporting Council (available
at frc.org.uk). As a listed company, Dignity is required to report
on how it has applied the principles of the Code and this is 
set out in the following pages. The Board is pleased to report
that Dignity has complied with all of the provisions of the 
Code throughout the period ended 29 December 2017 and
remained fully compliant at the date the 2017 Annual Report
was published, save for a short period, as noted in the 2016
Annual Report, between Martin Pexton stepping down from
the Board on 3 February 2017 and the appointment of Mary
McNamara on 1 March 2017 where the Group did not fully
comply with provision B.1.2 of the Code which requires that at
least half the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise
non-executive directors. 
At the end of 2008 Peter Hindley relinquished the role of 
Chief Executive and became Chairman of the Board. This 
was contrary to provision A.3.1 of the Code as he was not
independent on appointment. However, as suggested by the
Code, that appointment was only made after consultation with
the major shareholders of the Group at that time. The Board
felt at the time and continues to feel today that it is important
to retain his skills and knowledge of the funeral industry 
at Dignity. 
Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report for Dignity plc for the period
ending 29 December 2017.
Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance, details of which are given in this report and the
separate reports from the Chairman of:
• The Audit Committee;
• The Nomination Committee; and
• The Remuneration Committee.
The various sections of this report contain summarised
information from Dignity plc’s Articles of Association (the
‘Articles’) and the Companies Act 2006 which is the applicable
English law concerning companies. The relevant provisions of
the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if more
detailed information is needed.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Group’s
Corporate Governance Report for 2017. Our report is intended
to provide shareholders with a clear and comprehensive
explanation of what good governance means within Dignity,
what it means to us as the Board of Directors, how it is applied
and how it guides our decision making.
We are reporting in line with the UK Corporate Governance
Code (the ‘Code’) and I am pleased to advise that Dignity has
complied with all relevant provisions throughout the period
ending 29 December 2017, save for the exception noted later.
How we have achieved this is covered in this section of our
Annual Report and comprehensively explains our approach 
to and the application of good Corporate Governance.
Separate reports are included from each of the Board
Committees; we feel this gives the most comprehensive 
view of their activities.
Good governance is crucial at all levels within the Group 
and it is the responsibility of the Board both to lead by 
example and set the tone. It means ensuring that an effective
internal framework of systems and controls exists which
includes clearly deﬁned authorities and accountability which
promotes success, whilst allowing risks to be managed 
to appropriate levels. To do this the Board must make
appropriate judgements whilst giving consideration to 
the views of our shareholders and other stakeholders.
I would encourage you to attend our Annual General Meeting
on 7 June 2018 and take the opportunity to meet the
management team at this important event. We will take both
formal questions at that meeting and be available for more
informal conversation and questions afterwards.

Directors’ statement on corporate governance
How the Board Functions
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors that meets regularly throughout the year. The structure of the Board,
together with explanations of responsibilities, is shown on page 45. Informal meetings are held between individual Directors 
as required.
The management of the Group on a day to day basis is delegated, via the Executive Directors, to an experienced and generally
long serving senior and middle management team whose size and structure is commensurate with the complexity of the Group’s
activities. Managers have the necessary skills and knowledge relevant to their areas of responsibility. The remainder of the
responsibilities rest with the Board however, certain capital expenditures and acquisition projects are delegated under a formally
adopted Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board and the Expenditure Authorisation Policy.
All Directors are provided with the necessary papers in advance of the meetings to permit them to make informed decisions 
at those meetings. The Board also considers employee issues and key management appointments, including the role of
Company Secretary.
The Board now comprises six Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman. During the period the total number of directors 
who served was nine plus the Non-Executive Chairman however Andrew Davies the Operations Director retired from the Board 
on 5 January 2018 and Alan McWalter retired from the Board on 31 January 2018. There are the same number of independent 
Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors which the Board consider to be an appropriate and effective combination and
also complies with the Code in respect of FTSE 250 listed companies. The Board also considers that three Executive Directors,
supported by the wider Executive Management Team, details of which are on page 48, are sufficient to manage a Group of this
size, complexity and organisational structure.
There were five independent Non-Executive Directors who served for the period: Jane Ashcroft, Alan McWalter, Martin Pexton,
David Blackwood and Mary McNamara. Martin Pexton resigned from the Board on 3 February 2017 and after a comprehensive
and rigorous search conducted by an external recruitment agency Mary McNamara was appointed as Non-Executive Director 
on 1 March 2017. Alan McWalter retired from the Board on 31 January 2018 after completing the maximum of nine years service
as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Given the retirement of Andrew Davies as Operations Director and the appointment
of his replacement as part of the wider Executive Management Team Alan McWalter will not be replaced. 
Biographical details for the serving Non-Executive Directors appear on page 47. Their role is to challenge constructively the
management of the Group and help develop proposals on strategy. The Non-Executive Directors are chosen for their diversity 
of skills and experience. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for a fixed term of two years, subject to annual re-election by
shareholders. This term may then be renewed by mutual consent up to a maximum of nine years in accordance with the Code.
Appointments beyond six years are also subject to rigorous review prior to approval. The Non-Executive letters of appointment
are available, upon request, from the Company Secretary.
David Blackwood is the Senior Independent Director of the Group. He succeeded Alan McWalter who fulfilled that role during the
period. His role is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and act as an intermediary for other Directors if needed and to
be available to shareholders if so required. 
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are required to, and have, confirmed formally to the Board that, mindful of their
other commitments they have, and will have, sufficient time to devote to their responsibilities as Directors of the Company.
Jane Ashcroft, David Blackwood and Mary McNamara are independent of management, as defined by the Code. 
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice on the furtherance of their duties if necessary at the Group’s
expense. They also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director
and, where it is considered appropriate and necessary, training is made available to Directors. All Directors receive annual
training and updates on the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company. This covers legal, accounting,
security and tax matters as required or as requested by any director. In addition any newly appointed director receives
appropriate induction training. Mary McNamara is receiving such training following her appointment.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of any legal action against its Directors including in respect of
prospectuses issued in connection with the issue of additional Secured Notes and Returns of Value to Shareholders. The level 
of cover is currently £100 million.
The Directors have, during the period, formally reminded themselves of their duties as Directors under the Companies Act 2006
(Section 171-177). These duties include the need to avoid conflicts of interest (Section 175). No such conflicts of interest exist.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Board Appraisal
In accordance with the requirements of the Code an external evaluation of the Board and its Committees was completed in
2016, following on from the previous evaluation in 2013. Both were completed by Independent Audit Ltd, a specialist company,
entirely independent of the Group. This meets the requirements of the Code that an external evaluation takes place on at least
a three yearly basis and it is planned that a further external evaluation be undertaken in 2019.
During period, the Board undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees 
and Directors by way of the issue of a detailed questionnaire to all Directors. This was then followed by a detailed review 
of the responses, by the Directors, and identification of any actions arising. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior
Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman taking in to account the views of the
other Executive Directors. The Board was satisfied that its performance and that of its Chairman, individual Directors and
Committees was of the appropriate standard.
Board and Board Committee Attendance
Those attending and the frequency of Board and Committee meetings held during the period was as follows:

(iii)     Richard Portman attended certain Committee meetings in his capacity as Company Secretary.
(iv)     Mary McNamara was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2017. She attended all except one Board meeting after that date. The one missed was due to a commitment
made prior to her appointment.
The Board had eight full Board meetings per annum spread broadly equally across the year, one more than in 2016 as a further
meeting was arranged during the year. After careful consideration it was decided that seven is the appropriate number required
to exercise effective governance and control although that is kept under review. Further meetings are arranged if required.
When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the matters to be discussed and given an opportunity 
to make their views known to the Chairman prior to the meeting. A process exists whereby such views will be included in the
minutes of the meeting if necessary.
Three meetings between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors being present were
held during 2017. These are usually scheduled to occur before full Board meetings. The Non-Executive Directors also met once
during 2017 without the Chairman present.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, is responsible for overseeing the preparation and distribution of all agendas,
minutes and related Board and Committee papers. As Corporate Services Director, he attends the Board meetings in his
capacity as a Director of the Company but as Company Secretary provides corporate governance advice if required. The
minutes of the meeting are taken by an experienced Administrator from the Corporate Services function. Richard Portman 
also attends the Committee meetings when requested to do so by the Chairman of that Committee to provide corporate
governance advice as Company Secretary with the minutes being taken by the Administrator. 
The Board is happy that the role of Company Secretary is undertaken by the Corporate Services Director as, whilst traditionally
it might be considered more appropriate to have the roles separate, the Board believes in Dignity’s case it is the most cost
effective and sensible way of filling the role particularly given the skills and knowledge of the Corporate Services Director. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board has responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management, which is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. A formal and ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group was in place throughout the period and in place up to the date the Governance Report was
signed and approved for the Annual Report and Accounts 2017. 
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
50  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017   The Executive Directors and the wider executive management group are responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining
and evaluating the necessary systems of internal controls. Such controls are reviewed on an ongoing basis and formally
reviewed on an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of the Code. This annual review confirmed that the Group’s
risk management and internal control systems were appropriate and suitable for a Group of this size and complexity. 
Internal Audit completes a programme of work each year that provides assurance that the internal controls have been
operated as designed and also proposes improvements where appropriate and necessary. Coupled with this, the formal six
monthly review of the Risk Register provides a further review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls. 
All such work is reported to and monitored by the Audit Committee who recommends approval to the full Board and is
discussed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 53 to 55.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, as part of an ongoing process, formally reviews and continues to keep under
review the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, including financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management systems. The Audit Committee formally reviews risk management annually and receives reports from
Executive Management and Internal Audit regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of weaknesses in
internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal control. It also identifies the
significant controls upon which reliance will be placed. Any significant control weaknesses would be reported to the full Board
at their next meeting. There have been no reports of weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material
misstatement or loss in the period, nor in the period up to the date this Annual Report was published.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows:
• Financial Reporting – The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting. The Group’s monthly
actual results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated
with revised forecasts prepared as necessary;
• Financial Controls – The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and procedures to be
employed by operational management. Key controls over major business risks include reviews against budgets and forecasts,
review against key performance indicators and exception reporting;
• Quality and Integrity of Personnel – One of the Group’s core values is integrity. This is regarded as vital to the maintenance of
the Group’s system of internal financial control. The Directors have put in place an organisation structure appropriate to the
size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority where the Board considers 
it necessary and appropriate. There is also a Code of Conduct applicable to all employees of the Group as well as specific
policies such as Anti Bribery and Corruption, Slavery and Human Trafficking and Money Laundering; and
• Internal Audit – The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Corporate Services Director and the Audit
Committee. The latter reviews and approves the annual work plan of the Internal Audit function which tests the effectiveness
of many controls. Any significant weaknesses are reported to management and the Audit Committee on a timely basis. It
coordinates the completion of self-assessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control
weakness or exposure. Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas together with selected areas of the head office
function and any area where an Executive Director requests a review.
  During 2017 (as in 2016), there were quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit and the Executive Directors to
formally review and discuss Internal Audit’s work programme and findings. In addition, regular meetings between the Head of
Internal Audit and the external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’), were held during the year to discuss and plan audit work and
to ensure a complementary approach. The Head of Internal Audit formally reports to the Audit Committee at every meeting
and also held three private meetings with the Chairman of the Audit Committee during 2017;
• Procedures – The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its operations,
both client facing and in support departments. These provide clear guidance on the correct or most appropriate course of
action in various circumstances. Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have been identified. Both Internal
Audit and the comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such processes and procedures; and 
• Risk assessment – The Executive Directors and the wider executive management group have responsibility for the identification
and evaluation of significant risks that might arise in their areas of responsibility, together with the design of suitable internal
controls. This was in place throughout the accounting period and at the date of approval of the Annual Report. They also
regularly assess the risks facing the Group. A Risk Register is maintained which is presented to and reviewed by the Audit
Committee twice a year and then formally adopted by the Board of Dignity plc. Risks and any changes to those risks are
discussed at every Board meeting. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, which are documented in the Risk
Register, are discussed on pages 34 to 36 of the Annual Report. These risks have also been formally considered when the
Directors prepared their Viability Statement on page 36 of this Annual Report in accordance with provision C2.2 of the Code.
These procedures are designed to, amongst other things, help to provide assurance around the process of preparing
consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting system.
An explanation of how the Group aims to create and preserve value and the strategy for delivering its objectives is included in
the Operating Review on pages 20 to 26.

Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Relationship with Shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of clear communication with shareholders.
Regular contact with institutional investors, fund managers and analysts is maintained by the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director to discuss information made public by the Group. The Board receives reports of these meetings and any significant
issues raised are discussed by the Board. Where appropriate or if requested, such meetings could include either or both the
Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and the Non-Executive Directors
are also available to meet separately with shareholders if necessary or requested to discuss any issues that they may have. 
The Chairman is also available to discuss governance and strategy matters with the major shareholders. The Corporate Services
Director generally deals with queries or enquiries from private shareholders. The Board is as interested in their concerns as 
it is of institutional and corporate shareholders.
The AGM provides an opportunity to meet the Board and the Executive Management Team. All shareholders are free to attend
and put questions to any Director and in particular the Chairman of each of the Board Committees at the AGM on 7 June 2018.
At least 20 days’ notice will be given ahead of that meeting. Questions asked in person at the AGM will receive an oral response
whenever possible, otherwise a written response will be provided as soon as practicable after the AGM. Questions raised at any
other time will normally receive a written response. Shareholders attending the AGM will also have the opportunity to meet
informally with all the Directors and the Executive Management Team after the meeting has concluded.
The Directors consider that this Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model, risks and strategy. In order 
to assess whether the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable, the Board received an early draft 
to enable time for review and comment. The Audit Committee then met to consider the criteria for a fair, balanced and
understandable Annual Report and to review the process underpinning the compilation and assurance of the report, in relation
to financial and non-financial management information. At that meeting they considered the Annual Report and Accounts 
as a whole and discussed the tone, balance and language of the document, being mindful of the UK reporting requirements 
and consistency between narrative sections and the financial statements. As part of this process the Board considered the Group’s
reporting governance framework and the views of the external auditor as reported to the Audit Committee. Pages 4 to 36 provide
an assessment of the Group’s affairs. 
The Annual Report and Accounts is made available to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the AGM. Registered
shareholders receive a Notice of Meeting and Form of Proxy, the latter document allowing a shareholder to vote in favour, or
against or indicate an abstention on each separate resolution tabled at the AGM. Particulars of aggregate proxies lodged are 
also announced to the London Stock Exchange (‘LSE’) and placed on the Group’s investor website, www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk,
as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the AGM.
The Interim Report is no longer published as a paper document but is available on the Group’s investor website upon which
users can also access the latest financial and corporate news. All information reported to the market via regulatory information
services also appears as soon as practicable on that website.
The Group is happy to arrange visits to its funeral locations and crematoria, if requested by a shareholder, where and when it will
not disrupt services we are providing to our clients.

Audit Committee report 
The Audit Committee continues to 
address its key responsibilities and to 
respond effectively to changes in the 
Group’s business environment.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present my third report
as the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Membership and Process
The following Directors served on the Audit Committee 
(the ‘Committee’) during 2017: me as Chairman, Alan McWalter
(Senior Independent Director until the end of 2017), Jane Ashcroft
and Mary McNamara each of whom are independent Non-
Executive Directors. Mary McNamara who was appointed to 
the Board and this Committee on 1 March 2017. Martin Pexton
resigned from the Board and this Committee on 3 February 2017
so did not attend any meetings in 2017.
Alan McWalter retired from the Board and this Committee on 
31 January 2018 and I would like to record my thanks to him for
his support and guidance whilst serving on the Audit Committee.
All other Committee members served through to the date 
of this report. 
The Board is satisﬁed that I have, as Chairman of the 
Committee, recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience together
with competence in accounting and auditing that can be
appropriately and successfully applied at Dignity. In addition, 
the Committee has a broad range of experience across a
number of sectors that are relevant to Dignity. The Company
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. I report the
Committee’s deliberations at the next Board meeting and the
minutes of each meeting are made available to all members 
of the Board.
The Committee met three times during 2017; in March prior to
the release of the Preliminary Announcement for 2016; prior to
the release of the Interim Announcement for 2017 in July; and
again in December 2017 immediately prior to the end of the
ﬁnancial period. The Committee also met in March 2018 prior 
to the release of the Preliminary Announcement for 2017. The
attendance records of the members are shown on page 50. 
The external auditors ‘EY’, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the
Finance Director, the Operations Director, the Corporate Services
Director, the Head of Internal Audit and the Financial Controller
have all attended meetings by invitation.
The Committee holds a private session with the Lead Partner
from our external auditors without management present at least
twice a year. In addition, I, as Chairman of the Audit Committee,
met with the Lead Partner a total of two times through the year
to provide the opportunity for open communication and the free
ﬂow of any concerns relating both to the openness, transparency
and general engagement of management with the audit process
as well as to understand EY’s assessment of key judgements 
as they arise.
Key Responsibilities
The Committee works with the full Board to fulﬁl its oversight
responsibilities. Its primary functions are to:
• Monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements and other
information provided to shareholders to ensure they represent
a clear and accurate assessment of the Group’s position,
performance, strategy and prospects;
• Consider the ﬁnancial statements and recommend to the
Board on whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced, understandable and provides
information necessary for shareholders to assess the
performance, business model and strategy of the Group,
recognising the changes to the strategy of the business and
accounting changes such as the amortisation of trade names;
• Review signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting issues and judgements
contained in the ﬁnancial statements;
• Review the systems of accounting, internal control and risk
management;
• Monitor and review the signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed by the Group
as well as the management and mitigation of those risks; 
• Oversee and maintain an appropriate relationship with the
Group’s external auditors and review the effectiveness,
independence and objectivity of the external audit process;
• Monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit
function; review the internal audit plan; all internal audit
reports; review and monitor management’s responses to the
ﬁndings and recommendations of the internal audit function;
and maintain an effective relationship with the Head of 
Internal Audit; and
• Monitor and review the arrangements by which employees can,
in conﬁdence, raise concerns about any possible improprieties
in ﬁnancial and other matters (such as compliance with the
Bribery Act).
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the
Group’s corporate website at www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk.
Activities in the period
The key activities of the Committee during the period were:
• It completed a comprehensive review of the 2016 and 2017
Annual Report and Accounts and the 2017 Interim Report.
This review was to ensure that the Committee were completely
satisﬁed that the information was fair, balanced and
understandable. As part of this review the Committee received
reports from the external auditors on their audit of that Annual
Report and their review of the interim results. The Committee
also reviewed the Preliminary and Interim Announcements
made to the London Stock Exchange;
• At all meetings it reviewed reports made by Internal Audit which
included the review of progress against the plan for the period,
the results of principal audits and other signiﬁcant ﬁndings,
adequacy of management’s responses and the timeliness 
of resolution of actions arising; 
• Review and agreement of the three year rolling plan for

• A six month review and recommendation of formal adoption 
to the full Board of the Risk Register. This is part of a formal
ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. An additional review of the
Risk Register was also completed in March 2018.The principal
risks facing the Group are considered on pages 34 to 36 of 
the Annual Report; 
• Formally review the going concern assumptions adopted in 
the preparation of the 2016 and 2017 ﬁnancial statements;
• Completion of a comprehensive review of Dignity’s risk control
framework and its linkage to the Risk Register and Viability
Statement included in the Strategic Report on page 36; 
• The Committee discussed the annual external audit plan in
advance of the period end with the external auditors, which
addressed the planned audit approach to key accounting areas;
and 
• The Committee discussed the auditor’s views on key judgement
areas and audit ﬁndings relating to key accounting matters at
the conclusion of the audit.
Areas that have been discussed and considered by the
Committee in relation to the 2017 Annual Report are:
• Trade names – we examined the judgement made that the
useful life was no longer indeﬁnite and the estimate that a 
35 year life should be ascribed, ensuring that the assessments
made, and conclusions reached, were consistent with the Audit
Committee’s collective understanding of the funeral business.
• Impairment – we considered the results of the impairment test
performed, ensuring that the assessment made and
conclusions reached were consistent with the analysis and
reﬂected the changes in the funeral business. 
• Pensions – we examined the assumptions used in the actuarial
valuation for the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme considering
the consistency of approach with the prior year and compliance
with the requirements of IAS 19.
• Risk – a comprehensive review of the principal risks and
uncertainties disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report based on the
changing competitive environment in which the Group
operates.
• Pre-arranged funeral plans trusts – the Committee considered
the on-going treatment of the Trusts under IFRS 10 along with
the additional disclosure requirements of IFRS 12.
• A comprehensive review and ratiﬁcation of the Viability
Statement for Dignity included in 2017 Annual Report.
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external
audit. This policy assigns responsibility for monitoring objectivity,
independence and compliance with ethical and regulatory
requirements to the Audit Committee with day to day
responsibility assigned to the Finance Director, Steve Whittern.
The Committee also retains responsibility for the appointment
and removal of the external auditors, who are currently EY. 
The Audit Committee, on an annual basis, formally considers the
performance and independence of the external auditors. The
formal annual review was completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018.
This review took the form of a detailed questionnaire that was
sent to all Committee members and attendees at the Committee
meetings. The respondents were asked to grade all aspects of
the service provided. The Committee was, based on that review,
which indicated a strong level of conﬁdence in the external
auditors, fully satisﬁed with EY’s performance in 2017 and a
resolution to re-appoint them as external auditors will be tabled
at the AGM on 7 June 2018.
The Committee conﬁrms that during the year the Group has
complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use 
of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee
Responsibilities) Order 2014, as published by the UK 
Competition and Markets Authority.
Policy on non-audit fees
The Group has a rigorous and comprehensive policy on the use
of the external auditors for non-audit work. The policy states that
non-audit fees are limited to no more than 50 per cent of the
annual audit fee unless there are exceptional circumstances,
which are deﬁned as:
• The work necessitates the use of the auditor for regulatory
reasons; and
• Their use represents a material time/cost beneﬁt to the Group
in conducting a transaction. 
The policy also precludes the use of the external auditors for
certain types of work. All such work will be fully analysed in 
the Annual Report between tax compliance and advisory, non
statutory acquisition related services and statutory services.
Audit Committee approval is required prior to the work being
commenced and further disclosure of the works and the reasons
for it being performed by the external auditors will be included 
in the following Annual Report. The Audit Committee does not
envisage that non-audit fees payable to the external auditors will
exceed 50 per cent other than in exceptional circumstances.
In the period, EY undertook no non-audit work on behalf of the
Group except for their review of the Interim Report for 2017,
completion of turnover certiﬁcates, a ﬁnancial covenants
compliance certiﬁcate and certiﬁcations required as part of the
Group’s membership renewal of the FPA. Total fees of £42,000
were charged for the non-audit services compared to £304,000
for audit services. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 55
The Committee is conﬁdent that the objectivity and
independence of the external auditors is not compromised 
by reason of non-audit work, not least because such work will
generally be undertaken by other professional ﬁrms. A formal
statement of independence from EY has been received in 
respect of 2017.
Audit partner rotation
Consistent with the requirements of the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
EY audit partners serve for a maximum of ﬁve years on listed
clients. This is the fourth year that Simon O’Neill has been
Dignity’s audit partner and EY have been the Group’s auditors.
Work has begun to identify Simon’s successor.
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the
auditors is working well and is satisﬁed with their effectiveness
and there are no current plans to put the external audit out to
tender although the Committee remains mindful of the UK
Competition and Markets Authority requirement regarding
tendering I have discussed above.
The Audit Committee has also kept under review the
independence of EY and has been satisﬁed at all times that 
any threats arising to their independence have been subject 
to appropriate safeguards. 
Internal Audit
The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports 
to the Corporate Services Director and the Audit Committee. 
It coordinates the completion of self-assessment reports by
operational management that assists in highlighting areas 
of control weakness or exposure. Internal audit reviews are
completed on such areas together with selected areas of the
head oﬃce function and any area where a Director or the 
Audit Committee requests a review.
During 2017 (as in 2016), there were quarterly meetings between
the Head of Internal Audit and the Executive Directors formally 
to review and discuss Internal Audit’s work programme and
ﬁndings. In addition, regular meetings between Internal Audit
and the external auditors, EY, were held during the year to
discuss and plan audit work and to ensure a complementary
approach. The Head of Internal Audit provides reports to the
Audit Committee at every full meeting and met on a one to one
basis with me, as the Chairman of the Audit Committee on three
occasions in the period. This process allows the Committee to
monitor the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function as the
Head of Internal Audit is available at all Committee meetings and
all reports and their conclusions are comprehensively reviewed.
Whistleblowing 
A formal policy and procedure, established via the Committee,
exists by which employees of the Group may, in conﬁdence, raise
concerns about possible improprieties in ﬁnancial reporting or
other matters. This ensures arrangements are in place for the
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters
and appropriate follow-up action. Whistleblowing reports are
formally reviewed on an annual basis by the Committee or more
frequently should the need arise.
This Audit Committee report was reviewed and approved by 
the Board on 14 March 2018.

The Nomination Committee has the key 
role of ensuring we have the right blend 
of skills on the Board to deliver our strategy 
and successfully deal with changes in the 
business environment.
56  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2017
Nomination Committee report.
During 2017 the Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’)
consisted of me (as Chairman), Alan McWalter (Senior
Independent Director), Jane Ashcroft, David Blackwood and
Martin Pexton who resigned from the Board on 3 February 2017.
He did not attend any of the meetings in 2017 as they occurred
after his resignation. He was replaced by Mary McNamara who
joined on 1 March 2017. All, committee members, apart from
myself, are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Alan McWalter retired from the Board and this Committee on 
31 January 2018 after nine years service to the Group as an
Independent Non-Executive Director and latterly as both Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee. I would like to thank Alan for his
contribution to this Committee over all those years.
The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, acted as Secretary to
the Committee when requested by me to do so. All members are
considered to be independent by the Group having no day to 
day involvement with the Group.
During the year the Committee carried out the following tasks:
• Kept under review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board including ensuring that it has the necessary skills,
knowledge and experience mindful of the Board changes that
occurred, which included the appointment of a new chairman
of the Remuneration Committee and a new Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director;
• Considered succession planning in respect of all the Directors
and senior managers mindful of the changes to the size and
composition of the Board;
• Identiﬁed and nominated for approval by the full Board Mary
McNamara to ﬁll the vacancy arising upon the resignation from
the Board of Martin Pexton;
• Kept under review the leadership needs of the Group, both
executive and non-executive;
• Reviewed the time commitment required from the 
Non-Executive Directors; and
• Considered and approved the appointment of David Blackwood
for a further term of two years as an Independent Non-
Executive Director.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the
Group’s corporate website at www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk.
The Committee met three times in 2017. At these meetings the
principal duties of the Committee were formally considered and
no issues or concerns were identiﬁed. The members of the
Committee’s attendance record is set out on page 50. I report on
the Committee’s proceedings at the next full Board meeting and
the minutes of those meetings are made available to all
members of the Board.
As I explained in my letter in the 2016 Annual Report Martin
Pexton indicated that he intended to step down from the Board
in early 2017. The Nomination Committee therefore retained the
executive search agency Norman Broadbent to provide a list of
both male and female high calibre candidates with the
appropriate skills and experience to not only be a Non-Executive
Director of Dignity but also have the ability to be Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee in the future. I am pleased to advise
that at the end of a rigorous recruitment process we appointed
Mary McNamara, her biographical details are on page 47 of this
Annual Report. I am also pleased to advise that Mary has taken
over the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee from
Alan McWalter following his retirement from the Board.
In June 2017 Andrew Davies, the Group’s Operations Director,
indicated that he intended to retire from the Board. This
retirement took effect from 5 January 2018. Andrew Judd,
hitherto the Regional Manager for the South West Funeral
Region, after careful consideration, was appointed as his
successor as Director of Funeral Operations. This appointment
was not to the Board of Dignity plc.
Given that the number of Executive Directors was reducing from
four to three it was decided that it would not be necessary to
replace Alan McWalter with a new Independent Non-Executive
Director so the overall size of the Board fell from nine to seven
but there would still be an equal number of Executive and Non-
Executive Directors. The Committee felt, given the strengthening
of the wider Executive Management Team, that the structure,
size and composition of the Board still remained appropriate for
the Group’s size and complexity.
All the Non-Executive Directors are appointed for two year terms
which may then be renewed up to maximum of nine years
service in accordance with the independence guidelines in the
UK Corporate Governance Code.

The Committee, and by extension the full Board, continue to
support the spirit of Lord Davies’ Report “Women on Boards” . 
In 2011 we set a goal of 20 per cent of Board positions to be 
ﬁlled by women by 2015. Following the recent Board changes 
I am pleased to advise that it is currently 29 per cent having
increased from 22 per cent in 2016. We remain fully committed
to increasing the proportion of women serving on the Board 
of Dignity but we are also mindful of the overall need to recruit
the very best candidates regardless of gender. 
Similarly, and mindful of the Hampton-Alexander review, we 
will continue to encourage similar gender diversity in our senior
management positions throughout the workforce. Their report in
December 2017 noted that 22 per cent of our Board was female
which, as noted above, has now increased to 29 per cent. It also
noted that 22 per cent of the Executive Committee and direct
reports to the Directors of Dignity plc was also 22 per cent. 
That percentage is now 24 per cent.
I am also pleased to conﬁrm that the Group will continue 
to publish the details on corporate diversity suggested in
Recommendation 2 of the Davies Report and report on our
compliance (Recommendation 4) and appointment process
(Recommendation 5) in our Annual Report.
During the period, the Board completed an internal performance
evaluation of itself and its Committees. The results of this are
discussed on page 50. 
Finally, the Company’s Articles provide that all Directors retire 
by rotation with one third being subject to re-election each 
year. However we continue to adopt the provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code such that all Directors offer
themselves for re-election annually.
This Nomination Committee report was reviewed and approved
by the Board on 14 March 2018.

Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132 Report on Directors’ remuneration
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
The Remuneration Committee will continue to 
ensure that the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors remains linked to challenging 
performance targets thus ensuring that 
their interests and success are aligned 
with shareholders.
58  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present, for the ﬁrst
time as Dignity's Remuneration Committee Chairman, this
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the period ended 
29 December 2017.
Our Directors' Remuneration Policy, set out on pages 59 to 64
was approved in a binding vote of shareholders at the AGM 
on 9 June 2016. The policy will continue to apply in 2018 as it
has since it became effective in 2016. The Annual Report on
Remuneration (set out on pages 64 to 71) describes how this
policy will be implemented in 2018, together with details of
remuneration paid in the 2017 ﬁnancial year. Since no changes
are proposed to the policy, there will only be a single advisory
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM to cover this annual
statement together with the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance and reward in 2017
Dignity again delivered a robust ﬁnancial performance in 2017
with underlying proﬁt before taxation increasing three per cent
to £77.8 million. Underlying earnings per share 128.3 pence,
seven per cent higher than 2016.
2017 annual bonus outcome
The Group demonstrated good operational performance,
continued excellent client survey results and made further
acquisitions of established funeral businesses. This
performance was achieved against the backdrop of a
challenging environment which is becoming increasingly
competitive in 2018 and beyond. The annual bonus in 2017
was measured against stretching earnings before interest and
tax ('EBIT') targets, our key short-term ﬁnancial performance
indicator. EBIT was £104.6 million, three per cent higher than
that reported in 2016. The Group’s 2017 ﬁnancial performance
was suﬃciently strong to justify an award to Executive
Directors of 95 per cent of the maximum amount possible 
of their annual bonus opportunity. However, in light of the
signiﬁcant reduction in ﬁnancial expectations for 2018
following the trading update in January 2018, the current
Executive Directors have decided to voluntarily waive their
entitlement in full.
The LTIP award granted in 2015 was subject to performance
against two equally weighted measures, relative total
shareholder return (‘TSR’) and earnings per share growth
(‘EPS’). Following the three year performance period ending 29
December 2017 Dignity's TSR was ranked below threshold and
actual EPS was 128.3 pence. As a result, 50 per cent of the 2015
LTIP was capable of vesting on 6 March 2018. The Committee
believes the LTIP outcomes are representative of underlying
Company performance over the prior three year period.
Remuneration in 2018
The Remuneration Committee has made the following
decisions for the year ahead:
• No base salary increases have been awarded to the Executive
Directors for 2018. The average increase to the wider
workforce was broadly two per cent.
• The annual maximum bonus will remain at 135 per cent of
base salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for the
other Executive Directors. Reﬂecting the revised strategic
priorities of the Group, for 2018, 70 per cent of the bonus 
will be based on stretching EBIT targets and 30 per cent on 
well-deﬁned strategic objectives which underpin our strategy 
as set out on page 14.
• Taking into account the fall in share price after the year 
end, the Committee has decided to make awards under 
the LTIP at the same number that were granted in 2017,
which reﬂects a signiﬁcant decrease when expressed as 
a percentage of base salary. The Committee considered
carefully the performance metrics that should apply and
determined that it was not possible to set robust earnings
targets until the relationship between volume and margin
become clearer following the decision to change our pricing
strategy. Therefore, for this year's awards, vesting will be
subject to very demanding absolute total shareholder targets
which require management to grow the share price back to
the level prior to the announcement of the pricing change 
(i.e. a return of circa 135 per cent based on the current share
price). Any award that vests will be subject to a two-year
holding period, clawback provisions and an underpin
requiring the Committee to determine whether the vesting
outcome reﬂects the underlying performance of the
Company over the period.
Changes to the Board
We announced on 28 June 2017 that Andrew Davies had
agreed with Dignity that he would be retiring from the
Company early in 2018. Andrew subsequently stepped down
from the Board on 5 January 2018 and will cease to be an
employee of Dignity with effect from 27 April 2018. During 
the period of employment following Andrew's stepping down 
from the Board he will continue to receive his salary and
contractual beneﬁts and remained eligible to be awarded 
the annual bonus for 2017 which he subsequently did not
receive. Andrew's unvested LTIP awards will continue with
performance tested at the end of the relevant performance
periods and awards pro-rated to 27 April 2018. Full details of
his remuneration arrangements are set out on pages 64 to 70. 
Alan McWalter, previously Dignity's Senior Independent
Director and Remuneration Committee Chairman also 
stepped down from the Board and the Committee on 
31 January 2018 after nine years of invaluable service to 
the Company. On behalf of the Committee I thank him for 
his hard work and dedication. 
Shareholder engagement
Last year, at the 2017 AGM, we were pleased to receive almost 
94 per cent of votes in favour of the advisory Remuneration
Report vote. On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, 
I would like to thank shareholders for their ongoing support.
The Remuneration Committee actively seeks and welcomes
feedback from the Company’s shareholders. On behalf of the
Committee, I look forward to your feedback and ask for your
support at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Your
feedback will help shape our review of executive remuneration
which we will undertake later this year before our third binding
policy vote in 2019.

REMUNERATION POLICy REPORT
This section of the Directors' Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and sets out the remuneration policy which was approved by
shareholders at the AGM on 9 June 2016. The policy took formal effect from the date of approval and is intended to apply until the
2019 AGM. Please note that some of the information shown has been updated to take account of the fact that the policy is now
approved and enacted rather than proposed. A full version of the original shareholder approved policy can be found in the Annual
Report for the year ended 25 December 2015 available on our website at www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. 
Overview of Remuneration Policy
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will:
• Align rewards with the interests of shareholders;
• Motivate and encourage superior performance;
• Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy; 
• Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management; and
• Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
The table on pages 60 and 61 summarises the main components of Dignity's ongoing remuneration policy. Details of how the
Committee will implement the policy are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64.

Essential to recruit 
and retain executives 
of a high calibre.
Reﬂects an individual's
experience, role and
performance.
Base salary
Salaries are paid monthly. They are normally reviewed annually
and ﬁxed for 12 months commencing 1 January.   
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee takes into account:
• the role, experience, responsibility and performance 
(individual and Group);
• increases applied to the broader workforce; and
• relevant market information for similar roles in broadly 
similar UK listed companies and companies of a similar size.
There is no prescribed maximum.
Generally, the Committee is
guided by average increases
across the workforce. However,
higher increases may be awarded
on occasion, for example, where
an individual is promoted or has
been recruited on a below
market rate , where there have
been changes to individual
responsibilities or in the size 
or complexity of the business 
or where salaries have fallen
signiﬁcantly below mid-market
levels.
Salaries for 2018 are:
CEO: £511,500;
Finance Director: £316,200; and
Corporate Services Director:
£247,950.
The Committee reviews 
the salaries of Executive
Directors each year taking
due account of all the factors
described in how the salary
policy operates.
Beneﬁts
To provide competitive
beneﬁts to help recruit
and retain executives.
Beneﬁts include provision of a company car (or cash allowance in
lieu), fuel, landline telephone and broadband at each Executive
Director’s home residence, mobile phone, family private medical
cover and a pre-arranged funeral plan for the individual or spouse.
Relocation or other related expenses may be oﬀered, as required.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the all-
employee HMRC approved share schemes on the same basis 
as other employees.
Any expenses incurred in carrying out an executive’s duties which
are deemed to be taxable will be reimbursed by the Company
together with any personal tax due.
There is no prescribed maximum
as costs may vary in accordance
with market conditions.
Relocation expenses must be
reasonable and necessary.
HMRC tax-approved limits will
apply to all employee share
schemes.
Not applicable.
Pension
To provide retirement
beneﬁts in line with the
overall Company policy.
The Company operates a deﬁned beneﬁt plan, the Dignity 
Pension and Assurance Scheme, under which selected executives
may accrue beneﬁt. The deﬁned beneﬁt plan is closed to 
new members.
The Company may contribute to selected individuals' personal
pension schemes or is able to make salary supplements in lieu 
of pension contributions. 
Details of the arrangements for the Directors are set out in the
Annual Report on Remuneration.
The accrual rate under the
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is one
eightieth of ﬁnal salary for every
completed year of service.
The Company contribution to
deﬁned contribution plans or
salary supplement in lieu of
pension may be made up to the
value of 15 per cent of salary. 
Not applicable.
To motivate executives
and incentivise the
achievement of annual
ﬁnancial and/or
strategic business
targets. To ensure
further alignment with
shareholders through
the retention of
deferred equity.
Bonus payment is determined by the Committee after the year
end, based on performance against targets set prior to the start 
of the year. Targets are reviewed annually.
Bonuses up to 100 per cent of salary will be payable in cash. Any
bonus earned in excess of 100 per cent of salary will be deferred 
in shares. Deferred shares vest after two years subject to
continued employment but no further performance targets.  
A dividend equivalent provision allows the Committee to pay
dividend equivalents on vested deferred shares (in cash or shares).
This may assume the reinvestment of dividends on a 
cumulative basis. 
Bonus payments, including deferred bonus awards, are subject 
to recovery and withholding provisions in the event of ﬁnancial
misstatement or miscalculation of performance conditions. 
See Note 1.
The maximum award under the
annual bonus scheme is 135 per
cent of salary for the Chief
Executive and 125 per cent of
salary for the other Directors.
Performance metrics are
selected annually based 
on the Group's strategic
objectives. The bonus may 
be based on the achievement
of an appropriate mix of
challenging ﬁnancial, strategic
or personal targets. Measures
and weightings may change
each year to reﬂect any year-
on-year changes to business
priorities.
Financial measures which
account for the majority, if not
all, of the bonus may include
measures such as EBIT (or
other measures of proﬁt) 
or cash ﬂow. 
• For ﬁnancial metrics, a range
of targets may be set by 
the Committee, taking into
account factors such as the
business outlook for the 
year. Nothing is payable 
for performance below a
minimum level of EBIT. 
• Up to 70 per cent of salary 
(or an equivalent proportion
of the ﬁnancial element) 
is payable for meeting a
demanding target with
maximum bonus payable 
for achieving a second, 
more demanding target.
• Bonus is payable on a pro-
rata basis for performance
between the ﬁrst and 
second targets.

Long–Term
Incentive
Plan
Incentivises selected
employees and
Executive Directors 
to achieve successful
execution of business
strategy over the 
longer term.
Provides long-term
retention.
Aligns the interests 
of the Executives and
shareholders through
the requirement to
build up a substantial
shareholding.
Awards are normally granted annually in the form 
of nil cost options or conditional share awards. 
Participation and individual award levels will be
reviewed annually (subject to the individual limit) taking
into account matters such as market practice, overall
remuneration, the performance of the Group and the
Executive being granted the award. 
Awards normally vest after three years subject to the
achievement of stretching performance conditions 
and continued employment.  
Awards are subject to recovery and withholding
provisions in the event of ﬁnancial misstatement or
miscalculation. See Note 1.
Following vesting, Executive Directors will be required
to retain their net of tax vested shares for two years.
A dividend equivalent provision allows the Committee
to pay dividend equivalents, at the Committee's
discretion, on vested shares (in cash or shares) at the
time of vesting and may assume the reinvestment 
of dividends on a cumulative basis.
The maximum annual
award that can be
made to an individual
in any given ﬁnancial
year is 150 per cent 
of salary.
Awards under the LTIP vest subject to the
satisfaction of challenging performance measures
as set from time to time by the Remuneration
Committee. Performance conditions may include
a measure of proﬁtability, such as EPS, and
another measure of long-term success, such 
as TSR.
Performance below the threshold target will result
in zero vesting for each performance measure.  
25 per cent of the award may vest for threshold
performance.
In determining the target range for any ﬁnancial
measures that may apply, the Committee ensures
they are challenging by taking into account current
and anticipated trading conditions, the long-term
business plan and external expectations.
Performance periods will normally start from the
beginning of the ﬁnancial year in which the award
is made.
See Note 3.
Non–Executive
Chairman and
Directors’ fees
To attract and retain a
high quality Chairman
and experienced 
Non-Executive
Directors.
The Board determines the fees of the Non-Executive
Directors. They are based upon recommendations
from the Chairman and Chief Executive (or, in the 
case of the Chairman, based on recommendations
from the Remuneration Committee and the 
Chief Executive). 
Both the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors
are paid annual fees and do not participate in any
incentive plans or receive pension or other beneﬁts. 
The Chairman receives a single fee covering all his
duties. The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee
and additional fees payable for chairing the Audit and
Remuneration Committees and for performing the
Senior Independent Director role.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors shall be
entitled to have reimbursed all expenses that they
reasonably incur in the performance of their duties,
including those expenses that have been deemed 
to be taxable beneﬁts by HMRC. This includes any
personal tax that may become due.
The level of fees of the Non-Executive Directors reﬂects
the time commitment and responsibility of their
respective roles. Their fees are reviewed from time to
time against broadly similar UK listed companies and
companies of a similar size. 
In exceptional circumstances, additional fees may 
be payable to reﬂect a substantial increase in time
commitment of the Non-Executive Chairman 
and Directors.
There is no prescribed
maximum, however,
any increase to fees
will be considered in
light of the expected
time commitment in
performing the roles,
increases received by
the wider workforce
and market rates 
in comparable
companies.
Neither the Non-Executive Chairman nor the
Non-Executive Directors are eligible for any
performance related remuneration.
Share
ownership
guidelines
To align the interests 
of management and
shareholders and
promote a long-term
approach to
performance.
Executive Directors are required to build and 
maintain a holding of shares to the value of at least
200 per cent of base salary. This will be achieved by
setting a speciﬁc number of shares required to be held
by each Executive Director based on their 2016 salary
and the 28 day average share price to 25 February
2016. This resulted in the following required holdings
of Ordinary Shares.
Mike McCollum 43,709 Ordinary Shares.
Andrew Davies 27,880 Ordinary Shares.
Richard Portman 21,135 Ordinary Shares.
Steve Whittern 26,981 Ordinary Shares.
Until the guideline is met, the executive is required 
to retain 50 per cent of shares acquired under the
Company’s share plans (after allowing for tax and
national insurance liabilities).
Not applicable. Not applicable.
Notes 
1. Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and LTIP in the event of a restatement of the
accounts or an error in calculation leading to an over-payment. Payments may be recovered for up to two years after payment/vesting or two external audit cycles. The amount to be
recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including through the reduction 
of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or LTIP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.
2. Annual bonus metrics will be determined at the start of each year, based on the Group's priorities for the coming year.  Measures may include profit (such as operating profit, PBT or EPS)
which is one of the key financial measures of growth.
3. LTIP performance metrics will be determined at the time of grant and based on the Group's long-term strategy. Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the
business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders. The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver
of shareholder value.
4. The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. The Committee considers the general basic salary
increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors. An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group
and all permanent employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme. Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay
than for other employees. This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the
Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Group value creation.

Bonus Plan and LTIP discretions
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing
Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary. The Committee,
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include (but are not limited to) the following (albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table on page 61):
• Who participates in the plans;
• The timing of grant of award and/or payment;
• The size of an award and/or a payment;
• Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
• Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan
and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special
dividends); and 
• The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst
being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments
entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company
performance. The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors for 2018 vary under three
performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.
Notes 
• Minimum comprises fixed pay, which includes 2018 basic salary, the value of benefits in 2017 and a 15 per cent company pension contribution.
• On-target comprises fixed pay and assumes a bonus of 20 per cent of maximum is paid and 50 per cent of the LTIP vests.
• Maximum comprises fixed pay and assumes full bonus payment and LTIP vesting (based on the same number of awards as last year and an assumed share price on grant of 825 pence).
• No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.
Recruitment and Promotion policy
The remuneration package for a new director will be established in accordance with the Company's approved policy subject to such
modifications as are set out below.
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the
experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary
initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance
and development in the role. Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses
provided for if necessary. A pension contribution or cash in lieu of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided.

The structure of variable pay elements will be in accordance with the Company's approved policy detailed above. The maximum
variable pay opportunity will be as set out in the remuneration policy table, being 150 per cent of salary under the annual bonus plan
and awards with a face value of 150 per cent of salary under the LTIP .  Different performance measures may be set initially for the
annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that 
he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer), this may be provided, taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value 
(i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited.  Replacement share awards, if used,
may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of
these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules. The aim of any such award would be to ensure that as 
far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the amount forfeited.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their 
notice period. Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months' 
notice of termination of employment is required by either party. Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company's
registered office.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual re-
appointment at the AGM. Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice. The appointment letters for the Chairman
and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting each year. Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's
registered office. 
For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a
Director’s contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the
fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax. 
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious
breach of contract. No payment or compensation beyond salary (and the value of holiday entitlement) accrued up to the date of
termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control. The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments
beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
External directorships
The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can
retain the fees earned.
Treatment of incentives
At the discretion of the Committee, for certain good leaver circumstances (such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy,
retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she
works being sold out of the Company's group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee), a pro-rata bonus 
may become payable at the normal payment date for the period of employment and based on full year performance. Should 
the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
The treatment of share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules. 
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment. However, an executive will be treated as 
a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company
ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's
group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee. Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, if treated as a good
leaver, awards will normally vest on the original vesting date and will not normally be subject to a pro-rata reduction (unless the
Committee determines otherwise). Under the LTIP , if treated as a good leaver, awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to
the extent to which performance targets have been achieved. The number of LTIP awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata 
to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.

How shareholder views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes 
are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with
major shareholders in advance. The Remuneration Committee adopted such an approach in putting together the current policy 
by consulting the Company's largest shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies beforehand.
In addition, the Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from
shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration. However, when setting the remuneration policy
for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below (together with the Remuneration Committee Chairman's Annual Statement) will
be put to a single advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. The information below includes how we intend to operate our policy 
in 2018 and the pay outcomes in respect of the 2017 financial year. The information from the single total remuneration figures for
Directors on page 66 to the end of the section on loss of office payments on page 69 has been audited. The remainder is unaudited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018
Salaries
The Committee has determined that the Executive Directors will not receive an increase to base salary for 2018. This is against a
broadly two per cent average increase received by other employees across the workforce. 
Therefore, the proposed salaries as at 1 January 2018 are:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2018                                2017                          Increase

The fees for 2018 are as detailed below. The basic fee for serving as Non-Executive Director and the Supplementary Senior
Independent Director fee have not been increased from those in 2017. The Supplementary Audit Committee Chairman fee and
Supplementary Remuneration Committee Chairman fee have not been increased either:

Pension and Benefits
All Executive Directors will receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of their basic salary. Benefits will be provided
in line with the approved remuneration policy. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 65
Annual bonus
For 2018, the maximum bonus potential shall be 135 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for the other 
Executive Directors.
Following careful consideration, the Committee has decided to add strategic objectives to the EBIT measure this year. Therefore, 
70 per cent of the 2018 bonus will continue to be based on EBIT targets and 30 per cent on strategic objectives which are common 
to all Directors.
Having delivered the market's financial expectation for 2017, the results for 2018 are less certain as we gauge the response to the
January 2018 pricing changes announcement. As a result, the Committee has set a wider EBIT range than in previous years reflecting
this greater uncertainty. The target range is stretching in light of current expectations and a high payout under this part of the bonus
would require exceptional performance. For this year, 20 per cent of the EBIT element will become payable for achieving a demanding
target with full bonus payable for achieving a second, more demanding stretch target. The bonus is payable on a pro-rata basis for
performance between the first and second targets. 
The EBIT targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively. However, full
retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's Remuneration Report. 
The strategic objectives support the Group's strategy and business model as set out on page 14 of the Annual Report.
Any bonus payable in excess of 100 per cent of salary will be deferred in shares. The deferred shares will vest after two years subject 
to continued employment.
Long-term incentives
Last year, in line with our policy, Executive Directors received awards with a face value of 150 per cent of base salary. In determining 
the award level for 2018, the Committee took account of the fall in share price following the January 2018 pricing announcement and
has decided to award the same number of shares as in 2017. Each 2018 award will therefore be over shares with a value at grant 
equal to approximately 50 per cent of salary, a significant reduction to our normal policy.
Our recent practice has been to apply two performance conditions, each applying to half of the award – relative total shareholder
return (TSR) against a pan-sector group of companies and stretching earnings per share (EPS) targets. This balance has served the
Company well. However, the current medium term earnings outlook is uncertain (although we expect greater clarity later this year 
as the response to our pricing strategy changes emerges). Therefore, the Committee did not feel that robust EPS targets could
currently be set.
Instead it is proposed that the whole of the 2018 awards will vest based on absolute TSR. Full vesting will require performance broadly
equivalent to returning the share price to the level it was prior to the 19 January 2018 pricing announcement (1,950 pence, being the
three month average to 18 January 2018). The targets will be as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Absolute TSR                                 Equivalent share

The base price used to calculate TSR will be averaged over the period 19 January 2018 to the dealing day before the date of grant. The estimated TSR targets are based on the
average share price over the period 19 January to 1 March 2018 (the last practicable date before the printing of this report). Because TSR takes account of reinvested dividends, 
the share prices that must be attained will be lower than in the table if dividends are paid. The end averaging period will be the last three months of the 2020 financial year.
Vesting between threshold and maximum is determined on a straight line basis. 
The Committee may adjust vesting downwards if, acting fairly and reasonably, in its view the outcome does not reflect the 
underlying performance of the Company. 
Executive Directors are required to hold the net of tax vested shares for two years following vesting.

(a)
Taxable benefits for the year included: provision of a company car or allowance, fuel, family private medical cover, landline telephone and broadband at each Executive Director’s
home residence and a mobile telephone together with a pre-arranged funeral plan in accordance with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the
Executive Director or his spouse. 
(b)
The pension benefit is set at 15 per cent of basic salary. 
(c)
The bonus relates to performance in the 2016 financial year. The cash element, being 100 per cent of basic salary, of the bonus awarded for performance relating to 2016 was paid
at the end of March 2017. The remainder of the bonus for 2016; 35 per cent of basic salary in respect of Mike McCollum and 25 per cent of basic salary for the remaining Executive
Directors was deferred in shares which have to be held for two years. Whilst the performance criteria for the 2017 bonus were fully achieved no bonuses were paid. 
(d)
The LTIP value relates to the award that was granted 6 March 2015. The performance period for this award ends on 29 December 2017. The value shown is calculated by 
reference to the average share price in the last quarter of the 2017 financial year. The comparative number is the value of the 2014 LTIP that vested in 2016 restated to reflect 
the share price which is now known.
(e)
The other remuneration represents the gain on exercise and disposal of SAYE options granted in 2014.
(f)
Martin Pexton resigned from the Board on 3 February 2017 so his remuneration is to that date. Mary McNamara was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2017 and her
remuneration as Non-Executive Director is from that date.
Determination of 2017 annual bonus outcome 
The target for the 2017 annual bonus was based on the achievement of underlying EBIT targets:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Target                                        Stretch

EBIT 100 102.4 105.0 104.6 95
The strong performance of the Group during 2017 meant that the EBIT target of £102.4 million was exceeded by £2.2 million 
(2.1 per cent) and the outcome was just below the stretch target. This resulted in bonuses of 95 per cent of maximum becoming
payable. However the current Executive Directors have decided to waive their full bonuses for 2017 and no bonuses became
payable. The value of those waived bonuses are shown in the table below. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bonus                                                                                                                  Pay-out                              Bonus

Determination of LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year 
Half of the LTIP awards made in 2015 were subject to a relative TSR condition and half subject to EPS, both measured over the three
year period which ended on 29 December 2017.
TSR condition                                                                                                                                                                                                TSR relative to FTSE 350 companies

Dignity’s TSR over the three year measurement period was minus 4.8 per cent ranking Dignity in 253rd place out of the 319 companies
in the TSR peer group. Underlying EPS increased from 85.8 pence to 128.3 pence, a compound increase of 14 per cent. Consequently
50 per cent of the 2015 awards are due to vest, subject to continued employment to the vesting date and formal ratification by the
Remuneration Committee at the appropriate time.

The estimated value of the award is based on the average share price over the last quarter of the financial year. The actual value will 
be the value at the vesting date and is likely to be significantly lower.

Half of the 2017 award will vest subject to relative TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 and the other half subject
to EPS growth targets. The performance period for both tranches is measured over the three financial years, 2017-2019.
• TSR – No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting
for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between. For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the
Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
• EPS – No part of this award vests if underlying EPS in 2019 is lower than 136.8 pence, 15 per cent vests for EPS of 136.8 pence, 
50 per cent vests for EPS of 144.0 pence with 100 per cent vesting for EPS of 154.8 pence. Vesting is on a straight line basis for
performance in between these points.
Clawback and malus provisions apply and there is a holding period of two years.

No Director left in the year and no compensation for loss of office was paid. No payments were made to any past Directors. 
Andrew Davies retired from the Board on 5 January 2018 but remains an employee of the Group until 27 April 2018 on the same
salary package as when he was a director. As he was director throughout 2017 he would be eligible to receive the annual bonus for
that year but as set out above no bonus became payable. In addition as he was employed for the full measurement period for the
LTIP options granted in March 2015 which are capable of vesting in March 2018 he will be able to exercise his options in full to the
extent they are capable of being exercised. Thereafter he will be able, under the LTIP Rules, to exercise the options granted in 2016
and 2017, to the extent that are capable of vesting based on performance and on a time apportioned basis. 
No compensation or termination payment has been made or will be made to Andrew Davies. As advised in the Group’s Stock
Exchange announcement, released on 13 December 2017, after he ceases to be an employee he will remain as a consultant to the
Group assisting with the funeral home acquisition programme. He will be paid a fixed fee for this work.

Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The Code requires that the Remuneration Committee comprises a minimum of three non-executives. During 2017 the Committee
was chaired by Alan McWalter and the Committee members in 2017 comprised all the other Non-Executive Directors: Jane Ashcroft,
David Blackwood and Mary McNamara. Martin Pexton resigned from the Board on 3 February 2017 and was replaced by Mary
McNamara on 1 March 2017 who was also appointed to serve on the Remuneration Committee from that date. Alan McWalter
stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2018 and, from that date, was replaced as Committee Chairman by Mary McNamara.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided,
no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business. The 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Group’s bonus or share schemes. 
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms of reference, the framework and policy 
of Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration and its cost to the Group. The Committee considers the performance of the
Executive Directors as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and share awards to the Board for 
final approval. 
The Committee met four times during the year. At those meetings the basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers
were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were awards
granted under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). The meetings approved the payment of the 2016 performance related
bonus and dealt with the vesting of the shares awarded in 2014 under the LTIP scheme. In addition, the Committee closely
monitored the executive pay environment, governance developments and market practice.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely:
• The Chairman and the Chief Executive who attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required, and the Company
Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, who attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee. No individual takes
part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits. 
• New Bridge Street (NBS) (a trading name of Aon plc) was appointed by the Committee in 2012 to act as the Committee's
independent advisor. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group's Code of Conduct and any advice provided is
governed by that Code. In addition to advice provided to the Committee NBS provides some associated advice, for example, in
relation to legal implementation and Non-Executive Director fees. Other than these services NBS, nor any other Aon plc company,
provide any other services to the Group and the Committee is satisfied that New Bridge Street's advice is objective and
independent. Total fees charged in the period by NBS were £18,133+ VAT and were charged on a time spent basis.

The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated
financial statements for Dignity plc and its subsidiaries for the
52 week period ended 29 December 2017.
The company registration number of Dignity plc is 4569346.
        
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and the parent
company financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including
Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced Disclosure
Framework (‘FRS 101’) (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and
• State whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent Company financial statements
respectively.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Report on Directors’ Remuneration comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s websites and legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on
pages 46 and 47 of the Annual Report, confirm that, to the best
of their knowledge and belief:
• The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit
of the Group; and
• The Strategic Report on pages 4 to 43 of the Annual Report
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• That the consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and profit of the Company and undertakings
included in the consolidation as a whole; 
• That the Annual Report, including the Strategic Report,
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and
undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that they face; and
• Having taken into account all matters considered by the
Board and brought to the attention of the Board during the
year, the Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors
believe that the disclosures set out in this Annual Report
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Principal risks and uncertainties 
Operational risks are considered on pages 34 and 35.
An assessment of the Group’s exposure to financial risks and 
a description of how these risks are managed are included in
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Share capital
During the period, 184,672 Ordinary Shares of 12 48/143
pence each were issued to satisfy Long-Term Incentive Plan
share awards vesting in the period and 9,079 Ordinary Shares
of 12 48/143 pence each were issued to satisfy options
exercised under the 2013 Save As You Earn Scheme which
matured on 1 December 2016.  Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 73
Overview 01 – 03 Strategic Report 04 – 43 Governance  44 – 74 Financial Statements 75 – 129 Other Information 130 – 132
The issued share capital of Dignity plc at 29 December 2017
consisted of 49,931,901 Ordinary Shares of 12 48/143 pence
each. All the Ordinary Shares carry the same rights and
obligations. There are no other class or type of share in issue.
A special resolution passed at the last AGM on 8 June 2017
gives Dignity plc the authority to purchase up to 4,992,553
Ordinary Shares of 12 48/143 pence each at not less than
nominal value and not more than five per cent above the
average middle market quotation for the preceding five
business days. At the same meeting the Company was also
given authority to allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate
nominal value of £4,105,764 of which up to £307,932 may be
for cash. These authorities will expire at the conclusion of the
next AGM on 7 June 2018. It is the intention of the Directors 
to seek renewal of these authorities at that AGM. There are 
no restrictions at the period end on the transfer of securities.
Results
The results for the period are set out in the Consolidated
Income Statement on page 82. The Group’s profit before tax
amounted to £71.2 million (2016: £71.2 million).
Dividends
An interim dividend of 8.64 pence per Ordinary Share was paid
to shareholders on 27 October 2017. The Board has proposed
a final dividend of 15.74 pence (2016: 15.74 pence) per share,
which, subject to approval at the AGM, will be paid on 29 June
2018 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 
18 May 2018.
Employment policies
During the period, the Group has maintained its obligations to
effectively communicate and involve employees in its affairs.
Methods of communication used include an in-house
magazine, team talks, regular bulletins, both national and
regional and management briefings. This is discussed in more
detail in the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on
pages 37 to 43.
Employment policies are designed to provide equal
opportunities irrespective of age, sexuality, colour, ethnic 
or national origin, religion, nationality, sex or marital status. 
Full consideration is given to the employment, training and
career development of disabled persons, subject only to their
aptitudes and abilities. The Group endeavours, as far as is
practicable, to treat disabled persons equally with others and
will also endeavour to help and accommodate persons who
become disabled whilst working for Dignity.
The Directors will be publishing gender pay data on the
corporate website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk during 2018 
in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap)
Regulations 2017 that came into force on 1 October 2016.
Directors and their interests
Details of the Directors of the Company who were in 
office during the period and up to the date of signing the
financial statements are shown in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration on pages 68 and 70. In accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, at the AGM, all Directors will
retire as Directors of the Company and, being eligible, offer
themselves for re-election at the AGM on 7 June 2018. The
Directors have agreed, as in previous years, that they should 
all stand for re-election rather than relying on the Articles of
Association of the Company that prescribe that one third of 
the Directors offer themselves for re-election each year. 
During the period, the Company maintained liability insurance
for its Directors and Officers to a value of £100 million. The
Directors of each of the Company’s subsidiaries have the
benefit of an indemnity provision in the Company’s Articles 
of Association. The indemnity provision, which is a qualifying
third party indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of
the Companies Act 2006, was in force throughout the period
and is currently in force.
Health and safety policy
The Group’s operations are designed at all times in such a way
as to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, the health, safety
and welfare of all of our employees and all other persons who
may be attending our premises. This is discussed in the
Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on page 42.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which we all live
is an important concern for the Group. This is discussed in the
Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on pages 42 and 43
alongside other social and ethical considerations. 
Going concern
The Directors have conducted a rigorous and proportionate
assessment of the Group’s ability to continue in existence 
for the foreseeable future. They receive and review regularly
management accounts, cash balances, forecasts and the
annual budget together with covenant reporting. After careful
consideration, and mindful of the current market conditions,
the Directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue operating for that foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis for preparing the financial statements. The
Directors formally considered this matter at the Board 
meeting held on 9 March 2018.

Financial Statements for further details. Directors’ report continued

Independent Auditors and disclosure of information 
to Auditors
A resolution for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors at the
time when the report is approved, the following applies:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware;
and
• The Directors have taken appropriate steps to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
The Takeover Directive
The Group has one class of voting share capital, Ordinary
Shares. All of the shares rank pari passu. There are no special
control rights in relation to the Group’s shares. The rules
governing the appointment and replacement of Board
members and changes to the Articles of Association accord
with usual English company law provisions. The Board has
authority to purchase its own shares and is seeking renewal 
of that power at the forthcoming AGM within the limits set 
out in the notice of that meeting. There are no significant
agreements to which the Group is party which take effect, alter
or terminate in the event of change of control of the Group.
Corporate Governance Statement
The information that fulfils the requirements of a corporate
governance statement in accordance with rule 7.2 of the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules can be found in this
Directors’ Report and in the Directors’ Statement on Corporate
Governance on pages 49 to 52, which is incorporated 
by reference.
Strategic Report
The Strategic Report on pages 4 to 43 has been approved 
by the Board.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dignity plc
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Dignity plc’s group ﬁnancial statements and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) give a true and
fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 29 December 2017 and of the group’s proﬁt for
the period then ended;
• the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice including FRS 101; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards
the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Dignity plc which comprise:
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial reporting
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial
statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 32 to 36 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the Directors’ conﬁrmation set out on page 36 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks
facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement set out on page 73 in the ﬁnancial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements;
• whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3)
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the Directors’ explanation set out on page 36 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the ﬁnancial
statements of the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)
that we identiﬁed. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters
Audit scope
Materiality
Overview of our audit approach
• Fraud Risk – The risk of inappropriate revenue recognition, speciﬁcally the risk of inappropriate management override 
of the amount of revenue recorded.
• Fraud Risk – Management Override of Internal Controls inherent in those areas where manual journals are posted at head
oﬃce as part of the ﬁnancial statement close process.
• Other Risk – The risk of error in the carrying value of the intangible assets related to Trade Names or Goodwill where we
have addressed the risks connected with the amortisation of Trade Names and potential impairment of Trade Names and
Goodwill which arise following the Group’s announcement in January 2018 of a change in strategy and positioning in order
to protect market share.
• We performed an audit on the consolidated ﬁnancial records of the group to the materiality and performance materiality
described below.
• Overall group materiality of £3.6 million which represents 5% of proﬁt before tax. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 77
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee
Given investor focus on the 
group’s revenue performance 
we consider there to be a risk 
in relation to the manipulation 
by central management of the
amount of revenue recorded.
Management reward and incentive
schemes based on achieving proﬁt
targets may also place pressure 
on management to manipulate
revenue recognition.
Therefore there is a risk that
central management may override
controls to intentionally misstate
revenue transactions through
inappropriate manual journal
entries.
Refer to the Accounting policies 
(pages 86 and 87); and Note 3 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements
(pages 94 and 95).
Based on our procedures we have 
not identiﬁed any evidence of
management override through
inappropriate journal entries in
respect of the amount of revenue
recorded in the period.
Based on the results of the
procedures performed, including
journal entry testing, we have 
not identiﬁed any evidence of
management override through
inappropriate journal entries.
We considered the risks inherent in
those areas where manual journals
are posted at head oﬃce as part 
of the ﬁnancial statement close
process and in particular in respect
of subjective areas which we
considered to be most susceptible
to management override due to 
the degree of estimation involved.
These areas were considered to 
be the bad debt provision,
dilapidations provision and
uninvoiced cost accruals.
• We carried out testing relating to controls over revenue recognition;
• We evaluated the controls in the IT systems that support the recording 
of revenue;
• We performed analytical procedures to compare revenue recognised
with expectations based on past experience, management’s forecasts
and, where possible, external market data in respect of the numbers 
of deaths in the period and obtained corroborative evidence to support
divergences from our expectations;
• We reconciled the aggregate revenue amounts extracted from the sales
invoicing systems to revenue recorded in the general ledger and have
traced material reconciling items that arose therefrom to supporting
documentation; and 
• We tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts, applying
parameters designed to identify entries that were not in accordance 
with our expectations. This included analysing and selecting journals for
testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer 
or being manually posted. We veriﬁed the journals to originating
documentation to conﬁrm that the entries were valid.
The risk of inappropriate revenue recognition (Revenue 2017: £324.0 million, 2016: £313.6 million)
The risk of fraud and management override 
• We performed data analytics to identify journal entries that we believed
to be potentially unusual. We obtained supporting evidence for each of
those journals identiﬁed and veriﬁed the journals to originating
documentation to conﬁrm that the entries were valid; and
• We have performed audit procedures in respect of each of the estimates
listed to identity evidence of management bias. 
That the change in the estimated
useful life of Trade Names is
appropriate and has been accurately
reﬂected and appropriately disclosed
in the ﬁnancial statements.
That the impairment reviews have
been compiled on a reasonable basis,
that the conclusion that there is 
no impairment to be recorded is
reasonable and that the disclosures
made in this respect are appropriate.
We have addressed the risks
connected with the amortisation 
of trade names and potential
impairment of trade names 
and goodwill related to the 
funeral services segment which
arise following the group’s
announcement in January 
2018 of a change in strategy 
and positioning in order to 
protect market share.
The Group’s trade names have 
a carrying value of £151.3 million
(2016: £134.5 million) and are
included within intangible assets.
The Group’s goodwill has a
carrying value of £226.1 million
(2016: £215.9 million). 
Refer to the Accounting policies 
(page 88); and Note 9 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements
(pages 99 and 100).
The risk of error in the carrying value of intangible assets related to trade names and goodwill related to the funeral services segment
We have considered management’s assessment that the useful life of 
Trade Names has moved from indeﬁnite to ﬁnite, with a useful life of 35
years. We have corroborated that the assertions made by management 
to factual events and/or are consistent with the understanding of the
business we have built up through the course of our audit.  
In respect of the Group’s impairment reviews of Trade Names and Goodwill;
• We understood the methodology applied by management in performing 
its impairment test for the trade names and goodwill related to the 
funeral services division. 
• We calculated the degree to which the key inputs and assumptions 
would need to ﬂuctuate before an impairment was triggered and
considered the likelihood of this occurring. We performed our own
sensitivities on the group’s forecasts and determined whether adequate
headroom remained.
• We performed detailed testing to critically assess and corroborate the 
key inputs to the valuations, including:
  – analysing the historical accuracy of budgets to actual results to
determine whether forecast cash ﬂows are reliable based on past
experience;
  – corroborating the discount rate used by benchmarking it against market
data and comparable organisations; and
  – validating the growth rates have been appropriately adjusted to reﬂect 
the change in Group strategy and positioning.
We assessed the disclosures in note 9 against the requirements of IAS 36
Impairment of Assets.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and performance materiality determine our audit scope. Taken
together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The group ﬁnance function operates from
head oﬃce and has common ﬁnancial systems, processes and centralised controls covering all of its operations and individual
locations. The audit of the group is undertaken by one audit team and the group audit has been performed on the consolidated
ﬁnancial records to the materiality and performance materiality described below.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identiﬁed misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the
economic decisions of the users of the ﬁnancial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be £3.6 million (2016: £3.7 million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of proﬁt before tax. 
We believe that proﬁt before tax is the most appropriate measure of the ﬁnancial performance of the group on which to base
audit materiality.
We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone parent company ﬁnancial statements to be £4.6 million (2016: £4.4
million), which is 1% (2016: 1%) of equity. The materiality determined for the standalone parent company ﬁnancial statements
exceeds the Group materiality as it is determined on a different basis given the nature of the operations. For the purposes of the
audit of the group ﬁnancial statements, our procedures, including those on balances in the parent company, are undertaken
with reference to the group materiality and performance materiality set out in this report.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group and parent company’s overall control
environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely 
£2.7 million (2016: £2.8 million) for the group and £3.5 million (2016: £3.3 million) for the parent company. 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identiﬁed misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.2 million
(2016: £0.2 million) for both the group and the parent company, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 74 and 130 to 132,
including the Overview set out on pages 1 to 3, the Strategic Report set out on pages 4 to 43, Governance set out pages 44 to 74
and Other Information set out on pages 130 to 132, other than the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 79
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to speciﬁcally address the following items in the
other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those
items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 72 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual
report and ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary
for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our
knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 53 to 55 – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 44 – the parts of the
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance
Code containing provisions speciﬁed for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements
are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; 
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 72, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
ﬁnancial statements.  
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial
statements due to fraud; to obtain suﬃcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected
fraud identiﬁed during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both
those charged with governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined 
that the most signiﬁcant frameworks which are directly relevant to speciﬁc assertions in the ﬁnancial statements are those 
that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and the
relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. In addition, we concluded that there are
certain signiﬁcant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and regulations relating to occupational
health and safety and data protection. 
• We understood how the group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit and
those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes,
papers provided to the Audit Committee and any correspondence received from regulatory bodies.
• We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s ﬁnancial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might 
occur by meeting with management to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered
performance targets and their inﬂuence on efforts made by management to manage earnings or inﬂuence the perceptions 
of analysts. We considered the programs and controls that the group has established to address risks identiﬁed, or that
otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs and controls. Where the
risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identiﬁed fraud risk. These procedures
included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements were 
free from fraud or error.
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations
identiﬁed in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and
journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management,
internal audit; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 81

Other matters we are required to address
• We were appointed by the company on 8 June 2017 to audit the ﬁnancial statements for the 52 week period ending

The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is four years, covering the
periods ending 26 December 2014 to 29 December 2017.
• The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company 
and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Notes
1. The maintenance and integrity of the Dignity plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditor does not involve consideration of these
matters and accordingly the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented 
on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the ﬁnancial statements may diﬀer from legislation in other jurisdictions. 82 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the financial statements
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
European law requires that the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 are
prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted by the European
Union. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations (as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board) and those parts of the
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In the current period, the Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended
29 December 2017. For the comparative period, the Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the
53 week period ended 30 December 2016.
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and have been prepared under the
historical cost convention.
Preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. This will also affect the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements. The Group financial statements consolidate
the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (including all of its subsidiary entities) after eliminating
internal transactions. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the
acquisition method of accounting. The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary
undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date
of control.

Exceptional items are of a non-recurring nature to the results for the period and are therefore presented separately. In 2016, the
exceptional credit is due to the changes to the headline rate of corporation tax used to evaluate deferred tax.
In arriving at the Group’s underlying measures of profitability certain items are added back: profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets;
external transaction costs; amortisation of acquisition related intangibles; and exceptional items in respect of taxation.
External transaction costs
External transaction costs, associated with completed or aborted transactions, refinancing or return of value to shareholders, are
excluded from underlying profit as they are unconnected with the trading performance in the period and are therefore
presented separately. They relate wholly to external costs incurred by the Group.
Pre-arranged funeral plan trusts
The pre-arranged funeral plan trusts are not consolidated during the period as they are not controlled by the Group. Specifically,
Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (‘Regulated Activities’) Order 2001 (‘RAO’) requires a majority of the
managing trustees to be independent of the Group. Further information can be found in the non consolidation of pre-need
trusts note within critical accounting estimates and judgements below.
Revenue
Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income from
crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Revenues include amounts receivable from the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts for funerals performed by the Group for 
pre-arranged funeral plan members.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied. Costs of
maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
The Group pays certain disbursements (such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees) on behalf of its
clients. These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process. However, these amounts are not included within net
revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 87

1 Accounting policies (continued)
The accounting policies for recognising turnover for pre-arranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group views the United Kingdom as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long-term
characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT.
Pre-arranged funeral plans
Trust plans
The Group markets and sells pre-arranged funeral plans, with monies received from selling funeral plans being held and
controlled by independent pre-arranged funeral plan trusts (the ‘Trusts’). The responsibility for the ultimate performance of
funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan, some of whom are not owned by
the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions:
• A marketing and administration allowance in respect of each plan sold. The marketing element is only refundable in the
event that the plan is subsequently cancelled. A provision is made for cancellations based on historical experiences,
where material, to cover the estimated marketing element refundable to the Trusts. Marketing and administration
allowances are included in Group revenue when the related plan is sold less the provision for refunds arising on
cancellations; and
• Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative
services supplied to the Trusts. These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the pre-arranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group income
statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trust’s deed, which have been
assessed by the Trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities in respect of current
members (‘Recoveries’). All Recoveries are recognised as other income in the period in which the Trustees approve their
payment. The Group has not sought any Recoveries from the Trusts since 2012.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to members of the
Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to third party funeral directors when the funeral is ultimately performed.
All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Trust’s deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the Group when
a pre-arranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a pre-arranged funeral plan that (i) if the
customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all monies paid in respect
thereof (less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing company); (ii) the funeral director’s
services (as selected by the customer) will be provided regardless of price rises in the future; and (iii) for the majority of plans
sold, specific disbursements (such as crematoria fees, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees) will be provided regardless of price rises
in the future.
Insurance plans
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in
consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the plan holder
at a discount to its rates prevailing at the time of death.
A commission is paid to the insurers when the policy is initially charged to the Group. These costs are carried as a prepayment
and charged to the income statement as a funeral is performed, with the cost per funeral estimated based on the total costs
incurred and the expected level of policies where the Group will be involved in the fulfilment of the funeral. This expectation is
reviewed annually.
In the event of the death of the policyholder, if the Group performs the funeral, it receives an agreed amount from the insurers
which is recognised as revenue within the funeral services division. On occasions a third party will perform the funeral and the
Group will pass on all monies received to that party.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share
awards is measured at the date of grant. Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they
consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte
Carlo simulations. The valuations take into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations. 88 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Notes to the financial statements continued
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
1 Accounting policies (continued)
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for
an estimate of the share awards that will eventually not vest. The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at least annually,
with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately. When the options are exercised the Company issues
new shares.
Earnings per Ordinary Share
Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted
average number of shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary activities after
taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by the effects of all dilutive potential
Ordinary Shares (primarily share options). Underlying Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the underlying profit
after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Fair value measurement
Other than in respect of items measured at fair value on acquisition of businesses and in respect of share-based payments, the
Group has no assets or liabilities recognised at fair value. The Group discloses fair values for financial assets and liabilities at
each balance sheet date.
Fair value related disclosures are set out in note 26 in respect of fair values on acquisition of businesses and in note 21 in respect
of financial instruments.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability measured using the assumptions that
market participants would use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for subsidiaries and other businesses over the
fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less provisions for
impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The businesses and subsidiaries acquired
are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition, or the year thereafter and are therefore only
considered to be separate cash-generating units during this time.
Intangible assets – trade names
Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the estimated fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are
carried at historical cost less amortisation and provisions for impairment. When acquired as part of a business combination the
fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by virtue of the trade name being
well-established.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to write-off the asset on a straight line basis over the term of its
useful life.
During the period, the Group reconsidered the indefinite life assumed for its trade names. Given the increasingly price
competitive market and its impact on the business, the Group has concluded that an indefinite life is no longer appropriate.
The estimate was updated in 2017 to a useful life of 35 years, applicable from 1 October 2017. This resulted in an amortisation
charge of £1.1 million in the period.
Intangible assets – non-compete contracts
Non-compete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at their fair value, which is calculated as the present
value of any consideration paid discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straight line basis.
Intangible assets – software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible
asset. Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the
specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development of computer systems (including websites) is
recognised if, and only if, the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products,
controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years) using the straight line method. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 89

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Investment in financial assets
Investments in financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value with movements
recognised through other comprehensive income unless there is objective evidence of impairment in which case the movement
will be recognised through the income statement.
Intangible assets – use of third party brand name
The Group has a marketing agreement with Age UK Enterprises Limited, giving rights to market pre-arranged funeral plans
under the Age UK brand. The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over 20 years on a straight line basis, recognising that each year’s additional marketing activity
generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following 20 years.
Intangible assets – other
As part of the Crematoria Acquisition in 2016, the Group acquired interests in two crematoria subject to finite periods of
operation (by way of lease and/ or service concession). The fair value of these interests has been identified and recognised as a
separate intangible asset. The value of each interest will be amortised over the remaining period of operation.
Property, plant and equipment
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost
includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and condition.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost of assets to their residual value (excluding freehold land and assets in the
course of construction), over their expected useful lives using the straight line method. The bases and annual depreciation rates
in use for the various classes of assets are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings                                                                                                                                                       2% – 10% 
Short leasehold buildings                                                                                                                                                               Over term of lease
Motor vehicles                                                                                                                                                                                                 11% – 20%
Computers                                                                                                                                                                                                                    20% 
Other plant and equipment                                                                                                                                                                           5% – 33% 
Fixtures and fittings                                                                                                                                                                                                    15%
Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an indefinite life. Where the historical cost of land and buildings
cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third (based on historical data) of
the original cost of acquiring the land and buildings. This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Group’s trading premises and cremator re-linings are depreciated over the remaining life of the related
asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator re-lining, whichever is sooner. Asset lives and residual
values for each class of asset are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Assets in the course of construction are shown as work in progress at a value equal to costs incurred to date. Once completed,
they are reclassified and depreciated using the Group’s depreciation policy above.
Borrowing costs
If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends over a long period, the interest incurred on borrowed capital
up to the date of completion is capitalised as part of cost of construction as permitted by IAS 23 (Borrowing Costs).
Repairs and renewals
All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases
When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the Group, the
assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included as an obligation
under finance leases. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned assets.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements such that the interest element is charged to the
income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are ‘operating leases’ and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis.
Profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within
profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets in the income statement. 90 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Notes to the financial statements continued
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods where events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that have an indefinite useful life
(e.g. goodwill) which are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. For goodwill this is considered at a business segment level as
that is the level at which the return on assets acquired is monitored. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to
sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cash-generating unit are
estimated, based on latest management expectations for the following year and an annual growth rate in subsequent years.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the
particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset. Any impairment in the value of an asset below its
carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the
income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories
Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable
value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge represents
the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making adjustments to
estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the temporary difference
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to
generate a net asset or liability if the conditions of IAS 12 are met.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deductible
temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Pensions
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated
annually by independent actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
obligation. 
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or
credited to retained earnings in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, where it is
probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions (other than deferred tax) are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to the
undiscounted value. The unwinding of discounts is included within finance costs.
Employee share trust
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that Dignity plc
has de facto control. At the balance sheet date, the trust’s assets and liabilities recognised in the Group’s balance sheet within
share capital and reserves were nil (2016: nil).
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in
which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when paid. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 91

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments
Borrowings
All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs and subsequently at
amortised cost. The transaction costs, interest payable and premium on debt finance are charged/credited to the income
statement, as finance costs/income, on a constant-yield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it
is more likely than not that the lender will require earlier repayment, using the effective interest method.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A provision for
impairment is established based on historical experience. When a trade receivable is not collectable it is written-off against the
allowance account. Subsequent recovery of amounts previously written-off are credited against administrative expenses in the
income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits and amounts included in accounts restricted for
specific uses.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and
judgements in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial
statements are detailed below:
Provision for doubtful trade receivables
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired. Within each division, assessment is
made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the type of
services provided. The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if
appropriate. See note 21(c) for further details.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to
estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial assumptions include discount rates,
assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect
the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The
Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the inflation rate. See note 28 for further details.
Intangible assets – trade names
During the period, the Group reconsidered the indefinite life assumed for its trade names. Given the increasingly price
competitive market and its impact on the business, the Group has concluded that an indefinite life is no longer appropriate.
The estimate was updated in 2017 to a useful life of 35 years, applicable from 1 October 2017. This resulted in an amortisation
charge of £1.1 million in the period.
Funeral services goodwill impairment assessment
Performing the annual impairment assessment for goodwill requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating
units to which the goodwill has been allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires the use of estimates including those in
respect of future cash flows, growth rates and an appropriate discount rate. See note 9 for further details.
Critical accounting judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and
judgements in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The key judgements affecting the financial statements are
detailed below:
Non consolidation of pre-need trusts
The Group markets and sells pre-arranged funeral plans, with monies received from selling funeral plans being held by
independent pre-arranged funeral plan trusts. These Trusts are not consolidated by the Group, on the basis they do not control
them. The principle of non-consolidation was established many years ago, and therefore the Directors consider annually whether
there have been any changes to terms and conditions, or accounting standards that would change this determination. IFRS 10,
consolidated financial statements, was considered by the Group in 2015 with specific reference to the non-consolidation of the
pre-need trust. 92 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Notes to the financial statements continued
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
For new trusts acquired in the period, the Directors consider the terms and conditions to determine whether non-consolidation
is appropriate.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2017
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year that have a material impact
on the Group.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been 
early adopted 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted:
IAS 7, Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 7, effective 1 January 2017 and will therefore impact on the Group’s 2018
annual report disclosures. This standard requires disclosure so as to help users of financial statements better understand
change in an entities debt. The impact of the Standard is currently being assessed however, we do not expect any material
changes in disclosure.
IAS 12, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – Amendments to IAS 12, effective 1 January 2017 and will
therefore impact on the Group’s 2018 Annual Report. 
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers, effective 1 January 2018 and will therefore impact the Group’s 2019 financial
results. This standard establishes a new five step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measure and recognise revenue. The impact of this standard is
currently being assessed. 
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will
therefore impact the Group’s 2019 financial results. The impact of this standard is currently being assessed however, it is not
expected to have a material impact on the Group due to the nature of the Group’s financial instruments. 
IFRS 10 consideration
Power over the investee. Power arises when the investor
has existing rights that gives them the ability to direct the
relevant activities of the investee, being those activities
which influence the returns achieved by the investee.
The investor is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the
investee.
The investor has the ability to use its power
over the investee to affect the amount of the
investor’s returns.
Analysis
Dignity has no voting rights over the Trusts or any rights to 
direct the activities of the Trusts. Whilst Dignity has the power 
to appoint or remove trustees, legislation requires the majority
of trustees to be independent of Dignity.
Whilst Dignity controls the charge levied to the Trusts for the
provision of funeral services, it does not have the power to direct
the investment decisions of the Trusts. 
Dignity receives an allowance for the marketing of the plans and
for the performance of a funeral. From time to time Dignity may
receive a surplus from the Trusts.
Ultimately Dignity’s return is wholly dependent on the
investment performance of the Trusts. 
A majority of the Trustees are required, by legislation, to be
independent of Dignity and therefore Dignity does not, and
cannot, control the actions of the Trustees.
The investment strategy is set, implemented and monitored by
the Trustees. Consequently, Dignity does not have the power to
affect the amount of its returns.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 10 built on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor on whether an entity should
be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. In order to have control, IFRS 10 requires a
parent company to have power over the investee, an exposure to variable returns because of its involvement in the investee
and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns.  Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 93

1 Accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 16, Leases. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will therefore impact
the Group’s 2020 financial results. Under the standard a lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. Approximately
50 per cent of the Group’s properties are on lease terms that are currently accounted for as an operating lease but which will
result in the recognition of both an asset and a liability under the new standard. As the notes to the consolidated accounts
demonstrate, the Group has total minimum future lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of approximately
£213 million. Whilst the net present value of this commitment will be less than this amount, the grossing up of the Group’s
balance sheet that will be required to reflect this new standard will be material and will also impact on the Group’s reported
profit after tax. The Group will be assessing this in due course, but notes that the accounting standard does not affect the cash
flows or underlying economics of the business. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on
the Group.
2 Financial risk management 
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds, Secured Notes and bank borrowings. This approach seeks
to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value through efficient leveraging of the Group’s balance sheet,
which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash-generative nature of the business.
It is not the Group’s policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk 
Interest rate risk and other price risk
The Group’s main borrowings consist of Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a predetermined repayment
profile. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and yield spreads based on the market’s
current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes. Consequently, the fair value of these instruments will fluctuate. Fair values
are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding strategy and repay the Secured Notes early.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions with a long-term rating of at least BBB by Standard & Poor’s
and BBB+ by Fitch. These balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate. If interest rates reduced by one
per cent at the beginning of 2017 then the Group would receive £0.1 million less interest income on an annualised basis for each
£10.0 million held.
None of the Group’s other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group. However, this risk is minimised as much as possible through
well-established credit control procedures. Quantitative disclosures regarding the ageing of these receivables are included in
note 21(c).
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities and
regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances. In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its secured
borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5 times in respect of the securitisation
group. This ratio was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid. This
covenant test has been satisfied on each quarterly testing date in the period. At 29 December 2017 the actual ratio was
3.24 times (2016: 3.37 times). 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide returns for shareholders and repay holders of Secured Notes. It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an
optimal capital structure. The Group’s capital comprises equity and net debt as set out in note 24. The Group’s principal source 
of long-term debt financing is the Secured Notes, rated A and BBB respectively by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.
The Group monitors its capital structure based on the ratio of gross debt, as summarised in note 24, to underlying earnings
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. 
In order to achieve these objectives, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants for the Secured Notes under the terms of the Group’s secured borrowings
(see ‘Liquidity risk’ above). 94 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

3 Revenue and segmental analysis
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker
who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decision
maker of the Group has been identified as the four Executive Directors. The Group has three reporting segments, funeral
services, crematoria and pre-arranged funeral plans. The Group also reports central overheads, which comprise unallocated
central expenses.
Funeral services relate to the provision of funerals and ancillary items, such as memorials and floral tributes.
Crematoria services relate to cremation services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the Dignity operated crematoria
and cemeteries.
Pre-arranged funeral plans represent the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make their own funeral
arrangements and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Group’s net assets and liabilities are located in, the
United Kingdom and Channel Islands and relates to services provided. Overseas transactions are not material.
Underlying operating profit is stated before profit or loss on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs, amortisation of
acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation (collectively ‘Non-underlying items’). Underlying
operating profit is included as it is felt that adjusting operating profit for these items provides a useful indication of the Group’s
performance. Underlying measures are those used in the day to day management of the business. 
The revenue and operating profit/ (loss), by segment, was as follows:

Under IFRS the tax rate is lower than (2016: lower) than the standard UK tax rate of 19.25 per cent (2016: 20.0 per cent)
principally due to the adjustments in respect of the prior period offset by non-deductible expenses (2016: exceptional
adjustment). See Financial Review for further details. The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20 per cent to
19 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017. The Group’s underlying profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate
of 17.7 per cent (2016: 21.0 per cent). The current period effective tax rate is impacted by prior year taxation items of £2.0 million
which are not expected to recur. The Group continues to expect its effective tax rate to be approximately one per cent above the
headline rate of corporation tax. This translates to an effective rate for 2018 and 2019 of 20.0 per cent and 18.5 per cent in 2020.
The Group does not have any provisions for uncertain tax positions. 
In the prior period, legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 18 per cent to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020 was
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and so the deferred tax balance was calculated at the rates at which it is
expected to be incurred. As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax credit of £1.8 million through its income statement
and a debit of £0.3 million through other comprehensive income to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Group’s
deferred tax position.  98 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

The interim dividend represents the interim dividend that was approved and paid in the period out of earnings generated in the
same period. 
The final dividend represents the final dividend that was approved and paid in the period relating to the earnings generated in
the previous period.
Consequently, total dividends recognised in the period were £12.2 million, 24.38 pence per share (2016: £11.0 million,
22.16 pence per share).
A final dividend of 15.74 pence per share, in respect of 2017, has been proposed by the Board. Based on the number of shares in
issue at the date of signing this report the total final dividend payment is approximately £7.9 million. This will be paid on 29 June
2018 provided that approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 7 June 2018 and will be paid to
shareholders on the register at close of business on 18 May 2018. 
8 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit attributable to equity shareholders for the
relevant period. 
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume
conversion of any dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees under the
Group’s SAYE Scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the Group’s LTIP Schemes. At the balance sheet date, the
performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes are assessed, as required by IAS 33, and to the extent
that the performance criteria have been met those contingently issuable shares are included within the diluted EPS calculations. 
The Group’s underlying measures of profitability exclude profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs,
amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation. These items have been adjusted for
in determining underlying measures of profitability as these underlying measures are those used in the day to day management
of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods. 
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a
useful indicator of financial performance. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 99

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets (continued)
Impairment tests for goodwill and trade names
As described in note 1, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. For the
purpose of this impairment test goodwill is tested at a business segment level as this is the level at which the return on assets
acquired, including goodwill, is monitored.
The segmental allocation of goodwill is shown below:

The recoverable amount of each segment is based on a value-in-use calculation. 
The value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based upon the latest annual budget approved by the Board. Key
assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates (based on historical death rates supplied by
ONS), anticipated market share, mix and pricing (based on actual experience and reflecting the announcements made by the
Group in January 2018). Cash flows for all segments beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using a growth rate of
2.25 per cent (2016: 2.25 per cent), being an estimate of long-term growth rates for impairment review purposes only. The cash
flows for each segment are discounted at a pre-tax rate of 8.5 per cent (2016: 6.0 per cent). 
In respect of goodwill other than in respect of the funeral services division the directors do not consider that a reasonably
possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the value-in-use of the segment would result in any impairment of
goodwill. The headroom for the funeral services division impairment test under the current assumptions used is £123 million.
The discount rate would need to rise to 10.3 per cent, or the long-term growth rate would need to fall to 0.41 per cent for the
impairment test to result in £nil headroom for this segment. 
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment (2016: £nil). 
In addition to the Group’s annual goodwill impairment test, given that the Group has updated its accounting estimate during the
period, such that the useful economic life assigned to trade name intangible assets is now a 35 year life, an impairment test is
required in respect of these assets in the current year in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. The performance of this
impairment test, which was based on the same cash flow projections and key assumptions as the goodwill impairment test set
out above, indicated that no impairment arose in respect of any of the Group’s trade name intangible assets.  Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 101

(a) Prepayments
This balance represents the amounts paid to acquire the long leasehold interest in land at certain of the Group’s properties.
Management consider that leases greater than 50 years at inception are long leases. The balance is expensed on a straight line
basis over the term of the relevant lease. The leases expire at various times over the next 30 to 125 years.
(b) Deferred commissions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in
consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the plan holder
at a discount to its rates prevailing at the time of death. 
(c) Investment in financial asset
During the period, the Group invested £1 million in a non-controlling interest in a business.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and
unrelated. Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for
doubtful recoverables. For further details of the trade receivables past due and impaired refer to note 21(c).
Due to the short-term nature of these balances, the carrying value is considered to be their fair value. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 103

Amounts set aside for debt service payments
This amount was transferred to restricted bank accounts which could only be used for the payment of the interest and principal
on the Secured Notes, the repayment of liabilities due on the Group’s commitment fees due on its undrawn borrowing facilities
(see note 21(d)) and for no other purpose. Consequently, this amount did not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents in
IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows. This amount was used to pay these respective parties on 3 January 2018. Of this amount,
£0.3 million (2016: £0.3 million) is shown within the Statement of Cash Flows as ‘Payments to restricted bank accounts for finance
costs’ and £nil million (2016: £nil million) is shown within ‘Financing activities’ as ‘Payments to restricted bank accounts for
repayment of borrowings’.

(a) Dilapidations
The provision for dilapidations covers the costs of repair to leased premises occupied by the Group in respect of which a
dilapidations notification has been received, and properties where a dilapidation obligation exists but for which no notification
has been received. 
It is anticipated that the element of provision relating to dilapidation notices served, £1.2 million (2016: £1.2 million), will be
incurred in the following financial year, and the element relating to dilapidation obligations where no notice has been served will
be utilised over the terms of the relevant property leases, the majority of which is expected to be by 31 December 2026.
(b) Onerous contracts
The Group has provided for the discounted future costs of certain contracts to which the Group is legally bound. These contracts
relate to vacant leasehold properties and other contracts from which no economic benefit is derived. The provision will be
utilised over the term of the contracts and it is anticipated that it will be fully utilised by 2034. 106 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

All of the deferred tax assets were available for offset against deferred tax liabilities and hence the net deferred tax provision at
29 December 2017 was £30.3 million (2016: £25.7 million).
Other deferred tax liabilities includes capital gains rolled forward, other deferred tax assets includes option schemes £0.4 million
(2016: £1.3 million) and long service awards £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million). 
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable/recoverable within one year. However, the Directors consider that it is
not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the
whole balance as due after more than one year.   Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 107

Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash flows at relevant interest rates.
Trade receivables are held net of provision for impairment. 
Fair value estimation 
IFRS 13 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
All assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost with the exception of the investment in the financial asset explained further in
note 11.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

The Crematoria Acquisition Facility and Secured Notes are held at amortised cost. Other categories of financial instruments
include trade receivables and trade payables, however there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these
items.
The fair values of the Secured Notes are their market value at the balance sheet date and are considered to be level 1. 
The fair value of the Crematoria Acquisition Facility is considered to be nominal value, given the nature of the loan and the
source of the cash flows support its repayment and is considered to be level 3. 108 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

In addition to the above:
(a)  Financial liabilities include finance lease payables of £0.6 million (2016: £0.7 million), which represent the present value of
future minimum lease payments. At 29 December 2017 there is no difference between the nominal value, book value and
fair value of this liability; and
(b) Financial assets include £1 million in respect of assets held at fair value. The underlying investment is accounted for as an
asset held for sale in accordance with IAS 39 and has been initially measured at the fair value of consideration paid with
subsequent measurement based upon a level 3 fair value estimate. At 29 December 2017 there is no difference between
the nominal value, book value and fair value of this asset.
(b) Maturity of financial liabilities 
The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables
are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest costs yet to be incurred.

(c) Trade receivables 
As at 29 December 2017, £13.0 million of the individual gross trade receivables (2016: £12.7 million) were past due and partially
impaired. A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. The amount of the provision, as at
29 December 2017, was £6.2 million (2016: £6.2 million). The individually impaired receivables principally relate to monies owing
for funerals performed by the funeral services division. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

Notes to the financial statements continued
for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017
21 Financial instruments (continued)
£55.0 million (2016: £55.0 million) of the undrawn facilities available to the Group is a liquidity facility relating to the Class A and 
B Secured Notes. This facility may only be used to repay interest and principal on the Secured Notes in the event of insufficient
cash to service these instruments. The facility is subject to annual renewal. However, if the bank providing the facility does not
renew it, then the provider is required to place £55 million (2016: £55.0 million) in a bank account, which the Group may access
as if it represented a borrowing facility on the same terms. The facility is available on these terms until the Secured Notes have
been repaid in full. 
In the prior period, £26.2 million related to a Funeral Acquisition Facility provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland. It was a
committed facility, capable of being drawn until March 2017. 
During the period, the Group completed a refinancing of its Crematoria Acquisition Facility and undrawn Funeral Acquisition
Facility. These facilities have been replaced with a £50 million Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’), provided by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, which is secured against certain trade and assets held by legal entities outside of the Group’s securitisation structure.
The facility is available until July 2021, with the option to renew, subject to the bank’s consent at the time, by a further year.
The margin on the facility ranges from 150 to 225 basis points depending on the resulting gross leverage. This facility remains
undrawn at the balance sheet date. Further details may be found in the Financial Review. 
The remaining £5.0 million facility expires in October 2019. These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.

In addition to the above, the consolidated balance sheet also includes finance lease obligations which totalled £0.6 million
(2016: £0.7 million). These amounts do not represent sources of funding for the Group and are therefore excluded from the
calculation of net debt. 
The Group’s primary financial covenant in respect of the Secured Notes requires EBITDA to total debt service (‘EBITDA DSCR’), in
the securitisation group, to be at least 1.5 times. At 29 December 2017, the actual ratio was 3.24 times (2016: 3.37 times). 
These ratios are calculated for EBITDA and total debt service on a 12 month rolling basis and reported quarterly. In addition, both
terms are specifically defined in the legal agreement relating to the Secured Notes. As such, they cannot be accurately calculated
from the contents of this report. 112 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

The residual excess of the consideration paid over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible. This goodwill represents future benefits to the Group in terms of revenue, market share and delivering the
Group’s strategy. 
The fair values ascribed reflect provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2018. These fair values reflect the recognition of
trade names and associated deferred taxation, and adjustments to reflect the fair value of other working capital items such as
receivables, inventories and accruals which are immaterial.
Each acquisition made followed the Group’s strategy to acquire such locations that will help the Group grow and create value
for shareholders.
All acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method. None were individually material and consequently have
been aggregated. The aggregated impact of the acquisitions on the Income Statement for the period is not material. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 113

The above sensitivity analysis has been determined by applying the results of a fully accurate sensitivity analysis as at 6 April
2017 to the value placed on the Scheme liabilities as at 29 December 2017, assuming that the proportionate impact of the
change in assumptions would be the same. It does not, therefore, allow for the impact of plan experience since 6 April 2017,
although these would not be material. The same methodology was used for the sensitivity analysis undertaken for the period
ending 30 December 2016.

Scheme characteristic
The scheme is a final salary defined benefit scheme which was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2013 and ceased future
accrual to all members except those in the LGPS sections on 28 February 2017. It is administered by trustees in accordance with
its Trust Deed & Rules and relevant legislation. Member contributions are fixed with the employer meeting the balance of the
costs of providing scheme benefits. The contributions payable by the employer are set by the Trustees after consulting the
employer and in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pensions Act 2004. 
Funding arrangements
The Trustees use the Projected Unit funding method. The last full triennial actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 6 April 2014.
At the time of approval of the financial statements, the deficit reduction repayment plan for the anticipated deficit on the April
2017 triennial valuation has not been agreed with the Trustees of the scheme. 116 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

The scheme’s investment strategy is to de-risk the assets relative to the liabilities over time using a dynamic trigger based 
de-risking framework. The approach taken relates the asset allocation to the Scheme’s funding position on a low-risk 
“self-sufficiency” basis. The principles are to target to achieve full funding on the self-sufficiency basis by 2036; to reduce funding
level volatility by reducing un-hedged exposures (including the use of liability driven investments); and to monitor the progress in
the funding level and to capture improvements by opportunistically de-risking when circumstances permit. The latter is achieved
by switching investments from growth assets to matching assets as the funding level improves. It is recognised that although
investing partly in growth assets is necessary to meet the return expectations in pursuit of funding level improvements, this
increases the risk of a shortfall in returns relative to that required to cover the scheme’s liabilities.
Investment return risk 
If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions may be required at
subsequent valuations.
Investment match risk 
The scheme invests significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to the returns on bonds. If equities
fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk 
If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for scheme funding then additional contributions may be
required.
29 Pre-arranged funeral plans 
(a) Contingent liabilities and commitments
Dignity Pre-arrangement Limited, Dignity Securities Limited and Advance Planning Limited are fellow members of the Dignity
Group in the United Kingdom. These companies have sold pre-arranged funeral plans to their clients in the past. All monies from
these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the Dignity Limited Trust Fund
and the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans respectively (the ‘Principal Trusts’). Further details of the transactions can be found in the
financial statements of these companies, which are available from 4 King Edwards Court, King Edwards Square, Sutton Coldfield,
West Midlands, B73 6AP .
The Group has given commitments to these clients to perform their funeral. The agreed amounts payable to either the Group 
or to third party funeral directors will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts. The majority of the Trustees of each of the 
pre-arranged funeral plan trusts are unconnected to the Group, as required by current UK legislation. The investment strategy
is set, implemented and monitored by the Trustees.
It is the view of the Directors that none of the commitments given to these clients, which are explained further below, are
onerous to the Group. However ultimately, the Group is obligated to perform these funerals in exchange for the assets of the
Trust, whatever they may be. 
Similar commitments have arisen following acquisitions of businesses, since 2013, which have sold pre-arranged funeral plans
through similar trust based structures (the ‘Recent Trusts’). Only the National Funeral Trust and the Trust for Age UK Funeral
Plans receive funds relating to the sale of new plans (the ‘Active Trusts’).
(b) Pre-arranged funeral plan trust assets 
As noted above, the Group has given commitments to perform the funerals covered by the pre-arranged plans, regardless of
whether or not the Trusts have available assets to fund the funeral. The Group, therefore, has a potential exposure in the form of
a reduced fee should the Trusts investment strategy, over which it has no control, fail to deliver an appropriate return or result in
a fall in underlying asset values, or if the cost of delivery for a funeral increases at rates in excess of investment returns. Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  | 117

29 Pre-arranged funeral plans (continued) 
The Trustees have informed the Group that they continue to take independent advice regarding the Trust’s investment strategy.
As a result, it is anticipated that the investment allocation by class will develop further during 2018 and beyond, gradually
resulting in a portfolio in the following profile:
                                                                                                                                                                                     Example investment types                                                                           Target (%)

These developments in the Trust’s investment strategy are expected to enhance investment returns in the longer-term for a
broadly similar level of risk as that currently taken. The strategy will, however, potentially result in greater volatility year on year in
the reported value of the Trust’s assets. 
The Trustees have advised that the market value of the assets of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts were approximately
£940 million at 29 December 2017 (2016: £863.9 million) in respect of 306,000 (2016: 299,000) active pre-arranged funeral 
plans. 102,000 (2016: 68,000) of the remaining active pre-arranged funeral plans related to those backed by Insurance Plans, 
as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, with the balance of 42,000 (2016: 37,000) being plans arising
from acquisitions.
The Trustees of the Principal Trusts are required to have the Trusts’ liabilities actuarially valued once a year (once every three
years in the case of the Recent Trusts). This actuarial valuation is of liabilities of the Trusts to secure funerals through Dignity 
and other third party funeral directors and does not, in respect of those funerals delivered by the Group represent the cost of
delivery of the funeral. It is only in the event that there are insufficient funds within the Trusts to cover the cost of delivery to
Dignity that the commitment would become onerous to Dignity as described in (a) above. 
The Trustees have advised that the latest actuarial valuations of the Principal Trusts were performed as at 29 September 2017
(2016: 23 September 2016) using assumptions determined by the Trustees. Actuarial liabilities in respect of the pre-arranged
funeral plan trusts have increased to £877.2 million as at 29 September 2017 (2016: £839.7 million). The corresponding market
value of the assets of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts was £904.5 million (2016: £831.5 million) as at the same date.
Consequently the actuarial valuations recorded a total surplus of £27.3 million at 29 September 2017 (2016: deficit of
£8.2 million). The Group considers these to be prudent assumptions. If the valuation had been performed using a discount rate
equal to the long-term investment strategy target of the Trustees of inflation plus 2 per cent, then the valuations would have
reported an aggregate surplus of approximately £160 million.
Nonetheless, the Trustees have advised that the Trusts hold assets of approximately £3,100 (2016: £2,900) per active plan at the
balance sheet date. On average the Group received approximately £2,600 (2016: £2,500) in the period for the performance of
each funeral (including amounts to cover disbursements such as crematoria fees, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees).
The Trustees have advised that the Recent Trusts have approximately £17 million (2016: £19 million) of assets as at the balance
sheet date and no material actuarial surplus or deficit.
Transactions with the Group 
During the period, the Group entered into transactions with the National Funeral Trust, the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans and
the Dignity Limited Trust Fund (the ‘Principal Trusts’) and the Trusts related to businesses acquired since 2013 (‘Recent Trusts’)
(and collectively, the ‘Trusts’) associated with the pre-arranged funeral plan businesses. The nature of the relationship with the
Trusts is set out above and in the accounting policies. Amounts may only be paid out of the Trusts in accordance with the
relevant Trust Deeds.
Transactions principally comprise:
• The recovery of marketing and administration allowances in relation to plans sold net of cancellations (which are recognised by
the Group as revenue within the pre-arranged funeral plan division at the time of the sale); and
• Receipts from the Trusts in respect of funerals provided (which are recognised by the Group as revenue within the funeral
division when the funeral is performed).
Transactions also include: 
• Receipts from the Trusts in respect of cancellations by existing members;
• Reimbursement by the Trusts of expenses paid by the Group on behalf of the respective Trusts; and
• The payment of realised surpluses generated by the Trust funds as and when the Trustees sanction such payments. 118 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Bonus waiver
The Group’s 2017 financial performance was sufficiently strong to justify an award to Executive Directors of 95 per cent of
the maximum amount possible of their annual bonus opportunity. However, in light of the significant reduction in financial
expectations for 2018 following the trading update in January 2018, the Executive Directors have decided to voluntarily waive
their entitlement in full. These amounts were accrued in 2017 and will be released in 2018. 120 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

C1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable or at the end of the first full financial year following the recognition. Any
impairment in the value of fixed assets below depreciated historical cost is charged to the income statement within operating
profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates two employee share schemes: The Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) and Long-Term Incentive Plan
Scheme (‘LTIP’).
The Company applies IFRS 2 in respect of share option schemes resulting in the charge for such schemes being recognised in 
a subsidiary of the Company. The Company’s financial statements reflect the cost of the scheme as an increase in the cost of
investment in the subsidiary with the corresponding credit included within other reserves.
Employee share trust 
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that Dignity plc
has de facto control. In accordance with IFRS, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the transaction, the trust’s assets
and liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet. 
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in
which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when paid.
Financial instruments 
Borrowings
All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost in relation to amounts owed to
group undertakings. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs. 
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand includes demand deposits and amounts included in accounts restricted for specific uses.

Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report and the Dignity plc investor website may 
contain certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with respect to Dignity
plc (“Company”) and the Group’s ﬁnancial condition, results of its
operations and business, and certain plans, strategy, objectives, 
goals and expectations with respect to these items and the
economies and markets in which the Group operates.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, 
identiﬁed by their use of a date in the future or such words as
‘anticipates’, ‘aims’, ‘due’, ‘could’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘expects’,
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘targets’, ‘goal’ or ‘estimates’ or, in each 
case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance. By their very nature forward-looking statements are
inherently unpredictable, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that 
will occur in the future. Many of these assumptions, risks and
uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the Group’s ability 
to control or estimate precisely. There are a number of such factors
that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially
from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in
the economies and markets in which the Group operates; changes 
in the legal, regulatory and competition frameworks in which the
Group operates; changes in the markets from which the Group raises
ﬁnance; the impact of legal or other proceedings against or which
affect the Group; changes in accounting practices and interpretation
of accounting standards under IFRS, and changes in interest and
exchange rates.
Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or 
the Dignity plc investor website, or made subsequently, which are
attributable to the Company or any other member of the Group, or
persons acting on their behalf, are expressly qualiﬁed in their entirety
by the factors referred to in this statement. Each forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date it is made. Except as required 
by its legal or statutory obligations, the Company does not intend 
to update any forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this Annual Report or on the Dignity plc investor website
should be construed as a proﬁt forecast or an invitation to deal in 
the securities of the Company. We are Dignity
