CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
On behalf of the Board I am very  
pleased to report excellent progress in 
pursuit of our ambition to become a 
leading global retailer of musical 
instruments and equipment.
When writing this statement last year,  
our revenue growth expectation for the 
year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth 
we actually achieved reflects the huge 
effort made by our staff right across the 
business, from the Board of Directors 
and senior management, through to our 
customer service and warehouse teams.
International growth of 124% has been 
particularly pleasing, and this is an area  
in which we will continue to invest 
significant effort and resource to improve 
and increase our global reach, building 
on the early success of our recently 
launched Swedish and German 
distribution operations.
Notwithstanding the investment 
necessary for our next phase of 
expansion, the Board remains focused 
on delivering profitable growth, and  
as such is pleased to announce an 
operating profit of £2.6m which is a 
£1.7m (+192%) improvement on FY16’s 
underlying operating profit (adjusted  
to remove one-off IPO costs). This 
translates into net profit of £2.3m  
and earnings per share of 11.5 pence.
In many ways, this has been a 
transformational year for the business, 
and to effectively manage further  
growth and operational complexities  
the Group formed an Operational  
Board on 1 March 2017 to support and 
complement the plc Board, comprising  
a wide breadth and depth of operational 
and commercial experience.
To ensure we remain positioned for 
further growth, the Group requires 
additional head office capacity, and  
the Board is delighted to announce a 
property acquisition that provides an 
excellent long-term solution to our 
growth needs in our home city of York.
In 2012, private equity firm Key Capital 
Partners invested into the business,  
and in October 2016 sold its final 
shareholding. On behalf of the Board  
I would like to thank them and Peter 
Armitage, who represented Key Capital 
on our Board, for their efforts and 
support over the last four years. I’m also 
delighted to welcome new institutions 
and individuals onto our share register as 
we embark on the next chapter in the 
Gear4music growth story.
Given the investments scheduled for  
the current year to support continued 
growth, the Board has decided not to 
declare a dividend for FY17, but will again 
review its dividend policy in the next 
financial year.
Finally, I would like to again express my 
sincere thanks and appreciation to the 
extended Gear4music team for their 
commitment and hard work. It is their 
passion and knowledge that provides 
such a strong proposition for our 
customers and has helped to make our 
second year as a public company such  
a success.
Ken Ford
Chairman and Non-Executive Director
4 July 2017
It has been an excellent 
year with significant 
progress in many areas. 
We are delivering on 
our strategic priorities 
and are confident in the 
outlook for the Group.

MARKET 
OVERVIEW
The top ten European retail markets 
for musical instruments and music 
equipment are worth a combined 
£4.3 billion and are undergoing a 
shift to online. An estimated 
£178 million (24%) of the UK 
market is already online.
Market overview
Global
In December 2016 Music Trades 
estimated the global music products 
market in 2015 to be $16.2bn.
European
The top ten European retail markets 
for musical instruments and music 
equipment (including the UK) are 
estimated to be worth approximately 
£4.3bn, and are undergoing a profound 
shift towards online retail.
The largest retailer serving the European 
musical instruments and equipment 
market is Thomann.de based in 
Germany, with a 2016 reported turnover 
of approximately £589m. Other 
competitors in the European market 
include Musicstore.de (Germany), 
4Sound (Sweden), Bax Shop 
(Netherlands) and Woodbrass (France).
UK
The UK musical instruments and music 
equipment market is highly fragmented 
with no dominant retailer, presenting a 
consolidation opportunity. The top six 
companies account for an estimated 
22% of the UK market, with a long tail 
of small independent shops, pure play 
online retailers, general merchandisers 
and department stores.
The Board believes that the current 
dynamics of the UK competitive 
landscape presents an opportunity  
for continued organic growth. Whilst 
acquisitions do not form a core part of 
the current strategy, opportunities are 
reviewed on an ad hoc basis. 0.0

typically the end-users of our products.  
In addition, the Group supplies schools 
and other educational establishments, with 
Gear4music being the preferred supplier 
of the Crescent Purchasing Consortium, 
which specialises in educational sales  
and service.

339,800 are active customers (being 
customers who have purchased from 
Gear4music during the last 12 months). 
As the Group rapidly increased its 
European business it acquired 288,900 
new customers (FY16: 190,000), and 
80,600 customers came back to us to 
place at least one follow-up order. 
Average order value in FY17 was £124,

MODEL

quality music gear more accessible

in Europe. A bespoke e-commerce platform allows us to efficiently 
operate 19 websites, and as we develop this platform further, widen 
our product ranges and increase our marketing reach and brand 
recognition, we strongly believe we can continue to grow our share 
of the £4.3bn European market and expand our reach beyond this.

Our strategic priorities Overview Progress Achievements
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
We continue to develop and improve our customer proposition in each of the 
territories we operate. We’ll achieve this by localising our websites to drive traffic 
and improve conversion, expanding our multilingual customer service and 
marketing teams and, where the business case supports it, by opening small 
distribution centres to improve delivery options and cut delivery times.
We have launched our European distribution network with the opening of distribution centres in Sweden and 
Germany to improve our local customer proposition in terms of delivery timescales and costs, and to enable 
local buying in Swedish Krona and Euros.
We have enabled delivery to another 150 countries to identify potential opportunities to increase our international 
presence outside of Europe. Once opportunities have been identified and validated, market-specific websites will 
be launched.
 – 124% growth in international revenue to £21.3m
 – Opened two distribution centres
 – Launched international shipping
ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT  
OF THE BESPOKE E-COMMERCE 
PLATFORM
Our websites are driven by a bespoke and proprietary e-commerce platform, 
designed to maximise opportunities and deliver competitive advantage. It has the 
capacity to handle significantly increased volumes, and the capability to expand 
into new markets.
The acquisition of our software development team completed on 1 January 2017. Bringing software development 
in-house helps deliver the future cost-effective investment in platform development required to grow revenues 
and profitability. Investment enables us to respond to changing customer behaviours and expectations, by 
rapidly developing new features and functionality to drive website traffic, increase conversion rates and maximise 
operational efficiencies and reliability.
Examples of new features deployed during FY17 include the integration of multiple hubs to automatically  
select the most appropriate dispatch location, international ‘click & collect’, shopping basket and checkout 
enhancements, mobile website improvements and website cloudification. 
Our objective is continual innovation and to scale our systems to ensure our growth is underpinned by a robust, 
class-leading e-commerce platform, and we have a pipeline of new features and upgrades to deploy during the 
next 12 months.
 – Acquired software development team on 
1 January 2017
 – Team comprises 29 full-time software 
developers
 – Invested £1.5m in FY17
 – Launched new features around European 
configuration, mobile improvements and 
checkout and delivery enhancements
INTELLIGENT MARKETING
We will continue to invest in international marketing initiatives, extending our 
reach and penetration into existing and new international territories. New website 
content is constantly being added, including broadcast-quality product 
demonstration videos created in Gear4music’s in-house studio facilities.
We will leverage the email subscriber base though email re-marketing and 
content personalisation, to enhance customer retention and increase the repeat 
purchase rate.
Our marketing strategy continues to prove effective, with a 25% increase in website visitors, conversion rates 
improving by 47 bps, and 39% more repeat customers.
A digital personalisation platform has been deployed and will continue to be developed and refined in FY18 to 
ensure customers receive relevant information and offers through all communication channels. A database of 
over 650,000 subscribers currently receive regular email promotions.
Our return on investment in marketing continues to improve, with spend as a proportion of revenue falling from 
10.0% in FY15, to 8.7% in FY16, to 8.3% in FY17.
 – 12.6 million website visitors (FY16: 10.1 million)
 – 2.75% conversion rate (FY16: 2.28%)
 – 340,000 active customers (FY16: 226,000)
SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT
We will continue to extend the number of products available to our customers, 
including those for next-day delivery, and to continue the expansion of our 
own-brand product ranges with new and exclusive products.
We will widen our supply chain reach to include purchasing inventory in different 
countries and currencies, whilst at the same time consolidating where possible 
and dealing directly with factories and manufacturers.
At 28 February 2017 we listed more than 37,000 products, up 37% since IPO, and there are opportunities to 
increase this significantly.
Own-brand products are an important part of our business and the range increased from 1,600 SKUs last year 
to over 2,400, and revenue increased by 58% during the year to £14.5m.
Our Swedish showroom opened in May 2017 to serve the local market and is already helping secure new 
procurement opportunities, including our recent appointment as the Scandinavian distributor for Behringer, 
one of the world’s largest music equipment brands. We expect to open our German showroom in Autumn 2017.
 – 37,100 SKUs listed from over 710 brands

CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
I am delighted to report 
on a year that saw 
record sales and profits 
whilst continuing to 
invest in the key 
strategic areas that 
further improve our 
customer proposition.
Andrew Wass
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
When we joined AIM in June 2015, we 
were very confident that, with continued 
targeted investment of the funds from 
our IPO, we could build on the £24m 
revenues we had achieved in FY15, by 
improving our customer proposition 
through strategic investment into staff, 
systems, inventory and marketing, and 
expanding our presence in Europe.  
I am thrilled that we have surpassed 
those expectations, having more than 
doubled our revenues to £56m, whilst 
increasing profitability to an all-time high.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
Our Swedish and German distribution centres are 
scaling well and will be well positioned to support 
the business in the busier second half of FY18.
Andrew Wass
Chief Executive Officer
Investing for the future
Our recent focus has been on improving 
our customer proposition alongside 
removing the next layer of barriers to 
growth, by ensuring our operational 
facilities and systems can support our 
medium and long-term ambitions.
Office space
Our staff are central to our success, and 
in order to build our teams and support 
the expansion of the business, we have 
an immediate requirement for additional 
UK office space. As such we are very 
pleased to announce the £5.3m freehold 
acquisition of a 50,000 square foot 
property at Holgate Park in York, which 
will become our long-term UK 
headquarters. The new site will provide 
the flexibility and capacity we require for 
ongoing growth, whilst causing minimal 
upheaval for existing staff. 
The acquisition will be 100% debt funded 
with new debt facilities, providing 
significant cost savings when compared 
with leasing an equivalent building (should 
one have been available), and allowing for 
further expansion as required. To ease the 
transitional impact as we grow into the 
property, we have agreed a short-term 
lease-back arrangement with the vendor 
CPPGroup Plc for half of the building and 
the Board expects this will cover our 
interest costs for the first 12 months 
following completion on 30 June 2017.
The estimated financial impact has been 
considered in more detail in the Financial 
review on page 21.
Distribution expansion
Vacating our current office will increase 
our space for UK warehousing-related 
activities, enabling the business to 
continue to extract good value from  
the existing site until the lease expires  
in June 2020.
A core part of our growth strategy has 
been to invest in expanding our presence 
and further enhancing the customer 
service proposition in Europe. Having 
delivered 124% growth in European 
revenues during the year, now 
representing 38% of the Group’s revenue, 
we remain committed to continued 
investment, thereby underlining our 
confidence in the region’s long-term 
strategic value to the Group in helping us 
to build scale and shareholder value.
Our Swedish distribution centre became 
operational in November 2016, and I am 
pleased to report is performing well. We 
have successfully reduced our delivery 
timescales across Scandinavia, and 
reduced our courier costs across a wide 
range of products, improving the overall 
customer offer. Our German distribution 
centre began dispatching orders at the 
end of February 2017, and will be scaled 
up throughout the year to enhance our 
proposition across central Europe, whilst 
providing additional distribution capacity.
Showrooms
On 8 May 2017 we opened a showroom 
attached to our Swedish distribution 
centre, and in addition to serving the 
local Stockholm market, it is already 
helping us to secure new procurement 
opportunities. For example, we have 
recently been appointed as the 
Scandinavian distributor for Behringer, 
one of the world’s largest music 
equipment brands. We expect to open 
our German showroom by Autumn 2017.
Systems development
The acquisition of our software 
development team completed on 
1 January 2017, and is already allowing  
us to achieve more, react faster to 
developing trends, and further scale  
our systems to ensure our growth is 
underpinned by a robust, class-leading 
e-commerce platform. 
Examples of new features deployed 
during FY17 include the integration of 
multiple hubs across many countries  
to automatically select the most 
appropriate dispatch location, 
international ‘click & collect’, shopping 
basket and checkout enhancements, 
mobile website improvements, and 
website cloudification. Our objective is 
continual innovation, and we have a 
pipeline of new features and upgrades  
to deploy during the next 12 months.

Supporting and accelerating our

integrated software team allows us to be 
more agile, reacting faster to business 
and customer needs. 18

International expansion
In addition to launching our European 
distribution network, we have enabled 
delivery to another 150 countries during 
the last year, and whilst at the early stages 
of development, it is clear our business 
model is relevant to customers all around 
the world. As the year progresses we will 
develop our worldwide proposition, and 
increase our international presence 
wherever there is an opportunity.
Product range extension
Own-brand products continue to be a 
key component of our success, and I am 
extremely pleased with the progress we 
have made, adding new products and 
building on existing ranges to increase 
our own-brand revenue by 58% during 
the year to £14.5m.
Across all our ranges we currently list 
more than 37,000 products, up 37% 
since IPO, but we still see opportunities 
to grow this significantly, and will achieve 
this by further expanding our team of 
specialist buyers.
Intelligent marketing
With in excess of 12 million website 
visitors, conversion rates improving  
by 47 bps, active customer numbers 
increasing to more than 339,000, and 
39% more repeat customers than a year 
earlier, our marketing strategy has been 
highly effective. 
However, there is much more to achieve, 
and our focus for the year ahead will be 
on improving our social media activities, 
particularly on mobile, and delivering a 
more personalised experience for our 
existing customers and website visitors.
Current trading and outlook
We have a strong record of targeted 
investment driving growth and 
shareholder returns. Our momentum 
across the Group, but particularly in 
Europe, gives us the confidence to 
accelerate investment in infrastructure in 
order to scale up further. The associated 
investment of c.£1 million will mean 
profitability will be more H2 weighted for 
the current year. The business continues 
to trade in line with our expectations,  
and our current investment strategy 
reinforces the confidence we have in  
our prospects for this year and beyond.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
The response to the Group’s placing in May 
2017 was extremely pleasing and I believe 
raising £4.2m reflects well on our progress  
to date and prospects.

New head office
Our staff are central to our success and 
UK office space was close to becoming

long term requirements.

FINANCIAL 
REVIEW
Overview
The Group has delivered another strong financial performance, 
with underlying operating profit of £2.62m being £1.72m ahead 
of FY16. Profit growth has been achieved while the Group has 
continued to invest in people and operations, including the 
part-year cost of the Swedish and German distribution centres 
that are expected to generate tangible returns from the second 
half of this year.
Revenue
FY17
£000
FY16
£000
Change
%
UK revenue 34,865 26,016 34%
International revenue 21,263 9,473 124%
Revenue 56,128 35,489 58%
Revenue increased by £20.6m (58%) on FY16, building on 
growth of 46% and 37% in the previous two years. Revenue 
growth was 73% in the first half of the year and 50% in the 
second half when growth began to be measured against H2 
FY16 revenue growth, by which time the IPO-growth capital 
deployed in the business was having a positive impact. As such 
the Board also monitors two-year revenue growth and going 
forward will report on this metric. Revenue growth from FY15 to 
FY17 was 132%, compared to 100% between FY14 and FY16.
Growth in the well-established UK market continues to be 
strong at 34% (FY16: 39%) but was out-stripped by international 
growth which increased 124% and accounted for 38% of Group 
revenues compared to 27% in FY16 and 23% in FY15. In FY17 the 
Group began shipping outside of Europe as part of our plans to 
identify potential areas of new opportunity, with these revenues 
accounting for less than 0.5% of total revenue.
The UK’s EU Referendum vote and subsequent weakening of 
Sterling created currency-related revenue and margin 
opportunities as our products became cheaper in Europe, 
although our European revenue had already grown at 138% 
over the first four months of FY17 that preceded the vote.

Other-brand product revenue 39,351 24,842 58%
Own-brand product revenue 14,449 9,164 58%
Other revenue 2,328 1,483 57%
Revenue 56,128 35,489 58%
We are particularly pleased with the progress made in our 
own-brand business. Sourcing own-brand products takes time 
and the opportunity was highlighted as a medium-term 
aspiration upon IPO, so it is reassuring to see revenue growth 
catch up and match the growth in other-branded product 
revenue. Own-brand revenue growth has increased from 27% 
in FY15, to 33% in FY16, and 58% this year, and the proportion of 
revenue that came from own-brand products in FY17 was flat at 
25.7% (FY16: 25.8%).
Other revenue comprises carriage income, warranty revenue 
and commissions earned on facilitating point-of-sales credit for 
retail customers.

FY16 
£000
Change 
%
Gross profit 15,145 9,186 +65%
Gross margin 27.0% 25.9% +1.1ppts
The strong revenue performance contributed to a £6.0m gross 
profit increase on last year, with the gross margin improving 
from 25.9% to 27.0%, buoyed by improved own-brand product 
revenue growth and exchange rate fluctuations creating pricing 
and margin opportunities.
Some product-intake prices increased during FY17 due to the 
weakening of Sterling relative to the US Dollar. However, strong 
revenue growth enables further negotiations with suppliers and 
the leveraging of economies of scale to reduce the impact. 
Other-branded products are predominantly purchased in Sterling 
and are therefore less affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Local distribution centres will reduce delivery costs to 
customers in those home countries and adjacent territories, 
although reinvestment in our customer proposition will mean 
these savings will be largely passed on to the customer.

Recurring administrative expenses increased 51% compared to 
the 58% increase in revenue as the Group invested in European 
distribution centres and its people. These investments are 
central to delivering the Group’s strategy and critical to medium 
and long-term prospects. As referred to in the Chief Executive’s  21
Strategic 
Report
Corporate 
Governance
Financial 
Statements
statement, there will be an initial ‘overhead investment’ phase 
involving upfront additional costs being incurred that take time 
to generate added value. These costs will be evident in H1 FY18.
Marketing costs in FY17 increased 51% on FY16 to £4.66m (FY16: 
£3.08m), compared with the 58% increase in revenue. This 
includes investment into European markets to build brand 
recognition where the return is lower than in the UK. Marketing 
expenses as a percentage of revenue reduced from 8.7% to 8.3%. 
In FY17 labour costs increased 55% to £4.29m (FY16: £2.77m), 
as headcount increased to support current and future growth, 
with investment across the central functions, in Europe and in 
senior management appointments. Total labour costs as a 
percentage of revenue reduced from 7.8% to 7.6% and this will 
increase in H1 FY18 based on current labour cost run rates.
The European distribution centres incurred £0.48m of costs 
expensed as they became operational part-way through the 
year and began to scale up. The full-year cost effect of these 
investments and associated benefits will be evident in FY18.
FY17 underlying EBITDA of £3.62m equates to 6.4% of total 
revenue, compared to 4.7% last year. Exceptional administrative 
expenses of £606,000 in FY16 related to costs incurred in relation 
to the IPO, and as such did not repeat in FY17.
Financial expenses in FY16 included £233,000 of interest on 
private-equity loan notes that were settled in full on IPO in  
June 2015.
Reported profit before tax improved from break-even last year 
to a £2.64m profit this year, which translates into an EPS of 11.5 
pence (diluted EPS of 11.4 pence).
Cash flow and net debt
The cash flow statement for the financial year reflects the Group 
continuing to deploy the growth capital raised on IPO to 
generate returns by investing in stock and the e-commerce 
platform to improve the customer proposition and drive revenue.

Closing cash 3,001 3,548
The business generated a good level of trading cash in the year 
and actively invested in working capital. Stock increased by £4.8m 
(69%) to fuel revenue growth and leverage buying economies of 
scale, whilst continuing to take all available supplier early-payment 
discounts. This was partly funded by a £2.5m increase in stock-
loans and a £933,000 increase in trade payables.
Net cash from investing activities includes a £1.48m investment 
in the Group’s software platform and £711,000 of capital 
expenditure on warehouse assets and improvements, mainly  
in Europe. No finance leases were drawn against any of this 
expenditure, and £194,000 finance lease capital was repaid. 
Cash from financing activities includes a £1.9m net increase  
in stock finance drawn against own-brand stock.
Balance sheet and net assets
The Group had a strong year-end balance sheet, with net assets 
of £11.7m (FY16: £9.4m), and £3.0m cash (FY16: £3.5m).

The investment in the software platform in the year was £1.48m 
(FY16: £0.93m) to further develop functionality and resilience. 
This takes total cumulative spend on the platform to the end of 
the year to £4.8m.
The Group had net cash (being cash less bank debt and finance 
lease liabilities) of £0.36m compared to £2.59m at last financial 
year end, as the business invested in stock and fixed assets.
Non-adjusting event after the reporting period
On 8 May 2017 the Group exchanged contracts to acquire the 
freehold of a 50,000 square foot property at Holgate Park in York, 
with completion agreed for 30 June 2017. The purchase price is 
£5.3m with 70% of the price funded by a mortgage at 2.04% 
above LIBOR on an initial five-year term. A second five-year term 
loan will be drawn for £1.80m at 2.85% above LIBOR.
On 18 May 2017 the Group completed a placing of 610,000 new 
Ordinary shares and issued 100,782 new Ordinary shares 
pursuant to the full and final exercise of a warrant instrument. This 
resulted in gross proceeds of £4,349,000, and net cash into the 
business of £4,178,000. More detail is provided on page 67.
Dividends
The Board remains confident in the cash generative nature of 
the core business, but in light of the debt-financed acquisition 
of the freehold head office premises and other planned 
investments to support future growth, the Board does not 
consider it appropriate to declare a dividend at this time. 
However the Board will review the shareholder distribution 
policy during the financial year ending 28 February 2018.

OUR
PEOPLE
We have a strong, committed, experienced 
management team working alongside 
passionate staff with in-depth knowledge  
of their specialist area of focus.
Our team
As at 28 February 2017 we employed  
259 people across three countries, and 
many of them have first-hand musical 
instrument and equipment knowledge, 
playing in bands and producing their 
own music. Ongoing product training is 
routinely undertaken to ensure staff have 
relevant and up-to-date knowledge to 
enable them to advise customers.
Multilingual support for overseas 
customers in non-English speaking 
countries continues to be a key 
investment focus, and a prerequisite  
for many of the Group’s dealership 
agreements when selling outside the UK.
Operational Board
In many ways, this has been a 
transformational year for the business, and 
to effectively manage further growth and 
operational complexities the Group formed 
an Operational Board on 1 March 2017 to 
support and complement the Plc Board, 
comprising a wide breadth and depth of 
operational and commercial experience.
The Operational Board meets at least 
once each month to analyse and discuss 
operational and commercial matters, 
and to identify any material matters for 
escalation to the Plc Board. Swedish Commercial

RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
The Board recognise that certain risks and 
uncertainties can have significant rewards 
for the prospects of the business, and as 
such require careful identification, 
evaluation and management.
The Board takes overall responsibility  
for risk management, with a focus on 
evaluating the nature and extent of 
significant risks, and formulating 
mitigations around the risks required  
to be taken in order to deliver the 
strategic objectives. 
The Audit Committee has responsibility 
for overseeing the effectiveness of 
appropriate risk management processes 
and internal control systems. More detail 
of these processes is set-out in the 
Corporate Governance section.
Risk Description Mitigation
RAPID GROWTH
The Group’s business has grown rapidly. Operations and practices 
adopted at earlier stages of the Group’s development may be 
inappropriate for a business of an increased size and scale.
The Group may need to expand and enhance its infrastructure 
and technology, and improve its operational and financial systems 
and procedures and controls in order to be able to match its 
anticipated growth. The Group may face challenges in matching 
the pace of its expansion with corresponding improvements and 
enhancements in its systems, controls and procedures. The Group 
will also need to expand, train and manage its growing employee 
base.
As detailed in the Corporate 
Governance section on pages 30 to 33, 
the Executive team and the Board 
actively monitors and responds, so as 
to maintain systems and practices that 
are appropriate for the operations and 
scale of the Group.
The Group has recruited into key 
management positions and on 1 March 
2017 formed an Operational Board to 
support the Plc Board.
The Group has expanded its finance 
function with the addition of two 
management accountants, providing 
greater capacity and better segregation 
of duties, further improving the control 
environment.
The purpose of this section is to focus  
on the principal risks and uncertainties  
to our business model that could impact 
on our achieving our strategic objectives, 
and our future performance. A more 
comprehensive list was published in our 
Admission document that is available on 
our investor website.

Risk Description Mitigation
NEW  
JURISDICTIONS
The Group’s expansion into new jurisdictions may not be 
successful. Further expansion into markets outside the UK  
would expose the Group to a variety of risks, including different 
regulatory requirements, complications with staffing and 
managing foreign operations, variations in consumer behaviour, 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, potential political and 
economic instability, potential difficulties in enforcing contracts 
and intellectual property rights, the potential for higher rates of 
fraud and adverse tax consequences. 
The Directors have limited experience of the legal and regulatory 
regimes of jurisdictions outside the UK and their consequences for 
the Group’s business.
In addition, the Group will likely have to compete in new 
jurisdictions with companies already operating in the relevant 
market, which may understand the local market better than  
the Group. 
To the extent that the Group overestimates the potential of  
a new geographic market, incorrectly judges the timing of the 
development of a new geographic market or fails to anticipate  
the differences between a new geographic market and the UK,  
the Group’s attempt to expand into new geographic markets  
may be unsuccessful.
The Board will routinely direct 
management to seek professional input 
into any such major developments.
Advances into Europe will be in a 
measured and capital-efficient manner.
The Group has set up local subsidiaries 
in Sweden and Germany and recruited 
local management familiar with local 
laws and regulations.
TECHNOLOGICAL 
CHANGES
Unless the Group is able to respond to technological advances, 
e.g. through adapting and optimising Gear4music’s websites, on a 
cost-effective and timely basis, it may not be able to effectively 
build and/or maintain a competitive advantage.
The Group continues to allocate a 
significant ongoing annual software 
development budget, and in FY17 
brought the development team 
in-house to increase control and 
efficiency.
DISTRIBUTION  
CENTRES
In FY16 the Group was reliant on a single distribution centre and 
warehouse. This dependency has been partly mitigated in FY17  
by the Group opening two further distribution centres and 
warehouses, all holding stock for delivery directly to customers.
Any disruption to distribution centres’ efficient operation may 
therefore have an effect on the Group’s business.
Distribution centres may suffer prolonged power or equipment 
failures, failures in its information technology systems or networks 
or damage from fires, floods, other disasters or other unforeseen 
events which may not be covered by or may exceed the Group’s 
insurance coverage. 
The Group now operates from three 
locations.
The Group, in conjunction with its 
insurance broker, ensures sufficient  
and appropriate insurance cover is  
in place. This includes Business 
Interruption cover.
The Group has a formal disaster 
recovery plan in place that details 
actions in specific situations.

Risk Description Mitigation
WAREHOUSING, 
ONWARD 
DISTRIBUTION  
TO CUSTOMERS  
AND LOGISTICS
The supply of product to customers in a timely manner is critical to 
the success of the Group. The Group therefore operates its own 
warehouses, run by senior management that have many years of 
experience in the sector.
Any rapid increase in revenue may require further expansion of 
current warehouse space.
There is a risk that the Group may experience interruptions to the 
operation of these logistics and distribution networks that could 
prevent the timely or proper delivery of products, which could 
damage the Group’s reputation and deter customers, prospective 
customers, suppliers and/or prospective suppliers.
The Group has recently opened two 
more distribution centres with their 
own local logistics relationships, 
thereby reducing the dependency  
on any single site or local network.
There is a continuous monitoring of 
capacity at the warehouses and there  
is a step plan in place that the Board 
believes should allow the Group to fulfil 
an increasing number of orders from 
the existing site.
The Group maintains multiple delivery 
service providers to reduce the 
dependency on any single provider, 
and tracks service level agreements on 
an ongoing basis. This provides system 
flexibility to switch providers within a 
matter of days, if required.
CHANGE TO  
SEARCH ENGINES’ 
ALGORITHMS
Changes to search engines’ algorithms or terms of service could 
cause the Group’s websites to be excluded from or ranked lower 
in natural search results. 
Search engines frequently modify their algorithms and ranking 
criteria to prevent their natural listings from being manipulated, 
which could impair the Group’s ‘Search Engine Optimisation’ 
(‘SEO’) activities. If the Group is unable to recognise and adapt 
quickly to such modifications in search engine algorithms, the 
Group could suffer a significant decrease in traffic and revenue.
The Group will continue to operate 
SEO activities that adhere to search 
engine guidelines.
DATA SECURITY  
AND IT RELIABILITY
The Group relies heavily on its IT infrastructure and e-commerce 
system, and in particular its websites. If any one or more of its 
websites were to fail or be damaged this could impact the Group’s 
ability to trade.
If the Group’s IT and data security systems do not function 
properly there could be website slowdown or unavailability, loss of 
data, a failure by the Group to protect the confidential information 
of its customers from security breaches, delays in transaction 
processing and the inability to accept and fulfil customer orders 
which could affect the Group’s business.
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk  
by investing significant sums in IT 
infrastructure, including robust back-up 
systems, and in March 2017 moved the 
platform into the cloud.
The Group has a disaster recovery plan 
in place, which has been designed to 
minimise the impact of data loss or 
corruption from hardware failure, 
human error, hacking or malware.
Brand and proposition
MARKET 
RECOGNITION
Developing and maintaining the reputation of, and value 
associated with, the Group’s brands is of central importance to the 
success of the Group. Brand identity is a critical factor in retaining 
existing and attracting new customers. The Group is reliant on its 
natural search result rankings and paid advertising as it seeks to 
build market share and attract new customers. 
Any failure by the Group to offer high-quality products across a 
range of instruments, manufacturers and price points, excellent 
customer service and efficient and reliable delivery could damage 
its reputation and brands, and could result in the loss of customer 
confidence and a reduction in purchases.
Unfavourable publicity concerning the Group could also damage 
the Group’s brands and its business. If the Group fails to maintain 
its brands or if excessive expenses are incurred in this effort, the 
Group’s business may be affected.
Rigorous monitoring of customer 
feedback helps ensure issues are 
identified and rectified on a  
timely basis.
Own-brand products are carefully 
selected and rigorously tested prior to 
initial order.
Head of Marketing has been appointed 
to oversee and better coordinate all 
marketing activities.
COMPETITION IN ITS 
TARGET MARKETS
The UK and European retail market for musical instruments and 
music equipment is competitive. A number of competitors may 
have financial resources greater than those of the Group.
Both Amazon and eBay sell musical instruments and music 
equipment.
The Group has a track record of 
successfully competing on a wide range 
of factors, including quality and range of 
products, price, product availability, 
product information, convenience, 
delivery options and service.

Risk Description Mitigation
SUPPLY AND SALE OF 
THIRD-PARTY 
BRANDED PRODUCTS
The Group purchases products from a number of large global 
musical instrument and music equipment brand owners, and the 
Group’s business depends on its ability to source a range of 
products from well-recognised brands on commercially 
reasonable terms. 
The relationships between the Group and the third-party brand 
owners are generally based on annual contracts that the Group 
seeks to renew each year. The third-party brand owners may 
cease selling products to the Group on terms acceptable to it, fail 
to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner, 
terminate their relationship with the Group and enter into 
agreements with the Group’s competitors, or experience raw 
material or labour shortages or increases in raw material or labour 
costs. Any disruption to the availability or supply of products to the 
Group or any deterioration to the terms on which products are 
supplied to the Group could affect its business.
Whilst sales of third-party branded 
products accounted for approximately 
70% of the Group’s turnover in FY17 
(FY16: 71%), the Directors do not 
consider that the Group is significantly 
reliant on any one or more major 
brand/brand owner.
The Directors believe that the relative 
size of the Group, its purchase volumes 
and the strength of its relationship  
with the brand owners, built over a 
prolonged period in many cases, make 
it unlikely that any such arrangements 
would be terminated.
RELIANCE ON  
SUB-CONTRACT 
MANUFACTURERS
The Group sub-contracts manufacture of its own-brand musical 
instruments and equipment to independent third-party businesses 
in South-East Asia. Any disruption to supply or issues such as  
poor product quality could have an adverse impact on the  
Group’s reputation.
The impact of any issues arising with sub-contractors’ products is 
exacerbated by the lead times involved (12–14 weeks).
The Group has been successfully 
importing for over 14 years and  
has relationships with over 30 
manufacturers providing  
resourcing options.
The Board believes that the Group has 
established robust take-on and ongoing 
monitoring procedures, covering areas 
such as quality control and delivery 
performance, for new and existing 
sub-contract manufacturers that the 
Group seeks to adhere to rigidly.
DEPENDENCE ON  
KEY PERSONNEL
The loss of any key individual or the inability to attract appropriate 
personnel could impact upon the Group’s future performance. 
Should the Group fail to retain or attract suitably qualified and 
experienced personnel, it may not be able to compete successfully.
The Board has recruited into key 
management positions and on 1 March 
2017 appointed three further Directors 
to Gear4music Limited and formed an 
Operational Board. 
The senior management team is 
compensated through a combination 
of market-rate salary and longer-term 
share-based incentives to align key 
people’s remuneration with the 
continued success of the Group.

CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
The UK Corporate Governance 
Code
Whilst the Group is listed on AIM, it is not 
required to adopt the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the 
Code’). The Board, however, recognises 
the value and importance of high 
standards of corporate governance, and 
has adopted many aspects of the Code 
so far as the Board considers them 
appropriate and practical for a group  
of Gear4music’s size.
The Board of Directors and 
Committees of the Board of 
Directors
The Board, which is headed by the 
Chairman, comprises five Directors of 
which three are Executive and two are 
Non-Executive, providing a broad range 
of relevant skills and experiences. The 
Board considers Ken Ford and Dean 
Murray to be ‘independent’ Non-
Executives under the criteria identified  
in the Code. Directors’ profiles are 
detailed on pages 34 and 35. 
The Board met regularly throughout  
the year, with ad hoc meetings held 
when required.
The role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide 
leadership to the Group and to ensure 
the obligations of being a public 
company are adhered to. The Board 
bears collective responsibility for 
delivering ongoing success through the 
development of appropriate strategies 
that are aligned to the Group’s objectives, 
and deliverable with due consideration 
of risk and the resources available. The 
Board is also responsible for ensuring 
that a framework of effective controls  
is in place.
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer is clearly defined. The Chairman is 
responsible for ensuring the effectiveness 
of the Board and setting its agenda. The 
Chairman has no involvement in the 
day-to-day running of the business. The 
Chief Executive Officer has direct charge 
of the Group on a day-to-day basis,  
and the Executive team has collective 
responsibility for the implementation of 
the Group’s strategies, and is accountable 
to the Board for the financial and 
operational performance of the Group.
There are certain matters that are 
reserved for the Board’s consideration 
and these include, but are not limited  
to, matters of strategy, key commercial 
developments, risk management, the 
consideration and approval of budgets, 
significant capital expenditure and 
recruitment, acquisitions and disposals, 
and the approval of financial statements.
The formal Board agenda includes 
reports from the CEO, CCO and CFO 
detailing the commercial, operational 
and financial performance of the Group. 
Further to formal Board meetings,  
the Board receives weekly key trend 
information covering all trading aspects 
of the business.
The Board determines the fees paid to 
Non-Executive Directors.
The performance of the Board is 
evaluated informally on an ongoing  
basis with reference to all aspects of its 
operation including, but not limited to, 
the appropriateness of its skill level, the 
way its meetings are conducted and 
administered (including the content of 
those meetings), the effectiveness of the 
various Committees, whether corporate 
governance issues are handled in a 
satisfactory manner and whether there  
is a clear strategy and objectives.
A new Director, on appointment, is 
briefed on the activities of the Group. 
Professional induction training is also 
given as appropriate. The Chairman 
briefs Non-Executive Directors on issues 
arising at Board meetings if required, and 
Non-Executive Directors have access to 
the Chairman at any time. Ongoing 
training is provided as needed. Directors 
are continually updated on the Group’s 
business and on insurance and on issues 
covering pensions, social, ethical, 
environmental and health and safety  
by means of Board reports.
In the furtherance of his duties or in 
relation to acts carried out by the Board 
or the Group, each Director has been 
informed that he is entitled to seek 
independent professional advice at  
the expense of the Group. The Group 
maintains appropriate cover under a 
Directors and Officers insurance policy  
in the event of legal action being taken 
against any Director. 31
Strategic 
Report
Corporate 
Governance
Financial 
Statements
Each Director is appraised through the 
normal appraisal process. The Chief 
Executive Officer is appraised by the 
Chairman, the Executive Board members 
by the Chief Executive Officer, and the 
Non-Executive Board members by the 
Chairman. Each Director has access to 
the services of the Company Secretary  
if required.
The Non-Executive Directors are 
considered by the Board to be 
independent of management and  
are free to exercise independence  
of judgement. They receive no other 
remuneration from the Group other  
than the Directors’ fees.
The Board is supported by and  
receives recommendations from two 
Committees – an Audit Committee  
and a Remuneration Committee.
It is recognised that the Code does  
not treat the Chairman as independent 
and it is considered best practice that  
he should not sit on the Audit or 
Remuneration Committees. The Board, 
however, takes the view that as the 
number of Non-Executive Directors 
since 19 October 2016 is only two, 
including the Chairman, his participation 
will continue as the Committees gain the 
benefit of his external expertise and 
experience in areas which the Group 
considers important.
The table above shows the number of 
Board meetings and Audit Committee 
and Remuneration Committee meetings 
held in the period from 1 March 2016 to 
the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. The table also show the 
attendance of each Director.
Re-election
At each Annual General Meeting 
one-third (or whole number less than 
one-third) of the Directors will retire by 
rotation. In addition, Directors are subject 
to re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment.
Shareholder communications
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer regularly meet with 
institutional shareholders to foster a 
mutual understanding of objectives. The 
Directors encourage the participation  
of all shareholders, including private 
investors, at the Annual General Meeting 
and as a matter of policy the level of 
proxy votes (for, against and vote 
withheld) lodged on each resolution  
is declared at the meeting.
The Annual Report and Accounts is 
published on the Company’s investor 
website and can be accessed by 
shareholders.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group highlights potential financial 
and non-financial risks which may 
impact on the business as part of the 
monthly management reporting 
procedures. The Board receives these 
monthly management reports and 
monitors the position at Board meetings.
The Board confirms that there are 
ongoing processes for identifying, 
evaluating and mitigating the significant 
risks faced by the Group. The processes 
have been in place from 1 March 2016 to 
the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, and is consistent with the 
guidance for Directors on internal control 
issued by the Turnbull Committee.
The Group’s internal financial control and 
monitoring procedures include:
 – clear responsibility on the part of line 
and financial management for the 
maintenance of good financial 
controls and the production of 
accurate and timely financial 
management information;
 – the control of key financial risks 
through appropriate authorisation 
levels and segregation of accounting 
duties;
 – detailed monthly budgeting and 
reporting of trading results, balance 
sheets and cash flows, with regular 
review by management of variances 
from budget;
 – reporting on any non-compliance 
with internal financial controls and 
procedures; and
 – review of reports issued by the 
external auditor.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the 
Board reviews reports from the external 
auditor, together with management’s 
response regarding proposed actions.  
In this manner they have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls for the period covered by  
the accounts.
On 1 March 2017 the Group formed an 
Operational Board with the appointment 
of three further Directors to the trading 
subsidiary, Gear4music Limited. The 
Operational Board will meet at least 
once each month to analyse and discuss 
operational and commercial matters, 
and to identify any material matters to 
escalate to the Plc Board.

Audit Committee report
Overview
The Audit Committee (‘the Committee’) 
is established by and is responsible to the 
Board. It has formally delegated duties 
and responsibilities, and has written 
terms of reference. Its main 
responsibilities are:
 – to monitor and be satisfied with the 
truth and fairness of the Group’s 
financial statements before submission 
to the Board for approval, ensuring 
their compliance with the appropriate 
accounting standards, the law and  
the AIM Rules;
 – to monitor and review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system  
of internal control;
 – to make recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the appointment  
of the external auditor and their 
remuneration, following appointment 
by the shareholders in a general 
meeting, and to review and be satisfied 
with the auditor’s independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness on  
an ongoing basis; and
 – to implement the policy relating to 
any non-audit services performed by 
the external auditor.
Membership of the Audit 
Committee
Dean Murray is the Chairperson of the 
Committee and the other member is 
Ken Ford, both of whom are Non-
Executive Directors and have wide 
experience in regulatory and risk issues.
Role and operation of the Audit 
Committee
The Committee is authorised by the 
Board to seek and obtain any information 
it requires from any officer or employee 
of the Group, and to obtain external legal 
or other independent professional advice 
as is deemed necessary by it.
Meetings of the Committee are held at 
least twice per year and the auditor is 
invited to these meetings. The 
Committee meets once (usually during 
January) to discuss and agree the scope 
for the forthcoming external audit, and 
again (usually during April) to review the 
findings of the external audit in relation  
to internal control and the financial 
statements. At this meeting, the 
Committee carries out a full review of 
the year-end financial statements and of 
the audit, using as a basis the report to 
the Audit Committee prepared by the 
external auditor and taking into account 
any significant accounting policies, any 
changes to them and any significant 
estimates or judgements. Questions are 
asked of management of any significant 
or unusual transactions where the 
accounting treatment could be open  
to different interpretations.
The Committee receives reports from 
management on the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls. It also receives 
from the external auditor a report of 
matters arising during the course of the 
audit which the auditor deems to be  
of significance for the Committee’s 
attention. The statement on internal 
controls and the management of risk, 
which is included in the Annual Report,  
is approved by the Committee.
The 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act 
(‘the Act’) aims to promote greater 
openness in the workplace and ensures 
‘whistle blowers’ are protected. The 
Group maintains a policy in accordance 
with the Act which allows employees to 
raise concerns on a confidential basis if 
they have reasonable grounds in 
believing that there is serious malpractice 
within the Group. The policy is designed 
to deal with concerns, which must be 
raised without malice and in good faith, 
in relation to specific issues which are in 
the public interest and which fall outside 
the scope of other Group policies and 
procedures. There is a specific 
complaints procedure laid down and 
action will be taken in those cases where 
the complaint is shown to be justified. 
The individual making the disclosure will 
be informed of what action is to be taken 
and a formal written record will be kept 
of each stage of the procedure.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
The external auditor is required to give 
the Committee information about 
policies and processes for maintaining 
their independence and compliance 
regarding the rotation of audit partners 
and staff. The Committee considers all 
relationships between the external 
auditor and the Group to ensure that 
they do not compromise the auditor’s 
judgement or independence, particularly 
with the provision of non-audit services.
External auditor and non-audit 
services
Fees in relation to services provided by 
the external auditor in FY17 and FY16 
were:
FY17 FY16
Audit fee 40 28
Tax fees 60 3
Other fees –  
IPO-related fees – 137
Total fees 100 168
In FY16, given the one-off nature of the 
IPO fees, the Committee was satisfied 
that the external auditor did not have  
a self-interest threat.
The Committee has considered the ratio 
of audit fees to non-audit fees and is 
satisfied with the independence and 
objectivity of the auditor, KPMG LLP.

financial interest in the Group except for 
fees in relation to their holding of office 
and their shareholding as disclosed, with 
no potential conflict of interests and no 
day-today involvement of the Group. 33

Financial 
Statements
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance of the Executive 
Directors and makes recommendations 
to the Board on matters relating to 
remuneration, terms of service, granting 
of share options and other equity 
incentives. 
The Remuneration Committee meets  
at least twice a year.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy is designed to 
attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
Executives to ensure the Group is 
managed successfully to the benefit  
of shareholders.
Share ownership is encouraged and  
all the executives are interested in the 
share capital.
In setting remuneration levels, the 
Committee takes into consideration 
remuneration levels and practices in 
other companies of a similar size and in 
similar sectors.
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Executive 
Directors. Non-Executive Directors are 
not entitled to pensions beyond the 
required statutory minimums, annual 
bonuses or employee benefits, nor are 
they entitled to participate in share 
option arrangements relating to the 
Company’s shares.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has 
a letter of appointment stating his annual 
fee and that his appointment is initially for 
a term of three years. Their appointment 
may be terminated with one month’s 
notice.
Their fees are reviewed annually and set 
in line with prevailing market conditions 
and at a level which will attract and retain 
individuals with the necessary experience 
and expertise to make a significant 
contribution to the Group’s affairs.
Directors’ remuneration
The normal remuneration arrangements 
for Executive Directors consist of basic 
salary and private medical insurance. The 
CEO is also entitled to a car allowance 
and a pension allowance. Four Directors, 
including the CEO, are enrolled in the 
Group workplace pension scheme.
All Executive Directors have service 
agreements terminable by the Company 
with six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests
Details of the Directors’ shareholdings 
are included in the Directors’ report on 
page 36.
Directors’ share options
There is a Directors EMI share incentive 
plan in place for Chris Scott and Gareth 
Bevan, and an equivalent discretionary 
cash bonus plan for Andrew Wass, to 
reward the Executives for delivering 
success to the mutual benefit of 
shareholders, and specifically promote 
continuing earnings growth. 
The first and only awards to date were 
made on 31 May 2016 further to the 
announcement of the Company’s FY16 
annual trading results and following due 
consideration by the Remuneration 
Committee. Subject to continued 
employment and meeting performance 
conditions, these awards are scheduled 
to vest on 31 May 2018.
Further awards are expected to be made 
following the announcement of the  
FY17 results.

provision for the purpose of the Companies Act 2006.
Employee involvement
It is the Group’s policy to involve employees in its progress, 
development and performance. Applications for employment 
by disabled persons are fully considered, bearing in mind the 
respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicants concerned. 
The Group is a committed equal opportunities employer and 
has engaged employees with broad backgrounds and skills. It is 
the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of a disabled person should, as far as possible, 
be identical to that of a person who is fortunate enough not to 
suffer from a disability. In the event of employees becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues.

During the year ended 28 February 2017 the Group made 
donations totalling £881 (FY16: £nil) to the Bromley Youth  
Music Trust.
Supplier payment policy and practice
The Group does not operate a standard code in respect of 
payments to suppliers. The Group agrees terms of payment 
with suppliers at the start of business and then makes payments 
in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations.
The number of creditor days outstanding at 28 February 2017 
was 26 days (FY16: 30 days). This is a weighted average by invoice 
value, with reference to actual invoice and payment dates.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she 
ought to have taken to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
KPMG LLP has been Group auditor since 2012 and the Audit 
Committee has decided that, following the rotation of the 
current audit partner, it is appropriate to conduct a competitive 
tender process for audit services for the year ending 
28 February 2018 onwards.

STATEMENT OF 
DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Strategic Report, the Directors’ report and 
the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic  
Report, the Directors’ report and the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. As 
required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), 
FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland’. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
 – for the Group financial statements, state whether they  
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU; 
 – for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and 
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the  
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 39

responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 38, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and 
express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion:

2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ report:
 – we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
 – in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in  
our opinion: 
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Gear4music (Holdings) plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES (FORMING PART OF THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017
General information
Gear4music (Holdings) plc is a public limited company, is incorporated and domiciled in the UK, and is listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market (‘AIM’) of the London Stock Exchange. 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ‘the Group’). 
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The principal activity of the Group is the retail of musical instruments and equipment. 
The registered office of Gear4music (Holdings) plc (Company number: 07786708), Gear4music Limited (Company number: 
03113256) and Cagney Limited (dormant subsidiary; Company number: 04493300) is Kettlestring Lane, Clifton Moor, York YO30 4XF.
On 15 July 2016, the Group set up a Swedish subsidiary, ‘Gear4music Sweden AB’, as a 100% subsidiary of Gear4music Limited.
On 7 October 2016, the Group set up a German subsidiary, ‘Gear4music GmbH’, as a 100% subsidiary of Gear4music Limited.
On 10 October 2016, the Group set up a Norwegian subsidiary, ‘Gear4music Norway AS’, as a 100% subsidiary of Gear4music 
Limited. At 28 February 2017 this Company was dormant.
1 Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules for Companies, and apply the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), 
and make amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006. The Company has elected to prepare its 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 102; these are presented on pages 68 to 75. 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out below and have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in the consolidated 
financial statements. Subjective judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have 
significant effect on the financial statements are considered in Note 22. 
Selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes 
in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as presented in the 
Admission document which is available on the Group’s investor website.
Accounting period
The financial statements presented cover the years ended 28 February 2017 and 29 February 2016.
Measurement convention
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on these financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
 – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). Given the nature of the Group’s 
business and its debt structure, it is not expected to have a material effect on these financial statements;
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018) is not expected to 
have a significant impact on the Group’s revenues as the majority of the Group’s revenue is for product sales made direct to 
customers at standard prices and estimates are already made of anticipated returns;
 – IFRS 16 Leases (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). This fundamentally changes the accounting 
for leases by lessees. It eliminates the current IAS 17 dual accounting model, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet 
finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases and, instead, introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that 
is similar to current finance lease accounting. Operating leases disclosed in Note 20 are expected to come on balance sheet 
once this standard is adopted;
 – Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (effective date to be confirmed);
 – Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative (effective date to be confirmed);
 – Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (effective date to be confirmed); 
and
 – Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (effective date to be confirmed). 45
Strategic 
Report
Financial 
Statements
Corporate 
Governance
1.3 Going concern
The Group’s business activities and position in the market are described in the Strategic Report. The Directors believe that given  
the Group has significant financial resources, and has demonstrated good growth in revenue and underlying profitability from 
operating activities, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks. 
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient facilities to cover its future funding requirements. Short-term flexibility is 
available through trade finance and overdraft facilities. At 28 February 2017 the Group had £3.0m of cash and bank balances and 
HSBC have indicated they are supportive of renewing the Group’s facilities in July 2017.
The Group is committed to completing a £5.325m property and has approved debt-funding in place, and will continue to invest in 
European distribution centres. 
Having duly considered all of these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year, including the investments outlined 
in the CEO’s statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for the 
foreseeable future, and as such continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
1.4 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, 
the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which 
control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated.
1.5 Foreign currency
International transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the respective foreign currencies, and 
translated into the functional currency of the Group, Sterling, at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Translational 
accounting gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period they arise.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to the Group’s functional currency, Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses 
of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Functional currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Group’s functional currency.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial 
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable 
to the Company (or Group); and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in this financial information for called up share 
capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and 
borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of 
the cash flow statement. 
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributed transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
1.8 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on either a straight-line basis or a reducing balance basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 – Plant and equipment 4–5 years’ straight line
 – Fixtures and fittings 20–25% on reducing balance
 – Motor vehicles 25% on reducing balance
 – Computer equipment 3–5 years’ straight line
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment 
losses. Lease payments are accounted for as described below in Note 1.16.
1.9 Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 – the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 – the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 – the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill is allocated to 
cash-generating units, or (‘CGUs’). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.

1.10 Intangible assets 
Software platform
Computer software development costs that generate economic benefits beyond one year and meet the development asset 
recognition criteria as laid out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are capitalised as Intangible assets.
These costs include the payroll costs of employees directly associated with the development, and other direct external material and 
service costs. Costs are capitalised only where there is an identifiable development that will bring future economic benefit. All other 
website and maintenance costs are expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Capitalised software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives and charged to administrative expenses in 
the statement of comprehensive income. 
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally-generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated 
impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the 
date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 – Brand 10 years; and
 – Software platform 3–8 years
 
1.11 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value (‘NRV’). Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Stock is 
neither fashionable nor perishable.
A provision is made in respect of inventories as follows:
 – 100% against returns stock found to be faulty that is retained to be used for spare parts on the basis there is no direct NRV value; and 
 – a provision for the expected product loss on dealing with returns stock.
1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after 
the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that 
can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The effect of discounting is not material. When a subsequent 
event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For Goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of 
assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of 
assets (the CGU). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs. 
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss would be recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
No impairments have been recognised in the periods presented.

1.13 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution pension plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are 
rendered by employees. 
Share-based payments
The Group operates share option plans for qualifying employees of the Group. The fair value of these shares is determined using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is expensed in the statement of comprehensive income as an employee expense on  
a straight-line basis over the vesting period after allowing for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest with  
a corresponding increase in equity. The level of vesting is reviewed annually and the expense adjusted to reflect any changes  
in estimates.
1.14 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.15 Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the 
buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, including freight 
charges and duty where applicable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty. Carriage income is recognised 
on recognition of the related product sales. Returns are dealt with on receipt of the product into the warehouse which triggers an 
automatic credit, and an estimate for returns is provided for at the year end. 
The Group offers retail point of sale credit on orders over £250, through an agreement with an external credit provider. The Group 
does not retain any credit risk and commissions are recognised within revenue on recognition of the credit sale. In the year ended 
28 February 2017, this income totalled £102,000 (2016: £37,900). No discount is offered on any sales made through this credit provider. 
1.16 Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance 
charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Exceptional items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered to be non-recurring are classified as 
exceptional operating items. Such items, which include for instance fees in relation to IPO, are included within the appropriate 
consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately in the Notes to the financial information. Exceptional 
operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of 
the Group.
Government and other forms of grant
Government and other grants from third parties are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as a reduction in the 
costs incurred, on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. Where 
the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised on a systematic basis over the UEL of the related asset.
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, 
unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign 
currency accounting policy). Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and net foreign exchange gains. 
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

1.17 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A temporary difference on the initial recognition of goodwill is not provided 
for. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
1.18 Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. The Group’s 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) has been identified as the Board of Directors. 
 
2 Segmental reporting
The Group’s revenue and profit was derived from its principal activity which is the sale of musical instruments and equipment. 
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group has made the following considerations to arrive at the disclosure made 
in these financial statements. IFRS 8 requires consideration of the CODM within the Group. Operating segments have been 
identified based on the internal reporting information and management structures with the Group. Based on this information it has 
been noted that the CODM reviews the business as one segment, and receives internal information on this basis. Therefore, it has 
been concluded that there is only one reportable segment.

Acquisitions in the current period
On 1 January 2017, the Group acquired a software development business for £1.45m, satisfied in cash on a deferred consideration 
basis. The acquisition brings the outsourced software development team responsible for the Group’s bespoke e-commerce 
platform into the Group.
The amounts recognised in respect of the purchase consideration and goodwill are set out below and subject to fair value 
adjustment on the date of acquisition, as the consideration was £18,000 for identifiable PPE assets payable on completion, and 
£1.5m payable in 15 quarterly instalments beginning on 1 January 2017. The fair value has been determined using a discount rate 
equal to the prevailing market rate for a similar instrument.
Effect of acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:
Recognised

Assets acquired:
Property, plant and equipment 18
Identifiable assets 18
Goodwill 1,431
1,449
Consideration paid: 
Initial cash price paid 118
Deferred consideration at fair value 1,331
Total consideration 1,449
 
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition as the principal value-creating asset being acquired is the team. No other intangible assets 
arose on acquisition.
Contingent consideration
The £1.5m deferred consideration is contingent upon the team leader not performing services or being otherwise engaged by the 
vendor. The consideration is not automatically forfeited if the team leader leave the employment of the Group. The Directors 
believe 100% of the consideration will be payable.
Acquisition related costs
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £25,000 relating to legal advice. These costs have been included in Administrative 
expenses in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill
On 19 March 2012 goodwill arose on the acquisition of the entire share capital of Gear4music Limited (formerly known as Red 
Submarine Limited). 
On 1 January 2017 goodwill arose on the acquisition of a software development team from Venditan Limited, the team responsible 
for the development of the Group’s proprietary software platform.

In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets. A detailed review was 
undertaken at 28 February 2017 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value in use 
calculations based on cash-flow projections from formally approved budgets and longer-term forecasts.
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, the Gear4music brand name and the proprietary software platform.
A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows of other assets or groups thereof. The Group is deemed to have a single CGU to which the goodwill, the software 
platform and the brand are allocated. An impairment review has been performed on this CGU. The recoverable amount of this 
CGU has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. In assessing value in use, a five-year forecast to 28 February 2022 
was used to provide cash flow projections that have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10%. The cash flow projections 
are subject to key assumptions in respect of revenue growth, gross margin performance, overhead expenditure and capital 
expenditure. Management has reviewed and approved the assumptions inherent in the model:
 – Revenue forecasts based on growth by geographical market, at a range of growth levels based on market size and estimate of 
opportunity, trends, specific projects underway and management’s experience and expectation;
 – Product costs are assumed to be broadly flat and gross margins are forecast to be retained at current levels over the five-year 
management forecast period; and
 – Wage increases are a function of recruitment and a person-by-person review of current staff, with a range of percentage increases.
No impairment loss was identified in the current year (2016: £nil). The valuations indicate significant headroom and therefore a 
terminal growth rate assumption has not been needed to be applied in order to support the valuation of this CGU. Any reasonably 
possible change in other key assumptions, including the discount rate, would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill or 
other intangible assets.

Bank loans comprise a Trade Finance facility provided by the Group’s bankers, HSBC, and are secured by fixed and floating charges 
over the Group’s assets. The interest rate on 180-day import loans drawn under the Trade Finance agreement is 2.45% p.a. over 
HSBC’s Sterling Base Rate, and on an overdraft if and when drawn, is 3.25% over base. Interest on import loans is paid at the maturity 
of the relevant loan. Interest on an overdraft would be paid monthly in arrears. The Trade Finance facilities are due for review and 
renewal on or before 18 July 2017.
The head office freehold acquisition scheduled to complete on 30 June 2017 is debt-funded with HSBC, and this is in addition to 
the trading facilities outlined above.
All borrowings are denominated in Sterling.

 – £630,000 (2016: £672,000) of rent accrued but not paid as per the commercial agreement reached with the landlord and the 
legal form of the property lease. This accrual started to unwind in 2017 with £42,000 unwinding in the year, and a further 
£147,000 is due to unwind within one year as the cash paid exceeds the expense, and £441,000 will unwind in subsequent years 
to the end of the lease in June 2020; and
 – £100,000 bonus accrual relating to the estimated cash bonuses accrued relating to the Employee and Director EMI schemes, 
and Director Cash Plan (see Note 19).
Contingent consideration is due in relation to the acquisition of the software development team outlined in Note 9.
Government grants being spread over the useful economic life of the associated asset, relate to Regional Growth Fund Grants 
towards the acquisition of various capital items. Grant conditions exist linked to job creation, and these criteria have been satisfied.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
17 Financial instruments 
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Group’s policies on the management of liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks are set out below.
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments, which comprise term loans, hire purchase, finance leases, cash and liquid 
resources and various items arising directly from its operations, such as trade receivables and trade payables, is to finance the 
Group’s operations. 
Risk management framework
Regular reviews of strategic risks are performed by the Board.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is considered during the budgeting and forecasting processes, and throughout the year.
General commercial risk is considered at an annual insurance review in conjunction with an independent broker, and the 
appropriate insurance policies put in place.
(a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient and appropriately structured facilities to cover its future funding requirements. 
Short-term flexibility is available through import loans and overdraft facilities and, at certain times of the year, the netting off of 
surplus funds. The carrying amounts are the amounts due if settled at the period end date. The contractual undiscounted cash 
flows include estimated interest payments over the life of these facilities.

(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its  
contractual obligations. 
The Group faces low credit risk as customers typically pay for their orders in full on shipment of the product. There are a small 
number of education accounts with schools and colleges that have 30-day terms (1.9% of 2017 revenue; 2.3% of 2016 revenue),  
and trade accounts (1.2% of 2017 revenue; 0.9% of 2016 revenue). 
Funds lodged with Amazon, Digital River, Klarna and V12 Retail Finance totalling £394,000 on 28 February 2017 (29 February 2016: 
£175,000) is included in trade debtors.
Credit risk in relation to cash held with financial institutions is considered low risk, given the credit rating of these organisations.
(c) Interest rate risk
The Group’s bank borrowings incur interest at variables rates of between 2.45% and 3.25% above base, which exposes the Group  
to interest rate risk. Loans are with UK-based institutions, denominated in Sterling, and linked to the UK base rate.
At 28 February 2017, the Group had cash reserves of £3.0m and could utilise these funds to settle debts and mitigate any associated 
interest risk.
The Group’s policy, with regard to interest rate risk, is to monitor actual and anticipated changes in base rates, and if deemed 
appropriate, seek out alternative financing proposals to ensure retaining a competitive rate.

(d) Foreign exchange risk
All borrowings are denominated in Sterling.
The Group sells into Europe and more recently the rest of the world in eight currencies, including Sterling and Euros. In the year 
ended 28 February 2017, 37% (2016: 26%) of total revenue were in non-Sterling currencies, of which 51% (2016: 60%) were in Euros. 
Where costs (including local tax liabilities) are incurred in these respective currencies, currency balances are retained and payments 
made in these currencies, thereby mitigating any associated currency loss. The opening of distribution centres in Sweden and 
Germany has increased the proportion of liabilities denominated in Swedish Krona and Euros, further extending the natural hedge. 
Surplus foreign currency holdings are reviewed on a daily basis and balances in excess of known liabilities are converted into 
Sterling, restricting the period between the transaction and the point of conversion, thereby reducing the transactional risk. 
The Group purchases own-branded instruments and equipment from the Far East, transacting in US Dollars. The lead time from 
committed order to receipt of stock is typically 12–14 weeks, during which time the Group bears currency risk. The Group also 
trades with one supplier (2016: one supplier) on a trade credit basis with terms of 60 days. The Group has the trading platform ability 
and sufficient price flexibility to be able to pass on some adverse currency variances should it choose, and the Group generates 
enhanced margins on these products such that a proportion of these losses could be absorbed. The Group does not currently 
enter into forward contracts but reviews the situation, and would consider committing to such a position should it make 
commercial sense to do so.
The weakening of Sterling following the UK’s EU Referendum vote was of benefit to the Group as a net exporter. It increased 
own-branded product intake costs and the business sought to manage this by re-negotiating orders and investing in larger 
volumes to leverage purchasing economies of scale.

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are not sensitive to foreign exchange variations as currencies held are held to the extent 
they are required to settle a liability in that currency, or they are converted into Sterling.
Non-Sterling trade receivables include cash lodged with payment providers that is promptly settled. International trade debtors 
represent an immaterial amount such that the Group is not sensitive to associated foreign exchange variations.
Euro funds are retained to settle Euro-denominated payables. US Dollar-denominated trade payables are not currently bought 
forward against, but only represent a small exposure that can be otherwise managed.
(e) Debt and capital management
The Group’s objective when managing capital, which is deemed to be share capital, is to maximise the return on net invested 
capital while maintaining its ongoing ability to operate and guarantee adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders, within a sustainable financial structure. 
The Group monitors its gearing ratio on a regular basis and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions 
and strategic objectives of the Group.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the period. The Group does not have any 
externally imposed capital requirements. The funding requirements of the Group are met by cash generation from trading, cash 
raised on IPO, and the utilisation of external borrowings.

Contingent consideration (1,400) (1,331) – –
(6,814) (6,759) (1,919) (1,937)
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected 
in the table.
Trade and other payables and receivables
The fair values of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been 
assessed as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. The fair 
value of short-term deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the 
interest rate is reset to market rates.
Long-term and short-term borrowings
The fair value of bank loans is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of the loan notes is calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the 
market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group does not routinely enter into forward exchange contracts. The fair value of any material forward exchange contracts 
held would be calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Group’s bankers. 
Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration is assumed to be 100% payable. The consideration has been discounted to present value at 2.7%, 
being equivalent to the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar financial instrument.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments, measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techniques 
used to determine fair value.
 – Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 – Level 2: inputs other than quoted priced included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 – Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
There are three incentive schemes in place – an Employees EMI scheme, a Directors EMI scheme relevant to Chris Scott and 
Gareth Bevan, and a Directors cash bonus plan relevant to Andrew Wass who, by virtue of his 39% shareholding, is cash rather than 
equity rewarded.
The equity-settled share option plans are for qualifying employees of the Group, and options are settled in equity in the Company 
and subject to vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share options have an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares (10 pence) that the Company will 
subsidise by way of a bonus provided there are sufficient distributable reserves, and subject to certain conditions will vest on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant for initial awards on IPO, and the second anniversary thereafter.
The fair value of the cash-settled liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and settlement date.
Employee EMI Plan
The Board has responsibility for the operation of the Employee EMI Plan and may grant share options over shares to eligible 
employees. The Board has discretion to select participants in the Employee EMI Plan from eligible employees of the Group. Eligible 
employees will generally have been employed by the Group for more than three years at the time of award, but could be a shorter 
period at the discretion of the Board.
Awards under the Employee EMI Plan awards are only subject to service conditions.
Subject to continued employment, awards will normally be deemed to have been exercised at the end of the relevant vesting period.
Awards will be satisfied by the issue of new shares. The Company will grant a cash bonus to option holders in the month of 
exercise, the net value of which will be equivalent to the income tax, employee national insurance and the exercise price arising in 
relation to the awards.
Director EMI Plan
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for the operation of the Director EMI Plan and may grant share options over 
shares to eligible employees, and retains discretion as to the operation of the plan.
Executive Directors of the Company are eligible to participate in the Director EMI Plan. Participation is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Awards under the Director EMI Plan may be exercisable at the end of the vesting period subject to meeting EPS-based targets 
between the date of grant and vest, and subject to service conditions.
Awards will be satisfied by the issue of new shares. The Company will grant a discretionary cash bonus to option holders of up to 
25% of their annual salary at the time of award, deferred for a period of two years. 
Director Cash Plan
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for the operation of the Director Cash Plan and may grant cash bonus awards

Corporate

The preparation of consolidated financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions concerning the future, that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge 
at the time and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any 
future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities are discussed below:
 – The basis for stock provision and by association the carrying value – given the nature of the products sold, product margins 
earned, and trading terms with suppliers, Management currently provide for faulty returns retained for spare parts, and an 
estimate of the product loss to deal with problem stock. At 28 February 2017 the provision is £69,519 (2016: £15,023) on gross 
stock of £11.76m (2016: £6.92m). There are no other provisions made.
 – An accrual for sales returns in the 30-day money back guarantee period is made based on historical returns and actual returns 
could vary from this estimate.
 – Assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment review – such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate 
discount factors and the short, medium and long-term growth prospects. The impairment test carried out is based on five-year 
approved management forecast and a 10% discount rate (see Note 9).
 – Direct software development costs are capitalised as intangible assets. Judgement is applied in assessing the flow of future 
economic benefit, and in identifying which costs are capitalised and which are written off as an expense. Alternative judgement 
could result in certain costs being expensed.
 – The UEL of tangible and intangible fixed assets – management selected depreciation and amortisation periods appropriate to 
the assets held, and consistent with industry and accounting norm. Amortisation periods were independently reviewed as part 
of an intangible asset valuation exercise on IPO. Different UELs could be applied that would change the profit and loss charge 
and balance sheet carrying value.

Equity raise
On 18 May 2017, the Company completed the placing of 610,000 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 690 pence per share, raising 
£4,209,000 in gross proceeds (£4,052,730 net proceeds). The Company also issued 100,782 new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the 
full exercise of a warrant instrument, and received a further £140,087 in gross proceeds (£125,887 net proceeds). 
A total 710,782 new Ordinary Shares were admitted on 24 May 2017 taking the number of Ordinary Shares in issue from 20,156,339 
to 20,867,121, representing dilution of 3.5%. The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares. Updated 
shareholdings are reported on page 36.
Freehold purchase
On 30 June 2017 the Group successfully completed the purchase of the new headquarters at Holgate Park, Holgate Road, York

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017
The Company’s principal activity is to act as the holding company for the Group, whose principal activity is as a retailer of musical 
instruments and equipment. 
1.1 Basis of preparation 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (‘FRS 102’) as issued in August 2014. The amendments to FRS 102 issued in July 2015 
and effective immediately have been applied. The presentation currency of these financial statements is Sterling. All amounts in  
the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and  
loss account. 
In these financial statements, the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and has applied the 
exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures: 
 – Reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding from the beginning to end of the period; 
 – Cash flow statement and related notes; and
 – Key management personnel compensation. 
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:
 – Certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 Share Based Payments; and,
 – The disclosures required by FRS 102.11 Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues in respect  
of financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1.
The Company proposed to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework FRS102 in future periods.
Accounting period
The financial statements presented cover the years ended 28 February 2017 and 29 February 2016.
Measurement convention
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Functional currency
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency.
1.2 Going concern
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained on page 45.
1.3 Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
1.4 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
In accordance with FRS 102.22, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial 
assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in this financial information for called-up share 
capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
1.5 Basic financial instruments
Basic financial instruments comprise investments, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade 
and other payables.
Trade and other debtors
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Strategic 
Report
Financial 
Statements
Corporate 
Governance
Trade and other creditors
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributed transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
1.6 Impairment
Financial assets (including debtors)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after 
the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that 
can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The effect of discounting is not material. When a subsequent 
event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of 
assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of 
assets (‘the CGU’).
An impairment loss would be recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
No impairments have been recognised in the periods presented.
1.7 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.8 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution pension plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are 
rendered by employees. 
Share-based payments
The Company operates share-based option plans on behalf of the Group, and measures and recognises its share-based payment 
expense and re-charges it to other Group companies.
1.9 Financial income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, 
unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign 
currency accounting policy). Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and net foreign exchange gains. 
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in profit and loss on the date the Company’s right to receive payment is established.

1.10 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
