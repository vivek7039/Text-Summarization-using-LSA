1 In 2017 the Board has taken the decision to change the presentation of the underlying 
performance measures to now include other operating income. The Board believe this 
income is an integral feature of the replacement of meters, particularly prevalent during the 
current smart domestic rollout, and will occur with greater regularity on an ongoing basis. 
All prior year underlying results have been restated in accordance with this new approach.

Annualised recurring revenue refers to the revenue being generated at a point in time.
3 Pre-exceptional EBITDA and underlying PBT figures are presented under our revised 
approach to include other operating income.
4 Underlying PBT is before exceptional items and intangible amortisation.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 07 07 Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc I am pleased with the progress made in the year, 
another year of strong trading activity contributing 
to continued growth across the business. 
2017 has seen us make excellent progress, investing to build 
capacity through our strategic plan to enable us to install, 
own and manage a significantly increased number of utility 
metering assets for our energy supplier customers – particularly 
in the Smart Domestic market. This platform and increased 
capacity across all aspects of our operations puts us in a 
strong position to continue to grow our share of the UK’s 
smart domestic meter installation programme over the 
next three to four years.
Whilst continuing our profitable growth, the link to our 
heritage remains strong, with a focus on serving our 
customers. Our core values of investing in our people, 
systems and capacity remain as important to us today 
as they have been over the last 22 years. We have grown 
to 825 staff on a national basis and our people are key to 
delivering excellent customer service. I would like to thank 
all our employees for their highly valued contribution to 
serving our customers.
We now manage over 2 million utility metering and data 
assets on behalf of a continually expanding customer base 
of energy suppliers in both the Industrial and Commercial 
(I&C) and Domestic markets. This now includes a total 
portfolio of over 420,000 smart domestic meters.
In November 2017, we refinanced the business, extending the 
term of our £280m revolving credit facility and completing 
a £150m equity placing, providing us with a strong financial 
platform to help our customers complete their domestic 
smart meter programmes. I would like to thank our existing 
and new long-term investors and funders for their support.
Delivering our strategy
Last year we strategically changed our operational delivery 
model to gain direct control over a large proportion of our 
installation capacity and the end-to-end IT platform which 
underpins it. The value of this approach can be seen in the 
last year as SMS has performed strongly – deploying more 
capital and generating more incremental annualised 
recurring revenue than in the two previous years combined. 
This long-term annualised and index-linked recurring 
revenue has increased by 38% during the year, driven by 
the management and systems capacity in which we have 
invested. This enables us to provide energy suppliers 
with complete confidence in our ability to deliver 
their mandated rollout targets.
The UK domestic smart meter rollout is 
a government programme, requiring 
each energy supplier to offer 
installation of a smart meter 
in every home and business 
across the UK by 2020. 
Chairman’s statement
Willie MacDiarmid, Non-executive Chairman
Delivering our strategic plan
2017 has seen us 
make excellent 
progress and puts 
us in a strong position

UK’s smart domestic 
meter market.”
STRATEGIC REPORT
08
Willie  
MacDiarmid, 
Non-executive 
Chairman The business continues to operate with a market-focused 
structure, with three main service lines:
Asset management: We fund, at highly competitive rates, 
new meter and data assets which we install direct or adopt 
from third parties.
Asset installation: We have built one of the largest 
independent and national dual fuel metering installation 
services, enabling energy suppliers to achieve their mandated 
obligations under the government’s smart meter programme.
Energy management: We have an extensive team of experts 
who provide a full range of energy services, including risk 
management, bureau, energy efficiency, carbon reduction, 
generation and storage. 
Our technology, IT development and data security capabilities 
underpin all of these service lines and also provide new 
opportunities to innovate our services to the benefit of our 
customers beyond smart metering, particularly as we consider 
opportunities to install other long-term assets.
The safety of everyone involved in or associated with our 
business is of the utmost critical importance to us. “Safety 
Matters” (please refer to page 25) has been put at the heart 
of our business culture. We are proud of our assurance activities, 
which always ensure that health and safety is our top agenda 
item. However, we are not complacent and continue to invest 
and rigorously challenge, evaluate and assess the risks within 
our business to ensure that we are doing everything possible 
to ensure the health and safety of all our stakeholders. 
Dividend
We are pleased to announce a proposed final cash dividend 
of 3.46p for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 2.73p). 
In addition to the interim dividend of 1.74p (2016: 1.37p), this will 
make a total dividend of 5.20p (2016: 4.10p), a 27% increase. 
The final dividend will be paid on 31 May 2018 to those 
shareholders on the register (record date) on 27 April 2018 
with an ex-dividend date of 26 April 2018.
Outlook
We enter 2018 with a solid financial platform, a strong and 
growing utility metering installation capacity and ownership 
proposition, and the capability to innovate our services for 
our customers’ benefit over the long term.
We are in a strong position to continue to benefit from the 
Domestic Smart metering market and are continuing to increase 
the range of services to reduce customers’ carbon emissions 
and transform the UK energy system for the future.
We are committed to investing in metering installation and 
our ownership capacity, listening to and serving our customers’ 
needs and innovating our service proposition. 
We are confident that our proven and established leadership 
team will continue to build on our success as we deliver our 
strategic plan and take the business to the next phase of growth.
Willie MacDiarmid
Non-executive Chairman
This represents our largest market opportunity to increase 
the utility meters under management and as a result grow 
our index-linked recurring revenue, with c.43 million meters 
still to be installed across the market. Our strategy has 
positioned SMS to have control over the systems, people, 
processes and capacity to deliver on the market opportunity.
We plan to continue to increase our metering installation 
and management capacity and run rates with our growing 
customer base to enable SMS to continue to grow the two 
million assets currently under management.
Our strategic priorities, in 2018, will be to:
1.  Continue to install and own utility metering infrastructure 
and secure rental and data revenues from our contracted 
energy suppliers in the I&C market.
2.  Build on our strategic positioning and investment in 
capacity to take advantage of the Domestic Smart market 
opportunity in the UK. This is founded on our proven 
end-to-end delivery capability, increasing capacity and 
track record of customer service and operational delivery.
3.  Innovate our services to build big data, energy 
management, financing and installation capabilities that 
enable our customers to reduce their carbon emissions, 
and facilitate our investment in infrastructure asset classes 
which provide long-term recurring revenue.
People and systems
Our Board has evolved in 2017. In March we announced that 
Glen Murray, who had served as Chief Financial Officer of 
SMS since 2011, had decided step down from the Board and 
leave the business. I would like to thank Glen, on behalf of 
the Board, for his significant contribution to SMS over the 
last six years. We appointed David Harris as his replacement, 
who unfortunately resigned in August for health reasons. In 
September, we welcomed to the Board David Thompson as 
Chief Financial Officer. David had already made a significant 
contribution to the SMS success story in his previous role as 
Group Finance Director and is ideally placed to help drive 
the continued growth of the Company. In January 2018, 
Kelly Olsen joined us as a Non-executive Director, bringing a 
wealth of experience as an information technology specialist. 
Kelly is chairing a newly created Information and Technology 
Committee of the Board, with a remit to review and provide 
strategic guidance on development of the Company’s 
technology programmes. This is recognition of the importance 
of technology, information security and IT systems in providing 
the platform for our business to deliver a first-class customer 
experience. It will also provide a solid foundation for future IT 
investment, ultimately contributing to future shareholder returns.
We have continued to invest heavily in our people during 
2017, most notably through our in-house training academy 
to increase and develop our capacity for the domestic smart 
meter rollout. This capability is also key to our leading health 
and safety and technical assurance management controls, 
which are at the heart of everything we do.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 09 CEO’s statement
Alan Foy, Chief Executive Officer
I am pleased to report on the continued strong 
business and financial performance of SMS for 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
2017 has been a year of investment in our business – 
building capacity to grow and deliver for our customers 
in the domestic smart meter rollout which stipulates that 
smart electricity and gas meters are to be offered to every 
home in the UK by the end of 2020. After transforming our 
business model in 2016 through three strategic acquisitions 
to take control of our delivery services, we have accelerated 
our installation activities throughout 2017. As a result we 
have grown to have over 2 million utility metering and data 
assets under management (+62%), generating £57.0m in 
annually recurring index-linked revenue (+38%). The scale 
of this opportunity is clear; we invested more capital in meter 
assets and added more annualised recurring revenue in 2017 
than in the two previous years combined. This is illustrated 
by continued progress to the end of February 2018, where 
our portfolio of meter and data assets stood at 2.26 million 
generating £60.7m of annualised recurring revenue.
In order to grow these installation run rates we have 
continued to invest in inventory across our business. We 
have invested in stock to ensure we are able to meet customer 
demand, we have invested in a new operational delivery hub 
in Doncaster, we have invested in our IT systems and in our 
contact centre, we have invested in our health and safety 
and compliance management, and we continue to invest in 
our field engineer capacity through our accredited training 
school. We were particularly pleased to also add further 
financial capacity to the business through the successful 
completion of a £150m equity placement in November 2017. 
During 2017 we materially began to roll out smart meter 
installations from the eight non-exclusive framework 
agreements with UK domestic energy suppliers signed the 
previous year, and were pleased to add another significant 
framework contract to this list in August. These nine 
customers supply c.2.5 million consumers and on their 
behalf we installed over 370,000 smart meters to take 
our total smart portfolio to over 420,000 meters.
Operational review
During 2017 our gas and electricity meter and data portfolio 
under management increased by 62% from 1.25 million 
to over 2 million assets. Meter assets grew by 65% from 
958,000 to 1,583,000 and data assets grew by 53% from 
294,000 to 449,000 data points.
Our primary financial KPI is our annualised long-term 
index-linked recurring revenue (derived from our recurring 
rental revenue from our installed meter and data asset base), 
which increased by 38% from £41.3m to £57.0m as of the 
end of 2017. This increase of £15.7m compares to an increase 
of £6.6m in 2016, demonstrating the size of the opportunity 
ahead of us, and is the primary rationale behind the £150m 
equity placement, which provides us with the financial 
capacity to take advantage of this opportunity.
This financial KPI is central to our long-term annuity financial 
model as, once installed, these meters provide recurring rental 
revenue for the lifetime of the assets, alongside providing 
maintenance, support and ongoing service opportunities.
Industrial & Commercial (I&C) market
SMS has a strong and proven track record in the I&C market 
and we continue to benefit from continued demand for our 
services, particularly as the government has extended the 
date for which advanced meters contribute to its smart 
rollout obligations to October 2018 in the small business 
segment. This means that not only do we support our 
contracted energy supplier customers to complete their 
meter exchange programmes, but we also then collect and 
provide meter consumption data to them and the end users 
for billing and energy management purposes. Demand for 
these services remains strong, particularly in the micro 
business category, and we expect that to remain the case 
throughout 2018.
In the I&C gas market we continue to deploy the ADM™ 
device, our advanced metering solution, which provides 
half-hourly meter read information and we now have 
103,000 of these operational across the UK (increased 
from 91,000 at the end of 2016). We continue to see 
opportunities for our ADM™ device as part of other UK 
and international utility metering solutions.
Capacity for growth
We invested more 
capital in meter 
assets and added more 
annualised recurring 
revenue in 2017 than 
in the two previous 
years combined.”
STRATEGIC REPORT
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 10 We also provide and manage multi-utility infrastructure 
solutions throughout the UK. Our services cover the entire 
connections process from the initial feasibility stages and 
procurement to the final installation works, ranging from 
one-off gas and electricity connections, to multi-utility 
major projects. Our unrivalled customer service and years 
of expertise continue to make us the utility connections 
provider of choice and we see continued and increasing 
demand for these services.

Chief Executive Officer
UK Domestic market
2017 saw SMS materially embark on the rollout of smart meters 
as part of the UK government’s mandated smart meter 
programme, which requires all UK households and small 
businesses to be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020.
There are c.53 million gas and electricity meters in the UK 
and, as of the end of September 2017, there were 9.44 million 
smart and advanced meters installed in homes and businesses 
across the country. The market share of “challenger” energy 
suppliers in the Domestic market has increased to c.17% at 
the start of 2017 (c.9 million meters) and SMS has framework 
agreements with nine such independent energy suppliers, 
equivalent to up to 5 million of these meter points. We 
continue to engage with all energy suppliers in the market 
and believe we provide an attractive proposition to meet 
their installation deadlines, as we have both the financial 
and operational capacity to provide certainty to deliver 
their mandated obligations.
Energy management services
We provide the tools, expertise and knowledge to help 
our customers make better energy decisions, increase 
their control over their energy expenditure and reduce their 
costs and carbon footprints. Our innovative approach to 
monitoring and managing consumption data allows us to 
extract additional value for our customers and enables us 
to provide an integrated service covering collection and 
analysis of meter consumption data and the utilisation of 
that data to identify and deliver energy reduction activity. 
Our energy services therefore both take advantage of and 
provide opportunities for increased data recurring revenue, 
as well as providing a full range of energy management 
services in their own right. In 2017 we processed and 
analysed 630,000 billing points, delivered over 300 energy 
audits and compliance surveys and continued to identify 
significant opportunities for SMS to deliver turnkey energy 
reduction projects which we expect to accelerate in 2018.

Change to presentation of alternative 
performance measures
In the prior year, other operating income was excluded from 
our definition of underlying performance. This income is 
an integral feature of the replacement of meters, particularly 
prevalent during the current smart domestic rollout, and 
will occur on an ongoing basis. It is therefore the Board’s 
intention to present our underlying performance including 
this income. We hope this voluntary disclosure best allows 
our shareholders to understand the impact of this change.

Capital deployment and funding
2017 has been a year of significant growth and investment 
in our business. We have seen our portfolio of meter 
and data assets increase to 2.03 million, which includes 
423,000 domestic smart meters, resulting in capital 
expenditure of £122.8m in the year. This level of capital 
expenditure represents a three-fold increase over what 
was a record year in 2016 of £42.5m.
To fund our continued growth, we undertook an exercise 
to raise additional equity investment and refinance our 
debt facility in Q4 2017. I am pleased to report that we 
successfully placed £150m of additional ordinary shares 
at the same time as refinancing our £280m debt facility 
in November 2017. At the balance sheet date, our net 
debt was therefore £36.5m, giving us a net debt to 
pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio of 0.90 times. 
Our strategy of further significant capital deployment 
during the domestic smart meter rollout is clearly 
strengthened through the continued support from our 
shareholders and our banking syndicate comprising 
Barclays Bank plc, Santander UK plc, HSBC UK, 
Clydesdale Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group’s available cash 
and unutilised debt facility stood at £243.5m.
High quality people 
have been our largest 
area of investment 
as they are key to 
executing our strategy.”

Annualised recurring revenue
Annualised recurring revenue has increased 38% to £57.0m 
(2016: £41.3m). In gas, recurring meter rental and management 
revenue increased by 15% to £36.1m and data recurring 
revenue increased by 15% to £3.0m, while in electricity the 
recurring meter rental revenue increased by 283% to £11.2m 
and data recurring revenue increased by 56% to £6.7m.
The significant rise in electricity asset revenue is predominantly 
driven by the domestic smart meter rollout; historically the 
business has a gas-weighted portfolio so the installation of 
dual fuel meter sets sees the electricity portfolio grow 
similarly in absolute terms, albeit from a lower base.

Trading
Our revenues have increased 18% to £79.6m and our EBITDA 
on a statutory basis increased by 19% to £38.8m.
Our margin at a Group level fell 4% to 51%. The main drivers 
of this reduction relate to increased depreciation on our 
revenue-generating assets that we disclose as a component 
of cost of sales, and the investment in our own engineering 
capacity. Whilst we capitalise certain installation costs 
related to the meters we fit and own, a consequence of 
owning our internal installation workforce is that certain 
costs including sales, marketing and training cannot be 
capitalised under current accounting rules and these costs 
are therefore expensed to the income statement. Had we not 
taken the strategic decision to acquire and grow our own 
installation workforce, we would be able to fully capitalise 
such third-party meter installation costs and our EBITDA 
would increase accordingly.
Statutory profit before taxation has fallen by 2% to £18.0m 
reflecting increased depreciation (up 41% to £14.1m) and 
interest costs excluding exceptional finance costs (up 78% 
to £4.1m) due to the significant investment in 
capital expenditure.
S
17 Investment in revenue-generating assets
Our portfolio of revenue-generating assets has grown 62% 
to 2.03 million. The key driver for this increase relates to the 
domestic smart meter rollout, both the meters themselves 
and the associated data points. We added 371,000 domestic 
smart meters in the year. Through continued building of our 
installation capacity, be that through direct recruitment, the 
upskilling of existing single fuel engineers to dual fuel, or 
training new entrants in-house, and strategic working with 
selected subcontract partners, we ended the year with a 
record quarter of 133,000 smart meters being fitted.
The domestic smart meter rollout is also driving the increase in 
electricity data points, seeing an increase of 74% to 323,000.

* Includes 3rd party meter management appointments.
Investment in capacity
2017 saw the first full year of the in-house end-to-end 
procurement, installation and ownership cycle of meter and 
data assets, pursuant to the acquisition of the installation 
and IT businesses in 2016. We have invested heavily in 
shaping these acquired businesses into the existing SMS 
Group to realise the value from them.
High quality people have been our largest area of investment 
as they are key to executing our strategy under the smart 
meter rollout. We have seen our employment costs increase 
by 41% to £30.2m as we have recruited more engineers and the 
technical staff to support them, and made key appointments 
across all our central functions. 
We have further invested in our infrastructure with the 
opening of a new installation divisional HQ in Doncaster, 
to house our customer service teams, and recently opened 
a new 12,500 sq ft warehouse and logistics hub to add 
additional storage capacity for our growing meter inventory.
A key aspect of our domestic smart meter rollout is to 
preserve our installation run rates, and our working capital 
investment in meter inventory continues to grow to supply 
our engineers in the field. Inventory increased 171% year on 
year to £16.6m almost entirely due to holding increased 
domestic smart meters.
Exceptional items
Due to the acceleration in growth, the equity placing and 
the bank refinance, we have incurred significant one-off 
costs in the year. At the half year we reported £0.6m of 
reorganisation costs as we reshaped certain aspects of the 
business, predominantly transferring the separately acquired 
installation businesses into one overall operating division, 
and these costs now total £1.2m for the year. 
The equity placing and refinancing incurred costs of £0.5m 
of finance costs, £0.3m of one-off professional fees that 
have been expensed to the income statement and £4.0m 
of fees that have been included within equity. 
Alternative performance measures
To better reflect the underlying operating results of 
our business we have traditionally presented EBITDA, 
PBT and EPS after removing the effects of exceptional 
items (2017: £2.0m, 2016: £0.5m), amortisation 
(2017: £2.2m, 2016: £2.0m) and other operating 
income (2017: £3.4m, 2016: £1.1m).
As a Board we have taken the decision this year to include 
termination income, or other operating income, in our 
underlying performance measures to provide a clearer 
view of the actual performance and operating cash flows 
of the business.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 18 Risk description Mitigation Change
Business continuity – failure or interruption of IT systems
The Group has always understood the competitive 
advantage that it has derived from the significant 
investment made in its bespoke market-leading IT 
systems. Failure or interruption of these systems could 
result in reputational damage and loss of customer 
confidence and ultimately have financial consequences.
The Company’s IT infrastructure is subject to failure 
from a variety of causes, including human error, power 
loss and physical or electronic security breaches. 
Other factors which are out of the Company’s control 
include sabotage, vandalism, network failures, natural 
disasters, fibre optic cable cuts, improper building 
maintenance by the landlords of the buildings in 
which the IT infrastructure is located, and terrorism.
 X The Group has an IT strategy which is designed 
to support our growing business needs and 
provides appropriate infrastructure. We regularly 
review our IT security policies and have successfully 
undergone penetration testing of our IT systems.
 X Real-time offsite mirroring of its servers.
 X Failover facility available for immediate 
redeployment of staff, enabling key operations 
to be serviced.
 X Robust governance structures to ensure the 
information of our employees, our customers 
and our business is protected.
 No change
The Group continually 
reviews its strategy and 
implements changes to its 
IT infrastructure in line 
with known threats.
Funding
Being well funded is fundamental to our ability to 
provide continued growth. The Group is reliant on 
securing competitively priced funding to enable 
the continued investment in our growing asset 
portfolio. The Group has periods in the year where 
there is a peak in working capital needs which 
require short-term funding.
 X The Group continually reviews its capital requirements 
and funding options with potential funders.
 X The Group has a long-term relationship and strong 
support from its existing banking syndicate which 
continues to support the growth of the business.
 X The Group has recently raised £150m through an 
equity placing and extended a £280m revolving credit 
facility with a syndicate of banks which includes 
Barclays Bank plc, Santander UK plc, HSBC UK, 
Clydesdale Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc. 
 Risk decreased
The Group has secured 
sufficient capital to fulfil 
its growth strategy over 
the next two years.
Dependent on a limited number of gas and electricity suppliers
The Group’s core customers for growth are the UK 
gas and electricity suppliers; these are limited in 
number. The Group has contracts in place with 
key customers, which make up a large part of our 
existing portfolio. These contracts provide for the 
provision of meter rental and, in the event that 
our relationship with these suppliers were to be 
adversely affected by performance or damage to 
our relationship, then termination charges would 
apply. Damage to these relationships would have 
an adverse impact on the revenue generated by 
the Group.
 X Strong track record of maintaining these long-
term partnering relationships over the last 21 years.
 X Key account managers ensure that we are 
listening to our customers’ requirements and 
translating these into business deliverables.
 X Customer service is at the heart of our business; 
it is what we have built our reputation on and it 
is what is driving our future growth.
 X Securing new contracts with new market entrants 
ensures that we are able to minimise the risk of loss of 
assets through change of supplier by end customers.
 No change
The securing of new 
contracts reduces 
SMS’s reliance on 
the big six suppliers.
Major health and safety incident
We provide our services in a range of potentially 
high risk environments: in homes, in public 
buildings, with electrical and gas services, 
and as lone operatives in vans.
 X The Group places significant importance on the 
continued investment in high quality staff and 
performance of health and safety reviews. 
 X We have mandatory training standards driven by 
job roles with a centralised training team which 
monitors and maintains training standards.
 No change
We have a strong and 
established health and 
safety culture which 
is owned by the 
Executive Directors.
Managing risk
The attention of investors is drawn to the fact that ownership of ordinary shares will involve a 
variety of risks which, if they occur, may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business 
and financial condition and on the market price of the ordinary shares. We have a detailed and 
comprehensive risk management process, covering all aspects of business and operational risk.
Risk management and principal risks
S
Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 19 Risk description Mitigation Change
The Group may experience accelerated demand for its products and services
The Group expects to be able to meet its current 
capital expenditure from its internal resources, 
recent equity placing and its debt facility. The 
rollout of domestic smart meters may require the 
Group to consider supporting the working capital 
requirements for orders. Depending on the 
demand and available working capital it could 
adversely affect the Group’s ability to expand.
 X The Group maintains close relationships with 
funding partners maintaining regular dialogue 
on matters pertaining to trading and risk in the 
Group to give Directors confidence that future 
growth can be funded.
 X We maintain a strict internal review process on 
covenant compliance to ensure we remain in line 
with the requirements of our banking documents.
 X Opportunities are continually reviewed and assessed.
 Risk increased
The value of opportunities 
has significantly increased.
Changes in government policy
Current government policy is that smart meters 
are due to be offered to every home in the UK 
by 2020; this requires a large amount of capital 
investment. A large part of the Group’s growth 
strategy is geared around the exchange and 
delivery of these meter assets. Any changes 
in legislation may adversely affect the Group.
 X Actively involved with the Department of 
Business Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 
in shaping future policies.
 X Industry-respected management team, playing 
a major role within important working groups.
 X Lobbying on market-specific consultation, 
ensuring we understand the impact of a change 
in policy whilst having an active voice in the 
shaping of future policies.
 No change
The foundation stage of 
Domestic Smart is being 
rolled out and adoption 
by new entrants is high.
Reliance on performance of subcontractors
The Group relies on a number of third-party partners 
to deliver its meter exchanges and maintenance 
activities. Failure of one of these partners to deliver to 
the high expectation demanded by ourselves and our 
customers could result in loss of customer confidence 
or loss of accreditation. The Group took a strategic 
decision to safeguard its service standards through 
the acquisition of two of its third-party contractors.
 X The acquisitions of CH4 and Trojan in 2016 
significantly reduced the Group’s reliance on 
third-party providers and enable the Group to train 
and retain new dual fuel engineers to meet the 
demands of the domestic smart metering rollout.
 X The Group monitors and independently audits 
third-party partners’ accreditations, working 
practices and employee competencies.
 No change
Resource availability will 
become increasingly tight 
with the anticipated 
increase in demand.
Unforeseen delays and cost overruns when rolling out new, and upgrading existing, products
The Group may experience unforeseen delays and 
expenses in connection with a particular project or 
initiative. Although the Group has budgeted for 
expected costings, additional expenses may well be 
incurred. With the rollout of domestic smart resource 
retention, training and systems will be key. Inability 
to address these could negatively affect the Group.
 X The Group has considerable experience 
in forecasting and managing project 
implementation timetables.
 X The Group has taken steps, through its recent 
acquisitions, to ensure that it is able to mitigate 
future resource constraints that would 
otherwise have significantly hindered its ability 
to mitigate the above challenges.
 Risk increased
Complexity and challenges 
of such a large rollout within 
truncated timelines.
Loss of required accreditations
The installation and maintenance of electricity and gas 
meters within the UK is a regulated activity and, as 
such, the organisations need to maintain the required 
industry accreditations which are reviewed on an 
annual basis. Loss of these accreditations would mean 
that the Group would no longer be able to operate.
 X The Group has a dedicated compliance team 
which is responsible for ensuring that all members 
of staff are aware of our obligations. Routine 
audits are carried out and reported to the senior 
management team to ensure that compliance 
is maintained to the highest standard.
 No change
Robust audit processes 
ensure full compliance.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 20 SMS is a national business 
with offices up and down the 
UK; how does the coverage 
differ for the divisions?
All our divisions operate on a truly 
national basis, but with centres of 
excellence and management controlling 
operational delivery. Our meter 
installation business operates across a 
national footprint but with an operational 
hub based in Doncaster, where our 
training centre is also based. Our asset 
management, connections and energy 
management services are centred in 
both Glasgow and Cardiff, all of which 
is supported by a technology and IT hub 
based out of Cambridge. We focus on 
keeping close to our customers across 
all of our divisions.
What were the key client 
wins for 2017?
We were pleased in August to be 
able to announce a new meter rental 
agreement with Utility Warehouse to 
provide a minimum of 100,000 new 
meter installations and we continue to 
work with them and our entire client 
base to roll out smart metering across 
their customer portfolios. We have 
also continued to extend our energy 
and connections customer base, 
including new provision of services 
to the likes of Mitchells & Butlers 
and Liberty Global/Virgin Media.
How does the new 
management structure 
work across the divisions?
John is responsible for all activities 
associated with the creation and 
deployment of new meter assets, 
including all stock, sales, account 
management and engineering 
operational delivery. Tim is responsible 
for the management of those meter and 
data assets once they are on the wall and 
the other services we provide across 
both connections and energy 
management. This structure provides 
a clear separation of responsibility 
between asset installation and ongoing 
asset management and service provision 
but we work very closely together to 
ensure we provide a co-ordinated 
approach across the divisions.
What are the future market 
opportunities for each of 
the divisions?
The immediate opportunity for both 
asset installation and management is 
that of the smart domestic meter rollout, 
which the business has strategically 
positioned itself to be able to deliver. 
However, in many respects this will 
provide a foundation for the provision 
of wider data and energy management 
solutions enabled by the smart meter 
rollout, along with the opportunity to 
deploy a wider asset infrastructure class 
in the longer term across areas such as 
generation, storage and electric vehicle 
charging points.
What is your outlook for 2018?
We have made a very strong start 
to 2018 and aim to continue to build 
operational capacity to deliver our 
customers’ requirements across both 
the I&C and Smart Domestic market 
segments. As this operational capacity 
grows and pressure increases on energy 
suppliers to meet their domestic smart 
rollout obligations, we expect to 
continue to see increasing opportunities 
for our proven capability to critically be 
able to control delivery to the highest 
customer services. We also expect 
2018 to begin to see the transition to 
“SMETS 2” smart meters and, whilst 
this will provide some operational 
challenges, we are ensuring that we 
have the systems and processes to 
manage this business change. We 
also continue to place emphasis on 
the development of wider connections 
and energy management services, 
often mutually benefiting from data 
collection and provision opportunities. 
As a result of all these activities, we 
expect strong growth in our asset bases 
and recurring revenue streams across 
all market segments.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 21 Review of the year
In 2017 we concluded the integration of our acquisitions of CH4 and Trojan into 
the business and further strengthened our in-house installation capability to deliver 
Group meter assets. We have progressively driven efficiency improvements through 
the business during the year. Following the expected meter availability 
challenges in the first half of the year, we took the opportunity to focus on increasing 
our run rates and installation capacity month on month, investing in both the 
engineering workforce and required supporting infrastructure to support this growth. 
This increased capacity and in-house ability to grow further provides confidence to 
our clients of a secured and high quality workforce able to meet their requirements.
We are committed to continue to grow the asset installation capacity, but we are 
also focused on improving efficiency of delivery across all aspects of the business, 
not forgetting our modus operandi, which will always be “Safety First”. The capacity 
investment extends to our in-house training centre and industry-leading technical 
quality assurance team, which supports this and provides confidence to our clients, 
for quality and our ability to ramp up our installation capacity.
Business model
Our in-house operational delivery model is centred around a number 
of critical activities:
 X Technical assurance – training, development and competency management 
of all our engineering workforce.
 X Customer service – ensuring we have a dedicated customer-facing team who 
is responsible for customer experience, account management and ensuring 
we always live up to our service ethos.
 X Customer contact – innovation in customer appointment booking and 
management to ensure we maximise delivery opportunities across client 
portfolios.
 X Scheduling – whilst driving efficiency, making sure we always deliver 
on customer appointments.
 X Engineering management – day-to-day, first-class delivery through 
our trained and accredited workforce.
 X Integrated IT platforms – enabling us to integrate our services with 
our customers and provide the best customer experience.
 X Supply chain and logistics management – ensuring the right stock 
is in the right place at the right time.
This model allows us to control all aspects of operational delivery, working 
in partnership with our clients and being able to tailor our services to specific 
customer requirements. This national and large-scale engineering capability, 
as well as being able to deliver the smart meter rollout, also works to provide 
supporting maintenance and emergency services and, potentially in the future, 
installation of new asset classes partly enabled by the UK’s smart metering rollout.
Asset installation’s primary objectives are:
1. Safely deliver assets which provide long-term recurring revenue to our business.
2. Serve our customers to deliver their on-site metering requirements, 
remembering that we are the energy suppliers’ representative and that our 
success is built on customer service.
Our strategy for delivery:
The key to both these objectives is a safe, customer-focused, trained, efficient 
and growing workforce.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 22 Asset management
Business model
The asset management division is responsible for all meter and 
data assets from their initial deployment on the wall and for 
all electricity and gas industry agent appointments and related 
accreditations. As such we are responsible for tracking and 
management of our assets throughout their life, managing capital 
deployment and ensuring we realise the benefits of the significant 
investments we are making on behalf of our customers. Asset 
tracking and management reporting is therefore critical to our 
business to ensure we know where all our assets are and who 
is responsible for payment of rental charges at all times. 
Our operational model is centred on a number of 
critical activities:
 X Commercial management of all client and contractual 
relationships – ensuring that the businesses’ commercial 
interests are protected.
 X Asset tracking and management – financial and operational 
reporting, tracking and billing of all our assets.
 X Industry accreditations – ensuring compliance with industry 
bodies including MAMCoP and Elexon for our accredited 
industry services, a key enabler of our service provision.
 X Data retrieval – collection of consumption information from 
all our data assets and provision of this information to our 
customers for billing and energy management purposes.
 X IT systems – which automate and enable this activity 
across our large and growing asset base, ensuring 
performance, resilience and capacity for growth and 
security of data.
This model allows us to control all aspects of operational 
delivery, working in partnership with our clients and being 
able to tailor our services to specific customer requirements. 
This national and large-scale engineering capability, as well 
as being able to deliver the smart meter rollout, also works 
to provide supporting maintenance and emergency services 
and, potentially in the future, the installation of new asset 
classes partly enabled by the UK’s smart metering rollout.
This model ensures we are in control of the significant 
capital we are deploying and are able to ensure we realise 
the benefits of these investments over the life of our assets.
Asset management’s primary objectives are:
1. Manage all assets through their life, controlling capital 
deployment and return on investment.
2. Grow our data and accredited industry settlement services 
to provide further recurring revenue opportunities.
Our strategy for delivery:
The key to these objectives is a robust IT system to track our 
assets and deliver our accredited obligations, whilst maintaining 
strong commercial relationships with all our customers.
Case study
Asset management
During 2017 SMS Meter Assets, working with First Utility 
Limited, the largest independent UK domestic energy 
supplier, added a significant number of smart meter assets 
to the initial volumes in 2016 and our relationship continues 
to develop resulting in 2018 with an extension to the 
existing contract for a further 220,000 smart meters. 
Review of the year
2017 was a milestone year for the asset management business, with capital 
deployed and additional annualised recurring revenue greater than the two 
previous years combined, largely as a result of the business materially stepping 
into the Smart Domestic market opportunity.
Annualised recurring revenue from meter rental increased by 37% to £47.2m and, for 
both gas and electricity data services, increased by 40% to £9.7m. As a result we 
added £15.7m annualised index-linked recurring revenue to take our total to £57.0m. 
We ended the year in Q4 adding an average of £1.5m recurring revenue each month.
In 2017 we added Utility Warehouse to our contracted customer list in the 
domestic dual fuel sector, meaning we have framework contracts in place with 
nine of the largest independent energy suppliers, providing them with a fully 
managed service for the installation and management of assets.

Our energy management division has focused in 2017 on providing a platform 
for growth, investing further in data presentation and analytics systems and 
turnkey delivery capability for energy efficiency, generation and storage 
investment projects. We have also accelerated our focus on developing more 
long-term customer relationships and ensuring we maximise opportunities to 
derive increased data recurring revenue from our energy services activity and 
vice versa. Our greatest investment, however, is in our staff, whose expertise and 
knowledge provide the foundation for our services across both energy services 
and utility infrastructure and connections services. We see continued and 
increased demand for our services and have been pleased to put in place 
extended long-term contracts with our entire key customer base.

management requirements. SMS has 
been chosen as the principal contractor 
and is rolling out the full LED lighting 
project to reduce energy and carbon 
consumption across Travelodge’s 
entire 500–site portfolio.
Business model
The energy management division is responsible for ensuring customers realise 
the benefit of consumption data and to enable them to reduce their energy spend 
and carbon footprints. We are a specialist partner for managing energy and we 
do this by addressing all of the drivers that underpin the energy budget – taking 
a holistic, data-driven, systems-based approach, but delivering a range of specific 
services to maximise energy saving.

efficiency. Our data-driven strategies set clear and realistic objectives for 
efficient energy usage. Our strategies are based on energy assessment surveys 
and made possible by our bespoke energy data platform. With the right data 
at our disposal we target areas for improvement and set parameters for usage 
and deliver turnkey projects to reduce energy consumption.
This model ensures we are able to deliver tangible savings to our customers, 
underpinned by our data collection and analytics capability, and also provide 
recurring revenue opportunities for our metering and data collection services. 
Energy management’s primary objectives are:
1. Enable end customers to reduce their energy consumption, carbon footprints 
and energy costs through a data-driven approach.
2. Develop long-term customer relationships facilitating our full range of energy 
and data services.
3. Extend our services to support investment in wider asset classes, such as 
energy efficiency, generation, storage and electric vehicle infrastructure initially 
in the I&C market but also across the domestic segment.
Our strategy for delivery:
The key to these objectives is the development of skilled, expert and 
knowledgeable staff, aligned to our vision to deliver the transformation and 
decarbonisation of the UK energy system.

do a professional job and, above all, 
do it in a safe manner. Our people 
are our biggest asset. 
Learning and development continues 
to be an area of focus for us, as we 
firmly believe that investment in our 
employees has a direct and positive 
impact on our employee retention 
rates and the engagement levels of

With further investment we are 
increasing capacity and capability. 
In 2017 we delivered over 4,400 days 
of training across the Group. Many of 
our training programmes are tailored 
specifically for SMS employees and 
utilise real-life scenarios. This approach 
results in training programmes which 
are standardised and which reinforce 
our core values and helps to create 
a workforce that represents the high 
levels of performance the 
business demands.
We recognise that it is in the best 
interests of the Company and of our 
employees to create standardised 
processes wherever possible and to 
utilise technology to consolidate our 
information systems. As part of this 
journey, we are rolling out several 
nationwide initiatives to further 
develop these systems.

competencies are assessed prior to 
acceptance onto the SMS contractor 
supply database. We are proud that all 
of our contractors operate within our 
Environmental policy and contractor’s 
code of conduct before carrying out 
any work on behalf of SMS.

The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the 
Company and to discuss the measures required for its future 
development. Directors are provided in advance with a formal 
agenda of matters to be discussed at each meeting and with 
the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of 
the Company. Separate strategy meetings and meetings with 
senior executives are also held throughout the year. Records 
of all meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained 
by the Company Secretary. All of the Directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their 
appointment to the Board and to re‑ election by shareholders 
at least once every three years. In addition, any Non ‑ executive 
Director who has served on the Board for more than nine 
years will be subject to annual re‑ election.
The Chairman and Non‑ executive Directors have other 
third‑party commitments including directorships of other 
companies. The Company is satisfied that these associated 
commitments have no measurable impact on their ability 
to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The Executive 
Directors have no third‑ party commitments.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board 
for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and 
that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. 
In addition, the Company Secretary will ensure that the 
Directors receive appropriate training as necessary. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole. All Directors are supplied 
with information in a timely manner in a form, and of a 
quality, appropriate to enable them to discharge their duties.
The Board recognises that a healthy corporate culture is 
fundamental to SMS’s business purpose and strategy. Senior 
management has a critical role in setting the tone of our 
organisation and championing the behaviours we expect 
to see. Management is committed throughout the year to 
highlight the values, beliefs and business approach to health 
and safety, business integrity, customer experience, diversity 
and inclusion. Various indicators are used to monitor and 
provide insight into SMS’s culture, including employee 
engagement, health, safety and wellbeing measures and 
diversity indicators. The state of our culture is assessed 
through compliance reviews, internal audit and formal and 
informal channels for employees to speak up. We ensure 
action is taken to address behaviour that falls short of 
our expectations.
Board evaluation
The Company has implemented a formal process of annual 
performance evaluation for the Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors. The intention is that a performance 
evaluation of the Board, the Board Committees and 
individual Directors will be conducted annually and the 
method for such review will continue to be reviewed by 
the Board in order to optimise the process.
The Company has Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
in place.
Audit Committee
During the year the Audit Committee comprised 
Graeme Bissett (Chair), Miriam Greenwood and 
Willie MacDiarmid. Meetings are also attended, by invitation, 
by the Chief Financial Officer and Head of Internal Audit.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 31 Board evaluation continued
Audit Committee continued
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board with 
the discharge of its responsibilities in relation to financial 
reporting including reviewing the Group’s Annual Report 
and Accounts and half‑ year financial statements, reviewing 
and monitoring the scope of the annual audit and the extent 
of non‑ audit work undertaken by external auditor, advising 
on the appointment of the external auditor and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the internal audit function, internal controls, 
whistleblowing and fraud systems in place within the Group.
The Audit Committee meets at least three times in each 
financial year and has unrestricted access to the Group’s 
external auditor.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Remuneration Committee 
comprised Miriam Greenwood (Chair), Willie MacDiarmid 
and Graeme Bissett. The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance of the Executive Directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board on matters relating to their 
remuneration and terms of service. The Remuneration 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on 
proposals for the granting of share options and other equity 
incentives pursuant to any employee share option scheme 
or equity incentive plans in operation from time to time.
Nomination Committee
During the year the Nomination Committee was chaired by 
Willie MacDiarmid and also comprised Miriam Greenwood, 
Graeme Bissett and Alan Foy. The Nomination Committee 
considers the selection and re‑ appointment of Directors. It 
identifies and nominates candidates to fill Board vacancies 
and regularly reviews the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge and experience) of the 
Board and makes recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes.
Information and Technology Committee
The Board took the decision to form a new committee 
which will become operational in 2018. The Information 
and Technology Committee will be chaired by Kelly Olsen 
and also comprise Graeme Bissett, Miriam Greenwood, 
Willie MacDiarmid and Alan Foy. The Information and 
Technology Committee will consider the development 
and implementation of SMS’s major technology innovation 
strategies, review overarching technology and process strategy, 
architecture and roadmaps and make recommendations 
to the Board, as appropriate, regarding significant and/or 
strategic technology investments which support the 
Company’s strategy.
Accountability
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing 
the effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only be 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can therefore only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Whistleblowing
The Group encourages staff to report any concerns which 
they feel need to be brought to the attention of management 
concerning any possible impropriety, financial or otherwise. 
The Group has put in place a whistleblowing procedure 
where employees can confidentially report any concerns or 
wrong doing. This may be used to report incidents of fraud, 
bribery and corruption, discrimination, bullying or harassment, 
breaches of the Group’s health and safety or quality compliance 
or environmental concerns. The Group provides the Audit 
Committee with information in relation to matters reported, 
any subsequent investigation and follow‑ up actions.
Relationship with shareholders
The Company values its dialogue with both institutional 
and private investors. Effective two‑ way communication 
with fund managers, institutional investors and analysts 
is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as 
performance, policy and strategy.
Private investors are encouraged to participate in the AGM 
at which the Chairman presents a review of the results and 
comments on current business activity. The Chairs of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees will be available at 
the AGM to answer any shareholder questions.
We actively seek dialogue with the market as understanding 
what analysts and investors think about us is a key part of 
driving our business forward. Discussions with the market 
provide us with the opportunity to understand analysts’ and 
investors’ views on the Company’s strategy and performance. 
The Board receives regular updates on the views of shareholders 
through briefings and reports from the CEO and our retained 
advisers. In addition, our Non ‑ executive Directors are available 
to meet shareholders if they wish to raise any issues separately.
Financial results and other notable news releases such as 
contract wins and changes to our strategy are published via 
the London Stock Exchange’s Regulatory News Service (RNS).
Notice of the AGM is posted as an enclosure of the 
Annual Report.
Other matters
Brexit
The Board discussed a number of issues arising from the UK’s 
vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. We are closely 
following developments arising as a result of the UK’s decision 
to leave the European Union. Our review work undertaken so 
far shows that Brexit will have little impact for our business 
and we will continue to monitor this area.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, having given consideration to 
various alternative outcomes of future performance and 
forecast capital expenditure together with the available bank 
facilities, they are satisfied that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in business for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 32 Audit Committee
Audit Committee statement
The Committee meets at least three times a year generally 
just prior to Board meetings to facilitate immediate and 
efficient reporting to the Board, with additional meetings 
where necessary. The external auditor, the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer attend Committee 
meetings by invitation. The Committee also meets separately 
with the external auditor without others being present. 
The Chairman of the Committee maintains a regular 
dialogue with the Chief Financial Officer and his team.
Objectives and responsibilities
The Committee’s key objectives are to provide effective 
governance over SMS’s financial reporting and the performance 
of the external auditor; to provide oversight of the Group’s 
systems of internal financial control; and to report to the 
Board on these matters. 
In fulfilment of these objectives the Committee:
 X reviews SMS’s financial statements and announcements 
and considers whether these statements and announcements 
provide a fair, balanced and understandable view of 
the strategy and performance of SMS and of the 
associated risks;
 X considers the appropriateness of accounting policies 
and significant accounting judgements and the disclosure 
of these in the financial statements; 
 X oversees the relationship with and performance of the 
external auditor; and
 X reviews the effectiveness of financial controls and systems.
Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the 
oversight of the Group’s internal control, including risk 
management framework and the work of the internal 
audit function. The Group has in place an internal control 
environment to protect the business from the material risks 
which have been identified. Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over 
financial reporting and the Commitee has responsibility for 
monitoring the effectiveness of these controls. Risk registers 
are maintained and regularly reviewed by management and 
the Board, as a whole, including the Audit Committee, considers 
the principal risks, the nature and extent of the Company’s risk 
management framework and the risk profile that is acceptable 
in order to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives.
Internal audit
Internal audit undertakes financial and operational audits 
across the Group using a risk‑ based methodology and 
in accordance with the changing risk profile of the 
Company. Monitoring and review of the scope, extent and 
effectiveness of the activity of the Group’s internal audit 
activities is an agenda item at each Committee meeting. 
The Committee receives updates from the Head of Internal 
Audit on audit reports, the results of any unsatisfactory 
audits and the action plans to address these areas. The 
Chair also meets with the Head of Internal Audit without 
management being present to set annual objectives and 
any significant issues arising from their work. Due to the 
increasing pace of change of the business, initiatives are 
continuing to be implemented to evolve and strengthen 
the effectiveness of internal audit.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 33 Financial reporting and statutory audit
The Committee has reviewed with both management 
and the external auditor the annual financial statements, 
focusing on: the overall truth and fairness of the results and 
financial position, including the clarity of disclosures shown 
in the statements and their compliance with best practice 
requirements; the appropriateness of the accounting policies 
and practices used in arriving at those results; the resolution 
of significant accounting judgements or of matters raised by 
the external auditor during the course of their annual statutory 
audit; and the quality of the Annual Report taken as a whole, 
including disclosures on governance, strategy, risks and 
remuneration, and whether it gives a fair, balanced and 
understandable picture of the Group.
External audit
The Committee discussed, challenged and agreed with Ernst 
& Young its detailed audit plans prepared in advance of the 
audit, which set out its assessment of key audit risks and 
materiality accounting policies, practices and judgements.
The selection of appropriate accounting policies and 
practices is the responsibility of management; the Committee 
discussed these with both management and the external 
auditor. Significant areas considered by the Committee in 
relation to the 2017 financial statements are set out below.
Graeme Bissett
Chair of the Audit Committee
13 March 2018
Area of judgement Matter considered Action
Capitalisation of internal 
installation costs
Pursuant to the acquisitions of 
two meter installation businesses in 
2016, SMS carries out a significant level 
of in‑ house installation of customers’ 
meter assets, the costs of which are 
capitalised and depreciated as part 
of fixed asset depreciation.
The Committee considered management’s 
capitalisation process and the assumptions 
and judgements used when assessing 
whether expenditure should be capitalised.
Existence of smart meter inventory 
held by third parties
Due to forecast demand for smart 
meters, SMS has increased the level of 
inventory held and managed by two 
third parties at external warehouses.
The Committee considers the controls and 
procedures performed by management 
in relation to existence of inventory held 
by third parties. 
Recoverability of termination income 
and the impact on traditional domestic 
meter assets’ residual values
Termination income is an ever more 
prevalent income stream within the 
SMS business due to the domestic smart 
rollout and the level of recoverability 
requires significant judgement. The 
Group considers each significant 
customer individually with the relevant 
circumstances to which it relates, taking 
into account a number of factors. This 
informs the judgements made with 
respect to residual values. 
The Committee considered the judgements 
made by management, the quantum 
and the disclosure of relevant amounts. 
The Committee is aware that the 
Board receives a report on termination 
recoverability and provisioning each 
month and has assessed the Group’s 
processes for calculating and regularly 
monitoring termination income 
recoverability. The Committee confirmed 
with management that there has been 
no change to expected useful economic 
life and that judgements and estimates 
were reasonable and appropriate.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 34 Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is currently made up of the 
Non‑ executive Directors, each of whom is independent, and 
one Executive Director. The main focus for the Committee in 
2017 was the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer. 
You will see from the table that the Committee met on 
two occasions. In addition, we held a number of informal 
meetings and discussions with the Chief Executive Officer 
and others.
Appointment of Chief Financial Officer and 
Non-executive Director
In March 2017 the Committee appointed David Harris as 
Chief Financial Officer. However, unfortunately in August 2017 
David Harris resigned from the Board due to health reasons. 
Subsequently the Committee appointed David Thompson 
as Chief Financial Officer in September 2017. A formal and 
transparent procedure was followed by the Company when 
carrying out this search. When considering candidates the 
Board took into account a number of factors including the 
skills and expertise of the candidates. 
On 24 January 2018, the Company announced the appointment 
of Kelly Olsen as a Non‑ executive Director. The Committee 
was keen to identify candidates with experience in information 
technology given the Company considers technology to be 
a core component of the business. Kelly will chair a newly 
created Information and Technology Committee of the 
Board, reviewing and providing strategic guidance on 
development of the Company’s technology programmes.
Board composition and diversity
Our policy is to have a broad range of skills, background 
and experience. 
We do not set any particular targets but we fully recognise 
the benefits of greater diversity and will continue to take 
account of this when considering any particular appointment. 
We will continue to ensure that we appoint the best people 
for the relevant roles. 
All Directors will be consulted on the composition of the 
Board, as to the size, the appropriate range of skills and the 
balance between Executive and Non‑ executive Directors, as 
part of the Board evaluation process to be undertaken in 2018.

for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. The Report 
has been prepared by the Committee and approved by the 
Board of Directors (“the Board”).
The Committee and the Board acknowledge that as an 
AIM‑ quoted business the remuneration reporting 
requirements set out under section 420(1) of the Companies 
Act 2006 are not mandatory. However, we have chosen to 
report to our stakeholders to ensure transparency in respect 
of the Company’s policies for Executive and senior 
management remuneration.
The Committee will continue to adopt this approach to 
provide clear reporting both on past remuneration and 
future policy. 
The Report has been arranged in the following three parts:
 X the Chair’s Annual Statement, summarising and 
explaining the major decisions on, and any substantial 
changes to, Executive Directors’ remuneration in the year;
 X the Directors’ remuneration policy, which sets out the 
Group’s forward‑ looking policy for Executive and 
Non‑ executive Directors and the key factors which were 
taken into account in setting the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration policy; and
 X the Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out 
details of Executive Directors’ remuneration for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration is subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the AGM on Wednesday 23 May 2018.

Remuneration outcomes for the year ended 
31 December 2017
The principal aim of our remuneration policy is to ensure 
Executive Directors and senior management are rewarded 
for achieving our strategy of delivering long‑ term value to our 
shareholders. The importance of aligning our remuneration 
arrangements with the Company’s strategic priorities played 
a crucial role in the Committee’s decision making during 
the year. The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to 
ensure that the Executive Directors and senior managers are 
fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution 
to the overall long‑ term performance of the Company, in 
a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, 
motivate and retain Executives of the quality necessary 
to ensure the success the Company. 
Remuneration of Executive Directors is structured to 
ensure that:
 X the fixed element of pay, salary, pension and benefits 
is benchmarked against comparable companies of similar 
size and complexity;
 X a substantial proportion of Executive Directors and 
senior management remuneration is linked to the Group’s 
performance; and
 X remuneration rewards specific KPIs which deliver, inter 
alia, long‑ term value to shareholders, a safe operating 
environment, compliance will relevant health and safety 
policies and outstanding service to customers.
In line with our remuneration policy, the Company has an 
annual bonus plan with the aim of incentivising Executive 
Directors to achieve demanding annual targets relating 
to the Company’s financial performance, health and safety 
performance and personal strategic objectives.
During the year, the Committee discussed the steps required 
to provide statutory information relating to the gender pay 
gap legislation.
External advice 
 X During the period, the Committee engaged FIT 
Remuneration Consultants to assist with benchmarking 
Executive Directors’ and Non‑ executives Directors’ 
remuneration and the redesign of the LTIP and 
CSOP scheme.
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders 
vote to accept the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 37 Remuneration Committee continued
Directors’ remuneration policy (“the Policy”)
This section contains details of the Policy as prepared by 
the Committee. The Policy encompasses all remuneration 
in respect of Executive Directors, the Chairman and 
Non‑executive Directors.
The Policy will be displayed on the Group’s website 
(www.sms‑ plc.com) within the Annual Report, under the 
investor relations section, immediately following the 2018 
AGM (to be held on Wednesday 23 May 2018).
The objective of the Policy is to ensure that the overall 
remuneration of Executive Directors is aligned with the 
performance and objectives of the Group and preserves an 
appropriate balance of growth and shareholder value.
In 2017 the Committee has undertaken a review of the 
long‑ term incentives on offer for Executive Directors 
and other senior members of staff which has led to 
the development of a Long Term Incentive Plan and 
CSOP intended for introduction during 2018.
Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non‑ executive Directors, including 
the Chairman, is determined by the Executive Directors after 
external benchmarking. Non‑ executive Directors are not 
entitled to pensions, annual bonuses or employee benefits. 
Each of the Non‑ executive Directors has a letter of 
appointment stating their annual fee and that their 
appointment is for a term of three years. Their appointment 
may be terminated on three months’ written notice at any 
time. The level of Non‑ executive Directors’ fees was 
unchanged during the year.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
The main components of the Policy for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and the linkage to and support for the 
Company’s business strategy are summarised below:
 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Potential remuneration Performance metrics
Salary
To be set at a level which 
is sufficiently competitive 
to recruit and retain 
individuals of the 
appropriate calibre to 
deliver the Company’s 
strategy and which takes 
into account the Director’s 
experience and personal 
contribution to the 
Company’s strategy.
Salaries are typically reviewed annually, 
with any changes effective from 1 January. 
The review takes into account:
 X Company performance;
 X the role, experience and performance 
of the individual Director; and
 X average workforce salary adjustments 
within the Company.
Salaries are benchmarked from time to time 
against comparable roles at companies of a 
similar size and complexity.
Increases normally for 
inflation and in line with 
other employees, or in 
order to ensure that 
base salaries properly 
reflect the size, 
complexity and growth 
rate of the Company. 
The Executives’ base 
salary was reviewed 
on 1 January 2017 and 
there was no increase. 
On 1 January 2018 the 
Executive Directors 
received an inflationary 
increase in line with 
other employees.

Benefits
To complement basic 
salary by providing

Pension
To provide retirement 
benefits which, when 
taken together with 
other elements of 
the remuneration 
package, will enable 
the Company to attract 
and retain Executives.
The Executive Directors (together with all 
other eligible staff) are able to participate 
in the Company’s defined contribution 
(money purchase) pension scheme.
The Company contributes a maximum 
of 5% of salary.
A contribution of up to 
5% per annum of salary 
is paid into the scheme, 
by the Company, on 
behalf of the CFO. 
The CEO does 
not participate in 
the scheme. A pension 
contribution is paid into 
a private pension plan 
for the CEO.
n/a
Annual bonus
To incentivise the 
achievement of the 
Company’s annual 
financial targets.
The Executive Directors (senior management 
team) participate in a discretionary, annual, 
performance related bonus scheme. 
T argets are set at the beginning of each 
year based on the recommendations of 
the Remuneration Committee.
Bonuses are paid in cash based on the audited 
financial results.
For the Executive 
Directors, the maximum 
potential bonus is 100% 
of annual base salary.
For the year ended 
2017, the targets were 
based on, inter alia, 
profit before tax 
excluding exceptionals, 
recurring revenues and 
there being no material 
health and safety 
incidences.
Individual cash bonus
Only paid to recognise an 
exceptional contribution to 
a discrete project outside 
the ordinary course of 
business requiring the 
Executive Director to 
commit time and effort 
significantly over and 
above their normal duties.
Bonus to be paid at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and based on the 
formal recommendation of the Chairman.
Maximum potential 
bonus at the discretion 
of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Committee to evaluate 
the contribution of the 
Director to any project 
outside the ordinary 
course of the business 
with a particular 
emphasis on level of 
commitment made by 
the Executive Director.
We intend to launch a new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) during the course of 2018. The Committee has taken advice 
from external specialist remuneration consultants in designing a scheme which we believe will ensure a clear and transparent 
alignment of interest between management and shareholders together with the longer‑ term retention and incentivisation 
of the Executives involved. We will report on this fully at the appropriate time.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
It is the Company’s policy to provide for twelve months’ notice for termination of employment for Executive Directors, to 
be given by either party. For Executive Directors who have been newly recruited from outside the Group, the period would 
normally be six months, increasing to twelve months after twelve months’ service. The Company’s policy is to limit severance 
payments on termination to pre‑ established contractual arrangements; if the Company believes it appropriate to protect its 
interests, it may also make additional payments in exchange for non‑ compete/non‑ solicitation terms which are above and 
beyond those in the Director’s contract of employment. Typically, these will serve to extend the non‑ compete period for up 
to nine months from the date of termination. The Committee has discretion to contribute towards outplacement services and 
the legal fees for any departing Director to the extent it considers appropriate. Under normal circumstances, the Company 
may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to basic salary and 
benefits for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination. In case of gross misconduct, a provision is included 
in the Executive’s contract for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable. During the year, £139,605 was payable to 
two Directors as settlements following resignation.
Treatment of annual bonus on termination of employment
The Committee has discretion to determine that in the event an Executive Director leaves the Company, bonus payments may be 
paid once performance has been measured and on a pro‑ rated basis for the time spent in active employment with the Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 42 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report, the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the separate Corporate Governance Statement and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Company financial statements for each financial 
year. The Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the 
London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and have 
elected under company law to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including FRS 102 The 
Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland.
The Group financial statements are required by law and 
IFRSs adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the Group; the Companies 
Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 X select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 X make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable;
 X for the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and, for the Company financial statements, 
state whether applicable UK accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Company financial 
statements; and
 X prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Smart Metering Systems plc website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from

Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters X Recoverability of termination income and the impact on traditional domestic meter assets residual values.
 X Appropriateness of capitalisation of overheads and other expenses within domestic meter assets.
 X Existence of smart meter inventory held by third parties.
Audit scope X We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components and audit procedures 
on specific balances for a further three components.
 X The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 97% of pre-tax 
profit before exceptional items, 93% of revenue and 99% of total assets.
Materiality X Overall group materiality of £1.0m, which represents 5% of adjusted pre-tax profits before exceptional items.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of termination income 
within trade and other receivables 
(£25.7m, PY comparative £15.8m) and 
the impact on traditional domestic 
meter assets residual values
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 33); accounting policies (page 56); 
and note 14 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 69).
At 31 December 2017 the Group carried 
total meter assets amounting to £262m 
(2016: £155m).
The UK government target to replace all 
traditional domestic meters with smart 
meters means that traditional meters will 
be removed early. The current useful life 
of the Group’s traditional domestic meters 
reflects management’s assessment of the 
impact of the replacement programme 
on existing traditional meter assets.
The deinstallation of traditional domestic 
meter assets whilst within their customer 
contract term gives rise to termination 
income designed to compensate the group 
for loss of future earnings and carrying 
value of the asset. Variances in contractual 
terms increase the complexity of assessing 
recoverability of termination income.
The expected recoverability of termination 
income impacts the residual value of 
traditional domestic meters and amounts 
due on meters that have been removed. 
We identified controls designed by 
management to assess the recoverability 
of termination income and its impact on 
the residual value of traditional domestic 
meter assets portfolio and ensured these 
had been implemented. 
We reperformed management’s 
calculation of residual value and agreed 
the depreciation charge to a sample of 
depreciation rates for specific items with 
the fixed register. Specifically this included 
checking the clerical accuracy of the 
model and the integrity of source inputs. 
We evaluated the judgements applied 
by management to estimate the residual 
value. Specifically this included assessing 
the recoverability of termination fees and 
the impact on residual values.
We assessed the recoverability of earned 
termination fees by:
 X Reviewing contractual agreements with 
key customers to assess management’s 
judgement of recoverability.
 X Inspecting evidence of payments 
received during and subsequent to 
the year end. Where payment was 
not received we inspected the latest 
correspondence between the Group 
and customers to assess recoverability.
 X We obtained an understanding of 
changes in assumptions from the prior 
year. We inspected evidence of payment 
and correspondence from customers to 
evaluate management’s assumptions.
Based on the audit procedures 
performed we assessed the 
estimate of the residual value, 
useful economic life and 
recoverability of termination 
income to be reasonable.
We also consider there to be 
sufficient evidence to support 
management’s expectation that 
termination income recognised 
is recoverable. F

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
The depreciation charge for meters is 
impacted by residual value and the expected 
remaining useful economic life of the meter. 
Significant judgement is applied by 
management to estimate the recoverability 
of the termination income and the expected 
useful economic life. Variations in contractual 
terms by customer increase the complexity 
In making these assessments.
We considered the appropriateness of the 
related disclosures in notes and application 
of accounting policies in the Group 
Financial Statements.
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
one location, which covered 100% of 
the risk amount.
Appropriateness of capitalisation 
of overheads and other expenses 
within the total additions capitalised 
within plant and machinery (£122.8m, 
PY comparative £42.5m)
Refer to Audit Committee Report (page 33); 
accounting policies (page 56); and note 10 
in the group financial statements.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group carried 
total meter assets amounting to £262m 
(2016: £155m). This includes internal 
operational costs that have been 
capitalised in the current year.
As a result of the UK Government target 
to replace traditional domestic meters 
with smart meters the Group has incurred 
significant capital expenditure increasing 
the number of domestic smart meters 
under management. 
Since the acquisition of CH4 and Trojan 
a significant proportion of the Group’s 
smart meters are fitted by its in-house 
engineering team.
The significant risk relates to the 
appropriateness of the judgements 
made by management when assessing 
the appropriate categories and proportion 
of overheads and other expenses that are 
directly attributable to the installation of 
each domestic smart meter. 
We identified controls designed by 
management to determine the categories 
and proportion of overheads and other 
expenses directly attributable to bringing 
the meter assets into use by the group’s 
in-house engineering teams and ensured 
these had been implemented.
We evaluated the judgement applied by 
management to assess the appropriate 
categories and proportion of overheads 
and other expenses that are directly 
attributable to installation of meter assets. 
This included:
 X Assessment of the capitalisation 
methodology applied
 X Assessment of the key assumptions 
made by management, such as 
directly attributable headcount, 
directly attributable overheads, 
number of meter fits and engineer 
training requirements by obtaining 
supporting information
We benchmarked the average 
installation cost capitalised to contracted 
third-party installation costs to assess the 
reasonableness of amount capitalised.
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
one location, which covered 100% of 
the risk amount.
Based on the results of our 
audit procedures, we consider 
the amounts capitalised for meters 
installed by in-house engineers 
to be reasonable.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Existence of smart meter inventory held 
by third parties
Refer to Audit Committee Report 
(page 33) and note 13 in the group 
financial statements (page 69).
As at 31 December 2017 the Group carried 
inventory amounting to £16.5m (2016: £6.1m). 
A proportion of inventory is managed by 
third parties at the year-end.
To meet the increased demand for 
smart meter installations the Group has 
increased the level of installation inventory 
held and managed by two third parties at 
external warehouses, drop-boxes and 
engineers’ vans.
The Group is reliant on reporting from 
a single third-party installer of the levels 
of smart meter inventory held. The number 
of locations, systems and third parties 
responsible for managing the movement 
of inventory increases the risk of an error 
in the quantity of inventory reported to 
the Group. 
The significant risk relates to inventory 
existence arising from a misstatement in 
the quantity of inventory on hand reported 
to the group by the third-party installer. 
We identified controls designed 
by management to assess the 
appropriateness of the levels of 
smart meter inventory held at 
third-party locations and ensured 
these had been implemented.
We tested the controls over inventory by 
attending and obtaining results of perpetual 
inventory physical counts around year end 
and during the year at one third-party 
location holding a material quantity of 
inventory. We attended a full stock count 
at the other third-party location. 
We tested the Group’s reconciliation 
of inventory managed by third party 
at the year end. Specifically this included 
obtaining an understanding of reconciling 
items and confirming quantities to 
source documentation including 
third-party confirmation.
We performed cut off testing on inventory 
receipts and usage around the year end.
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
one location, which covered 100% of 
the risk amount.
Based on the results of the 
procedures performed we 
conclude the smart meter 
inventory held by third parties 
exists and is owned by the Group. 
In the prior year, our Auditor’s Report did not report key audit matters.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our 
audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, 
changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work 
to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the eight reporting components of the Group, we selected six 
components covering entities, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the six components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components (“full scope 
components”), which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three components (“specific 
scope components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had 
the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of 
these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 97% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s adjusted 
profit before tax (PBT) before exceptional items, 93% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 99% (2016: 99%) of the Group’s 
total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 79% (2016: 68%) of the Group’s adjusted PBT before 
exceptional items, 82% (2016: 90%) of the Group’s revenue and 97% (2016: 99%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific scope 
component contributed 18% (2016: 32%) of the Group’s adjusted PBT before exceptional items, 11% (2016: 10%) of the Group’s 
revenue and 2% (2016: 2%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of 
all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.
Of the remaining two components that together represent 3% of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax and before exceptional 
items, none are individually greater than 5% of the Group’s adjusted PBT before exceptional items. For these components, we 
performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to 
respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

Changes from the prior year 
The reduction in coverage from the prior year reflects the reduction in scope for two components of the Group from specific 
scope to review scope. This reflects the growth of the full scope locations and reorganisation of the business during the year.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group 
audit team.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the 
nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1.0m (2016: £0.9m), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of pre-tax profit before exceptional 
items (2016: pre-tax profit). We believe that pre-tax profits before exceptional items provides us with an appropriate materiality 
threshold for the users of the financial statements. 
We determined materiality for the parent company to be £3.56m (2016: £0.5m), which is 2% (2016: 2%) of total equity.

Materiality
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality from forecast pre-tax profits to actual pre-tax profits after 
exceptional items which reduced our materiality by £0.1m. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the members of Smart Metering Systems plc
Our application of materiality continued
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 50% (2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £0.5m (2016: £0.45m). We have set 
performance materiality at 50% based on our expectation and likelihood of misstatements taking into account the internal 
control environment, accounting systems and level of estimation in the financial statements.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.1m to £0.4m 
(2016: £0.09m to £0.37m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.05m 
(2016: £0.05m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 2 to 43, other than the 
financial statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 X the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 X the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. F
Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 51
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 X adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 X the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 X certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 X we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

Consolidated statement of cash flows
For the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 56
Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 were approved and authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 13 March 2018. Smart Metering Systems plc is a public limited 
company limited by shares and incorporated in Scotland, with its registered office at 2nd Floor, 48 St. Vincent Street, 
Glasgow G2 5TS. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on AIM.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in British Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern
Management prepares budgets and forecasts on a rolling 24-month basis. These forecasts cover operational cash flows 
and investment capital expenditure. The Group has committed bank facilities of £280m which extend to November 2020.
Based on the current projections and facilities in place, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to prepare the 
financial statements on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts of the Group include the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and subsidiary undertakings 
in which Smart Metering Systems plc has a controlling interest. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has all of the following: power over the investee 
(i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); exposure, or rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee; and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Use of estimates and judgements
The Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or if the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
Critical accounting judgements 
The following are the critical judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
 X capitalisation of internal installation costs:
 X a significant level of in-house installation of customers’ meter assets is carried out by the Group, the costs of which are 
capitalised and depreciated as part of fixed asset depreciation. Judgement is required by management to ascertain the 
appropriate categories and proportion of overheads and other expenses that are directly attributable to installation of 
meter assets; and 
 X recoverability of termination income and the impact on traditional domestic meter assets residual values:
 X the timing of the removal of traditional domestic meters during the smart meter rollout and the associated termination 
fees impact the residual value of these meters on subsequent disposal. Judgement is required around the expected pace 
of the smart meter replacement programme to ensure any gains or losses on disposal are minimised. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that may 
have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below:
 X impairment of goodwill:
 X management reviews the valuation of goodwill for impairment annually or if events and changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use. F
Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 57
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts 
and VAT.
Revenue is recognised when the significant rewards and risk of ownership have been passed to the buyer. The risk and rewards 
of ownership transfer when the Group fulfils its contractual obligations to customers by supplying services. 
Meter rental income
Rental income represents operating lease payments receivable from gas and electricity suppliers. Revenue is recognised on 
a straight line basis over the lease term. Rental income is calculated on a daily basis and invoiced monthly. Rental contracts do 
not operate on a fixed-term basis and are cancellable at any time by the lessee, in which case termination payments are levied 
and recognised as other operating income in accordance with the terms of the contract with immediate effect and do not transfer 
risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset. They are therefore considered as operating lease arrangements and 
accounted for as such.
In line with the underlying contractual terms, termination fees due are recognised at fair value upon notification 
of de-appointment and are classified as other operating income.
Utility connection
Revenue from connection contracts is recognised upon delivery of the related service.
Data management
Data income is recognised on a straight line basis over the contract period. Amounts invoiced in advance are recorded 
as deferred income.
Energy management
Energy advice is provided and revenue is recognised when risk and reward transfers. Advice is normally quite specific 
so recognised on a transactional basis.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables.
Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or loans and 
borrowings, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial 
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings and financial 
guarantee contracts.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Consolidated statement of financial 
position, if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Group has used derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge its interest rate risk. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. The Group has not designated any derivatives for hedge accounting.
Exceptional items and separately disclosed items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income those material 
items of income and expense which, because of the nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit 
separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in that year, so as 
to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance. Termination fee income 
is reported as a separately disclosed item given the materiality and nature. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Smart Metering Systems plc Annual report and accounts 2017 58
Accounting policies continued
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Research and development 
Expenditure on pure and applied research activities is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on product development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and 
the Group intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development; if future economic benefits are 
probable; and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated, when the product or system is available for use, so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its 
estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
 X Amortisation  10% on cost straight line
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from third parties are recognised as assets and measured at cost.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost at the date of acquisition less any amortisation and any 
impairment losses. Amortisation costs are included within the administrative expenses disclosed in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises 
from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives as follows:
 X Software  12.5% and 20% s traight line
 X Customer contracts 20%
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Longer life software is related to underlying meter assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible 
assets. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. See note 12 for detailed assumptions and methodology. Impairment losses are not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those 
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose identified 
according to its operating segment.
Provisional fair values are adjusted against goodwill if additional information is obtained within one year of the acquisition date 
about facts or circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Other changes in provisional fair values are recognised through 
profit or loss.
Changes in contingent consideration arising from additional information, obtained within one year of the acquisition date, 
about facts or circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill. Other changes 
in contingent consideration are recognised through profit or loss, unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity. 
In such circumstances, changes are recognised within equity.
Impairment
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangibles to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU 
to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. F
Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 59
Impairment continued
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Detailed assumptions used in the annual impairment tests with regard to discount, growth and inflation rates are set out 
in note 12 to the accounts.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment. When significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful 
lives and depreciation, respectively. Pursuant to the acquisition of the meter installation businesses on 18 March 2016 (see note 
27) certain internal costs to the Group are also capitalised where they are demonstrated as being directly attributable to 
bringing the meter rental assets into their useable condition.
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
 X Freehold property   2% on c ost 
 X Short leasehold property Shorter of the lease term or 15% and 20% on cost 
 X Plant and machinery   5%, 10% and 20% on c ost
 X Fixtures, fittings and equipment 15% and 33% on c ost
 X Motor vehicles   25% on c ost
 X Land is not depreciated.
During 2016, the Directors reassessed the useful life of domestic meters that were due to be replaced before the end of their 
useful life as part of the smart meter rollout programme. An exercise was undertaken to identify all meters affected and their 
useful life was shortened from 20 years to 5 years. In addition, the receipt of termination income under certain circumstances 
when meter rental assets are removed before the end of their useful life was also reflected in a revision to residual values. 
These factors resulted in a net increase to the overall depreciation charge of £685,000 in 2016.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised. The asset’s residual values, useful lives 
and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprises direct materials. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Consolidated statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Hire purchase agreements
Assets held under hire purchase agreements are capitalised and disclosed under property, plant and equipment at their 
fair value. The capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the notional interest is charged to the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in proportion to the remaining balance outstanding.
Leased assets and obligations as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised 
in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the 
inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recorded in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
The lease payments are apportioned between finance charges to the income statement and a reduction of the lease obligations. 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the applicable lease periods. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Group as lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets are classified 
as operating leases with meter income recognised in line with the meter rental income policy.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group. The annual contributions payable are charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments. The Group issues equity-settled 
share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Group’s various employee share and option schemes. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity–settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate 
of the shares that will ultimately vest. Own shares held under trust for the Group’s employee share schemes are classed as 
treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders’ equity. Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in 
shareholders’ equity.
Taxation
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from accounting profit as reported 
in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The deferred tax balance is calculated based on tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets include temporary differences related to employee benefits settled via the issue of share options. 
Recognition of the deferred tax assets assumes share options will have a positive value at the date of vesting, which is greater 
than the exercise price.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 61
Standards and interpretations continued
For standards with a future effective date, management is reviewing the impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
The key considerations are as follows:
IFRS 15 
An impact assessment has been performed on new standard IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) which 
SMS plc will adopt from 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on 
the delivery of performance obligations and an assessment of when control is transferred. This differs from existing IAS 11/18 
which focuses on the transfer of “risk and reward” as the point of recognition. The Group will adopt the modified retrospective 
method where the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance 
sheet in the period of initial application. 
Scoping of our revenue streams has been considered as follows:
 X Asset management (meter rental): This makes up around 50% of total SMS revenue; rental income from suppliers is 
recognised as revenue based on operating lease accounting and therefore falls in scope for IFRS 16 and is discussed below. 
 X Asset management (data): This involves the provision of data recording and transmission services from meters to supplier. 
Revenue is recognised straight line over the period of the contract. All data revenue is in scope for IFRS 15. 
 X Asset installations: Transactional revenue is billed to the customer on completion of the installation – which is when “control” 
passes and revenue is recognised. This segment also includes connections revenue which is a subset of installations but 
includes some longer-term projects. All installations revenue is in scope for IFRS 15. 
 X Energy services: The Provision of energy advice which is specific to the customer; revenue is recognised on a transactional 
basis when “control” is transferred and is fully in scope for IFRS 15. 
For revenue which is in scope for IFRS 15, a review has been carried out on existing customer contracts. Within SMS plc no 
existing contracts have been identified where more than one performance obligation exists. The majority of revenue comes 
from the simple installation of a meter asset, where there is only one performance obligation and control is deemed to transfer 
at the same point in time as risk and reward previously. Occasionally, SMS plc also engages in some longer-term contracts 
which fall under connections revenue within the asset installation business – SMS connections accounts for approximately 7% 
of Group revenue and only a small proportion of this comprise longer-term contacts. In such longer-term instances there may 
be various elements or stages to the contracts; however, these elements are not deemed to be “distinct” as defined by the 
standard and therefore only one performance obligation is considered to exist in such instances too. Our assessment 
concludes that no impact is expected when transitioning to IFRS 15. 
IFRS 16 
SMS plc will adopt IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) on 1 January 2019, as such a full impact assessment has been carried out. All meter 
rental revenue within the meter assets business is treated as an operating lease with SMS plc as the lessor and is therefore in 
scope for IFRS 16. As a lessor, the new standard does not make any significant changes to the way leases are accounted for 
currently under IAS 17 but it does provide additional guidance on what is defined as a lease. With regards to the definition 
of leases, SMS plc will continue to treat existing leases as operating leases and “grandfather” this assessment into the new 
standard. Any new contracts entered into following 1 January 2019 will be considered on their own merits under IFRS 16; 
however, all meter rental revenue is expected to continue to be classified as a lease and as such the new standard is not 
expected to have any impact on the way SMS plc accounts for its meter rental revenue.
SMS plc also holds some operating leases for buildings and office equipment as the lessee. Under IFRS 16, a lease liability will 
have to be recognised on the balance sheet for each and they will be depreciated over the period of the lease. Please refer to 
note 25 for details on the Group’s operating lease commitments. 
IFRS 9 
Ahead of the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) on 1 January 2018, management has reviewed the impact of 
the standard to ensure compliance with the new standard. Management expects the impact on accounting for loan modifications 
and the unlisted investment to be minimal, and the expected credit loss model for impairment review will not have an overall 
impact on the Group. The expected credit loss approach may impact the individual retained earnings of individual entities 
within the Group due to potential additional impairment provision for long-term intercompany receivables. These potential 
impairments would not impact the Group as they would be intra-Group items. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1 Segmental reporting
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three core divisions, asset management, asset installation and energy 
management, which form the basis of the Group’s reportable operating segments, and operating segments within those divisions are 
combined on the basis of their similar long-term economic characteristics and similar nature of their products and services, as follows:
 X Asset management comprises regulated management of gas meters, electric meters and ADM™ units within the UK.
 X Asset installation comprises installation of domestic and I&C gas meters and electricity meters throughout the UK.
 X Energy management comprises the provision of energy advice.
Management monitors the operating results of its divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. The operating segments disclosed in the financial statements are the same as 
reported to the Board. Segment performance is evaluated based on gross profit.
At the most granular level of information presented to the CODM, asset management aggregates four operating segments 
(gas meter rental, electricity meter rental, gas data and electricity data) principally on the basis that they derive from the same asset 
using similar processes for consistent customers and are often provided together. Asset installation aggregates two operating segments 
(gas transactional and electricity transactional) due to the consistent nature of the services, customers and delivery processes.
The following segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s reportable segments together with additional

12 Impairment of goodwill
The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. The goodwill is allocated to the asset management and asset installation segments, which are 
the segments that are expected to benefit from combining gas and electricity offerings. The Group tests goodwill annually 
for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment test was 
performed and no evidence of impairment was found as at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each CGU, including goodwill, with the 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts are determined from value-in-use calculations. F
Annual report and accounts 2017 Smart Metering Systems plc 69
12 Impairment of goodwill continued
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding pre-tax cash flow projections, discount rates and 
growth rates. The pre-tax cash flow is based on past performance and expectations as set out in the latest projections based 
on financial budgets approved by management. This discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the time value 
of money. Long-term growth is assumed at 2% and the estimated cash flows are derived by discounting future cash flows 
that are based on conservative growth and attrition rates and discounted at a pre-tax rate of 8.2%. 
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above the carrying value of each CGU; there is no reasonably possible change 
that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

Receivables are all in Sterling denominations.
The Directors are of the opinion that £1,812,000 of the overdue debts as at 31 December 2017 require impairment.
Accrued income is presented net of allowances for provisions, with accrued income being invoiced periodically and customers 
being the same as those within trade receivables. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Bank loans at 31 December 2017 relate to a revolving credit facility of £280m. In November 2017, SMS plc agreed a refinancing 
of this facility with its existing syndicate of banks. This extended debt facility extended the maturity date of the existing facility 
from March 2019 to November 2020 on similarly attractive terms to the existing facility. The extension of the facility results in 
£0.5m of finance costs that have been expensed through the profit and loss as exceptional.
The loan is available for 36 months and is payable in equal quarterly instalments based on a ten-year repayment profile, with 
final repayment due in November 2020. The loan attracts interest at a rate of 1.85% over the three-month LIBOR. 0.65% is paid 
on undrawn funds. The syndicate of banks compromise Barclays Bank plc, Santander UK plc, HSBC UK, Clydesdale Bank plc 
and Bank of Scotland plc. 
The banks have a bond and floating charge over current and future property and assets. F

19 Financial risk management
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks associated with interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. The Group 
has in place a risk management policy that seeks to minimise any adverse effect on the financial performance of the Group by 
continually monitoring the following risks:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises as a result of both its long and short-term borrowing facilities.
The Group seeks to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of fixed interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a change in interest rates on loans and borrowings after the impact of 
hedge accounting. The Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows:
Pounds Sterling

The Group can fix its variable rate borrowings for an additional premium of 70bps and we accordingly show the annual impact 
on our profit before tax. As mentioned in note 28 we have repaid £100m of the debt on 28 February 2018.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group (being bank loans and overdrafts, obligations under finance 
leases and other financial liabilities) as at each period end is as follows:

The fixed rate financial liabilities present at the start of 2016 related to the portion of the banking facility that was fixed through 
hedging instruments.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The Group’s financial assets at 31 December 2017 comprise cash and trade receivables. The cash balance of £150,600,000 
(2016: £7,999,000) is a floating rate financial asset.
Fair values of financial liabilities and financial assets
The fair values, based upon the market value or discounted cash flows of financial liabilities and financial assets held in the 
Group, were not materially different from their book values.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange is insignificant as primarily all of the Group’s operating 
activities are denominated in Pounds Sterling. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash in a manner designed to ensure maximum benefit is gained whilst ensuring security of investment 
sources. The Group’s policy on investment of surplus funds is to place deposits at institutions with strong credit ratings; this is 
considered to be institutions with a credit rating of AA- and above. Currently, all of the chosen investment institutions are in 
line with this criteria.
The ageing and maturity profile of the Group’s material liabilities is covered within the relevant liability note or below.

Credit risk
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables and accrued income is due to the Group trading with a limited number of 
companies which are generally large utility companies or financial institutions. Therefore, the Group does not expect, in the 
normal course of events, that these debts are at significant risk. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk equates to the 
carrying value of cash held on deposit and trade, other receivables and accrued income. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk from its customers is £20,771,000 (2016: £12,858,000) as disclosed in note 14 
– trade receivables and accrued income.
The Group regularly monitors and updates its cash flow forecasts to ensure it has sufficient and appropriate funds to meet 
its ongoing operational requirements whilst maintaining adequate headroom on its facilities to ensure no breach in its 
banking covenants.
Capital management
Capital is the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management 
is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise 
shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic 
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, sell assets, 
return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by pre-exceptional 
EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash. Pre-exceptional EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before 
any significant exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The objective of SMS’s strategy is to deliver long-term value to its shareholders whilst maintaining a balance sheet structure 
that safeguards the Group’s financial position. From an ordinary dividend perspective our objective is to provide a progressive, 
through cycle dividend that reflects the potential volatility of our business.

The Finance Bill 2016, which was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016, included legislation reducing the main rate of 
UK corporation tax from 20% to 17%. This decrease is being phased in with the reduction to 19% effective from 1 April 2017, and 
a further reduction to 17% effective from 1 April 2020. Consequently deferred tax has been provided at the tax rates at which 
temporary differences are expected to reverse.

(including Executive Directors) are eligible to participate in the SIP. Participants may each acquire “Partnership Shares” worth 
up to £1,800 per year from their pre-tax earnings at market value. The Company awards participants one Matching Share for 
each Partnership Share which they acquire. Dividends received on shares held in the SIP are reinvested to acquire Dividend 
Shares at market value. Matching Shares may be forfeited if the participant disposes of the corresponding Partnership Shares 
or leaves the employment of the Group within three years of the award date.

to the shares issued in 2009 in connection with the Group restructuring. This was previously recognised as a merger reserve 
under UK GAAP. Under IFRS, this has been classed as an “other reserve”. Additionally, the premium of £4,189,000 and 
£1,115,000 arising on the issue of shares as part of the acquisitions of CH4 Gas Utility and Maintenance Services Limited

£’000

CH4
£’000
Trojan
£’000
Qton

The contribution to Group profit from each would have been: (1,521) (1,698) (158) (3,377)
And the contribution to revenue from continuing operations 
from each would have been: 2,140 6,576 1,163 9,879
The acquisitions of CH4 and Trojan were part of the Group’s strategy to gain direct control of a large proportion of our 
installation capacity for ongoing delivery of our customer contracts in the I&C and Domestic meter markets. This continues 
to provide confidence to our customers in our delivery model for the new Domestic smart metering market. In addition, the 
acquisition of Qton allowed the Group to gain direct control and ownership of all software applications used by SMS for asset 
installation and ongoing management.
The goodwill recognised above is attributed to the expected benefits of securing our installation capacity and controlling our 
software applications.
None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for income tax purposes.
The primary components of this residual goodwill comprise:
 X the workforce;
 X the software capability;
 X revenue synergies from dual fuel; and
 X new opportunities available to each company as part of the larger AIM-listed Group.
The identifiable intangible assets will be amortised as follows:
 X Software – 20%
 X Customer contracts – 20%
Transaction costs and expenses directly relating to the acquisitions of £455,000 have been disclosed as exceptional items 
in the 2016 comparative figures.
