Introduction 
My first statement to shareholders as 
Executive Chairman reflects on two 
strong but contradictory themes. Firstly, 
the past year has been very challenging, 
both operationally and financially. 
Business performance has fallen short 
of expectations, we have outgrown some 
of our business processes and controls, 
and we have experienced significant 
changes to our Board.
Equally, and more importantly, it is 
already clear that the years ahead 
present significant upside opportunities. 
Strong value creation will result if we 
effectively implement our new strategy 
and successfully manage NCC Group 
through the transitional period in which 
we now find ourselves. Our business is 
not broken – indeed it has some notable 
strengths, both financial and operational. 
We still enjoy significant organic 
growth in our core markets and have 
a strong balance sheet. Furthermore, 
in a constantly evolving and complex 
market, our unique market leading skills 
and capabilities are keeping us at the 
forefront of thought leadership.  This is 
recognised by customers, who reward us 
with high levels of repeat business. If we 
improve our organisation and how we go 
to market, we will also see material value 
creation.
Business performance
The financial performance for the year 
was clearly disappointing, though in 
line with revised expectations. Despite 
delivering revenue growth of almost 
£35.4m (up 17 per cent), adjusted* EBIT 
went backwards to £27 .5m from £39.7m 
in the prior year. Operating profit fell 
from £1 1.4m in the prior year to a loss 
of £53.4m. This outcome reflected a 
number of historical weaknesses in our 
operating model.
Our business performance is shown in 
more detail in the Strategic Report on 
pages 16 to 57 .
Strategic review and 
strategic plan
Following the trading update on  
21 February 2017 , the Board 
commissioned a Strategic Review. The 
Review focused on three key areas. 
Firstly, to develop a better understanding 
of our marketplace, our competitors 
and our customers. Secondly, to assess 
the relative strengths and weaknesses 
of NCC Group in the market. Thirdly, to 
assess the  value created by the current 
portfolio of businesses. 
The Review confirmed that our markets 
remain attractive and, more importantly, 
that customers regard NCC Group as a 
very strong competitor in these markets 
with a strongly differentiated proposition. 
The strong cyber security theme (or 
“golden thread”) that runs through the 
Assurance Division represents a unique 
set of competencies and capabilities 
that we can leverage to deliver greater 
customer value in a highly complex and 
fragmented market. Our sector and 
application specific product offerings 
are leading edge and our solutions 
capabilities are highly valued and sought 
after.
The Review also confirmed the current 
financial logic of the relationship between 
Assurance and Escrow. Escrow itself is 
an attractive business and provides a 
stabilising influence on the Group.
*  This is a non-GAAP or Alternative Performance 
Measure (APM). Adjusted figures exclude the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, individually 
significant items, share-based charges, 
the unwinding of discount on deferred and 
contingent consideration, the results of the exited 
Domain Services business and any associated tax 
thereon.
NCC Group has a unique 
opportunity: we hold 
leading positions in 
growing markets around 
the world, our customers 
value us and our workforce 
is exceptionally skilled. 
However, we need to 
change how we organise 
ourselves and improve 
our internal business 
processes. Only by doing 
this will we be able to 
capture the significant 
value available to us

Chairman’s

NCC AR2017 - proof 8-Front.indd   2 09/08/2017   16:03:44 25546.04    9 August 2017 3:58 PM    Proof Six
Finally, the Review identified two of the 
smaller Assurance businesses that sit 
outside the cyber golden thread whose 
future would be better served under 
alternative ownership. These businesses, 
Web Performance and Software Testing, 
will be disposed of in due course.
Subsequently, we initiated the 
development of a new three-phase 
Strategic Plan and revised Target 
Operating Model in order to underpin our 
“go to market” and delivery strategies. 
In the next 12 to 24 months, we intend 
to focus more of our efforts on internal 
self-help measures than has been the 
case historically.
This should ensure that we reverse 
the margin compression seen in both 
trading divisions and across most 
territories in the last two years. The 
Group will then benefit from further 
organic growth with foundations built 
on scalable products and business 
processes. These new foundations will 
also significantly enhance our ability to 
leverage acquisition related growth when 
the Group returns to being acquisitive. 
Acquisition activity, if any, is therefore 
likely to be limited during this period to 
smaller “bolt-ons”.
The results of the Strategic Review are 
set out further in the Strategic Report on 
pages 18 to 23.
Dividends
The Board has reviewed the business 
performance in the current year 
alongside our historical progressive 
dividend policy. While mindful of the 
need for investment over the next few 
years, the Board is confident in our 
prospects and hence recommends that 
the dividend is maintained at the current 
level.
A final dividend of 3.15p is therefore 
being recommended by the Board, 
making a total for the year of 4.65p, 
equal to the prior year. If approved, the 
final dividend in respect of the year 
ended 31 May 2017 will be paid on  
29 September 2017 to shareholders 
on the register as at 1 September 2017 
with an ex-dividend date of 31 August 
2017.
As a matter of note, an administrative 
non-compliance issue has been 
identified with respect to distributable 
reserves and the payment of historical 
dividends. At all times the Group had 
adequate returns within subsidiary 
companies to meet these dividends. We 
expect to remedy the position by means 
of shareholder resolutions at the AGM in 
September. 
Governance
During the year, the Board has 
undertaken a major review of some of 
the Group’s governance structures. In 
part, this was prompted by a combination 
of shareholder and employee feedback. 
In addition, there was also the realisation 
that rapid growth in recent years had 
taken the Group beyond the design 
limits of the previous operating model.
The Board remains committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. 
We are working actively to enhance 
governance as well as our business 
processes and internal controls to match 
our ambitions for the Group’s future. The 
results of the Governance Review are 
set out in the Governance Report on 
pages 59 to 60.
Board composition
There have been a number of changes 
to the Board during the year. I joined 
the Board on 6 April 2017 as a Non-
Executive Director, becoming Executive 
Chairman in April when Paul Mitchell 
stood down as Chairman. 
Last year we noted our intention to 
strengthen the team further with an 
additional independent Non-Executive 
Director. As a result, Jonathan Brooks 
joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director on 13 March 2017 . Jonathan 
brings significant valuable experience of 
the technology sector.

Executive 
Chairman’s 
statement
Brian Tenner was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer on 1 February 2017 
following a search process prompted by 
the resignation of Atul Patel on  
10 August 2016. He became Interim 
CEO on 1 March 2017 , following the 
decision of Rob Cotton to step down  
as CEO. 
The current model of an Executive 
Chairman working closely with Brian 
as Interim CEO and CFO has been 
a necessary and effective bridge to 
deliver the Strategic Review and also 
maintain stability in the management 
of the business. Recognising that this 
is not a sustainable long-term solution, 
the Board has commenced a process 
to identify a permanent CEO using a 
firm of independent executive search 
consultants.
Board effectiveness
As Executive Chairman, I am responsible 
for the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects 
of its performance. During the year, the 
Board has reviewed its performance and 
effectiveness in accordance with the 
requirements of the Code. We note that 
the recent and significant changes in 
membership and new strategic direction 
represent a transition period for the 
Board as well as the Group. 
The Board will work to enhance 
oversight of the Group’s strategic 
development, monitoring the delivery 
of its business objectives and the 
development of the new Target 
Operating Model. We will also work  
hard to ensure that we maintain 
an effective, corporate governance 
framework that keeps pace with the rate 
of growth and change inside and outside 
of NCC Group.
Employees
Our staff are the foundation for most 
of the value inherent in NCC Group. In 
developing and implementing our new 
Strategic Plan and Target Operating 
Model we will work to ensure that we 
create a working environment that 
values the individual and allows each one 
of us to contribute to our full potential. 
This will include creating organisational 
values and clearer structures, roles and 
responsibilities. The coming financial 
year will also see a greater focus on 
personal development and training.
I would like to record my own and 
the Board’s sincere thanks to all of 
the Group’s employees, who have 
maintained their focus on delivering 
excellent service to our customers. 
This has been achieved against a 
backdrop of uncertainty caused by 
the Group’s volatile financial and 
share price performance, particularly 
in the latter quarters of the year. Our 
business is entirely reliant on the skills 
and experience of our staff. We are 
fortunate to have them choose to build 
their careers with NCC Group, and I look 
forward to working with all of them as 
we take our business forward.

Current trading and outlook 
All businesses go through transitional 
phases as they grow and mature. NCC 
Group is no exception. Where we are 
different, and at a significant advantage 
to many, is that change has not been 
forced upon us by mounting losses, a 
stretched balance sheet, technological 
obsolescence or a sudden shrinkage 
in our markets. We are operating in a 
rapidly growing international market in 
which our core skills and competencies 
will allow us to lead rather than follow. 
Our challenge is to manage the 
transition from one business model 
to another, as the growth in scale and 
complexity has made our early stage 
model ineffective.  We now need to 
create structures and products that 
allow us to benefit from our scale and 
deliver additional value for our customers 
while never losing sight of our core 
competencies and strengths, most 
notably represented in our staff, their 
energy and their commitment.
So while there is a lot of work to do to 
implement new processes, systems and 
structures, the outlook for NCC Group 
remains very positive. In fast growing 
international markets with a range of 
innovative products and services, the 
challenge is to execute effectively 
the planned changes in strategy and 
operating model. The Board is confident 
that the Group can deliver sustainable 
earnings growth and enhanced 
shareholder value once it has  more 
robust foundations in place. We are not 
only “securing tomorrow, today” for our 
customers, but for all of our long-term 
stakeholders.
In terms of trading for the current 
financial year, the Board expects 
Escrow to return to low single digit 
revenue growth and see some margin 
improvement. The Assurance business is 
expected to see high single-digit organic 
revenue growth as we build from the 
low point of the second half of last year. 
Assurance gross margins will improve as 
we implement our new operating model 
over the course of the new financial year. 
Set against these gains in gross profit 
are some cost headwinds arising from 
higher overheads linked to property 
costs and the amortisation and 
depreciation of capital spend in 2017 . 
Finally, the disposal of the Web and 
Software Testing businesses will reduce 
EBIT on a pro rata basis by £2.7m based 
on 2017 results. Overall, the Group’s 
expectations for adjusted EBIT in 2018 
are unchanged.

ASSURANCE DIVISION OVERVIEW
The Assurance Division operates in two 
discreet segments as described below.
Security consulting
The cyber landscape presents an ever 
increasing and ever changing threat 
to security as cyber intruders develop 
increasingly sophisticated ways to attack 
corporate networks, thereby gaining 
access to organisations’ sensitive and 
valuable data and systems.
The Assurance Division brings together 
a number of diverse product and service 
offerings in a number of different 
business lines. The “golden thread” 
running through the core businesses is 
“cyber security” – whether through the 
provision of consulting and professional 
services, managed services or hardware 
and software products. These core areas 
all focus on cyber security – in other 
words – how to maintain and protect our 
customers’ data and critical business 
systems from interruption by malicious 
or accidental events. 
Information security and cyber security 
continue to change at a rapid pace with 
new areas of concern or vulnerabilities 
frequently and regularly discovered. To 
stay ahead in the cyber-arms race, our 
global corporate culture is aligned with 
this rapid and constant change. We have 
created boutique ways of working with 
cultural values that encourage individuals 
to fulfil their full creative potential.
In conjunction with this creativity, the 
business is committed to listening to 
its clients’ requirements. Since much 
of the work carried out by the Group is 
research based, in order to maintain its 
equitable and ethical disclosure policies, 
research paid for by third parties and 
customers is not disclosed, unless 
requested by the paying organisation. 
Self-funded research by the Group will 
always be provided to the organisation 
that it affects in full, free of charge and 
without disclosure, until such time as 
the vulnerability has been resolved in 
a reasonable timeframe. This does not 
preclude the Group making a full public 
disclosure if there is a threat to life or to 
the general public’s online security, and 
the third party is unwilling to remediate 
the issue.
Historically, Assurance Division 
acquisitions have been based upon 
culture, fit and service but never on the 
basis of profit enhancement by cost 
reduction or the ability to turn around 
an ailing business. Threat intelligence 
and cryptography is the most recent 
example of this, where the Group 
acquired a business, Fox-IT, to fill directly 
a product and service need. While 
progress in rolling these services out to 
a much broader range of multinational 
customers has been much slower than 
expected, the opportunity remains an 
attractive one if we can reorganise 
ourselves effectively to deliver on it. 
Threat intelligence is one of the most 
important tools in an organisation’s 
armoury to help prevent and mitigate 
cyber-attack.
Our future acquisition strategy will 
be reviewed and developed after 
a necessary period of stabilisation 
and rebuilding of strong foundations 
in scalable business systems and 
processes.
Following the acquisition of Accumuli plc, 
the Group has the opportunity to offer 
an integrated managed scanning service 
as a single client solution (hence now 
referred to as MSS). A project is also 
underway to put all of our internal and 
external monitoring services on to the 
“CTMp” platform acquired with Fox-IT. 
While the Group will continue to be open 
to the sale of third party products, our 
focus will be on instances where we can 
offer value added after sales services. 
Not all of the Group’s sales of products 
are third party products. Particularly 
through the Fox business, we offer some 
very high-end products to customers 
that combine hardware and software in 
one package. This includes “DetACT” 
(for use by transactional financial 
services companies) and Data Diodes 
(a product range that helps secure 
one-way data communications such 
as a utility meter). Both products are 
sufficiently differentiated that they can 
attract better margins than third party 
product reselling.
As one of the world’s largest service 
led security consultancies, the Group is 
capable of leading all cyber security bids 
rather than having to look for support 
from larger third parties. 
Software testing and 
website performance
Essential websites, software and 
infrastructure that support an 
organisation do not just need protection 
from malicious attacks, they also need 
guaranteed performance levels. Flaws 
in code can prevent software from 
operating at optimum levels and spikes 
in online traffic can throw websites 
offline. Currently, NCC Group undertakes 
more than three million web page tests 
per day for clients worldwide.

Acquisition rationale
PSC is one of a very small group of companies that can 
provide expert services and solutions to organisations that 
require specialist compliance, consulting and cyber security 
testing services in the substantial and growing global 
payments industry. 
VSR
VSR was acquired in November 2016, again as part of the 
Group’s strategy of acquiring relatively small bolt-on consulting 
businesses. The maximum price that will be paid is $6.0m in 
cash ($4.0m up front and $2.0m contingent on performance

ESCROW
Escrow background 
The Escrow Division offers a high 
value product to customers who rely 
on mission critical applications and 
software packages for the day-to-day 
running of their business functions and 
processes. In today’s integrated business 
world, these applications typically extend 
well beyond accounting and reporting 
systems into Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) tools and even deeper 
into an organisation’s service delivery 
capability such as design tools in an 
advertising agency or manufacturing 
equipment in an engineering company.
These applications are often supplied 
by third party vendors. However, if a 
software or Software as a Service 
(SaaS) supplier goes out of business 
and/or changes hands, the continuing 
availability of these applications could be 
in doubt and hence business continuity 
is potentially put at risk.
NCC Group’s escrow and verification 
services assure the long-term availability 
of these applications, protecting both 
end users and software suppliers. 
Working with all parties involved in 
the development, supply and use of 
business critical software applications, 
NCC Group assures that source code, 
data and other information is constantly 
accessible and can be properly rebuilt 
from its components, if required.
Core services
Both through contractual arrangements 
and through verification testing services, 
Escrow’s service offering is to provide 
a safe and independent environment 
in which customers and their software 
suppliers can entrust NCC Group with 
source code that will allow continued 
access to key systems in the event of an 
interruption in supply.

The potential benefits include the 
continued operation of the customers’ 
core business systems at a relatively low 
cost. Escrow services are provided in both 
the traditional software market as well as 
in all iterations of the outsourced model. 
We continue to develop our SaaS service 
to respond to the continuing evolution of 
our marketplace, as well as developing 
server testing services in order to 
enhance the proposition.
Further, we provide registry data escrow 
services (a regulatory requirement) for all 
registrars and registries of domains. The 
IP address of each domain registered 
within a TLD is safely secured along with 
Registrar Data Escrow.
Due to its importance to clients, Escrow 
provides the Group with excellent 
recurring revenues along with good 
margins and cash generation. Escrow 
can be provided both in the traditional 
on-premise software market as well as 
in the cloud, as the basic underpinnings 
are the same; protection from an event 
that disrupts the relationship between 
the owner and licensee of a software 
product.
The Escrow Division remains a key 
cornerstone of the Group and is the 
platform upon which the organisation 
has been built. The fundamentals of 
the Group are fully encapsulated in this 
division, which is based around the very 
highest standards of customer care and 
equitable treatment to all parties in the 
contractual relationship. 
While there are limited cross linkages 
or shared sales opportunities with 
the Assurance Division, Escrow does 
offer services that complement those 
in Assurance to protect customers 
against the full range of cyber risks. 
A good example of this has been the 
development of offering SAST (static 
application security testing) services to 
software vendors on source code that 
has been deposited and verified with the 
Group’s Escrow Division.
The Group is one of the world’s leading 
and most established software escrow 
providers, with more than 35 years’ 
experience and protects over 15,000 
organisations worldwide, combining 
longevity and trust with technical 
expertise. The expertise contained 
within the Escrow Division, along with its 
credentials, offerings, global scale and 
reputation, sets NCC Group apart from 
other escrow providers.

The strategic review  
and target operating model
The Group began a Strategic Review 
in February 2017 . The objectives of the 
review fell into three broad categories:
 z Assessing our marketplace and 
customers’ buying preferences and 
criteria
 z Customer and market views of NCC 
Group and our capabilities, strengths 
and weaknesses
 z Assessing the commercial and 
portfolio logic of the current business 
lines within the Group
As findings began to emerge from the 
initial scope of work in the Strategic 
Review, we began a parallel work stream 
to consider: 
 z Assessing how we currently organise 
ourselves to address and capture 
the opportunities presented in 
our markets by best leveraging 
our strengths and unique selling 
propositions
Key findings from the 
Strategic Review
The key findings from the Strategic 
Review are set out in more detail in the 
later sections of this report but can be 
summarised as follows:
Marketplace: Our markets continue to 
grow strongly at or around a double-digit 
rate. Companies’ buying decisions are 
more about technical expertise and value 
for money than a simple price basis. See 
page 21 for more detail.
Our customers: NCC Group scores 
well on the issues that matter to 
customers: technical expertise, value for 
money and speed of delivery. The quality 
of customer service does appear to be 
an issue for the industry generally and 
NCC Group is similar in this regard. Our 
customers want to buy more from us 
and value our brand and reputation for 
excellence. See page 21 for more detail.
Our portfolio: The two divisions 
of Assurance and Escrow see little 
crossover in customer purchasing. 
However, Escrow is a robust stabilising 
influence on the Group. Within 
Assurance, we have identified two 
service lines that would have a better 
opportunity to flourish under alternative 
ownership and these will be sold in due 
course. See pages 8 and 29 for more 
detail.
As we digested the emerging outputs 
from the Strategic Review it became 
clear that to reach our full potential we 
would need to reorganise how we go 
to market and how we do business (in 
terms of our internal processes and 
structures). We have therefore started 
work on developing and implementing a 
new Target Operating Model (TOM), as 
further described on page 19.

The market 
opportunity
Introduction
Fundamentally, NCC Group is operating 
in a dynamic and fast growing market. 
Or rather, a series of related but 
separate fast growing markets. These 
statements apply whether one considers 
the marketplace from a product and 
service perspective, from a geographical 
perspective, or from an industry vertical 
perspective. Change is literally the one 
constant in almost all aspects of the 
market.
Today, cyber crime is one of the 
single biggest threats to businesses 
and individuals around the world. 
The average cost to recover from a 
DDoS attack is £275,000 and more 
than 90 per cent of businesses have 
experienced some form of cyber security 
threat. On average, it takes almost 
120 days for an organisation to find out 
that it has been compromised.
Furthermore, from our own research 
into the safety of the Internet, almost 
two-thirds of consumers believe an 
online data breach will compromise their 
financial information within the next 
year. The fact that some 60 per cent of 
consumers are more worried than ever 
before about protecting their personal 
and financial information online should 
certainly confirm the threat as one of the 
greatest to face businesses today.
Online security still seems to be behind 
the curve in failing to keep pace with 
the numerous types of organisations 
and individuals that seek to disrupt 
the Internet and organisations’ use of 
systems and data. The threat of being 
hacked or having valuable data stolen 
continues to evolve rapidly and at a 
seemingly unstoppable pace. Attacks 
using phishing, fake payment requests 
and ransomware are now everyday 
events. These attacks often cause 
significant operational disruption whose 
economic consequences can vastly 
outweigh any cost of remediation or 
prevention. Our challenge is to ensure 
that customers understand that a 
relatively modest up front investment 
in advice or other cyber services can 
ultimately save significant sums in 
remediation costs or arising from 
reputational damage.
The world in which we live cannot be 
made completely safe from cybercrime. 
As the number and range of threats 
proliferate, being innovative and using 
our experience and skills to protect 
against attacks becomes more important 
than ever. NCC Group is doing this by 
providing the best security consultants 
to world leading clients as well as 
conducting world-renowned security 
research.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Market dynamics
The relevant sub-segments that NCC Group’s core cyber offering competes in are shown below:
NCC AR2017 - proof 8-Front.indd   20 09/08/2017   16:04:20 25546.04    9 August 2017 3:58 PM    Proof Six
The addressable market is clearly very large at $38 bn 
in total and very fragmented. Management estimate that 
NCC Group is one of the largest “pure play” cyber security 
companies focusing on services as opposed to products 
but yet has relatively low market shares in most segments 
and geographies. Once we have developed robust and 
scalable internal structures and processes, this will 
represent a significant opportunity to grow the business 
profitably though bolt-on acquisitions.
Market research as part of the Strategic Review also 
confirmed that market growth is likely to continue and that 
customers’ propensity to pay more for high quality advice 
and solutions is growing.
Customers buying behaviours and key 
purchasing criteria (KPCs)
Customers made clear that their key buying criteria focus more 
on quality of technical expertise and advice as opposed to 
price. While value for money (effectively a ratio or a comparison 
of quality and cost) is very important, that reflects more on the 
demand for quality than low cost.
This is highlighted in the chart below that shows the relative 
importance of customers’ Key Purchasing Criteria (i.e the 
factors that influence their buying decisions). 
Interestingly, customers did not place as high a value on the 
ability to source internationally. Even in those customers who 
did buy in multiple territories.
In summary, on the items that matter most to customers in 
their buying decisions, NCC Group scores well or very well 
with the exception of customer service, which appears to be an 
industry-wide issue.
Technical 
Expertise
Consistently noted as having top-tier 
technical talent, Fox-IT seen as most 
technically advanced player in NL.
UK and US customers often feel 
NCC Group too transactional. Fox-
IT customers value their trusted 
partnership.
NCC Group and Fox-IT generally 
perceived as good value. Customers 
very willing to pay more for quality.
Seen as “mid-sized”, competing with 
boutique pure-plays, NCC Group

The market 
opportunity
Our competitive position
We must continue to drive innovation and thought leadership 
in our key market segments. The key is to ensure that our 
thought leadership also leads to practical new solutions to 
apply to the challenges and issues that our customers face. We 
must find the right balance of “blue sky” thinking and ideas that 
can be rapidly commercialised.
Innovation and creativity are two key foundations for the 
Group’s continued development and growth. Our new Target 
Operating Model is designed to ensure that these remain a 
core feature of the business. The recent and well publicised 
cyber attacks on a wide range of public and private enterprises 
around the world are a reminder of the need to constantly 
innovate.
The graphic below shows the current range and scale of the 
services and products offered by NCC Group in the cyber 
security market. Our aim is to shift more of our business to the 
right and upwards; that is, more repeat business of a highly 
differentiated nature.
During the Strategic Review we assessed the Group’s “Net 
Promotor Score” (NPS). This metric is widely used across a 
range of industries where customer satisfaction is a critical 
performance indicator. What NPS measures, quite simply, is 
whether or not a customer, on the basis of its experiences with 
a service provider, would recommend that service provider to 
another organisation. The measurement scale in NPS is itself 
a challenge – a positive score is counted if it rates a nine or 
ten out of ten. Conversely, a negative score is recorded for any 
outcome ranging from zero to six. What this means is that if a 
company received 100 scores of its service, with 10 ratings in 
each category, its NPS score would be negative 40.
The results of the NPS survey found NCC Group with a score 
of “positive 26”. As noted above in the explanation of the 
methodology, achieving any sort of positive score is difficult 
and a positive score of 26 means the significant majority of 
ratings by customers had to be above six out of ten and with a 
high proportion of those scoring the top two marks.
What the survey did show was that NCC Group scored better 
than many of its direct competitors in the Big Four or in the 
pure play cyber services companies. The business only rated 
less strongly compared to large Systems Integrators, defence 
contractors or product-based cyber companies. It is clear, when 
combined with direct interview feedback from customers, that 
NCC Group is well regarded for our technical expertise and 
its ability to help its customers overcome their cyber security 
challenges.

Target Operating Model 
(TOM)
Our current organisational structures 
and operating model have reached 
the limits of their design tolerances. In 
many cases the overlay of our business 
processes on those organisational 
design features creates a “spaghetti 
wiring diagram” that is complex, 
delivers unclear accountabilities and 
is undoubtedly inefficient at delivering 
business processes and services to 
customers. The recent addition of 
some relatively large acquisitions has 
emphasised further the need for a clear 
and transparent operating model that 
delivers a number of key objectives, the 
principal ones being as set out below.
TOM OBJECTIVE 1: Align the 
business to how our customers want 
to buy
The Strategic Review revealed that even 
our global customers tend to want to 
buy local services for delivery in country. 
This is true even for customers who have 
a central technology input to sourcing 
decisions. This finding drives the 
conclusion of a TOM that has a primary 
dimension of geographical business 
units and P&L accountability.
TOM OBJECTIVE 2: Leverage NCC 
Group value between business units
The business has historically operated 
within silos. This has been the case even 
inside individual business units where 
our structures have not encouraged 
service or product line leaders to cross 
sell or provide fully integrated solutions 
to our customers. Our historical Go-
To-Market model was identified by 
customers as being too transactional in 
many cases. While initiatives to address 
this issue began during the year, the old 
operating model barriers to collaboration 
were not removed. 
Our customers value our technical 
expertise and the wide range of services 
that we offer. Therefore, in order to 
leverage value across the geographies 
and service lines, we concluded that a 
matrix structure would be appropriate 
for the TOM. Therefore, the secondary 
dimension of the TOM is based around 
key service and product lines with key 
leadership and accountability roles 
identified within each to ensure sharing 
of best practice. To avoid unnecessary 
cost increases or duplication of roles, 
there will be some “double-hatting” in 
smaller businesses as they grow.
TOM OBJECTIVE 3: Deliver an 
integrated Go-To-Market proposition
Our customers value our expertise 
and range of services. They would like 
to buy more from us. But our current 
Go-To-Market approach can make 
this difficult. The challenges flow from 
disparate accountabilities and targets 
for different teams within the business 
units. We are therefore creating aligned 
sales and delivery teams with single 
leaders within each geography. Critically, 
sales leadership for strategic accounts, 
transactional sales activities, inside 
sales, bid preparation and management, 
and supporting marketing activities will 
report to one person in each territory. 
This will allow us to join up our offerings 
at a more strategic purchasing level 
within customers while also ensuring 
that our current successful transactional 
sales generation machine continues to 
perform.
TOM OBJECTIVE 4: Create 
scalable structures that facilitate 
profitable growth
Our historical ways of working and focus 
on certain services and products prevent 
benefits of scale from being realised. 
Selling more of a particular service 
would lead to an equal and proportionate 
increase in our costs and hence no 
positive operational leverage to drive 
improving margins.
Our staff management and work 
allocation processes have been less 
efficient than we would like. This has led 
to under-selling of key technical skills 
in that they are used on activities that 
attract a lower day rate than they should. 
As well as more accurate matching of 
our staff skills to the value of the work 
being performed for customers, we also 
intend to increase our focus on platform-
based sales such as monitoring services 
and after sales value added services. In 
particular, these will be driven from our 
Security Operations Centres in Delft 
(Fox) and Leeds (MSS) and will include 
services such as Threat Intelligence, 
DetACT, Managed Security Services, and 
our CTMp platform.
TOM OBJECTIVE 5: Design and 
implement effective and efficient 
business processes that support 
operating leverage
Over the last few years our support costs 
have been rising steadily, creating a 
further erosion of operating leverage or 
in some cases even leading to negative 
operating leverage. This reflects the 
fact that in many cases our business 
processes and systems have not been 
upgraded to keep pace with the size 
and complexity of the Group. The Group 
has been slow in rolling out its preferred 
core systems and this has caused undue 
delays, cost increases and inefficiency in 
how we work. These issues extend from 
finance and reporting systems to CRM 
systems to work and staff planning and 
management processes and beyond.
A key part of implementing the TOM 
is to embed effective and efficient 
business processes and systems within 
it. Over the next two years we will 
therefore be focusing on designing and 
implementing standardised business 
processes and making sure that they, 
and the underpinning systems, are rolled 
out across all of our business units. 
These systems and processes will often 
be designed and monitored centrally to 
ensure shared disciplines and effective 
control of the business.
Underpinning all of the objectives for 
the TOM will be a series of direct and 
specific key performance indicators 
and other metrics that drive the desired 
behaviours and outcomes. For example, 
we will be focusing on realisation for 
our consultants’ time as opposed to 
the more simple but less informative 
utilisation measure. Realisation will focus 
on a combination of hours worked but 
also, critically, on the amount of work 
that is actually billed and the rate at 
which it is billed. These are currently 
areas where we believe there is value 
leakage from the Group and plugging 
these leaks will help to generate 
improved margins in future.

1
 Grow
At a managed pace and 
in areas of core strength
In attractive and growing markets where NCC Group enjoys strong competitive 
differentiators, we aim to deliver medium-term growth in excess of market rates. By 
focusing on higher value added services we will avoid growth for its own sake while 
simultaneously protecting our margins.
Underlying* organic* revenue growth

Stripping out the impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, we aim to deliver growth in the short-term broadly in line with market rates.
 Æ Implement new Go-To-Market strategy and team 
structures 
 Æ Growth may therefore lag behind the market 
during the year
 Æ Develop a clearer understanding of our pipeline 
and ordering processes

Our new Target 
Operating Model
The Strategic Review identified that we do not organise ourselves in a way that brings 
simplicity and efficiency to our service delivery.
We will implement a new and clear operating model that delivers better customer service 
at an improving gross margin.
Adjusted* Gross margin to improve 
2017: 34.7 per cent (2016: 38.5 per cent)

 Improve
Business processes  
and systems
Our existing business processes are inefficient, and in many cases, difficult to scale. They 
often rely on manual activity and disparate information systems that can lead to a lack of 
clarity in decision-making.
We will design and implement improved business processes with reduced manual 
interventions to lower our costs to serve.

Q&A
WITH CHRIS STONE 
AND BRIAN TENNER
You are both new to the business. What 
have been your strongest first impressions?
Chris: Firstly, I would like to record my own and the Board’s 
sincere thanks to all of the Group’s employees who have 
maintained their focus on delivering excellent service to our 
customers.
Meeting the unique and brilliant staff at NCC Group has 
strongly reinforced my belief in the inherent untapped potential 
in this business – potential that has been suppressed by a 
failure to scale business process with our growing capabilities.
Our business is not broken – indeed it has some notable 
strengths, both financial and operational – which I have 
stressed with all the staff I have met. We have a business with 
enormous potential.
Brian: Our staff are the foundation of the value inherent in the 
business and I have been endlessly impressed by all those who 
I have met since joining, their passion and their expertise.
We address exciting markets which continue to grow strongly 
at or around a double-digit rate.
What has been clear to me since joining is that our technical 
expertise and reputation for excellence to address these 
markets is unparalleled. 
It’s been a difficult year. What have been 
the toughest challenges?
Brian: The past year has been very challenging, both 
operationally and financially. Business performance has fallen 
short of expectations and we have outgrown some of our 
business processes and controls.
The outlook for the business remains very positive in fast 
growing international markets. Our challenge now is to 
manage the transition from one business model to another, as 
the growth in scale and complexity has made our early stage 
model ineffective.
Chris: Substantial acquisitions and overlaying business 
processes has made our operating model a “spaghetti wiring 
diagram” that we have needed to unravel for the benefit of 
ourselves, our shareholders and our clients.
One of the key challenges that we face is transforming this 
operating model and our reporting, to disclose fully and in 
as transparent a way as possible, the value held within our 
business and the potential that has been suppressed by 
inefficient and outdated processes.
What are the priorities for the new  
financial year?
Chris: There is a lot of work to do to implement new 
processes, systems and structures. We have a tremendous 
opportunity in fast growing international markets, with a range 
of innovative products and services.
The challenge is to execute effectively the planned changes 
in strategy and operating model. We are confident that the 
Group can deliver sustainable earnings growth and enhanced 
shareholder value, once more robust foundations are in place.
Brian: Our priority for the new financial year is to efficiently 
implement the Strategic Plan and new Target Operating Model 
that was born out of the Strategic Review of the business.
We now need to create structures and products that allow us 
to benefit from our scale and deliver additional value for our 
customers while never losing sight of our core competencies 
and strengths, most notably represented in our staff, their 
energy and their commitment.

What are the objectives for the new Target 
Operating Model (TOM)?
Brian: Our TOM has five objectives.
 z First, align the business to how our customers want to buy.
 z Second, leverage our value between our business units.
 z Third, deliver an integrated Go-To-Market proposition.
 z Fourth, create scalable structures that facilitate profitable 
growth.
 z Fifth, design and implement effective and efficient business 
processes that support operating leverage.
Once the TOM is in place, we are confident that we can deliver 
sustainable earnings growth and enhanced shareholder value.
Chris: Innovation and creativity are two key foundations for 
our continued development and growth. Our new TOM is 
designed to ensure that these remain a core feature of the 
business.
Our aim is to shift the current range and scale of the services 
and products offered by the business in the cyber security 
market to more repeat business of a highly differentiated 
nature.
How will the new TOM work?
Chris: A key part of implementing the TOM is to embed 
effective and efficient business processes and systems  
within it.
Over the next two years we will therefore be focusing on 
designing and implementing standardised business processes 
and making sure that they, and the underpinning systems, are 
rolled out across all of our business units.
These systems and processes will often be designed and 
monitored centrally to ensure shared disciplines and effective 
control of the business.
Brian: Underpinning all of the objectives for the TOM will be 
a series of direct and specific key performance indicators and 
other metrics that drive the desired behaviours and outcomes.
For example, we will be focusing on realisation for our 
consultants’ time as opposed to the more simple but less 
informative utilisation measure.
Realisation will focus on a combination of hours worked but 
also, critically, on the amount of work that is actually billed and 
the rate at which it is billed.
These are currently areas where we believe there is value 
leakage from the business and plugging these leaks will help 
to generate improved margins in future.
Which business processes and systems  
need closing?
Brian: Our historical ways of working, and focus on certain 
services and products, prevent benefits of scale from being 
realised.
Selling more of a particular service would lead to an equal 
and proportionate increase in our costs and hence no positive 
operational leverage to drive improving margins.
As well as more accurate matching of our staff skills to the 
value of the work being performed for customers, we also 
intend to increase our focus on platform-based sales such as 
monitoring services and after sales value added services.
Chris: The years ahead present significant upside 
opportunities. Strong value creation will result if we effectively 
implement our new strategy and successfully manage the 
Group through the transitional period in which we now find 
ourselves.
Our business is not broken and we will not be closing but 
optimising the processes that are in place.
Within Assurance, the Web Performance and Software Testing 
businesses were found to have little cross over with the core 
consulting business and will be sold over the next year.
What are the plans for developing our 
people in the years ahead?
Chris: Our business is entirely reliant on the skills and 
experience of our staff.
We are fortunate to have them choose to build their careers 
with NCC Group, and I look forward to working with all of them 
as we take it forward.
Brian: Our staff are the foundation for most of the value 
inherent in the business.
In developing and implementing our new Strategic Plan 
and TOM we will work to ensure that we create a working 
environment that values the individual and allows each one of 
us to contribute to our full potential.
This will include creating organisational values and clearer 
structures, roles and responsibilities. The coming financial year 
will also see a greater focus on personal development and 
training.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Group revenue 
For the financial year ended 31 May 2017 , the Group increased 
reported revenue by 17 per cent to £244.5m (2016: £209.1m). 
Excluding Domain Services business that was exited during 
the year, the growth was £37 .7m or 18 per cent. 
The table below shows the proportions of growth that were 
organic (net sales growth in businesses that were owned for 
equivalent periods in the current and prior year), acquisitions 
growth (includes the full year impact of prior year acquisitions), 
and growth resulting from the impact of FX rates. Growth from 
changes in FX rates is calculated by restating the prior year 
revenue figures at current year rates.

Note: the Group’s current information systems do not report the impact of foreign 
exchange movements as a matter of course. The figures above are therefore 
calculated at year end using assumed weighted average exchange rates for 
each relevant currency for each year in question. This is being addressed in the 
Group’s new consolidation system which is being implemented in the first quarter 
of the new financial year.
The FX growth above is driven by increases in the weighted 
average exchange rates of both the US$ and €uro against 
£GBP, both of which strengthened by around 15 per cent.
The geographical breakdown of revenue by the location of the 
delivering business for the current and past year is as follows 
(Domain excluded):

Total revenue 241.9 100 204.2 100
Note: some businesses sell a modest amount of services in other countries and 
report that revenue as being within their own geography.
The amount of Group revenue earned outside the UK 
increased by £35.0m and reflects the impact of the Fox-
IT acquisition in the Netherlands half way through the last 
financial year and also strong growth in our US Assurance 
business. Both of these factors occurred within the Assurance 
division where the share of Group revenue has now risen to 
85 per cent (2016: 83 per cent).
Underlying organic revenue growth in the first half of the 
financial year was 19 per cent but in the second half fell by 
5 per cent compared to the prior year periods. The second half 
of the current year actually saw revenue fall compared to the 
first half,  contrary to the historical trends the business has 
delivered. 
Weakness in the second half compared to the prior year and 
the first half of the current year was particularly focused in 
MSS third party product sales which were £6.5m down in the 
second half compared to the first half.

Fox High Assurance product sales were also down £1.2m in 
the second half. Between them these reductions accounted for 
85 per cent of the fall in sales between the first and second 
halves.
A more detailed breakdown of the revenue performance of 
the Group in each of the operating segments is shown earlier 
in this announcement in the Assurance and Escrow divisional 
reports.
The Group is currently reviewing the basis on which revenue 
analysis is further reported. This review will include concepts 
such as recurring revenues, contracted revenues and repeat 
business. The Group may need to implement systems changes 
to accurately capture this analysis across all business units. 
Some further analysis is set out in the divisional reviews.
The Group continued to have minimal reliance on any one 
customer or sector. Within Assurance the largest customer 
represents approximately 4 per cent of Assurance revenue. 
The largest customer in Escrow is just over 1 per cent of total 
Escrow revenue. 
Group profitability and margins
The Board and Executive management use a number of 
non-GAAP measures in their day-to-day management of 
the business. The Group’s primary financial profitability 
measure will be Adjusted EBIT. Last year the Group used 
Adjusted EBITDA for this purpose. It is management’s view 
that Adjusted EBIT is more closely aligned to the underlying 
performance of the business. The majority of our peers and 
stakeholders use this metric, and hence it is therefore a more 
appropriate KPI for use in the business and in our external 
communications.
The table below sets out the reconciliation between reported 
statutory measures and the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted 
EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA.

OUR PERFORMANCE
During the year, despite delivering growth in most of our 
business units, each business unit and the Group as a whole 
have seen a contraction in our margins. The main cause relates 
to cost increasing both before and at a faster rate than the 
growth in our revenues in each business unit.
Margins contracted due to increases in both direct and indirect 
costs. Salary related costs represent approximately 70 per cent 
of the Group’s cost base. Cost increases were largely driven 
by a significant increase in headcount (16 per cent) combined 
with average salary increases of 6-7 per cent to give total 
salary-based cost increases of approximately 23 per cent, or 
around 16 per cent of sales. 
This compares with total organic and acquisition-based 
revenue growth of 15 per cent and led to a consequent 
reduction in utilisation and realisation from our professional 
service delivery staff. 
We also made investments in new sales structures that have 
not yet born fruit in proportionately increased revenues.
Other indirect cost increases reflect £3.4m of additional 
depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets 
linked to a number of systems having entered service, and 
hence these have started amortising. In addition, there was 
a £1.3m acquisition impact on these costs. Premises costs 
increased by £1.4m, partly to accommodate extra staff and 
also in upgrading facilities. Marketing spend rose £1.3m as the 
Group sought to raise its profile in a number of areas. 
As a result, Adjusted EBIT in the year fell from £39.7m to 
£27 .5m despite the benefit of a positive foreign exchange 
impact of £0.6m. At the same time, our Adjusted EBIT margin 
fell from 19.4 per cent to1 1.4 per cent. The following shows the 
key drivers for the reduction in year-on-year profitability.
The Group’s overall EBIT result included £0.2m of losses from 
the now closed Domain Services operating segment (2016: 
operating losses of £1.4m). The current year charge was then 
offset by a £1.2m profit on disposal of Open Registry (also 
treated as an adjusting item).
The Group’s reported pre-tax loss was £55.3m (2016:  
£9.4m profit).

How we are  
part of your daily life
ASSURANCE — SAFEGUARDING HEALTHCARE
One of the biggest ransomware attacks in recent history started somewhere in 
Europe on the morning of Friday 12 May 2017 .
Unnoticed for several hours, it circulated itself across the globe, infecting 
computers by exploiting a weakness in Windows operating systems that allows 
malicious code to be spread through file-sharing structures without a user’s 
consent.
In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) was the most high-profile victim. 
Nearly one-third (30 per cent) of all NHS Trusts were affected, with staff being 
forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments.
Victims in other countries include US delivery service FedEx, French car maker 
Renault and Russia’s Interior Ministry.
The malware, called WannaDecrypter, WannaCry or WCry, spread easily due to 
its ability to self-propagate; an instruction in the malicious code told it to jump 
to other vulnerable machines if it cannot connect to a specified address. This is 
reminiscent of the worm outbreaks of the early 2000s.
How our business model enables this
In these crisis situations, NCC Group’s 24/7 Security Operations Centres and 
managed services capability demonstrate their worth. Working around the clock, 
the team consistently delivers value and reassurance to customers across 
the globe, taking proactive steps to protect our customers and enhance our 
monitoring as new information and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) become 
available.
Over the course of the WannaCry attack, our Security Operations Centres carried 
out the following activities:
 z Provided expert analysis of the threat and offered pragmatic advice to all our 
SOC customers
 z Developed and then enhanced advanced SIEM correlation logic to monitor 
for attacks on customer networks, using IoC information provided from the 
Threat Intelligence (TI) research by NCC Group analysts
 z Used NCC Group’s threat sensors to proactively monitor for IoCs
 z Ensured commercial Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS) signature sets were 
up-to-date and monitored for the latest threats
 z Delivered 24/7 security monitoring, proactively watching for attacks and 
infection
 z Updated our SOC customers on a regular basis, including direct telephone 
calls to ensure that they were aware of the attack and to give them 
reassurance and assurance
How we will leverage this moving forward
As large-scale cyber attacks continue to occur on an ever-more frequent basis, 
it is important that your organisation is protected by utilising NCC Group’s 
24/7 Security Operations Centres and range of protective monitoring managed 
services. 
As a result of these proactive steps and measures, NCC Group’s SOC received 
the following feedback and praise:
“We have indeed received a note from the NCC Group SOC as 
part of the Network Threat Monitoring service, outlining the 
details of the attack and what to do to prevent damage – greatly 
appreciated. As always, we value the services that NCC Group 
brings to the table and are confident that our layered defense 
would offer the necessary resilience in this situation.”

OUR PERFORMANCE
ASSURANCE DIVISION – BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Assurance revenue
Assurance now accounts for 85 per cent of Group revenue 
and the impact of foreign exchange rates contributed £8.0m 
to the growth in the division. In addition, Assurance benefited 
from the full year effect of the prior year acquisition of Fox-IT 
(impact in 2017: £14.0m) and acquisitions in the year just 
completed (PSC £5.9m and VSR £1.1m). Net organic growth 
was £6.8m which represented year-on-year growth of 4.0 per 
cent with the balance due to changes in foreign exchange 
rates (£8.0m impact). The table below shows the revenue 
split between Security Consulting and a combined Web 
Performance and Software Testing.

Security Consulting 178.1 138.9 28
Web Performance and 
Software Testing 26.6 30.0 (1 1)
Total 204.7 168.9 21
Revenues in our Web Performance and Software Testing 
businesses fell by £0.5m (5 per cent) and £2.9m (14 per 
cent) respectively. In Web Performance we felt the impact of a 
slower take up than expected for a new service line and have 
taken an impairment charge on this business. In Software 
Testing the loss of a project that was already underway at 
the start of the year, following a strategic decision to cancel 
a divestment by the customer, had a negative impact on both 
revenue and costs as utilisation rates for permanent staff fell.
Towards the end of the financial year, both Web Performance 
and Software Testing businesses saw a pick up in sales 
pipeline opportunities and also in some longer term contract 
wins.
The table above can act as a guide to the impact on revenue of 
the proposed disposals of the Web Performance and Software 
Testing businesses during the course of the new financial year 
ending 31 May 2018. Neither business is particularly seasonal 
and therefore any reduction to the Group total turnover 
following the disposals is likely to be pro rated to the point in 
the new year when the businesses are sold.
The Assurance division saw very mixed revenue results during 
the year. While the headline growth rate for the Security 
Consulting activities is very attractive, some business lines saw 
better performance than others. The underlying performance 
of the Security Consulting business lines is much easier to 
understand by using constant currency and also by splitting 
performance between organic and acquisition based growth.  
Assurance revenue is broken down into more detail in the table 
below in terms of the impact of changes in foreign exchange 
rate, the impact of acquisitions in both the prior year and the 
year under review, and the “organic” performance of a number

The table on the opposite page highlights the number and 
variety of moving parts in explaining this year’s revenue 
performance. The impact of changes in FX rates and 
acquisitions are clearly shown in the top half of the table. For 
the purposes of this analysis, given that Fox-IT was acquired 
at the end of November 2015, the whole of the first half of 
the current financial year’s revenue has been attributed to the 
impact of the acquisition.
Growth in UK and US consulting revenues was very 
healthy, representing growth of 19 per cent and 24 per cent 
respectively on a constant currency basis. This was driven 
by a combination of market growth and our ability to capture 
share due to our scale. In addition, we have been bringing new 
products to market and continuing to expand our focus areas 
beyond transactional activity. Within Fox-IT we saw two strong 
opposing forces. As previously announced, a key customer for 
Fox High Assurance products (Fox-HA) significantly slowed 
down its purchases from the business following the change 
in ownership of the company. It is clear that we should have 
engaged with this customer in a transparent way ahead of 
the acquisition to allay some of their concerns. However, we 
have since been working hard and collaboratively to allay the 
concerns of the customer and we are starting to see some 
new orders coming in for Fox-HA products from this critical 
customer. If momentum is maintained we should see some 
growth in this service line in the new financial year compared 
to the year ending 31 May 2017 .
In sharp contrast to Fox-HA, the other Fox service lines saw 
organic growth of 17 per cent in the second half of the year 
compared to the same period of ownership in the prior year. 
In particular, our CTMp platform and Threat Intelligence made 
promising progress. This is particularly pleasing in that both 
of these are key service lines that we aim to expand within 
the Netherlands and then to leverage in other NCC Group 
locations. The scalability of the CTMp platform will also support 
margin recovery. It is for this reason and the emerging recovery 
in Fox-HA, that while the execution challenges for the business 
are reflected in the impairment of around 30 per cent of the 
goodwill associated with the acquisition, we remain confident 
about the prospects for the Fox-IT business and its capability 
to support a broader platform of scalable high value add 
services across NCC Group.
In MSS we also saw two conflicting but slightly different 
themes from those in Fox. The negative force there has 
been in the resale of third party products which fell by £7 .4m 
compared to the prior year, equating to a fall of 48 per cent, 
and a fall in 2017 second half sales of products of almost 
90 per cent to £0.7m. The fall partly reflects the end of an 
earn-out period that had been put in place when the business 
was acquired by the previous owners and subsequently 
extended by NCC Group . In addition, we are trying to change 
our focus to higher value add activities and the building of 
long-term relationships with our customers.
We have not pursued these sorts of sales as strongly as in 
previous years. Instead, where we continue to sell third party 
products, we will aim to link those purchases to implementation 
consulting advice and after sales services such as monitoring 
in our Leeds based Security Operations Centre (SOC). While  
the revenue would have helped the year’s results, we are not 
overly concerned as we seek to deliberately rebalance the 
business away from single transaction reselling of third party 
products. Similar to Fox, in the areas of the business where we 
do see longer term value and growth potential, the service lines 
grew by 17 per cent year-on-year.
The summary of the Assurance revenue is:
 z Good growth was delivered in those areas where we want 
to place our future focus as this is where scalable margin 
recovery can be created. 
 z Fox-HA will start to recover in the coming year. 
 z Reselling third party products in MSS in the medium-term 
will be continued if we can create linkages to our own value 
added after sales services. 
 z Acquisitions and FX also played a strong supporting role in 
the revenue growth story.

OUR PERFORMANCE
ASSURANCE DIVISION – BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
The table below is based on an estimated split of our 
Assurance revenue streams based on currently available 
information. As noted elsewhere, we will be improving the 
quality and granularity as well as the relevance of our internal 
management information systems over the coming years. The 
data is, however, accurate enough to give a broad indication of 
the split of revenue streams.
2017 2016
Assurance revenue £m
% of 
total £m
% of 
total
Consulting services 156.1 76.2 122.4 72.5
Managed services 24.9 12.1 1 1.8 7 .0
Product sales 23.8 11.6 34.7 20.5
Total 204.7 100.0 168.9 100.0
While revenue grew in total by £35.8m (21 per cent), the 
absolute level of operating profit fell year-on-year by £9.1m 
(35 per cent). The fall in operating profit is all the more stark 
because it is after the positive impact of foreign exchange 
gains of £0.4m and the benefit of acquisitions. The acquisition 
benefits were from a full year of ownership of Fox-IT (£0.5m) 
and part year ownership of PSC and VSR (£1.7m benefit).
The underlying business performance in the Assurance 
division generated £1 1.3m less operating profit than last 
year (down 44 per cent) on £6.8m organic revenue growth. 
Adjusted EBIT margins fell to 8.2 per cent (2016: 15.3 per 
cent). The most significant driver for this was the increase in 
overall salary costs.
Our consulting businesses in the UK and US both saw a 
fall in absolute profitability as a lack of control over the cost 
base meant that it grew faster than our revenue streams. In 
particular, this reflected a strategy to build sales and delivery 
teams ahead of equivalent revenue growth and that led to 
margins being compressed in both businesses at a gross 
margin and EBIT margin level. At the same time, the Group 
was starting to develop its strategic sales capability to allow us 
to move further up our customers’ internal purchasing decision 
chains to become less transactional and more strategic in 
approach. That investment has been slower than anticipated in 
bearing fruit.
The Assurance business will typically see one or two major 
unplanned contract wins in any particular year. These can 
be related to the reaction to a major event at a customer or 
a specific proactive project such as corporate activity. In the 
year to May 2017 , the division did not have a material benefit 
from any such contracts and actually suffered from the loss 
of some. In one specific case, a large-scale Software Testing 
project (referenced above) was already underway with staff 
deployed on the ground. When the customer discontinued the 
contract the revenue stream stopped very quickly in the first 
half, whereas it had been expected to run for most of the year. 
A second large-scale project was cancelled before it began. 
In the third, which had not become a contracted order but 
had been a firm prospect as NCC Group was the preferred 
supplier for that type of work, the customer decided not to 
proceed with the work. The estimated potential revenue from 
the three contracts was around £14-17m and £6-7m of gross 
margin (based on a gross margin assumption of 40 per cent). 
Approximately £7-10m of this revenue had been included in 
the Group’s operating plan at the start of the year.
The most challenged part of the Assurance division was MSS 
which saw a fall in revenue of £4.6m (14 per cent). As noted 
earlier, while much of the revenue fall related to less attractive 
sales of third party products, the gross margin delivered would 
still have been a helpful contribution towards the overhead 
base. 
Similarly to the consulting businesses, in MSS the Group 
set about rebalancing the sales efforts and teams towards 
strategic and higher value added sales of customer solutions, 
comprising product, professional services and managed 
services. While we are confident that this is the correct 
approach in the medium-term, the short term impact was to 
increase our cost base at a time when revenues were falling. 
There was also the impact of ongoing integration challenges 
for the MSS service lines (acquired under the Accumuli plc 
transaction).

How we are  
part of your daily life
ASSURANCE — SECURING SUPPLY CHAINS 
Supplier Assured
Effective information security comprises a number of internal factors that 
are directly within an organisation’s control – e.g. technologies, governance, 
processes and people.  Other factors can be outside of an organisation’s control 
such as interactions with suppliers. 
Third party suppliers can be an attractive way for cyber criminals to gain access 
to data and networks that would otherwise be beyond their reach. A huge range 
of external suppliers, from marketing to accountants to legal firms, may all hold 
intellectual property or sensitive personal information on employees and clients 
or may provide access into an organisation’s environment. 
In order to avoid costly damage to customer confidence, reputation and 
ultimately the share price, organisations must ensure comprehensive security 
audits of third party suppliers and partners are carried out and that all necessary 
security measures are being implemented and maintained.
NCC Group understands that organisations are using an increased number 
of suppliers, and on-site audits for the whole supply chain is not financially 
or operationally feasible. NCC Group has therefore developed a risk based 
approach to help organisations gain assurance that information security risks 
and requirements such as GDPR are managed effectively for their suppliers.
How our business model enables this
NCC Group has worked for a number of years auditing and assessing our 
clients’ supply chains to ensure that they are secure and robust. As such, 
we have made a significant investment in people, processes and technology 
associated with this. More recently, we have developed an end-to-end “Supplier 
Assured” managed service utilising a combination of on-site assessments and 
a remote questionnaire and evidence based validation to deliver a cost effective 
solution to our clients’ third party security.
The service is made up of four key pillars:
1. Supplier Landscape Assessment: We will conduct a questionnaire based 
risk assessment on your entire supplier landscape to help you identify your 
high risk suppliers and quantify how they impact your organisation’s data and 
technologies.
2. Supplier Audit: Suppliers will be asked to complete a 14 domain control 
self-assessment to ensure they have appropriate security controls to 
mitigate key risks. We will review the results of this self-assessment and 
select suppliers for on-site audits to ensure that risks are captured fully and 
effectively.
3. Supplier Remediation Management: We can help manage supplier risk 
remediation programmes by advising on measurable solutions that allow client 
continued assurance that risks are managed in line with business objectives. 
Lessons learnt from all remediation activities will be passed throughout the 
client organisation and its supply chain.
4. Supplier Management Strategy and Remediation: We can help 
strengthen the effectiveness of your supplier management programmes 
by providing assistance where you need it. We can help assess and build 
security controls, policies and procedures, on-boarding security requirements, 
off-boarding requirements etc. and assist in embedding this in your target 
operating model.
NCC Group works with a number of large organisations to successfully deliver 
this service in a modular fashion. Its Supplier Assured managed service is based 
on a secure portal platform to pseudo-automate the supplier review process and 
remove the traditional email and spreadsheet supplier review approach which 
can quickly become unmanageable for a large number of suppliers.   
For one well known supermarket chain we have recently undertaken a proof of 
concept exercise prior to a full roll out of the service, enabling the client to gain a 
clear understanding of the supplier risk landscape and also develop, implement 
and manage an appropriate remediation approach. Over 2,000 suppliers were 
ranked and the top 50 were selected for assessment by NCC Group. To ensure 
new suppliers were included within the tracker, a short-term due diligence 
process was developed with a strategic plan to fully mature the process.  
How we will leverage this going forward
As the supply chain threat continues to increase, NCC Group will place more 
emphasis on our Supplier Assured service. Utilising well established processes, 
procedures and tooling we will be able to onboard more clients into the service, 
enabling our clients to gain benefit from both cost savings and a well established 
and experienced team. We will also continue to revise, amend and improve our 
Supplier Assured framework, utilising the experience we gain from delivering in 
excess of 1,000 assessments.

The financial services sector has dealt with online criminal threats for nearly 
two decades yet the threats are ever increasing. Various types of criminals, and 
at times, nation states, have targeted their continuously evolving techniques for 
financial gain at banks and other financial institutions and their customers across 
the globe. 
In addition, espionage is a real and continuous threat for many organisations 
including financial services and governments. A defining feature of espionage is 
that it involves stealing of confidential or sensitive information such as intellectual 
property or PII and that it is designed to go unnoticed. The information may be 
used for competitive advantage or to support geopolitical goals. The damage 
resulting from espionage campaigns is often material and the impact can 
sometimes only be gauged after time. 
How our business model enables  
resilient finance
NCC Group’s Dutch based subsidiary, Fox-IT, has tracked criminal threat groups 
ever since the first attacks on online banking, giving us unique insight into 
criminal organisations, their modus operandi and the tools that they use. We use 
this insight and our knowledge to provide financial institutions with very specific 
and real-time information to detect and mitigate attacks along with contextual 
information about the individuals that may be unwittingly involved in fraud. 
In 2010, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands approached Fox-IT to 
help tackle the problem of fraud. Together, Fox-IT and the bank developed 
an innovative fraud detection platform (DetACT) as a means to directly 
operationalise our threat intelligence in order to help combat attacks such as 
Internet banking and credit card fraud. 
Other banks in the Netherlands joined later in our efforts to reduce damages 
as a result of Internet banking fraud, which peaked to €33m in 2012. Last year, 
fraud damages were less than €1m for the first time since 2007 in the Dutch 
market. Fox-IT is proud to have significantly contributed to this successful 
reduction in risk to the Dutch banking system. 
Globally, financial regulators are increasing the scrutiny of their markets with 
regards to demonstrated cyber resilience with the UK and the Netherlands 
leading these efforts today. NCC Group, as a Bank of England approved provider 
under the CBEST scheme, and Fox-IT, with wider NCC Group support as a De 
Nederlandsche Bank for TIBER scheme, is well placed in the market. These 
accreditations have resulted in NCC Group performing red team engagements 
for some of the most prolific financial market infrastructure providers and 
institutions in the UK, the Netherlands and the wider European market. 
How we will leverage this going forward 
Fox-IT continues to track criminal groups in order to understand how they 
work and predict what they will do next. The more recent blending of criminal 
and espionage operations shows the importance of following these threats 
closely. This in turn helps continuously improve Fox-IT’s fraud detection platform 
and it also feeds its Managed Detection and Response (MDR) platform with 
threats intelligence in order to provide rapid detection of these threats at earlier 
stages, when criminals infect systems that they can later use to carry out fraud. 
Additionally, our fraud detection platform gained traction in other parts of Europe, 
where we are currently helping banks fight fraud. 
Incident Response assignments are opportunities to see attackers live at 
work. They provide valuable information about the attacker’s means, motives 
and technical indicators of successful attacks. Fox-IT and NCC Group use 
information gained from such cases in multiple ways. 
First and foremost, we use it to detect new attacks with our MDR platform that 
protects all our customers. We also use the information for historic analysis to 
determine if any of our other customers has been the victim of an attack similar 
in nature. The insights we obtained during the IR case often lead to innovations 
in our MDR platform, thus continuously improving the platform. Lastly, any 
information about the attackers is used by our threat analysts as a starting point 
for further investigation into that attacker.
For red teaming in the financial sector, as Singapore, Hong Kong, the European 
Central Bank and other regulators implement robust resilience programmes, 
NCC Group’s experience, global reach, scale and technical investment means we 
are well placed to capitalise on market opportunities.

ASSURANCE — AUTOMOTIVE SPECIALISM
The Metrocab is London’s first zero emission capable taxi, developed by Frazer-
Nash Research and Ecotive. The vehicle uses an electric battery and a petrol 
engine, which extends the range of the battery. NCC Group works as a cyber 
security and assurance partner to Frazer-Nash Research to independently advise 
on the security of in-vehicle networks and systems.
Automotive cyber security
Many people talk about modern connected cars as “computers on wheels”. This 
analogy is not technically correct – a better one would be “complex networks on 
wheels”, comprising multiple network technologies and segments, connecting 
a range of different embedded computers from many different suppliers to 
sensors, actuators and display interfaces. Many of the embedded computers 
present within vehicles have been connected to each other for years in closed 
on-board vehicle networks. However, the big change that has prompted cyber 
security concerns in recent years has been the connectivity between the 
on-board vehicle network and the public mobile phone network, connecting 
vehicles to Telematics Service Providers and to the wider Internet. This change 
has required much greater scrutiny of the design and implementation of vehicle 
systems than has previously been deemed necessary, to ensure that remote 
attacks against connected cars cannot result in data theft or safety concerns.
How our business model enables this
NCC Group has been providing cyber security advice and guidance to  
the automotive industry since 2012. Our dedicated Transport Assurance  
Practice constantly updates assessment methodologies, tools and techniques 
through a research-led approach to consultancy. By having specialist technical 
teams, whose cyber security experience is augmented by domain-specific 
knowledge, we are able to provide world-leading services to the global 
automotive supply chain.
How we will leverage this moving forward
We already work as cyber security and assurance partners to many of the 
world’s leading vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers. With our research-led 
approach we are able to foresee new challenges facing the automotive industry, 
from vehicle-based ransomware and security concerns around autonomous 
vehicles, to the impact of GDPR legislation on car manufacturers.

OUR PERFORMANCE
ESCROW DIVISION - BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Revenue performance
The Escrow division now accounts for 15 per cent of Group 
revenues (2016: 17 per cent). Escrow revenue for the year grew 
by £1.8m (5 per cent) to £37 .1m (2016: £35.3m). Excluding the 
impact of FX, at constant currency rates underlying growth was 
£0.1m (0.3 per cent).

Europe 3.9 3.4 13
Total Escrow revenue 37.2 35.3 5
Escrow UK
Escrow UK revenue was £25.4m (2016: £25.7m). During 
the second half of the year we identified that some invoices 
had been recognised as revenue ahead of the related service 
delivery. The correction of this issue reduced reported revenue 
in the year by £1.0m with an almost equivalent EBIT impact. 
The issue had built up over three years and no individual year 
required a material adjustment and hence the full impact 
was recognised as a one-off, non-recurring, non-cash item 
in the current year. While there was never any question of 
not delivering the service, and in many cases payment was 
received in advance, this revised approach is deemed to be a 
more appropriate application of the Group’s unchanged policy 
on revenue recognition. 
The reported 1 per cent reduction in revenue (2016: 8 per cent 
growth) would have been growth of 3 per cent if not for the 
one-off adjustment.
Escrow UK recurring revenues increased to £14.1m (2016: 
£13.7m) and terminations remain at around 1 1 per cent with 
nearly 90 per cent of all contracts renewed (2016: 90 per 
cent). 
We expect UK growth to remain modest given the relative 
market maturity and our market share.
Escrow USA 
Escrow USA revenues grew by 27 per cent to £7 .9m (2016: 
£6.2m) with recurring revenues of £4.5m. Approximately half 
of this related to the impact of changes in FX rates with the 
balance all being organic growth. In the fourth quarter we 
restructured our senior management and sales team in Escrow 
USA to build further on the significant opportunity we have in 
that country.
Escrow Europe 
Escrow Europe revenues grew by 13 per cent to £3.9m 
(2016: £3.4m) with recurring revenues of £2.1m. However, 
all of this and more was the result of changes in FX rates. On 
an underlying organic basis the business actually shrank by 
3 per cent. This reflects significant management change in our 
European Escrow team that are being addressed in the first 
half of the new financial year.
Escrow Rest of the World 
The division has recently established an office in Dubai to take 
advantage of the Group’s reputation and expertise in a region 
that has good demand potential for escrow services and in 
which we have a number of existing clients, allowing us to build 
a larger footprint in anticipation of Expo 2020.
Our short-term goals for the Escrow division as a whole are:
 z To maintain our market leading position in the UK, delivering 
modest annual organic growth
 z To continue to develop evolving solutions for customers in a 
SaaS and cloud based world
 z To build on our scalable capability in the US
 z To stabilise our relatively small footholds in a number 
of European territories (the Netherlands, Germany, and 
Switzerland)
 z To begin to build out from our new positions in our “Rest of 
the World” offices in Dubai and Singapore
Escrow UK now has 1 1 1 employees (2016: 107), Escrow 
Europe has 12 employees (2016: 15) and the North American 
Escrow businesses have 41 employees (2016: 59).

Share of corporate costs (3.9) (3.2) (22)
Total Escrow EBIT 19.1 20.1 (5)
The £1.0m impact on profitability of the revenue recognition 
issue has been noted above. Because the revised approach was 
adopted in the second half of the financial year but applied to 
the year as a whole, it has had a disproportionate impact on the 
reported results in the second half. Excluding this adjustment, 
EBIT for Escrow would have been flat year-on-year.
The division experienced some of the same increases in 
the cost base as seen in the Assurance division but to a 
lesser degree. As a result, EBIT margins in the division fell 
by 5.6 per cent to 5 1.3 per cent (2016: 56.9 per cent) with 
revenue recognition being a one-off 2.6 per cent reduction. 
The revised operating model that is already in place for the 
Escrow teams around the world mean that the division should 
deliver an improvement in margins in the new financial year 
ending May 2018.

ESCROW — BUSINESS CRITICAL  
SOFTWARE CONTINUITY
A leading holiday operator decided to introduce a new reservations system to 
enable all of its high street outlets and businesses to have online access to the 
same real time price information for holiday packages. 
As a way of facilitating the real time availability of hotels, flights and car rental 
information the system was key to the holiday operator’s strategy of improving its 
service in line with its customers’ expectations and booking behaviour. 
The holiday operator began the process of replacing its legacy systems with a 
system that could communicate with the myriad of reservation systems used in 
the travel market and enable agents to give customers instant availability and 
reservation details. 
The system was also designed for use on multiple channels including websites, 
retail shops and call centres. 
The holiday operator takes business continuity for its critical reservation 
infrastructure seriously, so when planning for the new platform it wanted to 
ensure that provisions were in place to protect itself should an event occur that 
had the potential to disrupt the ongoing service of the application and affect 
customer experience. 
How our business model enables this
Following a review of the marketplace and the protection solutions on offer, 
the holiday operator decided to partner with one of the world’s leading 
escrow providers, NCC Group. NCC Group’s software escrow solutions are 
a smart, simple way of managing risk by protecting the huge investment that 
organisations make in software each year. 
Under the terms of an escrow agreement, NCC Group holds a copy of the 
source code behind the business critical application or platform and commits 
to release the material if a “trigger event” should occur that would render the 
software supplier incapable of fulfilling its contractual obligations. If such an 
event occurs, the holiday operator can apply for the material to be released 
quickly and safely, minimising cost and disruption. This would then enable it to 
maintain and support the application in-house or appoint a qualified contractor 
to do so. 
As part of all its escrow agreements, NCC Group carries out an Integrity Test on 
the material received to ensure it is virus free, accessible and of the expected 
type. This process ensures that any obvious mistakes in the deposit are detected 
and resolved.
However, due to the nature of the software in question and the uncertain 
economic climate, NCC Group recommended that as well as ensuring that 
the source code is stored and regularly updated, the holiday operator should 
commission Full Verification testing of the application to ensure that the source 
code deposited could be built into the working system if needed.
NCC Group’s range of verification services are specifically designed to 
remove any uncertainty of what is held in escrow and test the accessibility and 
completeness of the material.
The verification process gives both end users and suppliers complete peace 
of mind. Initially, the verification consultant worked with the supplier through a 
complete build of the source code and then worked with the team at the holiday 
operator to test that the correct application was created. The entire process was 
detailed in a comprehensive report, which the holiday operator can then use as a 
step-by-step manual to build the source code into the working application.
When its software supplier unfortunately went into administration, the holiday 
operator needed to invoke the escrow agreement and requested a source code 
release from NCC Group. The fact that the holiday operator had taken steps to 
mitigate risk, and had ownership of the build reports for the reservation system, 
played a crucial part in the legal negotiations that followed with its supplier’s 
administrators.
Only because the holiday operator had carried out verification of the source 
code through NCC Group’s Full Verification and Build Assured Verification did 
it have a full build report for the business critical reservation infrastructure that 
enabled it to carry on maintaining and supporting the application by appointing 
an alternative contractor to do so.
How we will leverage this going forward
Most businesses rely on IT applications to run important and critical functions 
within their organisation. As the use of IT across organisations continues to grow 
it is increasingly important to ensure that businesses have a plan in place to 
mitigate against the risk of software supplier failure. NCC Group will continue to 
engage with both software providers and our customers to help and form part of 
an organisation’s business continuity plan.

SOFTWARE TESTING — NEW SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION 
NCC Group’s client, a major luxury fashion retailer, required a testing partner 
who could manage the complex implementation of two third party solutions, 
maintaining the quality standards in parallel development.
The main challenge was the integration of the transformed EPOS system and 
the new loyalty offering, from both a technical and process perspective, into its 
current business model with minimum disruption.
These two projects were of the upmost importance as they will ultimately 
strengthen the client’s position in the retail industry and help it to maintain 
customer loyalty while meeting key strategic goals.
Software is not the client’s core business and it needed a quality partner to bring 
a strong approach as well as a complete testing solution.
How our business model enables this
Given the scale of the EPOS transformation, the client needed absolute clarity 
about how the validation and testing effort would ensure that both technical and 
business requirements were delivered as expected to fully support its business 
strategy and activities.
NCC Group put together a joined-up approach to deliver testing across the 
various transformation areas, ensuring that the solution delivered business value 
for the client. This included:
 z Leveraging NCC Group’s Delivery Centre to provide a remote, on-shore 
capability, with a local test manager to ensure tight communication and 
accountability.
 z Testing of the EPOS system and devices from NCC Group’s Delivery Centre, 
evaluating functionality from front of store to back end systems without 
taking up space in the client’s offices.
 z Testing of the loyalty solution across a range of browsers and devices, 
ensuring consistent customer experience and supporting incentivisation by 
the client.
 z Testing of the international version of the client’s website, validating orders 
across 1 1 7 countries into its fulfilment capability.
 z Testing of the client’s marketplace functionality, allowing customers to order 
directly through to suppliers through the client’s website and ensuring that 
the expansion of this marketplace delivered value to customers.
 z With NCC Group’s support at all stages of the process, the client 
successfully implemented two new key initiatives. The transformed EPOS 
system is now live in one of the main store locations and being rolled out at 
other locations.
 z The new loyalty application is currently being used by its customers and 
the international website and new marketplace have also successfully gone 
live. This allows the client to deliver a competitive retail experience to its 
customers on a global scale.
How we will leverage this going forward
 z The transformation enabled the client to deliver value to customers and 
NCC Group looks forward to working closely with the client as the company 
continues to expand and refine its retail offering.
 z This valued NCC Group client had a number of challenges, including lack of 
expert test consultant skills, shortage of desk space in prime London territory 
and expertise in delivering similar sized, business critical projects. The project 
was both demanding and critical to the continual success of this client both 
online and in store and failure to deliver was not an option. We partnered at 
the most critical stage where business requirements were being determined, 
we introduced testing early into every phase of development, and provided 
this client with a robust strategy to deliver and go live without fault. Key 
delivery points and objectives are below:
 — Previous expertise in sector and project type
 — Ability to scale with the exact skills at speed
 — Flexible on-site / off-site model (but all on-shore)
 — Develop a strategy that would be agreeable by the Board for budget 
approval and sanction
 — Ability to manage all test phases and manage stakeholders to  
Board level
 — Drive down costs where appropriate but without affecting test quality
 — Shared responsibility to meet demanding timescales
 — Secure, highly confidential off-site facilities

Individually significant items
The carrying value of all of our goodwill and intangible assets 
were assessed as part of our normal year end process. As a 
result, there have been a number of impairments recognised 
in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets. The Fox and 
former Accumuli businesses (the latter now known as MSS) 
have underperformed in the year compared to our original 
acquisition forecasts. They have also encountered integration 
challenges that have slowed the pace of commercial leverage 
of the different new service and product lines across the rest 
of the Group. In MSS we are also shifting focus away from one 
part of the business that previously concentrated on simply 
reselling third party products often without value added after 
sales services. 
The net result of these factors is to recognise an impairment 
of the goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Accumuli plc 
by £24.3m. This equates to around 50 per cent of the goodwill 
attributable to what is now known as MSS. It is worth noting 
that one part of the Accumuli business has been successfully 
and fully integrated with our UK Security Consulting business 
and its share of goodwill (£14.3m) is now considered as part of 
that cash generating unit (CGU). 
In Fox-IT we have recognised an impairment of £24.3m of 
goodwill, representing around 30 per cent of the goodwill that 
arose on acquisition. While we are confident that the Fox-IT 
business and service lines and the MSS business refocused 
on value added managed services and advisory services are 
attractive business in the medium to long-term, there is much 
to be done to realise this potential. The length of time needed 
to realise this potential and the execution risks involved 
over that period mean that it is appropriate to recognise the 
impairment of these assets.
In our Web Performance business we have reviewed the 
carrying value of both internally generated intangible assets 
and the goodwill associated with the acquisition of that 
business. While we do see longer term value in this business, 
some of the revenue generating intangible assets have been 
slower than originally anticipated to generate revenues and a 
retained customer base. The slower ramp up in revenue has 
therefore led to the recognition of impairments over two assets 
amounting to £3.0m and over goodwill of £5.7m.
In the prior year it was announced that the Group was 
withdrawing from the Domain Services operating segment. 
At that time two assets were retained with carrying values of 
£2.0m and £2.7m in respect of the .trust TLD and a software 
application for use in Domain and potentially in other retained 
parts of the Group. 
Given the inherent uncertainties in realising any value from the 
.trust TLD it has been decided to write that asset off in full. The 
Group will seek to maximise any value from the asset. It has 
now been identified that the retained Domain software system 
does not have a role in the business going forward and it too 
has been fully impaired.
Other individually significant items in the year are set out in 
note 3 to the accounts and include:
 z Adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration due 
to changes in FX rates of £2.9m;
 z Holiday pay accrual relating to previous financial periods of 
£1.8m. This is described in more detail in note 3;
 z Restructuring costs of £1.3m relate to professional fees for 
the Strategic Review, the Target Operating Model project, 
exit payments to the former CEO, and retention bonuses 
paid to former employees of Accumuli plc;
 z Double running and exit costs of £1.3m for empty 
properties;
 z Impairment of property, plant and equipment (£0.9m) on the 
planned relocation of the Group’s Manchester Head Office 
in September 2017; and
 z Acquisition costs of £0.8m.
Prior year individually significant charges are also set out in 
note 3.
Taxation 
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate is 29.3 per cent 
(2016: 22 per cent), which is marginally above the average 
standard UK rate of 20 per cent (2016: 21 per cent). The 
higher effective rate reflects the higher tax rates incurred in 
the overseas businesses. It had been earlier reported that the 
tax rate for the year would rise to around 31 per cent. This 
was based on an estimated position at the time of the Interim 
Results in January 2017 and included certain assumptions 
about the level and geographical origin of pre-tax profits. 
The actual results were lower than those estimates and a 
significant part of the reduction was in higher tax territories. 
The Group expects to maintain the effective P&L tax rate at 
around 30 per cent for the next few years, assuming a similar 
split of profitability compared to the current year.
The Group has recently hired a tax and treasury manager whose 
tasks will include developing a longer term strategy for tax and 
treasury matters. In both of these areas the Board has a low risk 
appetite and the new strategies will operate inside that.

Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.15p per 
ordinary share, making a total for the year of 4.65p. This 
represents a dividend equal to that paid in the prior year. While 
dividend cover is negative (2016: 2.4 times based on basic 
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations) the 
Board is confident that the Group’s new Strategic Plan will be 
a source of long-term sustainable growth in earnings, cash 
flow and shareholder value.
An administrative non-compliance issue has been identified 
with respect to distributable reserves and the payment of  
previous dividends. We expect to remedy the position by 
means of shareholder resolutions at the AGM in September.
Cash
We are aiming to disclose in as transparent a way as possible 
the key moving parts in our cash flows. We also publish a 
new definition and calculation of free cash flow and cash 
Conversion ratio that is more closely aligned to market 
practice.  
The table below summarises the Group’s cash flow for the 
year:

Foreign exchange impacts (6.1) 0.9
Closing net debt (43.7) (12.7)
The Group generated a net £25.9m of cash from operating 
activities. This was before deducting £3.7m costs of internally 
capitalised development costs. 
Working capital saw a reduction in accrued income as our 
billing processes became more effective and timely in the 
fourth quarter. While the natural consequence of this is then 
an increase in trade debtors, the net impact is to shorten the 
working capital life cycle and accelerate cash conversion. The 
net working capital cash outflow was the result of deliberate 
management action to improve supplier relations by improving 
the profile of creditor payments compared to prior years. 
Interest and tax cash costs remained modest and the latter 
reflects in part the lower profitability of our overseas higher tax 
rate territories.

Net capital expenditure of £1 1.0m was a mix of discretionary 
and maintenance capex. No breakdown of discretionary versus 
maintenance capex is available as yet. However, maintenance 
spend includes costs of new hardware and software for use in 
the business. Discretionary spend includes a number of new 
office locations that have either been acquired or moved into in 
the year ending 31 May 2017 . 
The largest one-off “discretionary” capex spend in 2017 was the 
£3.8m cost of Category A and B fit out costs of the Group’s new 
headquarters building in Manchester that will be occupied in the 
summer of 201 7 . 
The move was occasioned by the end of the existing lease and 
the need for more space to accommodate current and future 
business growth. The fit out costs in the year were almost fully 
funded by a landlord contribution of £3.7m. The estimate to 
complete the project is £4.0m and the final cash costs will be 
paid in the 2018 financial year.
Given the number of office moves completed or started in 
the 2017 financial year, we do not expect to incur similar 
significant capex or costs during the new financial year. 
Conversely, we expect our annual premises costs which 
include depreciation, rent, and rates to increase in the new 
financial year by £1.9m, which will be an annualised £2.2m in 
the following year.
Acquisitions are discussed in more detail in the Assurance 
Division review.
The calculation of the cash conversion ratio for the last two 
years is set out below and referenced to the various notes in 
the Annual Report.

£m
Net cash generated from 
operating activities 28.0 13.8
Adjusted EBITDA 36.2 45.0
Cash conversion ratio (A) / (B) 77% 31%
One of the main drivers for the difference between operating 
cash flow and EBITDA are the capitalised development cash 
costs in the year of £3.7m which if charged against EBITDA 
would give a cash conversion ratio of 86 per cent in 2017 .
Financing facilities
In November 2016, the Group increased its banking facilities 
to £1 10m (May 2016: £78m) with a new five-year multi-bank 
facility, comprising an £80m (May 2016: £78m) revolving credit 
facility and a £30m (May 2016: nil) five-year term loan. The 
term loan amortises at £2.5m every six months until maturity 
and at the end of the year the term facility stood at £25.0m.
The Group’s primary banking covenants are:
 z Leverage limit of 2.5 times and this is calculated as 
Adjusted EBITDA / net debt. For the purposes of the 
covenant test, net debt includes deferred consideration on 
acquisitions (but not contingent consideration).
As at 31 May 2017 , leverage for banking purposes stood 
at 1.5 times, comfortably below the Group’s maximum 2.5 
times covenant limit.
 z Net interest cover which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA 
/ net interest payments and has a limit of 3.5 times.
 z As at 31 May 2017 , net interest cover was 25.9 times, again 
comfortably above the minimum level.
At the year end, outstanding contingent payments relate to 
PSC of £2.8m and VSR of £1.3m. The payments to the former 
owners are due in two equal instalments and are measured on 
December 2017 and December 2018 by reference to profit 
targets set at the time of the acquisitions. 
Also outstanding is non-contingent deferred consideration in 
respect of the acquisition of Fox-IT comprising €10m in cash 
and €2.5m shares due to be paid in November 2017 . The 
Group has the option to make the share based payment in 
cash instead.

Principal risks  
and uncertainties
RISK MANAGEMENT
Governance
Overall responsibility for the risk framework and definition of 
risk appetite rests with the Board, who through regular review 
of risks, ensure that risk exposure is matched with an ability to 
achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. Risks are identified 
primarily by the management team and by using a structured 
risk framework, with non-executive review being carried out by 
the Board.
Risk management processes and controls
The Board, with input from the Audit Committee, monitors the 
ongoing process by which critical risks to the business are 
identified, evaluated and managed. On a biannual basis, the 
Board reviews the detailed risk register that has been prepared 
and updated within the business by the Operations Board 
which has responsibility for day-to-day risk management within 
the business.
The CEO chairs the Operations Board and the other members 
include senior business unit and functional heads. The 
business has put in place:
 z Ongoing procedures to identify, evaluate and manage 
principal risks;
 z Procedures to monitor the control systems in place to 
reduce these risks to an acceptable level;
 z A biannual detailed Group-wide risk review; and
 z A process to consider progress made against significant 
business risks at monthly operational Board meetings.
In addition, during 2016, the Board formed a specialist 
Cyber Security Committee to evaluate the specific risks 
associated with its cyber risk environment. We expect to 
evolve our risk management processes and controls further 
in the new financial year in order to embed further risk 
management processes within the business. This will include 
the development of online risk and action tracking systems. 
We plan to carry this out in parallel with the creation of a new 
Internal Audit and Assurance function, reflecting the growing 
complexity of our business.
Evaluation of risk
The design and ongoing effectiveness of the key controls 
over the Group’s principal risks are documented using an 
“assurance map”. This includes an assessment of the net 
impact of each risk and the likelihood of its occurrence once 
mitigating controls are taken into account. The key controls 
over the Group’s identified principal risks are reviewed twice a 
year by management, the Audit Committee and the Board.
However, the Group’s risk management programme can only 
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that principal risks 
are managed to an acceptable level.
Ranking of the Group’s risks is conducted by combining the 
economic, operational or environmental impact of risks and the 
likelihood that they may occur. Those risks that are considered 
to pose the greatest threat to the Group and score the highest 
are identified as “principal risks”. The operations of the Group, 
and the implementation of its objectives and strategy, are 
subject to a number of principal risks and uncertainties. Where 
more than one of the risks to occur together, the overall impact 
on the Group would be greater.
Risk register
The Group maintains a risk register, which:
 z Sets out the Group’s risk appetite;
 z Identifies the key risks faced by the Group and assesses 
their likelihood and impact; and
 z Identifies the processes and controls in place to mitigate 
these risks.
The Group Risk Register is the primary reporting vehicle used 
by the Operations Board in performing its risk management 
duties. It is reviewed in depth by the Operations Board on 
a biannual basis. The Risk Register is then reviewed by the 
Board. Day-to-day risks faced by the Group are mitigated by 
management processes and procedures embedded in the 
Group’s Quality System. 
As the business grows in scale  
and complexity, it is important  
that we evolve our risk 
management processes. During 
the last year we implemented 
some new and enhanced 
processes and controls around  
our risk management activities.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Group operates in a particularly dynamic and evolving 
market-place. As new events occur or the business transitions 
into new activities or phases of its development, the risk 
register is updated accordingly. 
For example, reflecting the changing nature of the business, 
during 2016-17 , we had to complete the integration of two new 
and sizeable acquisitions into our risk management processes. 
As a result of these acquisitions, the Group now has a larger 
proportion of its revenue coming from hardware or other 
product sales and also from key strategic customers, with the 
consequence of there being less predictable sales cycles and, 
in some cases, larger but less frequent sales.
During the year, we saw a slowing in purchase activity by a 
key strategic customer in the Netherlands. We also incurred 
customer losses while professionalising the contracts 
management activities in one of the businesses we recently 
acquired, as well as having to bear increased costs.
Furthermore, as a result of these recent large acquisitions, the 
scale and complexity of the Group increased and enhanced 
controls and processes needed to be put in place. In order to 
address this, the Board authorised the creation of the roles of 
Director of Risk and Assurance, and a Group Tax and Treasury 
Manager. The former is in the process of being recruited while 
the latter post has been very recently filled.
The Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. Detailed descriptions of the current principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group, their potential impact and 
mitigating processes and controls are set out below. The tables 
also highlight whether the risk is assessed as increasing or 
decreasing with a similar assessment for the position last year. 
This includes identifying new principal risks and uncertainties.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Areas Potential Impact Mitigation
1
 Strategy
As the Group and its operating environment 
change, so too must its strategy if it is 
to continue to succeed and generate 
increasing shareholder value. 
The Group is in the process of changing and 
developing a new strategy that will need to 
take root.
A poor strategy or ineffective execution of 
a strategy would have a material negative 
impact on the Group’s financial performance 
and value. It would potentially weaken the 
Group compared to its competitors and 
risk the Group’s established position in the 
marketplace.
 
Members of the Board have significant 
experience in evolving business strategies. 
This experience has been complemented 
by the use of external consultants who have 
participated in the recent Strategic Review. 
2
 Management of change
As the Group adapts and changes its 
strategy there are a number of complex 
projects and initiatives that not only need to 
be delivered but also require understanding 
and support from all staff.
Poor change management could lead to 
ineffective implementation of projects that 
then cost more to deliver, take longer to 
deliver, and result in fewer benefits being 
realised (or all three).
 
The Board has been enhanced during the 
last six months by the appointment of an 
Executive Chairman and Interim CEO, both 
of whom have extensive experience of 
implementing change on organisations. 
Through regular engagement with all levels 
of staff the Group will ensure that the 
Group’s vision and strategy is shared with 
and understood by all staff.
3
 Information Technology
The Group is heavily reliant on continued 
and uninterrupted access to its IT systems. 
The Group is a natural target for individuals 
who may seek to disrupt the Group’s 
commercial activities. 
If the Group’s systems failed, this could 
affect the Group’s ability to provide services 
to our customers. If a system failure was the 
result of a successful external cyber attack, 
this could result in the loss of sensitive data 
and compromise the Group’s reputation as a 
leader in the field of cyber security.
Failing to successfully implement new IT 
systems could similarly cause business 
disruption. 
 
The Group has made significant investment 
in its IT infrastructure to ensure it continues 
to support the growth of the organisation. 
The Group has appropriate controls in place 
in order to mitigate the risk of systems 
failure and data loss, including systems 
back-up procedures and disaster recovery 
plans. The Group also deploys appropriate 
malware protection, network security 
controls and encryption of mobile devices. 
The Group is currently reviewing high 
priority systems changes to ensure that 
projects are well managed and deliver the 
required targeted benefits in an appropriate 
timeframe.

Recruitment and retention 
of key personnel
The Group would be adversely impacted if 
it were unable to attract and retain the right 
calibre of skilled staff.
Some roles within the Group operate in 
highly technical and extremely specialised 
areas in which there are shortages of skilled 
people.
 
Loss of key managers could result in a 
lack of necessary expertise or continuity to 
execute the Group’s strategy. 
An inability to attract and retain sufficient 
high-calibre employees could become a 
barrier to the continued success and growth 
of NCC Group.
2017 2016
Key personnel are tied in through rewarding 
career structures and attractive salary 
packages, which can include participation in 
share schemes.
Succession plans are being finalised for key 
members of the management team where 
they are not already in place.
The Group is reviewing our assessment 
and development processes to ensure that 
our employees can enjoy opportunities for 
further career training and development.
5
  
Conduct and  
reputational risk
Damage can result to our reputation or 
business by a combination of unanticipated 
events or by the acts of a single employee. 
Conduct risk can arise from a number of 
areas such as failing to meet customer 
expectations on project delivery, testing 
assignments or source code handling or 
from employees who could maliciously 
disrupt the business and steal customer 
information.
All such instances could result in damage 
to reputation, loss of repeat business and 
potentially lead to litigation and/or claims 
against NCC Group.
2017 2016
NCC Group operates a system of policies 
and procedures which are regularly audited 
as part of the Quality System. 
These, combined with management 
oversight, the risk management process, 
project reviews and customer feedback, 
mitigate the risk to successful service and 
project delivery. All staff are trained regularly 
and backups are taken wherever possible 
before testing assignments begin.
Employees are vetted before joining and 
robust controls and processes are in place 
to manage employees such as accounting 
controls, IT monitoring large downloads of 
data and controls on client site operations. 
6
 
Cyber risk
This is the risk that is faced by many of 
our customers, that external agents will 
successfully access and harm NCC Group 
data and operating systems, inspired by 
either the pursuit of financial gain or malice. 
As a provider of security services, the Group 
is a high profile target and could therefore 
be targeted by attacks specifically designed 
to disrupt the Group’s business and harm 
the Group’s reputation. If such an attack 
was successful, it could adversely affect the 
market’s perception of the Group as well as 
causing business disruption.
2017 2016
The Board has constituted a Cyber Security 
Committee chaired by the Senior Non-
Executive Director.
Security testing is regularly carried out 
on the Group’s infrastructure and there 
are extensive measures in place to assist 
in identifying and dealing with security 
incidents. 
The Group has a dedicated Information 
Security Management Forum which meets 
regularly to discuss security risks to the 
Group. Employees also receive regular 
security training and updates.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Areas Potential Impact Mitigation
7 Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions and disposals can be costly 
to complete and complex to deliver the 
targeted benefits. Risks range from deal 
execution (including price negotiations, 
due diligence, and contracting) to transition 
and integration into (or separation from) 
NCC Group.
Well-executed acquisitions and disposals 
with an appropriate purchase price can 
create significant value. Poorly executed 
acquisitions and disposals or those with 
excessive purchase prices can destroy 
shareholder value.
2017 2016
As part of its medium-term strategy, the 
Board remains committed to making value-
enhancing acquisitions.
The need to establish a robust and scalable 
Target Operating Model for the Group, 
including integrated ways of working, 
processes and systems, means that the 
Group is less likely to make any material 
acquisitions for the next year or two while 
that TOM is put in place.
Furthermore, the significant write down in 
the carrying values of goodwill following 
the acquisition of Accumuli and Fox-IT 
has led the Board to commence a review 
of our acquisition process and disciplines 
to identify areas for improvement and 
ways in which to reduce the risk of future 
impairments on any new acquisitions. This 
includes developing a more robust post-
acquisition integration process to deliver 
targeted benefits.
8
  Competition and failure to 
respond to market trends
Barriers to market entry are relatively low in 
some of our lower value service offerings. 
Equally, in such a dynamic and fast evolving 
technology space, products or services can 
be rendered obsolete by new technologies 
or platforms.
A major change in the technology landscape 
could lead to a decline in an individual 
service line’s revenue stream. One example 
of a recent change that needs a response is 
the move to more cloud-based applications 
and data storage.
2017 2016
The Group employs a number of industry 
leading experts and thought leaders in our 
marketplace. This puts us at the forefront 
of change and allows us early insight into 
emerging trends. This in turn allows us to 
anticipate or pre-empt a number of potential 
risks.
Group-wide technology and technical 
forums are used to disseminate and share 
market intelligence and trends, as well as to 
formulate responses, on a regular basis.
9
  Failure to protect 
intellectual property
A number of the Group’s service offerings 
depend on intellectual property rights that 
need to be registered, maintained and 
protected in various jurisdictions. Examples 
include trademarks, patents and valuable 
know-how.
If such rights are not sufficiently protected, 
the Group could potentially no longer be 
able to offer a particular service in some or 
all countries.
2017 2016
Patents are applied for where appropriate 
and intellectual property is only disclosed 
under a licence agreement or confidentiality 
agreement. The Group also takes steps to 
differentiate its IP as far as possible to lower 
the risk of any potential infringement claims.

  Liquidity, foreign exchange 
and banking facilities
The Group requires access to adequate 
banking facilities to fund its daily operations, 
capital investments and potential 
acquisitions.
Furthermore, as the Group’s international 
footprint expands, there is an inherent risk 
of adverse foreign exchange movements 
affecting profitability.
Inability to refinance the Group’s core 
banking facilities could call into doubt the 
Group’s longer term viability. Equally, if those 
facilities lacked the appropriate flexibility and 
structure, this could inhibit delivery of the 
Group’s strategy.
The absence of any currency hedging in 
2016-17 resulted in an exchange loss of 
£3.7m.
 
The Group’s current banking facilities cover 
all of its expected needs of the Group for the 
period of such facilities and are sufficiently 
flexible to allow the Group to function 
effectively.
The Group has recently appointed a Tax and 
Treasury Manager for the first time. Part of 
their role is to support the CFO in developing 
a Treasury strategy and overseeing its 
implementation.
The Board is currently reviewing a new 
Foreign Exchange hedging strategy that is 
primarily based on net cash flow hedging.
Impact of Brexit on the Group
The Group currently has relatively little inter-territorial trade 
from the UK into Europe and vice versa. While Brexit has 
already had an impact on exchange rates which the Group has 
leveraged, there is inevitably some uncertainty around the likely 
impact of Brexit on businesses. The Group does not believe 
that Brexit will have a significant impact on its operations 
as currently structured. UK cyber regulation is likely to stay 
closely attuned to evolving regulation in Europe, such as 
GDPR where implementation will proceed in both Europe and 
the UK as envisaged. 
Viability Statement
In accordance with the requirements of the 2014 revisions to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors assessed 
the longer term prospects of the Group. The assessment took 
into account the Group’s current competitive and financial 
position as well as the potential impact of the principal 
risks documented above on pages 48 to 53 of the Annual 
Report. The assessment emphasised those risks that could 
theoretically threaten the Group’s ability to operate or to 
continue in existence. 
As a result, the Directors determined that a three-year period 
to 31 May 2020 was an appropriate time frame for the viability 
assessment based on the historic performance of the Group. 
The rapid changes occurring in our marketplaces mean 
that a longer period would not have an acceptable level of 
forecasting accuracy. The Directors note that even a three-
year period in a rapidly evolving marketplace can present 
challenges for forecasting accuracy. The three-year time frame 
also takes account of the Group’s core banking facilities which 
have an expiry date in November 2020 and that are likely to be 
renewed ahead of that date, in line with market practice.
In making their assessment, the Directors have considered the 
Group’s current financial position and cash flow generation 
and undertaken a sensitivity analysis over the key trading 
assumptions combined with the potential impact of one or 
more of the principal risks on the business materialising within 
the three-year period.
The Directors used the principal risks noted above to develop 
a set of plausible scenarios that could have a potentially high 
impact on the longer term viability of the business. These 
were then used as sensitivity analysis against the baseline 
projections above. The key risks included: 
 z Product obsolescence;
 z Loss of key people;
 z Significant loss of business systems (whether through 
malignant design or misadventure);
 z Conduct risk; and
 z Failure to comply with all appropriate laws and regulations.
The probability and potential impact of these risks 
crystallising was used to assess their possible impact on the 
Group’s financial resources and liquidity. At the same time, 
consideration was given to mitigating actions in response 
to these risks and the ability of the Group’s financing 
arrangements to absorb any such impacts. In addition, comfort 
was taken from the distributed nature of many of the Group’s 
operations as well as diverse income generating product lines.
Based on the results of the analysis outlined above, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will remain viable and be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-
year period of their assessment. Furthermore, the Directors 
have no reason to doubt that the Group will continue in 
existence beyond the three-year period under assessment.

Corporate social  
responsibility
NCC Group takes its corporate 
social responsibilities very 
seriously and recognises the 
important contributions to the 
business made by the wider 
community of stakeholders, in 
particular investors, employees, 
clients, suppliers and local 
communities. 
It recognises that by acting responsibly it can deliver a 
sustainable business, while contributing to the community and 
preserving the environment.
The Board takes into account social, environmental, human 
rights and ethical issues in its discussions and decision-
making, as well as the health and safety of employees. 
Stakeholders
Investors
The investors in the Group need to trust that their capital 
is being responsibly used to provide them with sustainable 
returns. The Group communicates regularly with its investors 
in meetings and roadshows to keep them up-to-date with both 
the opportunities and challenges faced by the Company. 
During this year, the Directors maintained engagement with 
investors through various meetings and telephone calls, details

People are fundamental to the Group’s business, and the 
support and involvement of the talented individuals who form 
its team is vital to the continued success of the Group overall. 
The Head of HR reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer 
to ensure high level visibility and control of all employment 
related issues.
The Group endeavours to attract and retain the brightest and 
best people in its industry and to make sure they are given the 
opportunity to develop their talents. The Group is committed 
to providing a productive working environment and recognises 
the importance of training and career development. 
Each employee has a training record and is positively 
encouraged to up-skill. All roles where an additional 
professional qualification can be achieved are actively 
supported and rewarded. The Group employs a training 
manager who ensures all relevant staff have the necessary 
training plans in place. 
On a daily basis, the Group provides relevant technical, 
administrative and sales training and each employee is 
required to dedicate a certain amount of time each month 
to research and development. The majority of the training is 
provided in-house (through on the job side-by-side coaching, 
internal workshops or as part of a research team) although 
external courses and trainers are used where it is appropriate 
to do so. 
It is not possible to directly quantify the total amount spent on 
training within the Group, as this is part of the normal working 
week.
The Group has a policy of keeping employees informed of, and 
engaged in, its business strategy through the Intranet, regular 
employee briefings and divisional meetings. Information is 
cascaded from the Board downward to ensure that relevant 
Group targets are communicated, as well as ensuring that 
cultural values are aligned.
Comments and suggestions from employees on the Group’s 
performance and management are actively encouraged. Direct 
access to the senior management team is actively promoted 
and encouraged and the Group maintains an Open Door Policy.
Every employee and contractor has access to an external 
whistle-blowing helpline pursuant to the Group’s Whistle-
blowing Policy.
Modern slavery 
The Group recognises that modern slavery is a crime and 
a violation of fundamental human rights. The term modern 
slavery includes not only slavery but also servitude, forced and 
compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have 
in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in 
order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. 
The Company has a zero tolerance approach to “modern 
slavery” and is committed to acting ethically and with integrity 
in all of its business dealings and relationships, and to 
implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls 
to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in 
its business or in any of its supply chains. The Company 
communicates its zero tolerance approach to all its suppliers, 
contractors and business partners and this message 
is reiterated in its “Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking 
Statement”on the Group’s website. It expects high standards 
from all of its contractors, suppliers and other business 
partners, and also expects that its suppliers will hold their own 
suppliers to the same standards.
Equality and diversity
The Group is committed to equality and diversity and offers 
equal opportunities to all and maintains an Equality and 
Diversity Policy which aims to create a working environment 
free from unlawful discrimination, victimisation and harassment 
in which all employees are treated with dignity and respect.

STRATEGIC REPORT
NCC AR2017 - proof 8-Front.indd   54 09/08/2017   16:05:24 25546.04    9 August 2017 3:58 PM    Proof Six
As part of this we work to ensure that all employees, whatever 
their personal circumstances, receive the same opportunities 
for training, career development and promotion.
The Board recognises the need to positively support gender 
diversity in a technology business, which has traditionally 
and historically attracted more men due to, in our view, the 
teaching of IT and Technology in our schools and colleges 
where the subject has historically been viewed as a primarily 
male preserve. The Group is endeavouring to engage with local 
schools, colleges and universities to help educate and instil the 
benefits and opportunities of careers in IT and cyber security 
for all genders.
NCC Group supports GCHQ’s CyberFirst Girls Competition in 
a bid to encourage young women to consider cyber security 
as a career. The competition, aimed at 14 and 15 year-old 
girls, is part of the National Cyber Security Programme and 
is designed to inspire a new generation of females. A team 
of female security consultants from the Group have been 
working on the initiative, producing videos with tips on how to 
avoid becoming a victim of a cyber attack and also speaking at 
roadshows in universities up and down the country.
Approximately 80 per cent of our employees are male 
and 20 per cent female. In our team of senior managers, 
approximately 92 per cent of the team are male and 8 per 
cent female while on our plc Board, 83 per cent are male 
and 17 per cent female. A “senior manager” is defined in the 
legislation as an employee who has responsibility for planning, 
directing or controlling the activities of the Company or a 
strategically significant part of the Company.
The Group is committed to its employees and actively attempts 
to improve their health, well-being and morale by encouraging 
fitness-based activities and taking part in charitable events. 
The Group has its own football, cricket and netball teams that 
play regularly, and organises cycling events encouraging mass 
employee and business participation. 
Health and safety
The Group takes health and safety in the workplace seriously 
and complies with all relevant legislation and best practice. 
There have been no workplace fatalities in the Group’s history 
and no reported workplace accidents in the year. 
Clients
NCC Group values each and every client and is proud of the 
long-standing nature of its client relationships. Continuing 
client satisfaction is central to its ongoing success and is 
regularly measured and monitored through the ISO 9001 
certified quality programme. This includes written and 
telephone satisfaction surveys each month.
Rare instances of negative feedback are treated with the 
utmost seriousness and dealt with swiftly by management 
through to resolution. Each Operational Director takes 
direct responsibility for customer satisfaction, with the CEO 
investigating directly if a division’s performance fails to meet 
the 75 per cent threshold. No investigations were required in 
the year reported on.
The Group recognises and understands that its relationships 
with those with whom it deals are the key to its success 
and, as such, takes its obligations and commitments to 
those people and organisations very seriously. The Group’s 
independence, reputation as a supplier of quality services and 
the trust of its clients are all key assets that it aims to protect 
at all times. It aims to engender in its employees principles 
of honesty and integrity and the desire to work to the best of 
their ability. To ensure best service for the Group’s clients all 
employees are required both to comply with the Company’s 
Code of Ethics and to undergo annual anti-bribery and equality 
and diversity refresher training.
The community
NCC Group believes in supporting good causes and 
encourages its staff to get involved too, with considerable 
success to date.
The Group has donated £65,000 to good causes this year, 
with its main charity being Macmillan Cancer Support, and 
with a number of local and national charities also benefiting. 
Additionally, the Group provided security consulting services on  
a pro bono basis to Comic Relief and has supported a number 
of employee related smaller charity initiatives. A similar policy 
has been introduced in North America.
The Group believes in community and encourages its staff 
to do the same. Again this year the Group has continued to 
sponsor local junior football teams by buying their football kit 
and trophies to encourage children to take an interest in sport 
and keeping fit. The Group has also co-sponsored the cycle 
team Torelli, an elite female team from the North West.
Every year NCC Group staff members participate in and 
organise football tournaments, silent auctions, raffles, bake 
days, sport days and many more fundraising activities. 
NCC Group has signed up to become a platinum sponsor of 
Cyber Security Challenge UK as it looks to bring more talent 
into the industry. The Challenge features a series of national 
competitions, learning programmes and networking initiatives 
designed to identify, inspire and enable more people to work in 
the cyber security industry. NCC Group’s cyber security experts 
will be closely involved in a number of competitions and events 
in the coming year.
NCC Group has also committed to offering student bursaries 
as part of the government-backed CyberFirst initiative in a bid 
to encourage more youngsters to take up careers in cyber 
security. The CyberFirst programme, which was set up by 
NCC Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 May 2017

Corporate social  
responsibility
GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), aims to 
provide secondary school-aged students with the tools and 
knowledge to live and work securely online while highlighting 
the wide range of career options available to them.
The Group is apolitical and does not support any political party 
in any jurisdiction nor has it ever made a political donation.
Human rights
The Board has an overall responsibility for ensuring the Group 
upholds and promotes respect for human rights and supports, 
through the Group’s Human Rights Policy, the UN Declaration 
of Human Rights which underpins its policies and actions.
Suppliers
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers in accordance with the 
agreed terms and conditions. Although the Group does not 
follow any code or standard on payment policy, where terms 
have not been specifically agreed, invoices dated in one 
calendar month are paid close to the end of the following 
month. At 31 May 2017 , the Group had an average of 34.82 
days purchases outstanding in trade creditors (2016: 42 days).
Environment and sustainability 
As a service provider with no manufacturing facilities, the 
impact of the Group’s operations on the environment is limited 
compared with other industries, however it recognises its 
responsibility to respect and limit damage to the environment 
in every way it can. 
The Group has in the past sought third party advice for 
initiatives that could be implemented and followed as well 
as for staff education to ensure that they are thinking about 
the environment both in work and at home. During the year 
the Group made available the selection of hybrid or electric 
vehicles though its company car scheme.
Presently, due to the size of the Group, an external 
environmental audit is not practical but this will be reassessed 
if the Group grows to such a size where an external audit 
would have merit. 
The Group’s Environmental Policy aims to reduce the energy 
our business uses by:
 z Conserving energy and other natural resources and 
improving efficient use of those resources;
 z Improving the efficiency of materials used;
 z Reducing waste and increasing reuse and recycling 
wherever possible;
 z Reducing the need for travel and encouraging the use of 
alternative means of transport, for example, via the Cycle to 
Work scheme and car sharing; and
 z Providing all staff with relevant environmental training and 
guidance.
Initiatives that the Group has put in place to reflect the above:
 z Energy efficient lighting in refurbished areas of the office 
and lighting which switches off automatically;
 z Use of recycling in all offices – there are paper recycling 
bins throughout the offices and bottles, cans and plastics 
recycling bins in the kitchens;
 z On-demand boiling water and cold water taps to reduce 
wastage of water and power;
 z Cycle to Work scheme;
 z Recycling of printer cartridges in all offices;
 z Printer replacements featuring double-sided printing as 
standard;
 z Recycling of redundant IT equipment;
 z Addition of low emission car options into the company car 
scheme;
 z Video conferencing facilities available in main offices. This 
reduces the need for travelling so helping the environment 
and improving productivity;
 z Teleconferencing facilities available for all staff;
 z Printer review to enable more double-sided printing; and
 z Increase staff awareness of environmental issues.
NCC Group’s new HQ – XYZ Building, 
Manchester
The Group’s new Manchester headquarters at the XYZ 
Building has been successful in addressing broader aspects 
of sustainability and has achieved a strong BREEAM 201 1 NC 
“Excellent” certification. Key sustainability factors include: 
 z Primary energy consumption reduced by 28 per cent 
through the utilisation and careful specification of a 
combination of high-efficiency, low NOx CHP and 
commercial boiler units with high-efficiency chiller and 
distribution units.
 z Low energy lighting is installed throughout, which is 
particularly important for reducing energy consumption 
within an office building.
 z All materials specified for the building had a reduced 
life cycle impact in terms of their CO
2
 emissions and 
environmental degradation potential.
 z All major materials were responsibly sourced with 
supporting certification evidence.
 z Full FSC certification achieved for all timber products used, 
both in the constructed asset and site works.
 z Careful specification of water consuming components 
resulted in a 42.13 per cent improvement in water 
consumption compared to the BRE baseline, supported by 
installation of flow control devices and water leak detection 
which tie in with the goals of the UK Government’s “Future 
Water” Strategy for England.

Greenhouse gas emissions
This section includes our mandatory reporting of greenhouse 
gas emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2014  
(“The Regulations”). 
The greenhouse gas report period is aligned with our financial 
reporting year and so runs from 1 June to 31 May for each 
reported year. 
The method we have used to calculate GHG emissions is the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition), together with the latest emission factors from 
recognised public sources including, but not limited to, Defra, 
the International Energy Agency, the US Energy Information 
Administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency and 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Our emissions cover scope 1 and scope 2 and we have used 
revenue as the intensity ratio as it best reflects the size and 
scale of the business. Our aim is to reduce the overall carbon 
intensity for the Group by at least 10 per cent over the next 
three years.

Chairman’s  
letter
The Board is committed to creating 
and maintaining a culture where strong 
levels of governance thrive throughout 
the organisation, specifically ensuring 
that we send out consistent messages 
on the core values of the Company and 
acceptable behaviours from our people, 
our suppliers and our advisers. We have 
made good progress in moving towards 
best practice and we will regularly review 
the context, progress and maintenance 
of these standards, for the benefit of all 
of our stakeholders. 
2017 Review 
Governance Standards
During the latter part of the year, 
shareholder and employee feedback led 
the Board to carry out a comprehensive, 
independent review of all aspects of 
its governance. This review was led 
by the Senior Independent Director, 
who was supported by independent 
external advisers. The review included 
a comprehensive analysis of the 
Company’s governance systems and 
procedures. 
The review highlighted that there 
were weaknesses in the Company’s 
governance systems and procedures 
particularly in the application of many 
of the Company’s policies including, but 
not exclusively, expenses and social 
media, the process for the instigation 
and authorisation of legal claims, 
where conflicts of interest existed, the 
perceived independence of advisers 
and the perceived lack of an open and 
transparent leadership culture. 
It resulted in the creation of a 
Governance Committee, chaired by the 
Senior Independent Director, which 
has overseen a number of changes to 
the governance processes adopted 
throughout the business. Actions have 
included:
 z changes to the composition of the 
Board, including the recruitment of 
an independent Chairman and an 
additional Non-Executive Director 
and the decision to commence an 
external search for a new Chief 
Executive Officer;
 z a review of, and in some cases 
change to, external advisers and other 
suppliers;
 z the initiation of a review of a number 
of internal policies, including 
expenses, reporting of legal cases, 
use of social media and handling of 
conflicts of interest.
The actions noted above will be 
completed by December 2017 . The 
Committee also agreed a strengthening 
of the senior management team and, in 
consultation with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee, it was agreed that 
now was the appropriate time to move 
forward with the creation of an Internal 
Audit and Risk Management function.
The Governance Committee has 
completed its role and has now handed 
over the oversight of actions to the full 
Board.
Board Changes
The year ended May 2017 has been a 
significant year of change for the Board. 
Atul Patel, Chief Finance Officer, 
resigned in August 2016 and left 
the business in February 2017 . In 
January 2017 , Paul Mitchell, Chairman, 
announced his intention to resign from 
the Board as Chairman of the Company 
and to step down from the Board in 
May 2017 . Rob Cotton, Chief Executive 
Officer, left the business in March 
2017 . An external search to appoint his 
replacement has commenced.
There followed a number of new 
Executive and Non-Executive Director 
appointments. 
Brian Tenner was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer in February 2017 , 
bringing substantial listed company 
experience. He stepped up to interim 
Chief Executive Officer, when Rob 
Cotton left the business. Chris Stone 
became Chairman of the Board in April 
2017 , initially taking on the mantle of 
Executive Chairman, until a new Chief

Executive Officer is appointed. Chris 
brings substantial experience of listed 
and private equity owned technology 
businesses. Jonathan Brooks was 
appointed as Non-Executive Director in 
March 2017 . He has added substantial 
non-executive experience in a listed 
environment, as well as tech industry 
experience.
Strategic Review
Alongside these changes to the Board 
and in light of the deterioration in 
trading in the Assurance Division during 
the financial year, the Board initiated 
a comprehensive Strategic Review of 
NCC Group’s markets, capabilities, 
opportunities and operating model. This 
included a review of how the assets 
and resources of the Group can be 
more efficiently deployed and utilised. 
The review was led by the Board and 
supported by externally appointed 
consultants. The results of the Strategic 
Review and resulting actions plans are 
set out in more detail in the Strategic 
Report on pages 18 to 27 .
Statement of compliance 
with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The Company measures itself against 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (“Code”), which 
is available on the Financial Reporting 
Council website (www.frc.org.uk).
As noted in last year’s Directors’ report, 
from June 2016 to March 2017 , the 
Company complied with the Code  
except for:
 z Provision B.2.1. The Company did not 
comply with the requirement that the 
Nomination Committee had a majority 
of members who were independent 
Non-Executive Directors. During this 
time, the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director did, however, have 
a casting vote. 
From April 2017 until 31 May 2017 , 
the Company complied with all of the 
principles set out in the Code. The 
exceptions noted above were addressed 
with the appointment of Chris Stone 
as Chairman (although he will initially 
take on the role of Executive Chair 
until a new CEO is appointed) and 
the appointment of Debbie Hewitt, 
Senior Independent Director, to Chair 
the Nomination Committee, which will 
continue whilst Chris Stone continues as 
Executive Chair.

Board composition  
and division  
of responsibilities 
Role profiles are in place for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which clearly set out the duties of each role.
Role Responsibilities
The Chairman  
of the Board 
(Chris Stone)
Is responsible for the running of the Board and promoting a culture of openness and debate. 
This role is currently filled by the Executive Chair, who will become Non-Executive Chair on 
the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman, in conjunction with the Chief 
Executive and other Board members, plans the agendas, which are issued with the supporting 
Board papers in advance of the Board meetings. These supporting papers provide appropriate 
information to enable the Board to discharge its duties which include monitoring, assessing 
and challenging the executive management of the Group.
The Chief  
Executive Officer 
(Brian Tenner – Interim)
Together with the senior management team, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the 
Group and regularly provides performance reports to the Board. This role is currently filled by 
a combination of the Executive Chair and interim Chief Executive, with the former focusing on 
external relationships and the Strategic Review and the latter on the operational management 
of the business with the support of the Operations Board. The Company has initiated an 
external search to recruit a new Chief Executive Officer.
The Chief  
Financial Officer 
(Brian Tenner) 
Works closely with the CEO with specific responsibility for all financial matters including 
Group accounting policies, financial control, tax and treasury management, risk management 
and financial probity. The CFO is responsible for the Group’s Information Systems and 
Property portfolio. The CFO is also accountable for the transparency and appropriateness of 
management information and key performance indicators, internally and externally.
The Senior 
Independent Director 
(Debbie Hewitt)
The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chairman and serves 
as an intermediary for other Directors, employees and shareholders when necessary. The 
main responsibility is to be available to the shareholders should they have concerns that 
they have been unable to resolve through normal channels or when such channels would be 
inappropriate. 
The other Non-
Executive Directors 
(Thomas Chambers, Chris 
Batterham and Jonathan Brooks) 
Maintain an ongoing dialogue with the Executive Directors which includes constructive 
challenge of performance and the Group’s strategy. 
Company Secretary 
(Helen Nisbet)
The role of the Company Secretary is to ensure good information flows within the Board and 
its Committees and between senior management and Non-Executive Directors. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for facilitating the induction of new Directors and assisting with their 
professional development as required. All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary to enable them to discharge their duties as Directors. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and for advising 
the Board through the Chairman on governance matters. The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.

Meetings and attendance
The Board considers that each Director is able to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. The Non-Executive Directors are 
contracted to spend a minimum of 24 days per annum on NCC 
Group affairs and on average spent 40 days on Company 
business during the year. Over and above this, a number of 
additional days were committed by the Senior Independent 
Director during the year and specifically from the period from 
October 2016 to May 2017 , when she led the Company’s 
consultation with key shareholders, chaired the newly created 
Governance Committee, which comprehensively reviewed 
the standards of Corporate Governance across all aspects of 
the business, chaired the Nominations Committee, as well as 
overseeing the initiation of the Strategic Review. During this 
period, she also led the recruitment of the new Chairman and 
an additional Non-Executive Director.

Experience of the Board
The members of the Board bring a wide range of skills and

to appropriately challenge and lead the Group’s strategy. As 
noted previously, the Board consciously chose a new Non-
Executive Director with specific digital market experience in 
order to meet an identified gap. The chart below summarises 
their key areas of significant experience.

Independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary and Directors are entitled to take 
independent professional advice if necessary, at the expense 
of the Company.
Conflicts of Interest 
The Companies Act 2006 requires Directors to avoid 
situations where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts or potentially conflicts with the interests 
of the Company. The Company’s Articles of Association require 
any Director with a conflict or potential conflict to declare this 
to the Board. That Director will not then be involved in the 
discussions relating to the proposal, transaction, contract or 
arrangement in which they have an interest, unless agreed 
otherwise by the Directors of the Company in the limited 
circumstance specified in the Articles of Association, nor will 
they be counted in the quorum or be permitted to vote on any 
issue in which they have an interest. 
During the year, the Audit Committee approved corporate 
finance fees payable to Rickitt Mitchell & Partners Ltd of £0.3m 
(2016: £0.8m) in relation to disposal of the OpenRegistry Group 
of companies and other M&A activity.  Paul Mitchell, who was 
Chairman of NCC Group plc until April 2017 and who is the 
Non-Executive Chairman of Rickitt Mitchell, was excluded from 
all discussions on the approvals of fees.
Directors’ and Officers’ liability (D&O) 
insurance
The Company maintains D&O insurance to cover the cost 
of defending civil proceedings brought against them in their 
capacity as a Director or Officer of the Company (including 
those who served as Directors or Officers during 2016). 
Board independence 
As required by the Code, at least 50% of the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, are independent Non-Executive Directors; the 
Board comprises two Executive Directors, four independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman 
(currently an Executive Chairman and one of the Executive 
Directors referred to above).
Paul Mitchell, the Chairman from June 2016 to April 2016, 
did not comply with the assessment of independence as he 
had served as Chairman for 17 years and did not meet the 
requirements for the Chairman to be independent. The Board 
considered this and put safeguards in place where this could 
impact his role. For areas where independence was deemed 
to be key to any decision making, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director was able to assume that position of 
responsibility where necessary and had the casting vote in the 
event of a split decision.

Board composition  
and division  
of responsibilities 
Chris Stone was recruited as independent Non-Executive 
Chairman in April 2017 , and has temporarily taken up the role 
of Executive Chairman, whilst the Company recruits a new 
Chief Executive. The Board is satisfied that on appointment 
Chris Stone was independent as he met the criteria specified 
below. 
The Board has debated and considers that all of the other 
current Non-Executive Directors are independent, and in so 
doing considered the profile of all of the individuals, concluding 
that none of them:
 z has ever been an employee of the Group;
 z has ever had a material business relationship with the 
Group or receives any remuneration other than their salary 
or fees;
 z has close family ties with advisers, other Directors or 
senior management of the Group that could reasonably be 
expected to cause a conflict;
 z holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other 
Directors through involvement with other companies or 
bodies;
 z represents a significant shareholder; or
 z has at the point of this report, served on the NCC Group 
Board for more than nine years from the date of their first 
election.
The Board notes that Debbie Hewitt, Senior Independent 
Director will have completed nine years on the Board in 
September 2017 . The Board considers Debbie to remain fully 
independent in her character, judgement and approach. It is 
the Board’s intention that she will remain in role to provide 
continuity whilst any changes that come from the strategy 
review are implemented, which is currently anticipated as some 
time during 2018. In the meantime, the Company will continue 
to search for an additional Non-Executive Director to provide 
for her succession. 
The Non-Executive Directors provide a strong independent 
element on the Board and are well placed to constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and 
succession planning. Between them they bring an extensive 
and broad range experience to the Group.
Details of the Directors’ respective experience is set out in 
their biographical profiles on pages 62 to 63. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours. 
Diversity
The principle of Board diversity is strongly supported by the 
Board. It is the Board’s policy that appointments to the Board 
will always be based on merit so that the Board has the right 
balance of individuals in place. The Board recognises that 
diversity of thought, approach and experience is an important 
consideration and is therefore one of the selection criteria 
used to assess candidates prior to any Board appointments.
The Company’s policy is to find, develop and maintain a diverse 
workforce at all levels and it is committed to developing a 
culture where women can achieve and retain senior positions.
The table below sets out the current position of the Company 
on a gender basis: 
Given the relatively small size of the Board, it would not seem 
appropriate to impose specific formulaic gender or diversity 
targets but it is the Company’s intention to increase the gender 
and ethnic diversity of the Board and senior management team 
as opportunities arise.
Annual re-election
In accordance with the Code, the Directors appointed in the 
financial year ended 31 May 2017 are subject to election by 
shareholders at the AGM in September 2017 and, in line with 
best practice, all others are subject to re-election annually.
Director induction, training and

appointment, which included visits to the Group’s operations 
and meetings with operational and executive management. 
Each Director’s induction is tailored to their experience and 
background with the aim of enhancing their understanding 
of the Group’s business, the operating divisions, employees, 
customers, suppliers and advisers and the role of the Board in 
setting the tone of our culture and governance standards.
The Company acknowledges the importance of developing 
the skills of the Directors to run an effective Board. To 
assist in this, Directors are given the opportunity to attend 
relevant courses and seminars to acquire additional skills 
and experience to enhance their contribution to the ongoing 
progress of the Group. All of the Directors attend sessions 
which are aimed at updating the Board on trends and 
developments in corporate governance.
Board and Committee effectiveness review
The performance of the Board and its committees are 
appraised annually and in 2017 , it was scheduled for an 
independent review of the Board to be completed. However, 
due to the number of Director changes in the year, it was 
agreed that an independent committee evaluation would be 
deferred until the Board has had time to form and establish 
performance and behavioural norms. An internal effectiveness 
review was completed instead for the year ending 2017 .
The evaluation identified changes which would improve the 
working of the Board, including: 
 z Board succession and the need to manage NED 
succession over the coming year, including the 
enhancement of the Board with two additional Non-
Executives:
 — one with Audit Committee experience;
 — one with Remuneration Committee experience; and
 — ideally one of these also to have specific ‘digital’ industry 
experience.
 z The appointment of Jonathan Brooks in March 2017 met 
the objectives in respect of Audit Committee experience 
and digital industry experience.
 z Strengthening of the Senior Management team, to reflect 
the outputs of the Governance Committee. The specific 
actions, including the appointment of an HR Director to the 
Operations Board, will be developed and implemented on 
the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer. 
 z Enhancement to the Board Management Information 
pack, to more closely align with the strategy, customer and 
operational metrics of the business.
 — This new structure will be developed in line with the 
new Target Operating Model set out on pages 19 to 23 
of the Strategic Report. It will include aligned KPIs that 
map to our short and medium-term strategic goals and 
objectives.
During the year, each of the Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Cyber Security 
Committee carried out an internal self-evaluation on their 
effectiveness. A number of recommendations were made, 
including the creation of an internal Audit function by the 
Audit Committee, the initiation of a process to provide for 
the Remuneration Committee Chair succession by the 
Remuneration Committee. The Nomination Committee 
recommended that the Board should undertake a broader 
review of management talent and succession planning across 
the business in 2017/18 and the Cyber Security Committee 
concluded that the committee should be renamed the Risk 
Committee and that its terms of reference should embrace all 
aspects of risk, not just cyber risk, as operational elements of 
risk are inextricably linked to cyber. As such, this Committee 
will be renamed the Risk Committee going forward.
Individual Director appraisals process
During the year, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director evaluated the performance of the Chairman and 
the Chairman evaluated the performance of each Director. 
In addition, the Non-Executive Directors met independently 
from the Executive Directors to discuss with the Chairman the 
overall functioning of the Board and his contribution in making 
it effective. 
Going forward, appraisals have been or will be carried out by 
the following individuals:
Director being appraised Appraiser
Chairman Reviewed by the Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, and feedback facilitated by the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
Chief Executive Officer Reviewed by all of the Non-Executive Directors and CFO and feedback facilitated by the Chairman.

Non-Executive Directors Reviewed by the Executive Directors and by their Non-Executive Director peers and feedback

Board composition

Operation of Governance Framework
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for reviewing, challenging and 
approving the strategic direction of the Group, whilst providing 
strong values based leadership of the Company, within a 
framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk 
to be assessed and appropriately managed. The Board reviews 
the Group’s business model and strategic objectives to ensure 
that the necessary financial and human resources are in place 
to achieve these objectives, to sustain them over the long-term 
and to review management performance in their delivery. 
The Board sets the tone of the Company’s values and ethical 
standards and manages the business in a manner to meet its 
obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders. 
It receives information on at least a monthly basis to enable it 
to review trading performance, forecasts and strategy and it 
has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision. 
The most significant of these are:
 z approval of strategic plans, annual operating plans and any 
material changes to them;
 z oversight of the Group’s operations ensuring competent and 
prudent management, sound planning, an adequate system 
of internal control and governance;
 z through the Audit Committee, oversight of financial 
reporting systems and information and adherence to 
appropriate accounting policies;
 z changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and Operating Board, oversight of the Company culture and 
ethical standards of the leadership and the independence 
of Non-Executive Directors, taking into consideration 
prudent succession planning;
 z approval of the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and 
major investments and capital projects;
 z approval of the dividend, treasury and banking policies, 
including the Group’s capital structure;
 z through the Remuneration Committee, the delivery of an 
effective Executive Remuneration Policy;
 z receiving reports on the views of the Company’s 
shareholders and approval of all documents put to 
shareholders at a general meeting or circulated to 
shareholders; and appointment of key advisers.
The Board has reviewed this schedule during the year and 
added specific matters where they feel it is critical to the 
ongoing success of the business.
As noted above, the operational management of the Group 
is delegated to the Operations Board of NCC Group. The 
Board also delegates other matters to Board committees and 
management as appropriate.
Risk Management
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the business 
risks are effectively managed. The Board has delegated 
regular review of the risk management procedures to the Audit 
Committee and collectively reviews the overall risk environment 
on an annual basis. The day-to-day management of business 
risks is the responsibility of the senior management team 
through the Operations Board. For a more detailed review of 
risk management processes, the principal risks faced by the 
Group and their mitigation, as well as a risk ‘heat map’ see 
pages 48 to 53.
Internal control
The Group has a system of internal controls which aim to 
support the delivery of the Group’s strategy by managing the 
risk of failing to achieve business objectives and to protect the 
stewardship of the Group’s assets. As such the Group can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance.
In addition, the Group insures against various risks, but certain 
risks remain difficult to insure, due to the breadth and cost 
of cover. In some cases, external insurance is not available at 
all, or not at an economical price. The Group regularly reviews 
both the type and amount of external insurance that it buys 
and in 2017 retendered the Group’s insurance policies. 
Executive Remuneration 
During the year, we continued to operate within the 
Remuneration Policy that was put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2014 AGM. This policy was adopted for three 
years. As this period is coming to an end, the Committee has 
now reviewed the policy to assess its appropriateness and 
alignment to the business strategy and has consulted with 
shareholders and shareholder advisory groups on its proposed 
changes. These proposed changes are summarised in the 
Remuneration Committee report on pages 88 to 91.

relations
Share capital structure
The Company’s issued share capital at 1 June 2017 consisted 
of 276,5 10,137 ordinary shares of one pence each. There are 
no special control rights or restrictions on share transfer or 
special rights pertaining to any of the shares in issue and the 
Company does not have preference shares. During the year 
452,589 new shares were issued under the Company’s all 
employee Save As You Earn scheme.
As far as is reasonably known to management, the Company 
is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another 
Company or by any government.
Board engagement with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. 
There is a regular dialogue with institutional investors including 
presentations after the Company’s year-end and half year 
results announcements. A programme of meetings take place 
throughout the year with major institutional shareholders and 
private shareholders have the opportunity to meet the Board 
face-to-face and ask questions at the Annual General Meeting. 
During the financial year the Directors held the following 
meetings with shareholders:
In addition to the Board’s regular engagement with 
shareholders in 2017 , the Senior Independent Director 
consulted with major shareholders on the Board structure, 
the performance of key executives and the decision to 
implement a full strategic review. The Senior Independent 
Director held 18 one-on-one meetings and 26 phone calls with 
investors on such matters during the year. The Remuneration 
Committee consulted with 15 institutional shareholders and 
three shareholder advisory groups during April and May 2017 
to discuss the future Remuneration Policy and subsequently 
advised shareholders in writing of the proposed changes.
Board shareholder updates
Feedback from major institutional shareholders is provided to 
the Board on a regular basis and, where appropriate, the Board 
takes steps to address their concerns and recommendations.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is an opportunity for 
shareholders to vote on certain aspects of Group business 
and provides a useful forum for one-to-one communication 
with private shareholders. At the AGM shareholders receive 
presentations on the Company’s performance and may ask 
questions of the Board. The Chairman seeks to ensure that 
the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are available at the meeting to answer questions 
and for all Directors to attend.

the 2016 AGM, the proportions of possible votes that were 
cast and the proportions in favour and against each resolution

Composition
The Audit Committee is chaired by me, a Chartered 
Accountant of 30 years’ standing. I have previously served 
as the Chief Financial Officer of two companies operating 
in the telecommunications sector including Symbian Limited 
(developer of operating systems for Smartphones). I also have 
experience as a Director of publicly listed entities. My earlier 
career included roles with Kleinwort Benson corporate finance 
and accountants Price Waterhouse. The Board considers that 
I have the recent and relevant experience required by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014.
The other members of the Committee who served throughout 
the year are the senior independent Non-Executive Director, 
Debbie Hewitt, who has a wide range of relevant business 
experience in a number of publicly listed entities and Chris 
Batterham, a Chartered Accountant who has served as a Chief 
Financial Officer in a number of companies, including some 
in the digital world. In addition, Jonathan Brooks, who joined 
the Board in March 2107 , was appointed to the Committee 
at the end of June 2017 . All members of the Committee are 
considered to be independent.
Summary biographies of each member of the Committee are 
included on pages 62 to 63.
Meeting Frequency and Attendance 
The Terms of Reference for the Committee require at 
least three meetings per year. During this financial year 
the Committee met 3 times. As well as the members of 
the Committee, the meetings are usually attended by the 
Chairman, the other Non-Executive Directors, the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer. The external auditors 
also attend each meeting. During the year the Committee met, 
on a number of occasions, with the external auditors without 
the Executive Directors being present.
The attendance of individual Committee members at Audit 
Committee meetings is shown in the table below:

Significant issues considered during the 
year in relation to the Financial Statements
During the year, the Committee reviewed and considered 
the following areas in respect of financial reporting and the 
preparation of the interim and annual financial statements:
 z the appropriateness of the accounting policies used;
 z significant areas of management judgement or estimation;
 z compliance with external and internal financial reporting 
standards and policies; 
 z disclosure and presentation of GAAP and non-GAAP 
information;
 z the requirement for a formal internal audit function; and 
 z whether the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary to assess the Group’s financial 
position, performance, business model and strategy.
In carrying out this review the Committee considered the 
advice of the Group’s finance team and the external auditors’ 
reports setting out their views on the accounting treatments 
and judgements included in the financial statements.
Significant accounting areas and areas of 
significant management judgement
The table below summarises some of the significant 
accounting issues and judgements that the Committee 
considered during the year in relation to the Financial 
Statements. These are identified as recurring items that the 
Committee regularly reviews and items of current year focus. 
The table also sets out the financial context and potential 
impact of each item as well as the impacted KPIs. Finally, the 
table shows the degree of judgement that the Committee 
feels has to be applied for each item. Items with a significant 
impact but with a “low” judgement level will typically have 
extensive independent third party evidence of the bases for 
any judgement. Areas assessed as requiring a “high” level of 
judgement tend to rely more heavily on management estimates  
and historical trends than extensive independent third party 
evidence.

Goodwill carrying value
(recurring item: see note 1 1 to the financial statements)
The Group has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, 
including two in 2016-17 and one more of significant scale 
in each of the previous two years. At the start of the current 
financial year, the Group had Goodwill of £224.3m.
In accordance with IAS 36, management has determined 
appropriate cash generating units (CGUs) on which to base 
the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets by comparing the recoverable amount to the 
carrying value. Impairment reviews are based on discounted 
future cash flow models that can contain a significant degree 
of management judgement in terms of the basis of the CGUs, 
the associated forecast cash flows, the appropriate growth 
rates to apply to revenues and margins, and the discount rates 
to be used.
The Committee has reviewed the rationale used to determine 
the cash generating units and assumptions used in future cash 
flows that underpin the valuation of goodwill. The CGUs used 
in the review of Goodwill changed during the year. This reflects 
the outcome of the Strategic Review that led to an updated 
management view of the lowest appropriate level of asset 
groupings that generate separately identifiable cash inflows. 
This is set out in more detail in note 1 1 to the Accounts.
The Committee is satisfied that the revised CGU 
categorisation is an accurate reflection of both the 
independently generated cash inflows and the way that 
the businesses are now managed and reported within the 
Group. The Committee is also satisfied that the cash flows 
and discount rates used in the valuations are neither overly 
optimistic nor overly conservative and represent management’s 
best estimate of the recoverable value of the goodwill in the 
relevant CGUs.
The conclusion of this year’s review was to impair the goodwill 
relating to the Accumuli acquisition by £24.3m (of the 
acquisition total of £5 1.6m) and in respect of the acquisition 
of Fox-IT by £24.3m (of the acquisition total of £70.9m). 
Historical goodwill of £7 .9m in respect of the acquisition of our 
Web Performance business was also impaired by £5.7m. More 
details on the background to the performance and prospects 
of the Fox-IT and Accumuli acquisitions can be found in the 
Strategic Report on page 44 and in note 1 1 to the financial 
statements.
Intangible assets carrying value 
(Including acquired intangibles, software and capitalised 
development costs) (recurring item: see Note 1 1 to the 
financial statements). 
The total value of acquired intangible assets at the start of the 
year was £49.7m. The movements in this balance during the 
year are set out in note 1 1 to the financial statements. While 
certain amounts were written off the carrying value of goodwill

NCC AR2017 proof 8- Back.indd   76 09/08/2017   16:01:26 25546.04    9 August 2017 4:01 PM    Proof Six
in the Web Performance, Accumuli and Fox-IT businesses, no 
impairments were needed in respect of the acquired intangible 
assets in these businesses or in any other CGU.
The Group continues to incur external and internal costs on 
the Group’s own information systems including a Group-wide 
finance system. These are referred to as ‘Software intangibles’. 
T otal costs of £3.7m have been capitalised in the year offset by 
amortisation charges of £1.7m and a reclassification of £6.6m to 
produce a net book carrying value, including software licences, 
at the end of the financial year of £9.0m (2016: £1 7 .7m).
The Group is also undertaking a number of development 
projects aimed at producing new products and services. These 
activities are collectively referred to as ‘Development’ costs 
and where IFRS recognition criteria are met, costs incurred 
are capitalised. T otal costs of £3.7m have been capitalised in 
the year plus a reclassification of £6.6m offset by amortisation 
charges of £1.7m and impairment charges of £7 .8m (see below 
for more detail) to give a closing net book value of £10.2m.
A key part of the investment in the current year has been 
the continued development of the Fox-IT and NCC Group 
technologies to expand the High Assurance range of products 
and to operate the Threat Intelligence and Managed Services 
Platforms. These products and platforms are in use in the 
business today and generate returns that support their carrying 
values.
The Web Performance business has a number of capitalised 
development projects driven by income generating services 
sold in the market. In two of these, revenue growth has been 
slower than anticipated and therefore impairments have been 
recognised totalling £3.2m. In one case, due to the expected 
time to reach a break-even cash flow, the entire asset has 
been impaired and in future no further costs in relation to the 
project will be capitalised. Instead they will be charged in full 
to the P&L. The estimated impact on EBIT in the new financial 
year will be an additional operating charge of £0.6m.
In the prior year, £6.9m of capitalised developments costs, 
infrastructure and know-how were written off in respect of 
the discontinued Domain Services division. At the time of 
the disposal of the Open Registry businesses in January 
2017 and the associated exit from Domain Services, certain 
specific assets were retained within the Group. The total value 
of retained assets as at 31 May 2016 was £4.2m of which 
£2.3m related directly to the ownership of the TLD .trust 
with the balance relating to a software tool (‘CMS’) that was 
originally intended for use in Domain Services. Following the 
cessation of Domain Services, the carrying value of TLD .trust 
is in question. Given uncertainty as to any recoverable value, 
the decision has therefore been take to write the asset value 
down to zero. At the same time, it is not felt that CMS tool will 
be used in the business in future and has similarly been written 
off in full.
Accounting for business combinations
(recurring item: see note 16 to the financial statements)
The Group is required to identify the fair value of all assets 
and liabilities at the time of acquisition including assets and 
liabilities that were not necessarily included on the acquired 
business’s balance sheet. The process of assessing fair value 
involves estimates and judgements based on expected future 
cash flows. These estimates are therefore inherently uncertain 
to a greater or lesser extent.
In the current year the Group acquired PSC in September 
2016 and VSR in November 2016. Management completed 
the exercises to determine the fair value of intangible assets 
and other net assets acquired in both of these acquisitions in 
accordance with IFRS 3. 
The Committee has reviewed a summary of the key 
assumptions adopted and compared these to other recent 
acquisitions. We have also discussed with our external 
auditors, KPMG, the accounting for acquisitions and the 
related disclosures to ensure that they are complete, accurate, 
understandable and compliant with IFRS 3. The Committee 
is satisfied that the values and disclosures around the 
acquisitions are appropriate.
Revenue recognition and accrued income
(current year focus item: see note 1 to the financial 
statements)
During the year, reflecting the upcoming change in revenue 
recognition rules in 2019 (FRS 15) the reliance on manual 
processes and controls within the business, and the inherent 
risks around revenue recognition more generally, the 
Committee decided to review the basis and methodologies 
used to recognise revenue in the Group. 
The Committee commissioned a detailed data analytics 
exercise by an independent firm of chartered accountants to 
review the underlying transactions for revenue recognition 
and the movements in and out of accrued and deferred 
income. Revenue transactions were also traced through to 
cash receipts. The broad conclusion of this exercise was that 
despite the over-reliance on manual systems and processes, 
no material systematic issues or errors were identified with the 
substance of reported revenue in the major business units in 
the current and previous years.
However, it was noted that on occasional instances in the 
Escrow Division, where invoices had already been issued 
and paid by the customer, that revenues had been incorrectly 
recognised in advance of the provision of the service. The 
impact of these instances on the financial statements was not 
considered material and more robust procedures have since 
been established.

Audit  
committee report
Individually significant items
(current year focus item: see note 3 to the financial 
statements)
Exceptional items by their nature and scale could have a 
significant impact on the reporting of ‘adjusted’ items such 
as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EPS. It is 
critical that these are properly categorised in order to allow a 
user of the financial statements to form an accurate picture of 
the underlying performance of the business. The Committee 
challenged management to provide the rationale for the 
treatment of certain costs as exceptional. The Committee 
has also challenged management on the use of ‘Adjusted’ 
or non-GAAP reporting metrics. All ‘Adjusted’ metrics are 
fully disclosed and reconciled to GAAP measurements in the 
Financial Statements.
Following this review and challenge to management, 
the Committee concluded that the items that have been 
designated as exceptional and hence excluded from ‘Adjusted’ 
measures of performance, were sufficiently material and 
unrelated to the underlying business to be properly classified 
in this way. 
Recoverability of working capital 
(current year focus item: see note 21 to the financial 
statements)
During the year, the Committee decided to perform some 
additional reviews of the Group’s working capital balances. 
In part, this reflected external stakeholder concerns over 
a perceived deterioration in cash flows relating to working 
capital, including accrued and deferred income. The 
Committee’s review therefore considered two different 
questions: firstly, were the working capital balances expected 
to be fully recoverable and, secondly, was the management  
of working capital as effective as it might be for a Group  
of this size.
On the first question, the Committee concluded that the 
Group’s working capital balances were fully recoverable at 
their stated amounts. On the second, measures were identified 
to improve the effective management of working capital and 
these are discussed further in the Strategic Report.
Taxation
(current year focus item: see note 8 to the financial 
statements)
As part of the publication of the Interim Results in January 
2017 , a significant rise was projected for the Group’s full year 
Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, from the prior year rate of 22% to 
a new level of 31%. The actual Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for 
the year ended 31 May 2017 was 29.3% (2016: 22%).
The projected and actual rates differ in part due to reported 
performance in different tax jurisdictions varying against 
expectations at the time of the Interim Results.
However, in addition, it has been identified that the scale 
and complexity of the Group requires an improvement in the 
management and control of the Group’s tax affairs.
Executive management have now appointed a Group Tax and 
Treasury Manager to look after the Group’s international tax 
affairs. The role will continue to be supported by the incumbent 
tax advisory firms, to target two objectives:
 z firstly, to ensure that the Group’s more complex and growing 
international footprint is fully compliant with all local 
legislation and transfer pricing regulations; and
 z secondly, that the Group’s tax affairs are managed in as 
effective a way as possible while adhering to a low risk 
appetite for tax planning activities.
Holiday pay provision
(current year focus item: see note 3 to the financial 
statements)
During the year, the Committee was made aware that there 
was an inconsistency in the application of the requirements 
of IAS 19R Employee Benefits across the Group. A number 
of major business units were not making provision for earned 
but not taken holiday entitlement for employees at the balance 
sheet date. This inconsistency had been previously highlighted 
by the auditors, though at that time the additional provisions 
required were considered not to be material to the Group and 
so were not adjusted for. 
After due consideration, the Committee recommended the 
consistent application of IAS 19R across the Group henceforth. 
This had the effect of creating an opening IAS 19R provision of 
£1.8m. This has been disclosed as an exceptional item since 
it does not relate to the underlying business performance in 
the current year. When added to the £0.7m normal operating 
charge in the current year and the amount already accrued, the 
total closing balance sheet provision as at 31 May 2017  
is £3.3m.

Internal Audit
Historically, whilst the Group did not consider it necessary to 
have its own internal audit function, this position was being 
reviewed annually. In consultation with executive management, 
it has been decided that the scale and complexity of the 
Group’s operations means that now is an appropriate time to 
create an internal audit function. The Group has appointed 
a Director of Risk and Assurance, who joins us in the new 
financial year and will be responsible for internal audit, the 
assurance of other quality systems and processes, and 
further embedding risk management processes throughout 
our operations. In the short term, the role will also focus on 
advising management in the design of appropriate internal 
controls that support the implementation of our new business 
processes and systems.
During the financial year, the main item of internal audit type 
work undertaken was in respect of revenue recognition as 
discussed earlier in this report.
Internal controls and Risk Management
The Board is responsible for establishing, maintaining and 
monitoring the Group’s system of internal control and reviewing 
its effectiveness. Internal control systems are designed to meet 
the particular needs of the Group and the risks to which it is 
exposed. By their nature, however, internal control systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. Key elements of the internal control system are described 
below. These have all been in place throughout the year and 
up to the date of this report and are reviewed regularly by the 
Committee and Board:
 z defined management structure and delegation of authority 
to Committees of the Board, subsidiary boards and 
associated business units;
 z recruitment standards and career development and training 
to ensure the integrity and competence of staff;
 z anti-bribery, security and compliance training;
 z information provided to management covering financial 
performance and key performance indicators, including 
non-financial measures;
 z a detailed budgeting process where business units prepare 
plans for the coming year;
 z procedures for the approval of capital expenditure and 
investments and acquisitions;
 z monthly operational reviews to monitor and re-forecast 
results as required against the annual operating plan, with 
major variances followed up and management action taken 
where appropriate;
 z clearly documented internal procedures set out in the 
Group’s ISO 9001:2008 accredited quality manual;
 z regular internal audits of key processes and procedures 
under the Group’s ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 accredited 
quality assurance process;
 z monitoring of any whistle-blowing or fraud reports.
The external auditors provide independent advice on those 
areas of internal control which they assess during the course 
of their work for the Group and whose findings are regularly 
reported to the Board and the Audit Committee.
The Group’s non cyber security risks are monitored by the 
Board which sets aside time for an in-depth discussion 
of notable or changing risks to the business. A detailed 
description of the Group’s Risk Management processes and 
controls is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 48 to 53.
Whistle-blowing and confidential reporting 
procedures
The Group operates a confidential reporting and whistle-
blowing procedure (known as our ‘Open Door Policy’). The 
policy aims to support the stewardship of the Group’s assets 
and the integrity of the financial statements as well as 
protecting staff welfare. The procedure is reviewed annually by 
the Committee to ensure that it remains fit for purpose. 
During the current year review, the Committee has decided 
to enhance the procedure by appointing an independent third 
party reporting agent to be the first point of contact for those 
who do not wish to use normal internal line management 
channels for reporting their concerns. This will be advertised 
internally via staff notice boards and our intranet.
The Committee reviews any whistle-blowing or confidential 
reporting of concerns raised during the year with respect 
to their nature, scale and any associated or consequential 
risks. During the year, the Committee reviewed the results 
of an independent review of whistle-blowing matters carried 
out under the direction of the Senior Independent Director. 
The Committee discussed the outcome of that review and 
was satisfied that the Company’s response in each case was 
appropriate. The Committee was also satisfied that there 
were no implications for the integrity of the Group’s Financial 
Statements and that no other changes were needed to the 
policy and procedure besides the adoption of a third party 
reporting mechanism.

Audit  
committee report
Review of the Audit Committee’s 
effectiveness
The Committee has reviewed and considered the effectiveness 
of its performance during the year. The review included the 
views of members of the Committee and of regular attendees 
at the various meetings (including the Executive Directors). I 
am satisfied that the degree of rigour and challenge applied 
in performing the Committee’s responsibilities is appropriate, 
effective and continues to improve. 
 
External auditors effectiveness and 
appointment 
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations 
regarding the reappointment of the external auditors 
following a formal review of the auditors’ performance 
following the June Audit Committee meeting. In making these 
recommendations the Committee considers:
 z the experience, industry knowledge and expertise of the 
auditors;
 z the scope and planning of the audit and any variations from 
the plan;
 z the quality of the processes adopted;
 z the fees charged;
 z their attitude to and handling of key audit judgments;
 z their ability to challenge and communicate effectively with 
management; and
 z the quality of the final report.
During the financial year, I attended regular meetings with 
KPMG’s engagement partner without management being 
present. This provided the opportunity for open dialogue. The 
engagement partner demonstrated their understanding of 
the Group’s business risks and the consequential impact on 
the financial statements. Feedback on the conduct of the 
audit from the engagement partner’s perspective is used to 
determine if any challenges in the prior year audit would be 
sufficiently addressed in the next audit cycle.
The Group’s current auditors, KPMG LLP, have been in place 
since 1 November 2013 with a competitive audit tender 
process having last been undertaken in November 201 1. The 
UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) Statutory 
Audit Services Order (Order) states, amongst other matters, 
that FTSE 350 listed companies should put their external audit 
contract out to public tender at least every ten years.
In the prior year it was proposed that the external audit 
contract again be subject to a formal tender exercise during 
2017 with a view to appointing the successful audit firm 
with effect from 1 June 2018. Given the number of recent 
changes in the membership of the Board and ongoing 
changes in the structure of the Group as the new Strategic 
Plan is implemented, it has been decided that a change in 
external auditors may not be of benefit to the Group at this 
time. The Group will therefore review this position during the 
new financial year. The Group does fully intend to remain in 
compliance with the requirement to carry out a formal tender 
every ten years and the position and timing of such a tender 
will remain under review.
Therefore, having fully considered the performance, 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the 
reports they have produced in the current financial year, the 
Committee has concluded that it is appropriate to recommend 
to the Board the reappointment of KPMG LLP as the Group’s 
external auditors for the next financial year.
Auditors’ independence and objectivity
The Committee received a formal statement of independence 
from the external auditors.
The Company also operates a rigorous policy designed to 
ensure that the auditors’ independence is not compromised 
by their undertaking inappropriate non-audit work. The Audit 
Committee’s approval is therefore required for any fees for 
non-audit work paid to the auditors in excess of £10,000 
(ten thousand pounds) in any financial year. However, the 
Company recognises that it can receive particular benefit from 
certain non-audit services provided by the external auditors 
due to their technical skills and detailed understanding of the 
Company’s business. A copy of the full policy on the payment 
of fees to the external auditors for non-audit services can be 
found on the company website at www.nccgroup.trust  
During this financial year £17 ,500 (2016: £10,000) non-audit 
fees were paid to the external auditors for the half year review.
All significant pieces of non-audit work are put to informal 
tender to suitable parties that, if appropriate, can include 
the external auditors. Upon review as to suitability and 
price, the work will then be placed with the service provider 
recommended. If this is the external auditors then Audit 
Committee approval is required in accordance with the policy 
noted above.

Related Party Transactions and other fees 
approved by the Committee
The former Non-Executive Chairman, Paul Mitchell, was also 
the Non-Executive Chairman of Rickitt Mitchell. During the 
year the Audit Committee approved corporate finance fees 
payable to Rickitt Mitchell & Partners Ltd of £0.3m (2016: 
£0.8m) in relation to the completed acquisitions PSC and VSR 
and the disposal of the Open Registry businesses. The fees in 
the prior year related to the acquisition of Fox-IT and the equity 
fundraising that accompanied it. 
The Non-Executive Chairman was excluded from all 
discussions on the approval of fees payable to Rickitt Mitchell 
& Partners Ltd.
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered 
whether the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, when taken 
as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable (‘FBU’) and 
whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders 
to assess NCC Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. 
The independent reviewers noted above were not major 
contributors to the Annual Report and Accounts but at the 
same time, as members of the Operations Board, are deemed 
to be sufficiently well informed on the Group’s activities to be 
able to give appropriate feedback on the FBU criteria. 
Taking all of the inputs and subsequent amendments 
into account, the Committee was satisfied that taken as 
a whole the Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable.

Nomination  
committee report
Paul Mitchell was Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
until January 2017 when he announced his intention to resign 
as Chairman of the Board. He remained a member of the 
Committee until he left the Board on 31 May 2017 . 
Debbie Hewitt, Senior Independent Director, became Chairman 
of the Nominations Committee in January 2017 . Other 
members of the Committee are the three independent Non-
Executive Directors, Thomas Chambers, Chris Batterham and 
Jonathan Brooks, the latter of whom joined the Committee 
when he joined the Board in March 2017 . 
The Nomination Committee’s objectives and 
responsibilities. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
size, structure, balance, composition and progressive refreshing 
of the Board and its committees and as such its duties include: 
 z reviewing the structure of the Board;
 z evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity on the Board;
 z making recommendations for further recruitment to the 
Board or proposing changes to the existing structure of the 
Board, or individual Directors;
 z reviewing the leadership needs of the Company, both 
Executive and Non-Executive; 
 z succession planning for Directors and other senior 
Executives within the business;
 z recruiting, appointing and exiting of Directors;
 z overseeing membership of, and succession to, the various 
Board committees and;
 z reviewing the time commitment required from the Non-
Executive Directors on NCC business.
The Chairman of the Board leads the process for the 
appointment of new Non-Executive Directors to the Board and 
for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief 
Executive, in conjunction with the Chairman, leads the process 
for the Chief Finance Officer. The Senior Independent Director 
leads the process for a new Chairman of the Board.
In relation to an appointment to the Board, the Committee 
draws up a specification and assesses the capabilities and 
experience required for such a role, including an assessment 
of the time commitment required. Candidates are sought by 
third party advisers and where appropriate through assessment 
of internal candidates and are then formally considered by 
the Nomination Committee. Extensive external referencing is 
completed.
All appointments are made on merit and against objective 
criteria with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board, including gender and race. 
The Committee has had a 
busy year with a significant  
number of Executive and 
Non-Executive changes  
to the Board

The Company and the Committee value the aims and 
objectives of the Davies report on women on boards and 
support and apply the Group’s diversity policy set out on  
pages 54-55. 
No formal measurable objectives for female and ethnic 
representation at Board level have currently been set as the 
Committee is committed, while having regard to the diversity 
policy, to recommend only the most appropriate candidates 
for appointment to the Board. Currently 17 per cent of the 
Directors and officers on the Board are women and there is no 
ethnic representation.
When a new Director is appointed they receive a full, formal 
and tailored induction into the Company and discuss with the 
Chairman any immediate training requirements.
During the new financial year 2018, the Board will recruit a 
new Chief Executive Officer and will provide for its succession 
requirements by the appointment of a new Non-Executive 
Director.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found in the 
Group’s Investors’ section of the Company’s website:
www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/investor-relations
The terms of reference are reviewed annually and updated 
when necessary.
Committee Meetings
The Committee is required, in accordance with its terms of 
reference, to meet at least twice per year. During this financial 
year, the Committee met nine times.

Cyber security  
committee report
The Cyber Security Committee was formed as a new 
committee of the Board in November 2016 to assess the 
Group’s internal cyber security policy and defences. 
Debbie Hewitt, Senior Independent Director, was appointed as 
Chairman of the Cyber Security Committee on inception. Non-
executive Directors Chris Batterham and Jonathan Brooks 
are also members of the Committee, with Chris joining the 
Committee on formation and Jonathan joining the Committee 
in May 2017 . 
The Group’s Chief Cyber Risk Officer (“CCRO”) and the 
Group’s Information Security Officer are standing invitees of 
the Committee. The Executive Directors are invited to attend 
Committee meetings when the Committee considers it to be 
appropriate.
The Cyber Security Committee’s objectives 
and responsibilities
The Cyber Security Committee is responsible for assessing the 
performance of the Group’s internal security and defences and 
as such its duties are to: 
1.1  oversee and advise the Board on the current cyber risk 
exposure of the Group and future cyber risk strategy;
1.2  review at least annually the Group’s cyber security 
breach response and crisis management plan;
1.3  review reports on any cyber security incidents and the 
adequacy of proposed action; 
1.4  receive and consider the regular reports from the CCRO;
1.5  ensure the CCRO is given the right of direct access to 
the Committee;
1.6  consider and recommend actions in respect of all cyber 
risk issues escalated by the CCRO, head of IT and the 
compliance function;
1.7  keep under review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
controls, services and products to analyse potential 
vulnerabilities that could be exploited; 
1.8  regularly assess what are the Group’s most valuable 
intangible assets and the most sensitive Group and 
customer information and assess whether the controls in 
place sufficiently protect those assets and information; 
1.9  review the Group’s ability to identify and manage new 
cyber risks;
1.10  assess the adequacy of resources and funding for cyber 
security activities;
1.1 1  regularly review the cyber risk posed by third parties 
including outsourced IT and other partners;
1.12  oversee cyber security due diligence undertaken as 
part of an acquisition and advise the Board of the risk 
exposure; and
1.13  annually assess the adequacy of the Group’s cyber 
insurance cover.
The Group increased its capability to 
detect and react to potential incidents to 
ensure it keeps up with the ever  
evolving cyber threat landscape

The Board leads the process for the appointment of new 
members to the Committee on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee and in consultation with the Chairman 
of the Committee.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found in the 
Group’s Investors’ section of the Company’s website, www.
nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/investor-relations. The terms of 
reference are reviewed annually and updated when necessary.
Committee activities during the year
During the financial year the Committee assessed the Group’s 
short-term tactical requirements, including the introduction of a 
new Cyber Security Breach Response and Crisis Management 
Plan, while simultaneously addressing longer term strategic 
goals around ensuring the Group’s resilience to potential 
cyber attacks of all levels. The Group increased its capability 
to detect and react to potential incidents with the additional 
of new, or enhanced, security controls and its intention is 
to continue to invest in the Group’s infrastructure to ensure 
that the Group keeps up with the ever evolving cyber threat 
landscape. 
The Committee also reviewed the Company’s cyber risk 
insurance and initiated an external benchmarking exercise 
to understand the robustness of its performance and risk 
processes relative to other external organisations. The output 
of this will set the priorities for the Committee to review  
in 2018. 
Committee Meetings
The Committee is required, in accordance with its terms of 
reference, to meet at least three times per year. During this 
financial year, the Committee met three times. 
The attendance of individual Committee members at the Cyber 
Security Committee meetings is shown in the table below.

Committee Effectiveness
During the year, the Cyber Security Committee carried out an 
internal self-evaluation on its effectiveness, noting that the 
Committee is still in its formative stages. As an output of this 
evaluation, the Committee, along with the Board, resolved 
in May 2017 to extend the scope of the Cyber Security 
Committee to include assessment of wider risk matters across 
the Group. During the next financial year the Cyber Security 
Committee will be renamed as the ‘Cyber Security and Risk 
Committee’ and its terms of reference will be extended to 
include overall responsibility for risk management, policy and 
internal control systems across the Group (except for those 
areas that are within the scope of the Audit Committee, as 
summarised on pages 74 to 75).

Remuneration  
committee report
ANNUAL STATEMENT
I present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 May 2017 . The Report is split into three sections, 
namely, this Annual Statement, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
During the year, we continued to operate within the 
Remuneration Policy that was put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2014 AGM. This policy was adopted for three 
years. As this period is coming to an end, the Committee has 
now reviewed the policy to assess its appropriateness and 
alignment to the business strategy and has consulted with 
shareholders and shareholder advisory groups on its proposed 
changes. The proposed changes are summarised at the end of 
this statement. 
2016/7 has been a very challenging year for the Group. 
Although sales continued to grow, EBITDA fell back by 20 
per cent to £36.2m. This disappointing performance has been 
reflected in the performance-related elements of Executive 
remuneration and as such, no payment was made to any 
departing or current Executive for the annual bonus for the 
year ended 31 May 2017 . 
In addition, the target set for adjusted EPS over the last three 
years was missed and the Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP) 
awarded in the year ended 31 May 2014 lapsed, for both of 
the Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
There was considerable change in the composition of the 
Board. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer and 
Chairman all stepped down from the Board this year. Their exit 
terms are set out in detail on pages 100-101 of the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
We appointed a new CFO, Chairman and an additional Non-
Executive Director. 
Brian Tenner, Chief Finance Officer, joined the business on  
1 February 2017 . He was awarded a base salary of £250k 
and benefits and incentives in line with policy, the detail of 
which is included in the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
page 101. He was appointed to the position of interim Chief 
Executive on 1 March 2017 and was awarded a base salary 
of £350k for this role, which he retains whilst holding this 
interim position. His base salary will revert to £250k when he 
relinquishes his responsibility as interim CEO. No other terms 
and conditions were changed. He was awarded a nil per cent 
salary review from 1 June 2017 (as he joined the Company in 
February 2017). The general salary review awarded to all other 
employees was 2.5 per cent (for supporting functions) and 
4.5 per cent (for frontline staff). There were, however, market 
related adjustments to a number of roles across the business 
and increases for promotions. 
Chris Stone joined the business on 6 April 2017 as Executive 
Chairman. His fees for this role are £350k. Once a permanent 
Chief Executive Officer has been appointed Chris Stone will 
become Non-Executive Chairman and his fee will reduce to 
£135k.
Non-Executive Director fees are due for review every three 
years and these were reviewed with effect from 1 June 2017 . 
Details of these increases are given in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 96. The Board (with the exception of 
the Non-Executives), is proposing to change the Policy on 
Non-Executive Director fees to move to an annual review. 
This reflects the approach for other staff and prevents Non-
Executive fees getting significantly out of line with market, 
which could be a limiting factor to the attraction of new Non-
Executive Director candidates and could also result in large, 
albeit irregular, adjustments.

The committee has reviewed  
the Group’s remuneration policy to  
assess its appropriateness and  
alignment with business strategy
NCC AR2017 proof 8- Back.indd   86 09/08/2017   16:01:42 25546.04    9 August 2017 4:01 PM    Proof Six
The Board has undertaken a comprehensive review of the 
business strategy, a summary of the output is contained on 
pages 17 to 23. 
The Committee has reviewed the Executive Remuneration 
Policy in this context. It has consulted on its proposals with 
major shareholders and shareholder advisory groups and 
has decided that no changes are proposed to the structure 
of remuneration or the quantum of incentives but that it will 
make some changes to ensure we reflect most recent best 
practice. This includes adding a holding period to the long-
term incentive and increasing the shareholding guidelines for 
Executive Directors from 100 per cent of salary to 200 per 
cent of salary.
Looking forward, the Committee intends to keep the same 
annual bonus structure in 2017/18, but will add strategic 
performance objectives alongside profit targets, which is 
allowed within the current Remuneration Policy. These 
objectives will include measures coming from the key priorities 
identified from the strategy review. The strategic targets will 
account for 25 per cent of the bonus entitlement. As in prior 
years, the bonus will continue to be self-funding and as such, 
no bonus will be payable, even for strategic targets, unless the 
minimum profit target is met. The profit target will be based 
on actual rather than adjusted PBT. Thirty-five per cent of any 
bonus earned will be deferred into nominal cost share options 
and once vested after two years shares must be retained until 
the shareholding guideline is achieved. Clawback and malus 
provisions are in place for the annual bonus.
The Committee recognises that annual bonus target disclosure 
is a key issue for shareholders. Our Policy going forward will be 
to disclose annual bonus targets in the year in which payment 
is made. For example, financial year 2017/18 targets will be 
disclosed in the 2017/18 Remuneration Report, subject to the 
Committee being comfortable that the targets are no longer 
commercially sensitive. We intend to adopt this approach with 
immediate effect so the targets for 2014/15, 2015/16 and 
2016/17 are all disclosed in this report.
In relation to the L TIP for 2017–20, the Committee intends to 
make awards of up to 100 per cent of base salary and these 
will vest after three years if a demanding EPS performance 
target is satisfied. We will also add a measure of Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and a cash metric, for the first time 
this coming year, to further align Executive incentives with 
outcomes for shareholders. Up to 60 per cent of the potential 
will relate to EPS, 30 per cent to the cash metric and 10 per 
cent to TSR. Clawback and malus provisions are in place for 
the L TIP. A holding period has been added to the long-term 
incentive requiring Executives to retain any vested shares (net 
of tax) for a period of two years or until their shareholding 
guideline has been met (whichever is the later) to further align 
Executives with shareholders.
In line with best practice, we are also proposing to increase our 
Executive shareholding guideline from 100 per cent of base 
salary to 200 per cent, with the individuals required to hold 
on to all vested shares until the guideline has been achieved, 
except shares sold to meet any tax liability arising from vesting 
shares. 
The Committee will be asking for the Policy to be approved for 
a further three years, though recognises that there may be a 
need to bring further changes next year, once the output of the 
strategy review is clear. The Committee will of course consult 
with shareholders if that is the case.
At the Annual General Meeting in September 2016, 98.92 
per cent of shareholders voted in favour of the adoption of 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee appreciated the support for our approach. The 
2017 Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be put to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting 
in September 2017 , providing shareholders with the opportunity 
to voice their opinions on how the Committee has implemented 
the Remuneration Policy this year. The new three year Policy 
will also be put to the vote. We look forward to receiving your 
support on our approach to Remuneration at the Annual 
General Meeting.

Remuneration  
committee report
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company’s 
policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
other senior Executives. The principles which underpin the 
remuneration policy for the Company are to:
 z ensure Executive Directors’ rewards and incentives are 
directly aligned with the interests of the shareholders 
in order to reinforce the strategic priorities of the 
Group, optimise the performance of the Group and 
create sustained growth in shareholder value, without 
encouragement to take excessive undue risk;
 z provide the level of remuneration required to attract, retain 
and motivate Executive Directors and senior Executives of 
an appropriate calibre;
 z ensure a proper balance of fixed and variable performance 
related components, linked to short and longer-term 
objectives; and
 z reflect market competitiveness, taking account of the total 
value of all the benefit elements.
Our Remuneration Strategy has been designed to reflect the 
needs of a large multinational organisation, which is growing 
both organically through the innovation of products and 
services and with value enhancing acquisitions, which enable 
us to leverage our access to new capabilities and products. 
The annual bonus incentivises sustainable growth across all 
areas of the business and the Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP) 
reflects our longer-term growth ambitions, particularly in new 
markets and new products.
Remuneration for the Executive Directors is structured so 
that the variable pay elements (annual bonus and long-term 
incentives) form a significant proportion of the overall package. 
This provides a strong link between the remuneration paid 
to Executive Directors and the performance of the Company. 
This also provides a strong alignment of interest between the 
Executive Directors and shareholders, particularly as 35 per 
cent of the annual bonus and all of the long-term incentive is 
payable in the form of shares.
For the purposes of section 226D(6)(b) of the Companies Act 
2006, this policy will take effect from the date of the 2017 
AGM, which is scheduled to be held on 21 September 2017 .

SALARY
Attract, retain and

Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
salaries for Executive Directors annually 
unless responsibilities change. 
Pay reviews take into account Group 
and personal performance and 
externally benchmarked market data 
for companies operating in IT services, 
management consulting and relevant 
high-tech sectors, which although 
not directly comparable, provides an 
indicative range. 
In setting appropriate salary levels the 
Committee takes into account pay and 
employment conditions of employees 
elsewhere in the Group, alongside the 
impact of any increase to base salaries 
on the total remuneration package
Any changes are effective from 1 June  
each year. 
Details of current salaries are 
set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (page 101).
Salary increases are normally 
in line with those for other 
employees but also take 
account of other factors such 
as changes to responsibility 
and the complexity of the role.

ANNUAL BONUS
Drive and reward 
sustainable business 
performance. 
Based on a range of stretching targets 
measured over one year. This might 
include, but not exclusively, profit 
measures and other strategic objectives 
such as cash management, brand 
development, customer satisfaction and 
retention, business unit sales growth 
and employee engagement.  
Performance below the minimum 
performance target results in no 
bonus. No more than 20 per cent 
of the maximum opportunity is paid 
for achievement of the threshold 
performance targets.  
Payments rise from the threshold 
payment to 100 per cent of the 
maximum opportunity for levels of 
performance between the threshold and 
maximum targets. The rate of the rise 
and the various payment targets are 
determined annually by the Committee.
The Committee has discretion to 
reduce the formulaic bonus outcome if 
individual performance is determined to 
be unsatisfactory or if the individual is 
the subject of disciplinary action.
35 per cent of any bonus payment is 
invested in nominal cost share options 
and deferred for a two year period. 
Dividend equivalents are paid on vesting 
share options. Malus and claw back 
provisions are in place for both cash 
and deferred elements.
Chief Executive Officer 100 
per cent of base salary.
Chief Finance Officer 100 per 
cent of base salary.
Introduction of strategic 
targets, which account for up 
to 25 per cent of the annual 
bonus potential. This will 
ensure focus on delivery of 
the KPIs underpinning the 
strategy.
Strategic targets will have 
a gateway of the minimum 
profit hurdle before they can 
be payable.
No more than 20 per cent of 
the maximum opportunity is 
paid for achievement of the 
threshold performance target 
– this has been reduced 
from 25 per cent under the 
previous policy.
Disclosure of annual bonus 
targets will be made in 
the year in which payment 
is made, subject to the 
Committee being comfortable 
that the targets are no longer 
commercially sensitive.
Executives will be required 
to retain all deferred bonus 
shares (except any tax 
payment related to their 
vesting) until they have 
attained the minimum 
shareholding guideline.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
To drive long-term 
performance in line 
with Group strategy 
and incentivise 
through share 
ownership.
Awards have a performance period of 
three years.
The level of vesting is determined by 
measures appropriate to the strategic 
priorities of the business. At least half 
of any award will be subject to financial 
performance measures. Measures 
might include, but not exclusively, EPS, 
cash flow and relative TSR metrics.
Initially, the targets will represent 
maximum 60 per cent of potential for 
EPS, 30 per cent for cash flow and 
10 per cent for relative TSR. 
The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to determine the number of 
measures to be used.
Performance below the threshold target 
results in no vesting. For performance 
between the threshold target and 
maximum performance target, vesting 
starts at 20 per cent and rises to 
100 per cent of the shares vesting.
Any awards granted under this policy 
to Executive Directors which vest and 
are exercised after the completion of 
the three year performance period must 
be held for a further two years after 
vesting, even if the Director has met the 
200 per cent shareholding guideline.
Should a change in control of the

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINE
To align the interests 
of Executive Directors 
with the interests of 
all of the Company’s 
shareholders.
The Executive Directors are expected 
to build and retain a shareholding in the 
Group at least equivalent to 200 per 
cent of base salary. Executives will be 
required to retain all vested deferred 
bonus shares and L TIP shares released 
from the holding period until they have 
attained the minimum shareholding 
guideline and even then they may only 
sell when they have held vested L TIP 
shares for a minimum period of two 
years.
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive 
Directors are permitted to sell sufficient 
shares in order to meet any tax 
obligation arising from vesting shares.
Further align shareholder 
and Executive interests by 
increasing the Executive 
shareholding guideline from 
100 per cent of base salary 
to 200 per cent. 
Executives will be required 
to retain all vested L TIP 
shares (except to meet 
the tax obligation relating 
to their vesting) until they 
have attained the minimum 
shareholding guideline and 
even then, only when they 
have held vested L TIP shares 
for a minimum period of two 
years. 
Choice of performance measures  
and target setting
For both the annual bonus and L TIPs, our policy is to choose 
performance measures which help drive and reward the 
achievement of our strategy and which also provide alignment 
between Executives and shareholders. The Committee reviews 
metrics annually to ensure they remain appropriate and reflect 
the future strategic direction of the Group.
Targets for each performance measure are set by the 
Committee with reference to internal plans and external 
expectations. Performance is generally measured on a ‘sliding 
scale’ so that incentive payouts increase pro rata for levels 
of performance in between the threshold and maximum 
performance targets. 
With regard to the annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee 
believes that a simple and transparent scheme with sufficiently 
stretching targets and an element of bonus deferral prevents 
short-term decisions being made and ensures that the 
Executive is entirely focused on the delivery of sustainable 
business performance, which significantly enhances 
shareholder value. 
With regard to the L TIP, the Committee believes in setting 
demanding objectives, which reward steady, progressive 
growth, in order to incentivise and encourage long-term growth 
and enhance shareholder value. It is the Committee’s view that 
inappropriately high targets can encourage inappropriate risk 
taking and in a Group where innovation and research is key to 
Group Strategy, it could result in these areas being dispensed 
with, thereby jeopardising the long-term aims of the Group.
Performance measures and targets are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. In cases where targets are 
commercially sensitive, for example annual profit targets for 
the annual bonus, they will be disclosed retrospectively in the 
year in which the bonus is paid.
Differences in pay policy for employees and 
Executive Directors
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors is replicated 
throughout the Group and aims to attract and retain the best 
staff and to focus their remuneration on the delivery of long-
term sustainable growth by using a mix of salary, benefits, 
bonus and longer-term incentives. 
As a result, no element of Executive Director remuneration 
policy is operated exclusively for Executive Directors:
 z The annual performance related pay scheme for Executive 
Directors is largely the same as that of the Operational 
Directors and Senior Managers within the business and all 
are aligned with similar business objectives;
 z Participation in the L TIP is extended to other Senior 
Executives ensuring consistency in policy; and
 z The pension scheme is operated for all permanent 
employees.
The main difference between pay for Executive Directors and 
employees is that Executive Director pay is structured so that 
the variable pay element forms a significant proportion of 
the overall package and the total remuneration opportunity is 
higher to reflect the increased responsibility of the role.

Remuneration  
committee report
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive shareholding guidelines
The Committee considers that each Executive Director of 
the Company should retain a personal holding of shares 
in the Company, the rationale being that this will expose 
those Directors to the same risks and rewards enjoyed by 
the Company’s shareholders and as such align the interests 
of Executive Directors with the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders. 
In any event, 35 per cent of the value awarded as part of the 
annual bonus scheme will be awarded as nominal cost deferred 
share options, to be held for a period of no less than two years 
and share options vesting under the L TIP scheme, if exercised, 
are to be held for a minimum of two years after the vesting date.
Furthermore, Executive Directors are required to build and 
retain a shareholding in the Group at least equivalent to  
200 per cent of base salary. Executives will be required to 
retain all vested deferred bonus shares and L TIP shares 
released from the holding period until they have attained the 
minimum shareholding guideline and even then they may only 
sell when they have held vested L TIP shares for a minimum 
period of two years (subject to the below paragraph).
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive Directors are permitted 
to sell sufficient shares in order to the meet any tax obligation 
arising from vesting shares, notwithstanding that the Executive 
Director has not attained their minimum shareholding.

FEES

Non-Executive 
Directors.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined 
by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association and are based on information on fees 
paid in similar companies taking into account the 
experience of the individuals and the relative time 
commitments involved.
There will be separate disclosure of fees paid for 
Chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
and for acting as Senior Independent Director.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed 
annually.
Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) can be reimbursed if determined to be a 
taxable benefit.
Current fee levels are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on page 96.
Overall fee limit will be within the current £300,000 
limit set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
approved on 21 September 2010, which is subject 
to increase on 21 September each year by the same 
percentage increase as the percentage increase in 
the General Index of Retail Prices for all items (or 
such other comparable index as may be substituted 
for it from time to time before such anniversary) in 
the 12 months immediately preceding such date.
Approach to recruitment
The principles applied in the recruitment of a new Executive 
Director is for the remuneration package to be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration 
policy for existing Executive Directors in force at the time of 
appointment. Further detail of this policy for each element of 
remuneration is set out below:
Salary. Salaries for new hires, including internal promotions, 
will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s 
intended pay positioning and the market rate for the applicable 
role.
Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, 
the Committee will have the discretion to allow phased salary 
increases over a period of time for newly appointed Directors, 
even though this may involve increases in excess of the rate 
for the wider workforce and inflation.
Benefits. Benefits will be provided in line with those offered 
to other Executive Directors, taking account of local market 
practice, with relocation expenses or arrangements provided 
if necessary. Tax equalisation may also be considered if 
an Executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their 
employment with the Company. The Company may also pay 
legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual. These 
would all be disclosed.
Incentive opportunity. The aggregate ongoing incentive 
opportunity offered to new recruits will be no higher than 
that offered under the annual bonus plan and the L TIP to the 
existing Executive Directors. Different performance measures 
and targets may be set initially for the annual bonus plan, 
taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the 
point in the financial year at which they join.

‘Buyout’ awards. Sign-on bonuses are not generally offered 
by NCC Group but at Board level, the Committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share based ‘buyout’ awards when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company 
and, therefore, shareholders, including awards made under 
Listing Rule 9.4.2 R. Any such ‘buyout’ payments would be 
based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism such 
as cash, shares, options, time horizons and performance 
requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Transitional arrangements for internal appointments 
to the Board. In the case of an internal appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role 
may be allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, 
adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In 
addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put 
to shareholders for approval at the first AGM following their 
appointment.
Policy on payment for loss of office. Payments on 
termination for Executive Directors are restricted to the value 
of salary and contractual benefits for the duration of the notice 
period. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to seek 
to mitigate termination payments and pay what is due and fair. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive 
Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of 
office. The Company may also pay an amount considered to 
be reasonable by the Committee where loss of office is due 
to redundancy or in respect of fees for legal advice for the 
outgoing Director.
Elements of variable remuneration would be treated as follows:
Annual bonus. The treatment of annual bonus payments 
upon cessation of employment is determined on a case by 
case basis. When the Committee determines that the payment 
of an annual bonus is appropriate, the annual bonus payment 
is typically:
 z prorated for the period of time served from the start of the 
financial year to the date of termination and not for any 
period in lieu of notice or garden leave; and
 z subject to the normal bonus targets, tested at the end of 
the year, and would take into account performance over the 
notice period; and 
 z subject to deferral of 35 per cent of the value.
The Committee also has the discretion to determine whether 
any nominal cost deferred share options from previous annual 
bonus payments will vest at the normal vesting date or earlier 
on leaving or whether they lapse. If the Committee exercises 
this discretion, they can also determine if the vesting should 
be prorated to reflect time served since the beginning of the 
deferral date. The same discretionary principle would apply 
to the payment of dividends on any shares that have been 
deferred, but not yet vested. This too would be prorated to 
reflect tenure.
Long Term Incentive Plan. Under the L TIP, unvested 
awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment. 
However, in line with the plan rules, the Committee has 
discretion to allow awards to vest at the normal vesting date, or 
earlier. If the Committee exercises this discretion, awards are 
normally prorated to reflect time served since the date of grant 
and based on the achievement of the performance criteria. The 
holding period detailed above will apply to such incentives.
All Employee Share Schemes. The Executive Directors, 
where eligible for participation in all employee share schemes, 
participate on the same basis as for other employees.
Approach to service contracts and letters of 
appointment. The Committee’s policy is to offer service 
contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of 
between six and twelve months exercisable by either party. In 
addition, the Executive Directors are subject to a non-compete 
clause from the date of termination, where enforceable.
All Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are terminable on at 
least three months’ notice on either side. 
The Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors offer 
themselves for re-election every year.

Officer, plus 20 per cent vesting of the maximum award 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
 z Maximum. Fixed remuneration plus maximum annual 
bonus opportunity, £250,000 for the Chief Finance Officer, 
which is equivalent to 100 per cent of salary for the Chief 
Finance Officer plus 100 per cent vesting of the maximum 
award under the Long Term Incentive Plan which is 100 per 
cent of salary for the Chief Finance Officer.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Remuneration Committee does not consult directly 
with employees when determining Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors. However, as stated above, the annual 
bonus and L TIP are operated for other employees to ensure 
alignment of objectives across the Group and the terms of 
the pension scheme (save for the contribution entitlements) 
are the same for all permanent employees. In addition, the 
Committee compares information on general pay levels and 
policies across the Group when setting Executive Director pay 
levels.
How shareholder views are taken into 
account
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received on the Directors’ Remuneration Report each year 
and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more 
generally. Shareholders’ views are key inputs when shaping 
remuneration policy. When any material changes are proposed 
to the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman will inform major shareholders in advance and will 
generally offer a meeting to discuss these. There has been 
significant consultation on the proposed changes to the 
Remuneration Policy this year.
Key areas of discretion  
in the remuneration policy
The Committee operates the Group’s variable incentive 
plans according to their respective rules and in accordance 
with HMRC rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient 
administration of these plans, the Committee will apply certain 
operational discretions. These discretions are implicit in the 
policy stated above, but we have listed them for clarity. These 
include, but are not limited to:
 z Whether annual bonus is paid to Executives once notice 
has been served.
 z Discretion in exceptional circumstances to amend 
previously set incentive targets or to adjust the proposed 
payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome.
 z Certain decisions relating to the L TIP awards for which 
the Committee has discretion as set out in the rules of 
the relevant share plans which have been approved by 
shareholders.
 z The decisions on exercise of clawback rights.

Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors before the current 
legislation on remuneration policies came into force or before 
an individual became a Director, such as the payment of 
outstanding incentive awards, even where it is not consistent 
with the policy prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled. 
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 
External Directorships for Executive 
Directors
Executive Directors may accept one external Non-Executive 
Directorship with the prior agreement of the Board, provided 
it does not conflict with the Group’s interests and the time 
commitment does not impact upon the Executive Director’s 
ability to perform their primary duty. The Executive Directors 
may retain the fee from external directorships.
During the financial year, Chris Stone held more than one 
external Non-Executive Directorship with the consent of 
the Board on the basis that such external Non-Executive 
Directorships did not conflict with or impact on his ability to 
perform his role as Executive Chairman and as Chris’s role will 
revert to becoming Non-Executive Chairman when a new Chief 
Executive Officer is appointed.
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with 
Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 
9.8.8R of the Listing Rules.
The following report will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the 2017 AGM, which is scheduled to be held  
21 September 2017 . The information on pages 97 to 105 has 
been audited where indicated. 
How will the remuneration policy 
be implemented in the year ended  
31 May 2018?
Executive Directors’ Base Salaries. As the Chief Finance 
Officer was appointed in February 2017 and the Executive 
Chairman in April 2017 , the Committee has decided not to 
award any salary increases with effect from 1 June 2017 . With 
regard to all other employees, the general increase has been 
2.5 per cent (for support staff) and 4.5 per cent (for frontline 
staff), except those who have been promoted or where market 
adjustments were made to employees who were out of line with 
the general market, where larger increases have been made. 
This compares to the awards made last year to the previous 
Chief Executive Officer, Rob Cotton, of 6.02 per cent to £528k  
and to the previous Chief Finance Officer, Atul Patel, of 6.03 
per cent to £246k. 
The Chief Finance Officer is currently standing in as Interim 
Chief Executive Officer and receives a temporary salary 
supplement of £100k, making a total salary of £350k, which 
will revert to £250k when the new Chief Executive Officer is 
appointed.
The Executive Chairman will revert to becoming Non-Executive 
Chairman when a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed 
and his fees will revert to £135k.

Executive and will revert to £250k when a new Chief Executive Officer is 
appointed and the role reverts to Chief Finance Officer.
Pension and Benefits. There will be no changes to pension 
or benefits provision.
Annual Bonus. The annual bonus maximum for the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Finance Officer in 201 7 /18 will 
be 100 per cent of salary. Any bonus due to the Chief Executive 
Officer will be prorated to reflect full months worked in the year. 
The bonus due to the Chief Finance Officer will be based on his 
average salary for the year, including the supplement paid for his 
additional responsibilities as interim Chief Executive Officer.
Measures will be based 75 per cent on the achievement of 
actual operating profit (EBIT) targets and 25 per cent on the 
achievement of strategic objectives. To ensure that the bonus 
is self-funding, no bonus, including any due for achievement 
of strategic targets, will be payable if the minimum EBIT target 
is not met. The profit target will be based on delivery of the 
Group’s own internal plans, which are comprehensively set, 
scrutinised and agreed by the Main Board, overlaid on to the 
financial forecasts and expectations in the investor community. 
In addition, to ensure that this bonus opportunity also results in 
shareholder alignment and provides greater retention value, 35 
per cent of any bonus payment will be deferred in shares for 
two years. The bonus, deferred share options and associated 
dividends are also subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The performance measures, together with the level of 
performance against each objective, will be disclosed in the 
2017/18 Annual Report on Remuneration.

committee report
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The targets relating to the 2016/17 bonus payments (of which 
there were none) are shown below and as this is a transition 
year to our new policy on disclosure, we are also disclosing 
2015/16 and 2014/15 bonus targets and achievement against 
those targets.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). It is expected that 
awards of 100 per cent of base salary will be made under 
the L TIP in September 2017 , following the completion of the 
Strategic Review and the Company’s 2017 AGM at which 
the new remuneration policy will be tabled for approval on 
the same terms as set out in the policy table. These will be 
subject to a two-year post vesting holding period for Executive 
Directors. As well as the holding period, the Executives have 
to achieve a shareholding guideline of 200 per cent of salary 
(post shares sold to cover any tax) before they can sell any 
shares that vest. The awards are also subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.
The vesting of L TIP awards will be based on performance 
of Earnings Per Share (60 per cent), a Cash flow metric 
(30 per cent) and a relative Total Shareholder Return 
metric (10 per cent). The Committee believes that these 
three measures are transparent, easy to understand, easy 
to track and communicate, cost-effective to measure and 
fundamentally aligned to the strategic ambitions that have 
been communicated to the market.
The performance conditions will be set once the Strategic 
Review and Target Operating Model have been completed.
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
In line with the current Policy, Non-Executive Director fees are 
due for review every three years and these were last reviewed 
in June 2014. The fees have been benchmarked in line with 
companies of a similar scale and complexity and it is proposed 
that the base fee is increased from £38,000 to £45,000, 
to apply with effect from 1 June 2017 . Additional fees for 
chairing the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
and performing the duties of Senior Independent Director will 
remain unchanged at £7 ,000, £7 ,000 and £6,000 respectively. 
In addition to the above, the Board (without Debbie Hewitt’s 
participation) considered the additional hours committed by 
her in her capacity as Senior Independent Director during 
the year and specifically from the period from October 2016 
to May 2017 , when she led the Company’s consultation with 
key shareholders, chaired the newly created Governance 
Committee, set up to comprehensively review standards of 
Corporate Governance across all aspects of the business, 
chaired the Nominations Committee, chaired the newly created 
Disclosure Committee, as well as overseeing the initiation 
of the strategy review. During this period, she also led the 
recruitment of the new Chairman and an additional Non-
Executive Director. The Board decided that in recognition of 
the significant increase in time and the diligence with which 
she tackled these considerable tasks that she should be paid 
an additional one-off fee of £35,000. Such a payment is within 
the scope of our NED fee policy.
In addition, the Board is proposing to move to an annual 
review of fees for Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman. This reflects the approach with general staff and 
prevents Non-Executive Director fees getting significantly out 
of line with market, which could result in significant irregular 
adjustments to NED fees and which could be a limitation to 
the attraction of new appointments.

How has the remuneration policy been implemented in 
the year ended 31 May 2017?
This section sets out how the remuneration policy was 
implemented in 2016/17 . The key implementation decisions 
during the year related to:
 z Determination of annual bonus outcomes for the 2016/17 
performance period.
 z Determination of the vesting level of L TIP awards which 
related to the three year performance period ending on 
31 May 2017 .
 z Terms of the exiting Directors, including the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer.
 z Terms of the new Directors appointed to the Board, 
including the Chairman and Chief Finance Officer.
 z The performance targets of the annual bonus scheme, 
which will apply for the YE 31 May 2018. 
 z The performance targets and value of awards to be granted 
under the L TIP, which will vest in 2020.

Additional information in respect of the Single Total Figure of Remuneration
Annual Bonus
Our previous policy was to disclose annual bonus targets retrospectively after two years. Following a review of that policy, the 
Committee has decided to disclose annual bonus targets in the annual report to which the annual bonus payment relates. As a 
result, this year is a transition year, in which we are disclosing the targets for three annual bonus awards: the 2016/17 annual 
bonus, the 2015/16 annual bonus and the 2014/15 annual bonus. These disclosures are set out below:
2016/17 Annual Bonus (Audited)
For the year ended 31 May 2017 , the maximum potential bonus opportunity for Rob Cotton was 100 per cent of salary 
(£528,000), for Atul Patel 100 per cent of salary (£246,000) and for Brian Tenner 100 per cent of salary but prorated to reflect 
that he joined part way through the year (£40,000).
No annual bonus was paid to any departing or current Executive Director for the year ended 31 May 2017 , recognising the 
significant underperformance of the business in relation to market expectations. 
The performance measures and targets are set out below:

2015/16 Annual Bonus (Audited)
For the year ended 31 May 2016, the maximum bonus opportunity for Rob Cotton was 100 per cent of salary (£498,000), and

A total bonus of 70 per cent of potential was paid to each Executive Director, 35 per cent of which was deferred in shares for a 
further two years.

Actual performance/Bonus payments £37 .0m £348,600 £162,400
In relation to the deferred share option granted to Rob Cotton on 15 July 2016, for 41,357 shares, all outstanding deferred share 
options under the DB Plan, relating to the 2016 annual bonus awards (totalling 41,357 shares), and the cash equivalent relating 
to the dividends due to be paid on those shares, will lapse at the cessation of Rob Cotton’s employment on 31 October 2017 , as 
part of his exit arrangements. The cash equivalent on the dividends at 31 May 2017 is £1,923.10. 
Atul Patel resigned and left the Company on 3 February 2017 . In relation to the deferred share option granted to Atul Patel on 15 
July 2016, for 19,266 shares, the Committee determined that these awards should vest on a prorata basis to reflect time worked 
since the date of the grant. This will result in 6,422 shares vesting on 31 May 2018 in relation to the awards granted in July 2016.

Participants in the DB Plan are also entitled to a cash payment of an amount equal to the value of dividends that would have 
been paid on the deferred share options in relation to dividend record dates occurring between the date of grant and the date 
that the awards vest. Accordingly, the Committee determined that Atul Patel will be entitled to a prorata dividend accrual payment 
when the deferred share options vest, which as at 31 May 2017 amounts to £298.62. 
The awards and dividends will continue to be subject to the relevant malus and clawback provisions. 
2014/15 Annual Bonus (Audited)
For the year ended 31 May 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for Rob Cotton was 100 per cent of salary (£470,000), and for 
Atul Patel 100 per cent of salary (£209,000).
A total bonus of 72.8 per cent of potential was paid to each Executive Director, 35 per cent of which was deferred in shares for a 
further  
two years.

Actual performance/Bonus payments £25.47m £342.141 £152,144
In relation to the deferred share option granted to Rob Cotton on 28 July 2015, for 52,614 shares, while he was still employed by 
the Company when the deferred share options were due to vest on 31 May 2017 , notwithstanding the rules of the DB Plan and 
the terms of the option certificate in relation to those deferred shares, he agreed, as part of his exit arrangements, not to exercise 
his option. These deferred share options and the associated dividend of £4,645.82 lapsed.
Atul Patel resigned and left the Company on 3 February 2017 . In relation to the deferred share option granted to Atul Patel on 28 
July 2015, for 23,396 shares, the Committee determined that these awards should vest on a prorata basis to reflect time worked 
since the date of the grant. This resulted in 19,497 shares vesting on 31 May 2017 in relation to the awards granted in July 2015. 
Participants in the DB Plan are also entitled to a cash payment of an amount equal to the value of dividends that would have

Chief Executive Officer
Rob Cotton, Chief Executive Officer, stepped down from 
the Board and was put on garden leave from 1 March 2017 . 
Although Rob Cotton’s Service Agreement provides for a 12 
month notice period, it was mutually agreed that this would 
be reduced to a period of eight months’ garden leave, during 
which he would receive payment by monthly instalments 
equating to eight months’ salary, pension and car allowance 
(total of £399,600). It was also agreed that he would continue 
to receive other benefits as usual during this garden leave 
period. He will cease being an employee of the Company on 
31 October 2017 . 
No payment was made in lieu of annual bonus in respect of 
the financial year ended 31 May 2017 or during the garden 
leave period and no further L TIP grant will be made.
In relation to the L TIP option granted to Rob Cotton on  
6 August 2014 totaling 228,432 shares under option, the 
performance condition was not achieved and the option lapsed. 
All outstanding L TIPs in respect of the 2015 and 2016 awards, 
totalling 400,490 shares under option, will lapse (in the case 
of the 2016 awards) or will not be exercised as agreed by Rob 
Cotton (in relation to the 2015 awards) at the cessation of his 
employment on 31 October 2017 .
In relation to the deferred shares granted to Rob Cotton 
on 28 July 2015, which were due to vest on 31 May 2017 , 
totalling 52,614 shares, notwithstanding the rules of the DB 
Plan and the terms of the option certificate in relation to those 
deferred shares, he agreed not to exercise his option (the cash 
equivalent relating to the dividends totalled £4,645.82).
All other outstanding deferred shares under the DB Plan, 
relating to the 2016 annual bonus awards, totalling 41,357 
shares and the cash equivalent relating to the dividends due 
to be paid on those shares, will lapse at the cessation of Rob 
Cotton’s employment on 31 October 2017 . The cash equivalent 
as at 1 April 2017 is £1,923.10. 
Any Save As You Earn awards outstanding at cessation of his 
employment on 31 October 2017 will lapse.
No further payments for loss of office will be made.

Chief Finance Officer
Atul Patel, the previous Chief Finance Officer, resigned and 
stepped down from the Board on 10 August 2016 and left the 
Company on 3 February 2017 , after working his notice.
His salary, pension and car allowance was paid in monthly 
instalments as usual, including other benefits until 3 February 
2017 . He was not eligible for an annual bonus in respect of the 
financial year ended 31 May 2017 .
All Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘L TIP’) awards held by Atul 
Patel (in respect of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 awards, totalling 
288,161 shares under option) lapsed on cessation of his 
employment on 3 February 2017 .
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DB Plan’), he deferred a total 
of 42,662 shares relating to the 2015 and 2016 annual bonus 
awards. The Committee determined that these awards should 
vest on a prorata basis to reflect time worked since the date of 
the grant. This resulted in 19,497 shares vesting on  
31 May 2017 in relation to the awards granted in July 2015 
and 6,422 shares vesting on 31 May 2018 in relation to the 
awards granted in July 2016. 
Participants in the DB Plan are also entitled to a cash payment 
of an amount equal to the value of dividends that would have 
be paid on the deferred shares in relation to dividend record 
dates occurring between the date of grant and the date that 
the awards vest. Accordingly, the Committee determined that 
he will be entitled to a prorata dividend accrual payment when 
the deferred shares vest. 
The awards and dividends will continue to be subject to the 
relevant malus and clawback provisions. 
His outstanding Save as Your Earn awards lapsed on the 
cessation of his employment on 3 February 2017 .

SAYE options granted and exercised in the year. The Group operates an HMRC approved SAYE scheme. All eligible employees, 
including Executive Directors, may be invited to participate on similar terms for a fixed period of three years. During the year

employment on 31 October 2017 , he elected, as part of his exit terms, to withdraw from the 2016 scheme. On his departure from 
the Company, Atul Patel’s participation in the 2014 scheme lapsed.

Shareholding Requirements (Audited)
This year, the Remuneration Committee has decided to adopt a new guideline with regard to Executive shareholding. The 
Executive Directors are expected to build and retain a shareholding in the Group at least equivalent to 200 per cent of base 
salary. Executives will be required to retain all vested deferred bonus shares and L TIP shares released from the holding period 
until they have attained the minimum shareholding guideline and even then, only when they have held vested L TIP shares for a 
minimum period of two years. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive Directors are permitted to sell sufficient shares in order to 
meet any tax obligation arising from vesting shares.

Directors’  
report
The Directors present their report and the Group and Company 
Financial Statements of NCC Group plc (the ‘Company’) and 
its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) for the financial year 
ended 31 May 2017 .
Principal activities 
The Company is a public limited company incorporated in 
England, registered number 4627044, with its registered 
office at Manchester Technology Centre, Oxford Road, 
Manchester, M1 7EF. In August 2017 , the headquarters of 
the Company will be relocating from Manchester Technology 
Centre to XYZ Building, 2 Hardman Boulevard, Spinningfields, 
M3 3AQ.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of 
independent advice and services to customers through 
the provision of escrow and cyber assurance services. The 
principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. 
Strategic report 
Pursuant to sections 414A-D Companies Act 2006, the 
strategic report can be found on pages 16 to 57 . This report 
sets out the development and performance of the Group’s 
business during the financial year, the position of the Group at 
the end of the year and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Company’s statement on corporate governance can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Report, the Audit 
Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 1 1 1. 
The Corporate Governance Report, the Audit Committee 
Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report form part of this Directors’ Report and 
are incorporated into it by reference. 
Results and dividends 
The Group’s and Company’s audited Financial Statements for 
the financial year ended 31 May 2017 are set out on pages  
1 13 to 169. 
The Directors propose a final dividend of 3.15p per ordinary 
share, which together with the interim dividend of 1.5p per 
ordinary share paid on 24 February 2017 makes a total 
dividend of 4.65p for the year. 
The final dividend will, if approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), be paid on 29 September 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 1 September 2017 . The ex dividend date will be 31 August 
2017 . 
An administrative non-compliance issue has been identified 
with respect to distributable reserves and the payment of 
previous dividends. The Company expects to remedy the 
position by means of shareholder resolutions at a general 
meeting to follow the AGM in September.  
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors have considered, among other 
matters, the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out 
on pages 48 to 53. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts 
and financial projections, the Board is satisfied that the Group 
will be able to operate within the level of its facilities for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason and as detailed in note 1 to 
the Financial Statements (Basis of preparation), the Directors 
consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three year period, in accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014, as set out on page 53.
Post balance sheet events 
There have been no balance sheet events that either require 
adjustment to the Financial Statements or are important in the 
understanding of the Company’s current position. After the 
year end the Group decided to dispose of two business units, 
Software Testing and Web Peformance. This is disclosed in 
more detail in the Strategic Report.

Directors’ responsibilities 
statement
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and the 
financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
 z select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 z make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
 z state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
 z prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the 
annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 z the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 z the strategic report/Directors’ report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.
We consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

Independent
auditor’s report
TO THE MEMBERS OF NCC GROUP PLC ONLY
1.  Our opinion on the financial statements  
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of NCC Group plc 
for the year ended 31 May 2017 set out on pages 134 to 169. 
In our opinion:
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
May 201 7 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 — the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Overview
Materiality:  
Group financial 
statements as a  
whole
£0.74m (2016: £1.20m)
4.7% (2016: 5.0%) of the Group profit  
before tax normalised to exclude  
individually significant items
Coverage 96% (2016: 99%) of Group profit before tax
Risks of material misstatement vs 2016
Recurring 
risks
Recoverability of goodwill
Capitalisation of software and  
development costs as intangible assets
 
Business combinations accounting
 
The risk in relation to the recoverability of goodwill has 
reduced following the impairment of £54.3m recognised 
during the year.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
The risk Our response
Recoverability 
of goodwill
(Goodwill 
£198.7m, 
2016: goodwill 
£224.3m) 
Refer to page 76 
(Audit Committee 
Report),  
page 128 
(accounting 
policy) and  
page 132 
(financial 
disclosures).
Subjective valuation
The trading environment in the year has been 
challenging for NCC Group plc resulting in 
a change in Directors and a Group wide-
strategic review. The resultant change in 
operating structure has led to a reassessment 
of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs).  
The assessment of the recoverability of 
goodwill could vary significantly depending on 
the determination of CGUs.
Forecast-based valuation
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows which are the basis of the assessment 
of recoverability, the outcome could vary 
significantly if different assumptions were 
applied in the model.
Goodwill balances have increased significantly 
over recent years following a number of 
acquisitions, some of which involve early start-
up businesses.
During the year ending 31 May 2017 
impairment of £54.3m has been recognised in 
respect of goodwill. 
Our procedures included: 
 z Testing application:  Reviewing the Group’s determination of CGUs against 
our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standard, 
particularly in regards to whether the CGUs are capable of generating 
independent cash inflows. 
 z Historical comparison: Assessing the Group’s forecasting accuracy by 
comparing actual results in the period to what was previously forecast for the 
year.
 z Our sector experience:  Assessing the reasonableness of future cash 
flow forecasts for each CGU having regard to actual trends and known future 
orders.
 z Benchmarking assumptions: With assistance from our own valuation 
specialists we critically evaluated the risk adjusted discount rates, with regard 
to market observable data of risk free rates, returns on equity for comparable 
companies and company size premium. We also evaluated the assumptions for 
cost inflation and terminal growth rate, having regard to market data.
 z Comparing valuations: Comparing the sum of the discounted cash 
flows to the Group’s market capitalisation adjusted for debt to assess the 
reasonableness of the value in use calculations.  
 z Sensitivity analysis: Performing break-even analysis on the assumptions 
noted above for CGUs where no impairment had been identified by the Group. 
 z Assessing transparency: Assessing the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions reflect the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill. We also 
assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the changes 
made in identifying the Group’s CGUs.

The risk Our response
Capitalisation 
of software and 
development 
costs as 
intangible 
assets
(Additions in 
the year: £7 .4m; 
2016: £8.8m)
(Net book 
value: £19.2m; 
2016: £21.9m)
Refer to page 76 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 
128 (accounting 
policy) and  
page 77 (financial 
disclosures).
Accounting treatment
The Group capitalises internal and external 
costs in respect of software and development 
projects. The Group has also capitalised costs 
in relation to the finance and operational 
systems upgrades that represent substantial 
improvements to these assets. The Directors 
apply judgement in the classification of 
expenditure as capital in nature rather than 
ongoing operational expenditure. 
Forecast-based valuation
Revenues have been falling short of 
business plans, due to a challenging trading 
environment.  As a result, the Group has 
tested previously capitalised software and 
development costs for impairment. There 
remains a degree of uncertainty around 
whether expected revenues and profits 
will be realised and be sufficient to ensure 
the recoverability of the assets recognised 
on the balance sheet. Certain of the key 
inputs, specifically timing and amount of 
capital expenditure, customer sign up rates 
and related cost of sales, and discount rate 
applied to future cash flows require significant 
estimation and judgement. 
During the year ended 31 May 2017 the 
Group has impaired capitalised development 
costs by £7 .7m in relation to certain specific 
projects where the generation of future 
economic benefits is no longer probable.
Our procedures included: 
 z Testing application: Agreeing a sample of costs to supporting 
documentation to understand the nature of the items and evaluate the 
appropriateness of their classification as capitalised costs, having regard to the 
relevant accounting standards. This included assessing whether major projects 
are technically feasible and commercially viable by reference to existing and 
future orders.
 z Personnel interviews: Corroborating the costs capitalised with information 
from the project teams regarding the nature of work performed in the year for 
which costs have been capitalised.  
 z Historical comparison: Assessing the Group’s forecasting accuracy by 
comparing actual results in the period to what was previously forecast for the 
year for each significant project. Critically evaluating the assumptions for future 
customer sign up rates, having regard to actual rates in previous years.
 z Benchmarking assumptions: Critically evaluating the discount rates, 
revenue and cost inflation having regard for market observable data. 
 z Assessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the capitalisation of software and development 
intangible assets.

intangibles £7 .7m;

Refer to page 77 
(Audit Committee 
Report), 
page 128 
(accounting 
policy) and

Accounting treatment
The Group made two acquisitions during the 
year. Judgement is involved, in relation to the 
identification of assets and liabilities acquired, 
particularly separately recognised intangible 
assets.
Subjective valuation 
The most subjective area relates to the 
fair value valuation of assets and liabilities 
acquired, especially acquired intangibles such 
as customer contracts and relationships.  
Our procedures included: 
 z Accounting analysis: Assessing the judgements taken around fair value 
adjustments having regard to relevant accounting standards.  Considering 
the separately identified intangible assets acquired through gaining an 
understanding of the business acquired and applying our professional 
experience and judgement.
 z Methodology choice: Comparing the methodology used in the valuation of 
acquired intangibles using the expertise of our internal valuation specialists.  
 z Benchmarking assumptions: Critically evaluating assumptions such as 
discount rates, growth rates and customer churn rates applied in the valuation 
of acquired intangibles, having regard to internal and external data.
 z Assessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the business combinations accounting.

Independent
auditor’s report
TO THE MEMBERS OF NCC GROUP PLC ONLY
3.  Our application of materiality and an  
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £0.7 4m (2016: £1.20m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax of £15.7m (normalised to 
exclude the individually significant items as disclosed in note 3), 
of which it represents 4.7 per cent (2016: 5.0 per cent).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £37 ,000 
(2016: £60,000), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 21 (2016: 20) reporting components, we 
subjected 1 1 (2016: 10) to audits for Group reporting 
purposes. We conducted reviews of financial information 
(including enquiry) at a further five (2016: seven) non-
significant components as these components were not 
individually financially significant enough to require an audit 
for Group reporting purposes but a review was performed to 
provide further coverage over the Group’s results.
The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the following percentages of the Group’s results: 96 
per cent of the Group’s profit before tax, 91 per cent of the 
Group’s profit before tax normalised to exclude individually 
significant items, 96 per cent of Group revenues and 97 per 
cent of Group total assets (2016:  99 per cent of the Group’s 
profit before tax, 96 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax 
normalised to exclude individually significant items, 97 per cent 
of Group revenues and 91 per cent of Group total assets).
For the remaining five components, we performed analysis at 
an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement within 
these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to 
the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. 
The Group audit team approved the component materialities, 
which ranged from £0.15m to £0.45m (2016: £0.25m to 
£0.50m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
Group revenue

the Group across the components. The work on one of the 
21 components (2016: none of the 20 components) was 
performed by component auditors and the rest by the Group 
audit team. The Group audit team performed procedures on 
the items excluded from normalised Group profit before tax.
The Group audit team visited one (2016: n/a) component 
location in Delft, Netherlands (2016: n/a), including to assess 
the audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings 
were also held with this component auditor. At this visit and 
in these meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the Group audit team was then performed by the 
component auditor.
4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
 — we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
 — in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5.  We have nothing to report on the 
disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 — the viability statement on page 53, concerning the principal 
risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in 
operation over the three years to May 2020; or 
 — the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6.  We have nothing to report in respect of 
the matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 — we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy; or
 — the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 — certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
 — we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
 — the Directors’ statements, set out on page 108, in relation 
to going concern and longer term viability; and   
 — the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on  
page 60 relating to the Company’s compliance with the  
1 1 provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 1 12, the Directors are responsible

Notes to  
the accounts
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
1  Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
NCC Group plc (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in 
the UK. The Group financial statements consolidate those of 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
“Group”). The parent Company financial statements present 
information about the Company as a separate entity and 
not about the Group. These financial statements have been 
approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 July 2017 .
Both the parent Company and the Group financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRS”). 
On publishing the parent Company financial statements here 
together with the Group financial statements, the Company is 
taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and 
related notes that form a part of these approved financial 
statements. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these Group financial statements. 
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis except for consideration payable on 
acquisitions that is measured at fair value.
Functional and presentation currency
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in 
millions of Pounds Sterling (£m) and all values are rounded to 
one decimal place except when otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 57 . The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Business and Financial 
Review on pages 2 to 15. In addition, note 21 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
The Group funds its strategic acquisitions and meets its 
day-to-day working capital requirements via a multi-currency 
revolving credit facility of £80.0m, a £25.0m multi-currency 
term loan that amortises by £2.5m every six months and an 
overdraft of £5m. At 31 May 2017 , the amount drawn down 
under the facilities was £56.0m. This facility was agreed in 
November 2015 and is due for renewal in November 2020. 
The Directors have reviewed the trading and cash flow 
forecasts of the Group as part of their going concern 
assessment and have taken into account reasonable downside 
sensitivities which reflect uncertainties in the current operating 
environment. The possible changes in trading performance 
show that the Group is able to operate within the level of the 
banking facilities and as a consequence, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully. After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
a period of at least 12 months. Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and accounts.
New standards
No new standards have been adopted for the first time that 
affect the reported results or financial position. 
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not 
yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted 
by the EU). The Group does not intend to early adopt these 
standards:
 z IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will 
be effective from the year ending 31 May 2019 onwards. 
Management continues to assess the likely impact of this 
standard.
 z IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Recognition and 
Measurement will be effective from the year ending 31 May 
2019 onwards. Management is still considering the impact 
of this new standard.
IFRS 16 Leases will be effective from the year ending 31 May 
2020 onwards and the impact on the financial statements will 
be significant to NCC Group plc. IFRS 16 requires lessees 
to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments 
and a right-of-use asset for all lease contracts. Therefore, 
the substantial majority of the Group’s operating lease 
commitments (some £56.4m on an undiscounted basis, as 
shown in note 26) would be brought on to the balance sheet 
and amortised and depreciated separately. There will be no 
impact on cash flows although the presentation of the cash 
flow statement will change significantly. Management is still 
considering the impact of this new standard and is as yet 
unable to quantify its likely impact.

Notes to  
the accounts
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
1  Accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. The Group controls 
an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity.
Acquisitions on or after 1 June 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 June 2010, the Group measures 
goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 z the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 z the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree; plus
 z if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair 
value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 z the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration 
transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement 
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts generally are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated 
with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as 
incurred.
Any deferred or contingent consideration payable is 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the 
contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not 
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent 
consideration are recognised in the income statement. 
On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to 
measure non-controlling interests either at its fair value or 
at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the 
identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
Acquisitions before 1 June 2010
For acquisitions before 1 June 2010, goodwill represents 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase 
gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the 
issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in 
connection with business combinations were capitalised as 
part of the cost of the acquisition.
Contingent consideration on business combinations was 
recognised only to the extent that it could be reliably estimated 
and it was probable that the consideration would be paid. Any 
subsequent changes to the carrying value of the contingent 
consideration were recognised as adjustments to goodwill.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences 
until the date that control ceases.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of 
subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have 
occurred since 1 June 2004, goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the 
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired including 
identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangibles are those 
which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights 
regardless of whether those rights are separable.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 June 2004, goodwill is 
included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under UK GAAP at 31 May 2004 which was 
broadly comparable, save that only separable intangibles were 
recognised and goodwill was amortised. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is 
not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect 
of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the 
investee.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the 
income statement as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on 
development activities is capitalised as “development costs” if 
the product or process is technically and commercially feasible 
and the Group intends, has the technical ability and has 
sufficient resources to complete development, future economic 
benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably 
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its 
development. Development activities involve a plan or design 
for the production of new or substantially improved products or 
processes.

Software costs 
The Group capitalises “software costs” in accordance with 
the criteria of IAS 38. Software costs comprise two elements, 
IT licences for periods of one year or more, and the third 
party and internal employee time costs for internal system 
developments. Capitalised costs are initially measured at cost 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over the licence term or 
the period for which the developed system is expected to be in 
use as a business platform.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, 
direct labour, overhead costs that are directly attributable 
to preparing the asset for its intended use and capitalised 
borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised 
in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised 
development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in 
the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset 
to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure 
on internally generated goodwill, is recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred. 
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic 
lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are 
systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Other intangibles are amortised from the date they are 
available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Acquired customer 
contracts and relationships  – between three and ten years
Software – between one and seven years
Capitalised development costs – between three and ten years
Impairment excluding deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss 
is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is 
impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the 
loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured 
at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest 
rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised 
through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent 
event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the 
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, 
other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible 
assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet 
available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each 
year at the same time. The recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and 
its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating 
unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the 
purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating 
units, (“CGUs”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, 
for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the 
level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated 
to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an 
asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata 
basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in 
prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any 
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. 
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s

carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are set out in note 28 to 
these financial statements.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
in value. To the extent that borrowing costs relate to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, 
borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of that 
asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of 
each part of an item of plant and equipment as follows:
Computer equipment – between thee and five years
Plant and equipment – between thee and five years
Furniture – between thee and five years
Fixtures and fittings – term of the lease
Motor vehicles – four years
Plant and equipment is also tested for impairment whenever 
there is an indication of potential impairment.
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment. 
Investments in property and unlisted shares are carried at cost 
less impairment which is based on the fair value at acquisition.
Inventory
Inventory is held at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the value of goods and services provided 
during the period, excluding VAT and similar taxes. The 
application of this policy in each of the operating segments is 
as follows:
Assurance services
The results of partially completed contracts, whether fixed 
price or on a time and materials basis, are recognised on a 
percentage completion basis according to the number of days 
worked in comparison to the total contracted number of days 
by including the profit or loss earned on work completed to 
the balance sheet date. Provisions are made for any losses 
on uncompleted contracts expected to be incurred after 
the balance sheet date. For certain Assurance services, a 
higher proportion of the total costs can be incurred in the first 
month due to set-up costs . Where this is the case, a greater 
proportion of the associated revenue is also recognised at the 
same time as the costs, with the remainder deferred over the 
life of the contract.
Escrow and website monitoring
Fees are recognised on completion of the services attributable 
to the initial set-up of a new project, contract and also in 
respect of verification services. Maintenance and escrow 
agreement revenue is deferred and released to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the related 
agreement, on the basis that the performance is deemed to fall 
evenly over the contract period.
Domain services
Trademark Clearinghouse (“TMCH”) fees are deferred and 
released to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the life of the related agreement. Agreements are for durations 
of one, three or five years. Domain name registry fees are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the period specified 
in the customer agreement. Revenue from the contracted sale 
of domain names is recognised when the full title and rights 
to the domain name have transferred to the customer. This 
revenue recognition policy applies to the Open Registry Group 
which was disposed of during the financial year.
Sale of products
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the products have passed to the buyer, which 
is considered to be upon delivery under the contractual terms, 
and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. 
Determination and presentation of operating segments
The Group determines and presents operating segments 
based on the information that is provided to the Board, whom 
acts as the Group’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) 
in order to assess performance and to allocate resources. 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that 
engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses 
that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other 
components. An operating segment’s results are reviewed 
regularly by the CODM to make decisions about resources to 
be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
The Group reports its business in two key segments: The 
Escrow division and the Assurance division. Within the Escrow 
division we manage some aspects of the day-to-day business 
on a geographical basis and this allows us to disclose revenue 
and operating profit for those geographies. However, while we 
can manage and disclose some aspects of those as individual 
operating segments, they are all managed under the Escrow 
division’s senior executive team. That team takes the decisions 
on resource allocation, product development, marketing and 
areas for focus and investment. For this reason, the Escrow 
division is regarded as the appropriate reporting segment with 
additional operating segment disclosures presented to give the 
user of the accounts a further level of granularity.

Within the Assurance division, the business has historically 
differentiated between its core cyber security and consulting 
activities on the one hand and on the other its Web 
Performance activity and its Software Testing activity. However, 
similar to Escrow, the different activities came together under 
an Assurance management team for strategic and resource 
allocation decision-making. The new Target Operating Model 
for the Assurance division going forward confirms that 
clustering of activities around a central theme or “golden 
thread” of cyber security.
Individually significant items
The Group separately identifies items as individually significant 
if the item is considered unusual by its nature or scale, and 
is of such significance that separate disclosure is relevant to 
understanding the Group’s financial performance and therefore 
requires separate presentation in the financial statements in 
order to fairly present the financial performance of the Group. 
Such items are referred to as “individually significant items” 
and are described in note 3.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the 
appropriate monthly exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated using the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on 
translation are included in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date. The income statements 
of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the 
weighted average exchange rates for the financial year. 
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of opening net 
assets are taken to the currency translation reserve. They 
are released to the income statement upon disposal of the 
subsidiary to which they relate.
Operating lease payments
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as 
an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the 
lease. 
Employee benefits – defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. 
The assets of the scheme are kept separate from those of 
the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount 
charged as an expense in the income statement represents 
the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the 
accounting period.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to 
be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans 
if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payment transactions
Share based payments in which the Group receives goods 
or services as consideration for its own equity instruments 
are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment 
transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are 
obtained by the Group. They are treated as an adjusting item in 
arriving at the non-GAAP “Adjusted” Metrics.
The grant date fair value of share based payment awards 
granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an 
option valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of awards for which the related service and non-
market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that 
the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on 
the number of awards that do meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For 
share based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, 
the grant date fair value of the share based payment is 
measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for 
differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Share based payment transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or 
other assets that is based on the price of the Group’s equity 
instruments are accounted for as cash-settled share based 
payments. The fair value of the amount payable to employees 
is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase 
in liabilities, over the period in which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured 
at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any 
changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as 
personnel expense in profit or loss.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to 
the employees of a subsidiary it recognises in its individual 
financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in 
that subsidiary equivalent to the equity-settled share based 
payment charge is recognised in respect of that subsidiary in 
its consolidated financial statements with the corresponding 
credit being recognised directly in equity.

Notes to  
the accounts
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2017
1  Accounting policies (continued) 
Interest bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated 
at amortised cost with any difference between cost and 
redemption value being recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable and interest 
receivable on funds invested. Interest income and interest 
payable are recognised in the income statement as they 
accrue, using the effective interest method. Interest is 
capitalised when interest charges are incurred in relation to the 
purchase of capitalised assets. To the extent that borrowing 
costs relate to the acquisition, construction or production of a 
qualifying asset, borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the 
cost of that asset. 
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the 
date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred taxation. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the 
taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The 
following temporary differences are not provided for: the 
initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets 
or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit 
other than in a business combination, and differences relating 
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will 
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will 
be available against which the temporary difference can be 
utilised. 
Intra-group financial instruments
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect 
the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable that the 
Company will be required to make a payment under the 
guarantee.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount 
less impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash in hand 
and deposits repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand form part of the Group’s cash 
management and are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash 
flows. 
Treasury shares
NCC Group plc shares held by the Group are deducted 
from equity as “treasury shares” and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken to reserves. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related 
notes:
Impairment of goodwill
The Group has significant balances relating to goodwill at 
31 May 2017 as a result of acquisitions of businesses. The 
carrying value of goodwill at 31 May 2017 is £198.7m (2016: 
£224.3m) following the impairment recorded during the 
year. Goodwill balances are tested annually for impairment. 
Tests for impairment are primarily based on the calculation 
of a value in use for each cash-generating unit. This involves 
the preparation of discounted cash flow projections, which 
require an estimate of both future operating cash flows and 
an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate. Such estimates are 
inherently subjective and can have a material impact on the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NCC AR2017 proof 8- Back.indd   132 09/08/2017   16:01:52 25546.04    9 August 2017 4:01 PM    Proof Six
result of the impairment test. 
A cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable 
group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups 
of assets. Identification of a CGU does involve judgement. The 
Directors have made judgements in determining the cash-
generating units (“CGUs”) within the Group and in allocating 
goodwill to these CGUs. As a result of the strategic review 
undertaken during the year, management have reconsidered 
the cash-generating units within the Group, this is discussed 
further in note 1 1.
Capitalisation of development costs
Development activities involve a plan or design for the 
production of new or substantially improved products or 
processes. Judgement is required in determining whether the 
project is technically and commercially feasible; estimation 
is required in assessing the future economic benefit. Such 
estimates are inherently subjective and can have a material 
impact on determining the viability of the project and ultimately 
whether the costs should be capitalised.
For projects where development costs have been capitalised, 
impairment assessments require an estimate of both future 
operating cash flows and an appropriate risk adjusted discount 
rate. Such estimates are inherently subjective and can have a 
material impact on the result of the impairment test. 
Business combinations
During the current and prior year the Group has made a 
number of significant acquisitions. The acquisition price in 
some cases includes an element of contingent consideration; 
the assessment of the fair value of the contingent 
consideration requires estimating the fair value based on the 
expected future cash outflow. Such estimates are inherently 
subjective and can have a material impact on the reported 
values. 
For each acquisition, judgement is required in determining 
the separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and 
estimation is used to determine the fair value of the separately 
identifiable assets. Estimation involves the preparation of 
discounted cash flow projections, which require an estimate 
of both future operating cash flows and an appropriate 
risk adjusted discount rate to arrive at the fair value. Such 
estimates are inherently subjective and can have a material 
impact on the reported values.
In addition, the Group has sold its interest in the Open Registry 
Group. An element of the consideration to be received is 
contingent upon the future performance of the business. The 
assessment of the fair value of the contingent consideration 
requires estimating the fair value based on the expected future 
cash inflow. Such estimates are inherently subjective and can 
have a material impact on the reported values.
2  Segmental information
The Group is organised into the following two (2016: three) 
reporting segments, Escrow and Assurance, each of which 
is separately reported. While revenue and profitability are 
monitored by individual business units within these operational 
segments, it is only at the operating segment level that 
resource allocation decisions are made. Performance is 
measured based on segment profit, which comprises segment 
operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets, 
share based payment charges and exceptional items. Interest 
and tax are not allocated to business segments and there are 
no intra-segment sales.

costs relate to fees incurred in relation to the acquisition of Fox-IT Holdings BV.
The adjustment to consideration of a £2.9m charge relates to foreign exchange revaluation differences on the carrying value 
of consideration. In the prior year the £4.7m income relates to the net gains related to the reassessment of the Open Registry 
contingent consideration and an adjustment to the consideration payable for a previous Accumuli plc acquisition.
A goodwill impairment of £54.3m (2016: £1 1.9m) has been recognised in respect of the CGUs for Fox-IT Holdings BV, 
Accumuli plc and Web Performance (note 1 1). The Fox and former Accumuli businesses (the latter now known as MSS) have 
underperformed in the year compared to our original acquisition forecasts and also encountered integration challenges that have 
slowed the pace of commercial leverage of the different new service and product lines across the rest of the Group. In respect of 
Web Performance, revenue generating intangible assets have been slower than originally anticipated to generate revenues and 
the slower ramp-up in revenue has therefore led to the recognition of the impairment.

The Directors have assessed the carrying value of intangible 
assets and concluded that the carrying values of certain 
capitalised development and software costs are impaired (note 
1 1). Accordingly, a write down of £5.7m (2016: £6.8m) has 
been recognised in respect of capitalised development costs 
(£3.2m) and in respect of the .trust domain name (£2.5m). 
In addition, residual Domain Services software with a book 
value of £2.0m has been written off in full. In the prior year, the 
intangible asset write down of £6.8m relates to the impairment 
of capitalised costs for redundant technology.
The Group has incurred restructuring costs of £1.3m (2016: 
£2.6m) relating to the exit payments to the former Chief 
Executive (as shown in the Remuneration Report) and other 
members of senior management, professional fees in relation 
to the Strategic Review and retention bonuses paid to former 
employees of Accumuli plc. As previously reported,  NCC 
Group became responsible for paying these bonuses on 
acquisition of the Accumuli group. In the year to 31 May 2016, 
restructuring costs included Accumuli plc retention bonuses, 
severance costs and other costs associated with the wind 
down of the Domain Services division.
The onerous property lease charge of £1.3m (2016: £nil) is 
in respect of double running costs of empty properties. The 
£1.8m charge for vacation pay relates to previous financial 
periods and this is described in more detail in the Audit 
Committee Report. Of the total charge, £0.5m relates to the 
prior year with the balance relating to prior years up to 31 May 
2015 with no significant charge in any one year. The £0.9m 
(2016: £nil) impairment of fixtures and fittings relates to items 
in the current head office which will be obsolete after the 
relocation later this year.

respect of 2017 were £1.2m (2016: £1.8m). Employer contributions to pensions for Executive Directors for qualifying periods 
were £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the Directors in the period was £0.1m (2016: 
£0.7m). The net value has been calculated by reference to the closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares on the day 
before the date of grant. During the year, 89,804 share options were exercised by Directors (2016: 72,538) with a market value

6  Domain Services 
In June 2016, the Board took the decision to close down the activities of the Domain Services operating segment. During the 
prior year, the development activities of Domain Services were severely curtailed and the assets and business activities were 
either shut down or sold in the current financial year. This included the sale of the Open Registry group of companies comprising 
Open Registry SA, ClearingHouse for Intellectual Property SA, Nexperteam CVBA and Sensirius CVBA to external buyers 
for a combined total consideration of €3.75m in January 2017 , €2.0m receivable in immediate cash and €1.75m as deferred 
consideration, receivable in July 2018 at a fixed interest rate of 4 per cent. A profit on disposal of £1.2m is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within individually significant items (note 3).
The tables below provide an analysis of Domain Services activities for revenue, EBITDA and profit before tax as these are

was based on quoted market prices for the period during which the options were outstanding. The prior year did not treat Domain 
Services as an adjusting item as the decision to exit the business was taken after the end of the financial year. To be consistent 
with the current year, the prior year adjusting items have been amended to include the results of Domain Services. The net impact 
was to increase the prior year Adjusted EPS by 0.4p.

11 Intangible assets (continued)
Cash generating units (CGUs): Goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to CGUs in order to be assessed for potential 
impairment. CGUs are defined by accounting standards as the lowest level of asset groupings that generate separately 
identifiable cash inflows that are not dependent on other CGUs. Following the Strategic Review, the Directors have reconsidered 
the CGUs within the Group. The CGUs and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs is shown in the table below. The table also 
includes the discount rate used to assess the NPV of the future cash flows of each CGU:

Web Performance 2.2 15.2
Accumuli (known internally as MSS) 28.6 15.4
Total Assurance 160.2
Total Group 198.7
In the prior year, the goodwill allocation and pre-tax discount rates (WACC) for each CGU (in brackets) were: Escrow UK £21.2m 
(10.1%), Escrow Europe £6.4m (10.7%), Escrow USA £7 .3m (12.9%), Assurance USA £24.6m (15.0%) and European Security 
Services £164.8m (1 1.2%).
The composition of the MSS business noted above (formerly known as Accumuli) is slightly different from the Accumuli Group 
at acquisition. One part of the Accumuli business, known as RandomStorm, carried on identical activities to some parts of UK 
Security Consulting. Those activities and their cash flows were transferred to UK Security Consulting during the year and are 
no longer separately managed or independent cash flows associated with MSS. Those cash flows and their associated share of 
goodwill is therefore included in the UK Security Consulting CGU.
During the year, the Group acquired Payment Software Company Inc, a global payment and security consulting company, and 
Virtual Security Research LLC (VSR), an information network and application security consulting company. 
When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations. These calculations 
require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections; long-term growth rates; and a pre-tax market discount rate. 
Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s detailed annual operating plan for the forthcoming financial year with assumptions 
applied for expected revenue growth and costs to forecast years two to five which are forecasts which have been approved by the 
Board. The judgement on these assumptions is based on management’s past experience of growth and knowledge of the industry 
sectors and markets. The projections beyond five years are forecast using an estimated long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2016: 
2.5%) which represents management’s best estimate of a long-term annual growth rate in EBITDA. A different set of assumptions 
may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes in the macroeconomic environment.

The discount rates used are based on management’s calculation of the WACC using the capital asset pricing model to calculate 
the cost of equity. Specific rates are used for each CGU in the value in use calculation and the rates reflect management’s 
assessment on the level of relative risk in each respective CGU. The pre-tax discount rates used in the value in use calculations 
are shown above.
The Directors have considered a range of sensitivities. If the discount rates used in each CGU were decreased or increased by  
1 per cent, the total Net Present Value of future cash flows would increase by £105m and decrease by £81m respectively. 
In the specific case of the CGUs where goodwill has been impaired in the current year, or where an impairment would potentially 
arise, the impairment amounts would increase/(decrease) as follows:

16  Acquisitions (continued)
Fox-IT Holdings BV
In the prior year, NCC Group (Solutions) Limited acquired Fox-IT Holdings BV, a company based in the Netherlands. Fox-IT has a 
leading market position in Europe for high-end Cyber Security solutions and is a leading European provider of Advanced Incident 
Response Services. Fox-IT’s activities of Advanced Threat Protection, Threat Intelligence and Web/Mobile Event Analytics, 
High Assurance and Secure Infrastructure provide further depth to NCC Group’s cyber and assurance services and growth

second anniversaries of completion comprising €10.0m cash and €2.5m newly issued NCC Group plc shares each. The first 
deferred payment was paid in November 2016 and the Directors agreed to make this payment fully in cash consideration. 
Accordingly, a payment of €12.5m was made to the former owners.

The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £2.5m (2016: £2.7m) on tax losses as management consider it probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which it can be utilised. The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on 
£6.2m (2016: £5.7m) of tax losses carried forward due to uncertainties over their future recovery.
Included in recognised and unrecognised tax losses are losses of £2.9m that will expire in 2034 (2016: £3.5m). Other losses 
may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £nil (2016: £0.2m) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Fair value of financial instruments
As at 31 May 2017 the Group and Company had no other financial instruments other than those disclosed below. The carrying 
value of contingent consideration on acquisitions, held at the year end is valued using a level 3 valuation method as defined by 
IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement. There have been no transfers between levels in the year. 
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value by level of fair value 
hierarchy: 
 z quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1); 
 z inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and 
 z inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3). 
The loan is held at amortised cost which is considered to equate to fair value. All other assets and liabilities are held at either fair 
value or their carrying value which approximates to fair value.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.

The trade receivables of the Group typically comprise many small amounts due from a large number of customers. The Group’s 
customer base, whilst concentrated largely in the UK, represents a spread of industry sectors. The largest amount due from 
a single customer at the reporting date represented of 8.6 per cent of total Group receivables (2016: 6.4 per cent). All of the 
Group’s cash is held with financial institutions of high credit rating.
The provisions in respect of trade receivables are used to record probable impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that 
no recovery of the amounts owing is possible. If the amount is considered irrecoverable, it is written off against the financial 
asset directly and any provision for impairment is released at the same time. The Group has a dedicated credit control team who 
regularly review customer debt balances to assess the risk of recovery. The allowance is all for debts older than 90 days (2016: 
older than 90 days). The ageing of Group debt and associated impairment loss is reported to the Board on a monthly basis.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risks by regular reviews of forecast and actual cash flows in line with contractual maturities of financial liabilities and 
the Revolving Credit Facility available. Forecast cash flows are reported to the Board on a monthly basis. The following are the

The fair value of services received in return for share options is calculated with reference to the fair value of the award on the 
date of grant. The fair value is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the award, 
adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting. Black-Scholes and Binomial models have been used to calculate the fair 
values of options on their grant date for all options issued after 7 November 2002, which had not vested by 1 January 2005. The 
assumptions used in the model are illustrated in the table below:
