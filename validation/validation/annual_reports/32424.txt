Strategic report
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This year has shown strong performances for the business, in which 
we have reached record highs and have concentrated on delivering 
initiatives to move forward with confidence into 2017 /18.
Chairman’s Statement
Overview of 2016/17 
The financial year ended 31 March 2017 can be 
split into two halves. In the first six months of 
the financial year, the uncertainty surrounding 
the run-up to the Brexit referendum and the 
subsequent challenging markets slowed 
revenue growth. This, coupled with a 
combination of non-recurring employment 
costs and growth-related development costs, 
saw our profitability fall well below our 
expectation. We saw a stronger performance,  
in the last six months, when improved market 
conditions, favourably impacted by the result of 
the US presidential elections, helped increase 
both revenues and profit. 
Importantly, our Assets Under Management 
and Administration, a key metric of 
performance, continue to grow. Whilst we have 
recently experienced the benefits of more 
upbeat market conditions, the full ramifications 
of the negotiations on Brexit, together with the 
uncertainty arising from the outcome of the UK 
general election, have yet to emerge. Therefore, 
we will be monitoring developments closely in 
the interests of both shareholders and clients. 
Dividend 
In recognition of this year’s progress, and 
notwithstanding the need to continue 
monitoring an increasing cost base, the Board  
is recommending a 1.6% increase in the final 
dividend to 1.29 pence per share (2016: 1.27 
pence per share). This increase in the dividend 
reflects the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
long-term prospects and prudent use of 
available reserves. 
Combined with the interim dividend of 
0.58 pence per share (2016: 0.58 pence 
per share), the total dividend for the year 
is 1.87 pence per share (2016: 1.85 pence 
per share), a 1.1 % increase. The final 
dividend will be paid on 15 September 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 September 2017. 
Strategy 
The delivery of high quality personal investment 
advice and strong investment management 
capability remains at the core of our approach. 
As highlighted at the time of the interim results, 
we have sought to refine our client-focused 
strategy during the year to ensure premium 
service and integrity in all that we do for our 
clients. We aim to increase shareholder value  
by growing revenue, improving efficiency and 
continuing to increase our dividend payments. 
We continue to advance the delivery of our 
strategy for growth in a fast-moving sector in 
which the pace of change in regulation and 
technology are a constant. Whilst preserving 
our healthy cash balance as a buffer for 
unforeseen events in these potentially turbulent 
times, we remain committed to providing a 
complete range of services through our core 
business of investment management and 
advice, not only to high net worth and mass 
affluent clients but also to clients with smaller 
portfolios. We also remain committed to our 
financial planning and Wealth Management 
division as we increasingly look to position 
ourselves favourably with intermediary 
professionals and their clients. 
After four years of rapid expansion, including 
the corporate acquisition of Barker Poland Asset 
Management LLP in 2015, we are currently 
concentrating on successfully delivering the 
many continuing initiatives to deliver growth 
and satisfy increasing regulatory obligations. 
The Board is acutely aware of the demands our 
recent expansion has placed on our personnel, 
particularly the financial, compliance and 
operational teams in Romford, where we 
maintain investment and increase resources to 
mitigate the risks associated with growth. 
Culture, governance and the Board 
By setting the right example at the top, the 
Board has prioritised the communication of 
good conduct and the appropriate culture 
across all who represent the Company.  07
Strategic report
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We are even more 
committed now to increasing 
our service proposition 
through greater use of 
technology in a way that  
is relevant to clients, 
intermediaries and our  
own advisers.
We expect all personnel to exemplify good 
culture and behaviour to achieve good 
outcomes for clients and market contacts. 
Those aspects which need to be cascaded down 
throughout the organisation are identified by 
implementing a formal process of measuring 
and reporting against suitable metrics. The 
Executive Directors and senior management, 
through daily contact with employees and 
associates alike, endeavour to demonstrate 
strong leadership and to be inspiring role 
models while providing effective supervision. 
Directors, account executives  
and staff 
After another year of attracting new revenue 
generators to the Group, and absorbing their 
additional investment business through 
transfers of clients and their assets, we would 
like to thank all our fellow Directors, Investment 
Managers and Advisers, and members of our 
operations team for their hard work and 
diligence in assisting in this process. 
The Board and in particular the Executive 
Directors have undergone a year of structural 
change in the governance and oversight of the 
business. We reported last year the newly 
created role of Group Compliance Director into 
which Guy Jackson has made an effective 
contribution since joining in May 2016. After 
managing the York office profitably for over ten 
years, David Hetherton has taken retirement 
from his role as Executive Director, Wealth 
Management, and we wish him well. Last year, 
Robert Elliott advised the Board of his intention 
to retire as a Non-Executive Director and also as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and he will 
not be seeking to be re-elected to the Board at 
the forthcoming AGM. We will still benefit from 
his experience as a business leader and 
Chartered Accountant within our divisions. Clive 
Bouch, whom many colleagues will remember 
as a former partner with Deloitte LLP, has a 
long-standing relationship with the Company 
and we are delighted that he has joined the 
Board to serve as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. His guidance, based on his recent 
relevant Board experience in several sectors of 
financial services, will be an invaluable asset to 
the Group.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
at the South Place Hotel, 3 South Place, London 
EC2M 2AF on 6 September 2017, at 11.00 a.m. 
Looking ahead
In recent years we have achieved substantial 
growth, continuing to refine our strategy and 
business model to make further strides towards 
attaining our long-term strategic goals. We are 
now even more committed to increasing our 
service proposition through greater use of 
technology that is relevant to clients, 
intermediaries and our own advisers. Our 
willingness to innovate beyond our traditional 
business using our stable capital base is well 
established.

Strategic report
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The year to 31 March 2017 saw a rise in annual revenue of 1 2%  
to a record £29.2m and underlying operating profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £1. 14m, an improvement of 75.4% over last year, 
reflecting the continuing strength of our strategy for growth.
CEO’s Statement 
Overview
After a difficult first half, it is pleasing to report 
that the Group saw a rise in annual revenue of 
12% to a record £29.2m for the current full year. 
Profit before tax fell 14.8% to £0.8m from 
£0.94m. However, when adjusted for exceptional 
administrative expenses and the prior year gain 
of £0.94m on the sale of Euroclear shares, there 
was an underlying improvement of 49% to 
£1.16m from £0.78m.
Notwithstanding the improvement, the Board 
and executive management remain focused on 
improving the gross margin, managing the 
administrative cost-base and maintaining 
revenue growth.
The market’s strength since September has 
demonstrated its resilience to the potential 
repercussions of the Brexit vote and also the 
surprise at the Trump victory in the USA. This 
strength, alongside inflows of new assets (being 
mainly client lists acquired during the year) has 
enabled our Assets Under Management and 
Administration (AUMA) to grow by 26.8% to a 
record high £5.2bn, with a corresponding positive 
effect on our portfolio managed revenues in our 
final quarter.
The proportion of less volatile non-broking 
income as a percentage of total income has 
remained steady at 61.7% (2016: 61.8%) and 
cash reserves of £7.69m (2016: £7.20m) have  
also been maintained.
Statement of financial position
As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s financial 
position remains strong with a 6.6% increase 
in the level of net assets to £21.8m (2016: 
£20.5m), including an increase in net cash held  
at the year end date of £7.69m (2016: £7.2m) 
despite higher dividend payments of £716,000 
(2016: £657,000) and acquisition cash 
consideration payments of £1,098,000 
(2016: £823,000).
Operations
Although we have seen an increase in 
administrative expenses a material proportion  
of which relates to the exceptional items and 
development expenses associated with enhanced 
systems and controls for meeting higher client 
service levels and regulatory standards costs  
were strictly monitored and headcount has  
been largely restricted to incoming revenue 
earners, their support teams and administrative 
sections directly affected by our growth.
During the last 18 months our Executive Directors 
and Investment Managers have been heavily 
engaged in a major upgrading of our systems, 
monitoring and record-keeping in order to develop 
our own rising regulatory standards and those seen 
across our sector. This has led to a significant 
redefinition of the way in which we communicate 
with our substantial client base alongside a much 
greater use of technology. We are moving forward 
to complete the hard yards of this exercise 
imminently. The outcome is intended to reinforce 
our current offering to clients by continuing to build 
and maintain a closer and deeper understanding 
of each client’s circumstances and requirements, 
thereby ensuring the suitability of the individual 
service being provided. We are hugely appreciative 
of our clients’ continuing understanding 
throughout this time-consuming but important 
process, which should see a much improved 
premium service delivered to our clients. We firmly 
believe it will underpin our prosperity with a 
stronger foundation to ensure a Company-wide 
emphasis on good client outcomes in a manner 
aligned with our culture. The costs associated with 
these developments and improvements were 
recorded mainly in the prior year and in the first 
half of the current financial year.
Preparations are well underway to meet the 
challenges posed by the UK’s adoption of the 
European Parliament’s MiFID II Directive. 
We continue to fully support and reinforce 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  
on its drive to ensure that advice given to clients 
by our account executives is suitable, 
well-explained and properly recorded.

that the scope for additional expansion 
continues to be a realistic prospect. The 
new and meaningful increase in the annual 
ISA allowance from £15,240 to £20,000 
provides an incentive for clients to continue 
investing into our ISA wrapper, enabling 
income and capital gain to remain tax 
free. The number of new ISA subscriptions 
this year was higher by 9.7%, alongside a 
similarly impressive increase for Junior ISAs 
of 16.8%. AUM within our ISAs soared by 
26% to £764m from last year’s £600m.
The Structured Investments division has 
produced an excellent year of results for investors 
with many ‘kick-out’ style products maturing 
early with healthy gains against a backdrop of 
strong equity market performance. Despite a 
financial year dominated by political uncertainty, 
reinvestment rates amongst investors have 
remained strong. Our competitive range of 
structured investment products continues to 
garner strong support amongst the financial 
adviser community, enabling us to broaden our 
client base and AUM.
In addition, our Alternative Investments 
management team delivered substantial growth 
in revenues and funds under management 
through the Tier 1 (Investor) Visa Investment 
Programme and Short-term Lending (property 
financing) mandates. The equity arbitrage desk 
continues to perform well, delivering even greater 
profitability compared to last year.
Wealth Management
Our Wealth Management division, run from York, 
continues to be driven by a focused management 
team and a highly qualified team of Advisers, 
who provide a committed, quality service to  
a growing client base.
Complementing this division, our Ebor Pensions 
business administers Self Invested Personal 
Pensions (SIPP) and Small Self-Administered 
Schemes (SSAS), along with a small number of 
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes 
(FURBS).
AUMA of the combined divisions within our 
Wealth Management arm increased to £514m 
(2016: £501m). Turnover from Wealth 
Management fell slightly, reflecting the shift 
towards taking lower recurring fees as opposed to 
higher initial revenue, and this has contributed to 
the lower reported result for this segment 
compared to the previous year. However, a 
degree of cost-cutting and growth  
in ongoing activity has led to an anticipated 
improvement in profitability at the start of the 
current calendar year. There has been a pleasing 
continuation of this in the opening weeks of the 
new financial year.
Outlook
In keeping with our plans for expansion, we are 
finalising the move of our London head office to 
new more modern, high quality premises within 
central London before the end of 2017.
Trading activity in the opening weeks of 
the new financial year has continued the 
positive momentum seen in the last quarter 
of the year ended 31 March 2017 and 
your Board correspondingly looks to the 
immediate future with greater optimism, 
albeit tempered by potential political 
challenges and geopolitical headwinds.
Despite the present threat to political stability 
caused by the recent outcome of the UK 
general election and the significant demands 
we face from our continuing regulatory 
initiatives over the next 18 months, it is our 
emphasis on integrity, service and good 
customer outcomes which will drive our 
public profile and competitive positioning 
to deliver underlying growth in the next 
phase of the Group’s development.

Encouragingly, following its acquisition in 
March 2015, Barker Poland Asset Management 
LLP (BPAM) has delivered its second full 
contribution to our results above our 
expectations which has helped our stated 
aim of materially increasing the proportion 
of our revenues earned as fees, rather than 
through transaction-driven commissions. This 
is a key performance indicator reflecting the 
changing shape of the business from traditional 
stockbroking to an increasingly integrated 
investment and wealth management model.
Investment Management
The Group’s Assets Under Management (AUM) 
have grown to record levels. We recognise 
the growing importance of scale, which gives 
clients and market participants a degree of 
reassurance of the security of their assets and 
the strength and stability of the organisation. 
With total Assets Under Management and 
Administration (AUMA) at the year end 
standing at a high of £5.2bn (31 March 
2016: £4.1bn), our target of £5bn AUMA by 
2018 has already been achieved with £10bn 
being a realistic milestone for the future.
Discretionary and Advisory Assets Under 
Management (AUM) at the year end were £3.2bn 
(31 March 2016: £2.3bn). This pleasing increase 
resulted partly from the inflow of AUM from the 
clients of new Advisers and Investment 
Managers, alongside transactional revenue and 
positive investment markets. Commission income 
from broking and investment activity showed a 
strong recovery in the second half of the year, 
after a poor first half that had been negatively 
affected by Brexit. Net investment management 
fees signalled growth on the back of new AUM 
and portfolio values increased by 5.1 % to £8.2m 
(2016: £7.8m).
Gross revenues from the Investment 
Management division increased by 14.4% 
during the period to £27.0m (2016: £23.6m), 
which contributed to this segment’s significantly 
improved reported result compared to 
the previous year. Management believe 
Statement of financial position
As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s financial position remains strong with a 6.6% increase in the level of net assets to £21.8m 
(2016: £20.5m), including an increase in net cash held at the year end date of £7.69m (2016: £7.2m) despite higher dividend 
payments of £716,000 (2016: £657,000) and acquisition cash consideration payments of £1,098,000 (2016: £823,000). 10

Market opportunity
2016/17 year in review 
David Cameron’s announcement of the date 
of the Brexit referendum doused the flames 
of investment opportunity, market activity 
and overseas investment in UK. It allowed the 
fear of volatility to override the enthusiasm 
for sensible investment. The first half of our 
2016/17 financial year reflected the malaise 
that had pervaded markets and the resultant 
level of market activity which was low. 
However, activity picked up towards the end 
of 2016 after Donald Trump emerged as 
the surprise winner of the US Presidential 
election. The markets reacted positively 
as they translated his fiscal stimuli, 
infrastructure investment programmes, 
pro-business stance and decisive approach 
into an enthusiasm for risk assets.
Sterling suffered an immediate and extreme 
fall in the aftermath of the Brexit result to 
$1.30, having mainly traded in the $1.55 to 
$1.45 area, with similar falls against many 
other global currencies. Whilst this provided a 
price stimulus for companies with high levels 
of overseas earnings, it had a negative effect 
on inflation and cost expectations as investors 
operated a cautious and inactive approach.
After an immediate sell-off and recovery 
in the hours after the referendum, the UK 
equity market began a positive march from 
June 2016 to March 2017. The FTSE 100 
climbed from below 6,000 to over 7,400, 
buoyed by the positive effect of weak 
Sterling on foreign earning companies.
Expected increases in interest rates were 
put on hold as soon as the Brexit result was 
given; and shortly after the referendum the 
Bank of England reduced interest rates to 
0.25% and introduced a new quantitative 
easing programme to shore up confidence. 
Although ten-year gilt yields rose off their 
post-Brexit vote lows of 0.51 % (August 
2016), having fallen from 1.60% (April 2016), 
they rose to 1.51 % in January 2017 before 
retreating to March 2017 lows of 1.07%.
In the quarter following the referendum, 
commercial property investment stalled with 
the IPD Index falling over 2% (although this was 
to pick up through the year end and into 2017).
Inflation stayed persistently low at 1.3% in 
September and October 2016, but a recovery 
in energy prices and rising food inflation led 
to a spike in inflation in 2017, resulting in CPIH 
reaching 2.3% in March 2017. Inflation over the 
medium term has been expected to be close 
to the Bank of England’s upper limit of 3% due 
to a buoyant economy, low unemployment, 
imported inflation on the back of weak Sterling, 
as well as the longer-term effects of Brexit.
Our position in the market 
We continue to realise our aim of building 
an integrated Investment Management and 
Wealth Management business for high net 
worth and mass affluent clients from bases in 
London, York, Birmingham and selected regions.
The growth in Assets Under Management 
and Administration (AUMA) in 2016/17 has 
come from new clients attracted through new 
Investment Managers who have joined recently, 
and through the positive performance and 
increasing values of the underlying investments 
themselves. We see continued AUMA growth 
coming from opportunities in changes of 
pensions legislation, from ongoing referrals and 
introductions from clients and intermediaries, 
and from new joiners who bring their clients.
 
We maintain our culture and the appeal of 
independence, flexibility and integrity, alongside 
our Associate model, with a predominant focus 
on achieving the right customer outcomes. We 
compete with our peers and larger institutions 
who aim to direct their clients into services 
that suit those firms’ own corporate needs. 
Larger competitors limit the service that 
they offer to clients in order to simplify their 
offering, at the expense of client choice.
We also seek to develop revenue streams  
that constitute an increasing percentage 
of fees, adding complementary businesses, 
without detracting from investment 
management and wealth management.
The opportunities afforded by the increased 
pension freedom represent a substantial shift 
in the way in which SIPPs and SSASs can be 
viewed and, in particular, the potential for using 
personal pensions in different ways and the 
shift from defined benefit schemes to defined 
contribution schemes (including SIPPs).
The year ahead 
Whilst a high level of uncertainty continues 
to pervade the economic, geopolitical and, 
specifically, UK political status quo, markets 
remain threatened with potential volatility.
Risk assets, which have been bought and 
held by those with cash or with the ability to 
raise finance at the extremely low prevailing 
interest rates, continue to reach recent and 
all-time highs. We continue to believe in the 
importance of dividend income in this low-
interest rate environment, however, some 
equity valuations are being stretched. 
Signals of the beginning of the end of 
European Central Bank stimulus and 
low/negative interest rates have been given. 
In particular, the European economy is 
producing evidence of a stronger recovery 
than in recent years. We expect this to 
continue in the coming year, but note that 
whilst the French political environment has 
become more settled, there are still important 
elections to come in Italy and Germany.
 
The recent election in UK has created 
a much weaker UK government and a 
febrile domestic political atmosphere 
and gives the UK Brexit negotiators a 
challenging future as the timetable for 
working out what Brexit means begins.

Chris Kitchenham, Private Client Director; and  
Mark Rushton, Chief Investment Officer.
The challenges of MiFID II must be met 
by January 2018 and beyond, and Walker 
Crips is working hard to deliver the necessary 
developments in keeping with the timetable. 
The resources that are being, and will be, 
employed to comply with the many and 
varied requirements of the new regulatory 
environment are an essential part of the future 
and will weigh on margins across the industry.
 
The industry’s period of change and 
modernisation in recent years is likely to 
continue, having accelerated over the last  
five years. Challenges will continue from 
more extensive (and expensive) regulatory 
initiatives, changes in retail clients’ attitudes to 
types of service and ongoing pressure on fees, 
changes in demand as a result of demographic 
shifts (an aging population) and transfers of 
assets between generations, with a focus on 
commissions and costs given the benign interest 
rate and lower income investment environment.
With barriers to entry in the traditional broad 
wealth management industry (as opposed 
to robo-advice and challenger entrants with 
extremely clean, simple, focused business lines), 
we expect further consolidation as a result 
of the high level of regulatory requirements 
and technology development costs.

My manager was very 
understanding in letting me finish 
my studies. Everyone here is 
supportive, and that’s what you 
need. The atmosphere makes 
you want to come to work.
Mitchell Martin
Apprentice – Global Custody
8 months’ service 
Mitchell applied to Walker Crips last spring, 
after interviewing it was clear he was 
extremely capable and would be a valuable 
addition but he was encouraged to finish his 
A-levels before joining the Global Custody 
department. Mitchell is keen to keep 
developing, understanding more and taking 
on more responsibility at Walker Crips.
I enjoy working in different 
departments, moving about broadens 
your horizons. The culture here is 
very family-like with a lot of care in 
the Company. If you do good work, 
you know about it straight away.  
It’s very rewarding.
Macoist Grimes
Apprentice – HR  
(Currently seconded to Cashiers)
4 months’ service 
Macoist is our most recent apprentice hire. 
Although he initially joined as an HR 
apprentice, his bright disposition has seen him 
earn secondments across other departments 
and divisions. Macoist sees himself learning 
across more departments to build a future  
at Walker Crips. 
Our people and culture
We are proud of our long history; and our cultural values of 
teamwork, honesty, integrity, fairness and client focus represent 
the Company’s DNA upon which our organisation has flourished. 
People and culture
Our apprenticeship scheme has been very 
successful. We welcome the chance to mentor 
and develop our apprentices through a mutually 
beneficial relationship of learning while working. 
Many of our apprentices stay on with us and 
build a career within the Company. 
It is our policy to ensure that all job applicants 
and employees are treated fairly and on 
merit, regardless of their race, gender, marital 
status, age, disability, religious belief or 
sexual orientation. 34.2% of our employees 
are women, and the Group keenly supports 
women in being promoted to senior roles. 
Walker Crips is proud to have 78 employees who 
have worked with us for over ten years and we 
have 30 employees who have been with us for 
more than 20 years. The experience that these 
staff members provide us with is invaluable.
We understand the importance of giving back 
to the communities who support us throughout 
the UK. Walker Crips employees take part in 
charity sporting events throughout the year, 
including the London Marathon, Great City Race 
and Invesco Perpetual Challenge. Many Walker 
Crips offices sponsor and take part in local 
sporting and charity events.
The Social Responsibility and Safety Committee 
consists of two subsidiary Company Directors 
and other senior managers. The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board on social, 
environmental and community issues. While the 
Group is a financial services organisation whose 
primary responsibility is to maximise investment 
returns to clients, there are non-financial 
considerations which may affect the long-term 
value of the subsidiary companies, and close 
attention is paid to minimising their 
environmental impact. 
The health and safety of our employees is 
critical to our success, and environmental 
considerations go hand in hand with 
maintaining a safe and healthy workplace. 
By participating in the Cycle to Work scheme, 
we enable employees to reduce their 
carbon footprints and improve their overall 
health. Providing a safe and welcoming 
work environment is key to developing 
motivated, healthy and happy personnel.  17

Magi Andrews
Head of ISAs
49 years’ service 
Magi is our longest standing employee, 
joining in 1968 in the typist pool, she has 
worked under four CEOs including Mr Crips. 
Magi developed a love for stocks and shares 
over the years, assisting the dealers actually 
on the floor of the stock exchange and seeing 
the changes to regulation and technology. 
The very first employee to have a computer, 
she initially had to update manual ledgers 
and keep them in a tin box. 18

Key performance indicators
The Group’s strategy continues to deliver results and progress. 
Performance in 2017 is set out below with data from preceding 
years. Year-on-year data is presented on a consistent basis 
providing measurable indicators. The Board will continue to 
monitor these KPIs regularly.
An increase of 75% in Operating Profit before 
Exceptional Items has come from increased 
Revenue from fees and transactions as a result 
of growth in AUMA which has outpaced the 
increase in related costs.
Underlying Revenue growth drove a 9% 
increase in Gross Profit of £ 1.6m.
The increase in New Revenue Generators was 
less than in 2016, in part due to timing with 3 
Investment Managers starting in March 2016. 
The number of new revenue generators in 2015 
was high due to the Barker Poland acquisition 
(involving 6 CF30s).
The non-broking income proportion was similar 
to the previous year, with asset inflow across 
Discretionary, Advisory and Execution Only 
services. Management Fees grew by 5.1 %. 19

TOTAL DIVIDENDS 
(PENCE PER SHARE)
Growth in AUMA has led to an increase in 
Revenue of 12% as a result of increased fees 
and commission income.
Growth of 27% in Total Assets has come from 
inflows of new assets (mainly from new Advisers 
and Investment Managers) plus market 
increases in asset values.
Discretionary and Advisory AUM, taken 
together, grew by 42% from inflows of new 
assets plus market increases in asset values.
Although markets and AUMA growth picked  
up after Brexit and the US election, first half 
2016/17 Transaction Volume was stifled by 
market malaise and low resultant level of 
activity, although it picked up in the second half.
The AUM increases have derived from: 
Administration up 10%; Advisory up 50%;  
and Discretionary up 31 %. Non-Discretionary 
(i.e. Administration and Advisory AUM) taken 
together, grew by 26%.
The rise of 1.1 % in the Total Dividend reflects 
confidence in the Group’s long-term prospects 
and prudent use of available reserves. 20

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks
Risks to the business are reviewed monthly and monitored by the 
Board-appointed Risk Management Committee in conjunction 
with the internal process for management of capital risk (ICAAP). 
They are formally reviewed by the Board at least annually.
Risk Description and how it arises Mitigation Status
Credit/counterparty risk
Client failure  
to settle 
transaction
Risk appetite
Low/Medium
The risk that a client or market counterparty will not 
meet its obligations to the Group in accordance with 
agreed terms resulting in losses.
This risk can arise when a client fails to pay for a 
purchase of shares or to deliver a certificate of 
ownership of a stock which has been sold. Also a 
similar exposure arises if a market maker fails to 
complete the same trade through corresponding 
payment or stock delivery.
 – Daily monitoring of clients’ positions and 
counterparty exposures and individual trade 
limits. Credit assessments of counterparties and 
treasury policy to avoid concentration risk. Credit 
risk assessments of banks and custodians, active 
monitoring of exposures and use of credit 
ratings. Using several banks to hold both clients’ 
and the firm’s money, with levels being 
constantly reviewed.
Conduct risk
Customer 
outcomes
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk that clients or the wider market suffer 
detriment as a result of inappropriate behaviour  
or actions by staff or business partners.
This risk can arise when representatives of the Group 
are not given sufficient training or awareness of the 
highest standards of behaviour central to the core 
services of the Company, being honesty, integrity 
and fairness.
 – Clear and balanced financial promotions, 
suitable investment advice and complaints 
management. Board oversight, development of 
staff and training, strong corporate governance 
with defined roles, ensuring the tone from the 
top sets a fair, positive and ethical culture.
Regulatory risk
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk of failure to comply with new or amended 
regulations incurring fines and causing reputational 
detriment.
Failure by management to recognise the scope and 
impact of new or amended regulations on the 
business model and resources needed to implement 
change.
 – Board oversight, development of staff and 
training, strong corporate governance with 
defined roles, recovery plan, monitoring the 
Group’s performance relative to competitors, 
compliance monitoring programme, regulatory 
development oversight, documented policy and 
procedures and regular contact with regulators. 
Peer comparison and communication, increased 
compliance personnel and early gap analyses 
conducted.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk that the Group is unable to meet its 
payment obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities as they fall due.
This risk can arise in the stockbroking subsidiary 
where large amounts of trade values are being 
settled daily and can lead to a funding requirement 
due to a delay in market delivery or late settlement 
by clients.
 – Contingency funding plan, cash flow forecasting, 
experienced management team monitoring 
settlement performance, maintenance of cash 
surplus buffer, ability to raise an overdraft facility 
and liquid financial trading book can be realised. 
Group entities settle intercompany balances 
regularly and are not reliant on intra Group 
funding. 21

Risk Description and how it arises Mitigation Status
Operational risk
Business disruption
Risk appetite
Low/Medium
The risk that an internal or external event causes 
failure of the core business activities or IT systems 
supporting them.
This risk can arise when the business fails to 
effectively control or administer the operating 
systems at the heart of the business, fails to 
manage its resource requirements properly or 
maintains inadequate security arrangements.
 – Business and information system recovery plans 
are approved, tested and maintained. Data 
incident log records and analyses all unforeseen 
events to prevent recurrence. Insurance cover in 
place for certain causations e.g. financial crime 
and consequential loss.
Cyber fraud
Risk appetite
Low/Medium
The risk of fraudulent action by external parties 
maliciously breaching the Group’s internal 
systems.
This risk can arise from failure to implement 
sufficient controls over security access to all  
IT systems.
 – Senior management oversight, encryption  
and protection software installed, prevention 
procedures, segregation of duties between front 
and back office, system authority and payment 
limits and system access controls and 
heightened employee awareness.
Personnel
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk of losing key staff who are the drivers of 
significant components of the business.
This risk can arise on the failure to reward 
individuals with challenging performance targets 
and competitive levels of financial compensation.
 – Succession and contingency planning, 
appropriate compensation levels and share 
incentive schemes to reward and retain staff. 
Investment in staff through training, key man 
insurance cover and contractual restrictive 
covenants.
Capital adequacy
Capital adequacy
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk that the Group’s business strategy and 
plans for growth are not sustainable on the 
existing regulatory capital base.
This risk can arise when new acquisitions, products 
or initiatives are embarked upon without sufficient 
reference to impact on regulatory capital 
adequacy.
 – Capital adequacy surplus is maintained well in 
excess of regulatory requirements. Material 
surplus cash balances are always carried. 
Ongoing review of regulatory capital through  
an Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process. New initiatives are examined and stress 
tested prior to implementation
Market risk
Market risk
Risk appetite
Zero/Low
The risk of losses rising as a result of exposure  
to market movements in the price of financial 
instruments, including foreign exchange.
This risk can arise when the Group’s proprietary 
trading book positions incur losses on negative 
price movements.
 – Portfolio size and transaction limits are low  
and monitored. Speculative investments are  
not permitted.

Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Introduction to governance
Dear shareholder,
Good corporate governance is critical to the delivery of value to the 
Group’s stakeholders and this section of the Report describes how Walker 
Crips is governed and managed in the context of the principles of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, available to view at www.frc.org.uk.  
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management and 
oversight of the Group and for its long-term success. In particular, the 
Board is responsible for agreeing the Group’s strategy, monitoring financial 
performance, setting and monitoring the Group’s risk appetite and 
maintaining an effective system of internal controls.
The last year has been busy as usual, ensuring that we are up to date 
with industry regulation. I have already referred to the considerable 
effort being made to upgrade our systems in order to serve our clients 
in a complete and professional manner appropriate to their needs and 
investment objectives. This project is approaching completion and the 
positive impact is already being observed by both our advisers and clients.
We continue our focus on culture and behaviour in line with good 
principles of conduct. This followed a review of our risk management 
processes, including the further development and enhancement of our 
conduct risk framework and policy. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
Principles for Businesses remain our most important benchmarks and we 
strive to conduct our business with integrity and put client interests at the 
heart of what we do.
An ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board has been 
conducted as well as its structure, skill sets and experience. We are 
aware of areas where we need to improve and by working together 
we are already dealing with more precise succession planning, better 
quality Board papers produced more timely and improving the metrics 
by which the attainment of good culture is being developed throughout 
the organisation. As a result we strengthened the Board with the formal 
appointment into a newly-created role of Group Compliance Director, Guy 
Jackson, in May 2016. The Nomination Committee was heavily involved 
in the recruitment process and continues to review and plan Board 
succession for the medium and long term. Another key appointment 
to the Board was made on 31 March 2017, when Clive Bouch joined us 
as a Non-Executive Director. He has been formally appointed as Joint 
Chair of the Audit Committee and I look forward to working with him. 
David Hetherton, our Wealth Management Director, chose to take 
retirement in November 2016 and has not been replaced. I can confirm 
that, following formal performance evaluation, all Non-Executive 
Directors being proposed for re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their role.
The Audit Committee, now Joint Chaired by Robert Elliott who will 
not be seeking re-election at the 2017 AGM, meets regularly to 
discuss and review our published results and oversee the internal and 
external audit functions. A formal tendering process was conducted 
before appointing BDO LLP as our new external auditor. Following 
his appointment Clive Bouch now joint-chairs the Audit Committee 
with Robert Elliott and the Committee recently adopted new terms 
of reference in response to the 2016 Corporate Governance Code.
I like to maintain regular contact with the executive team outside of Board 
meetings and I am in regular dialogue with the Chief Executive, who 
updates me with developments on current projects and progress towards 
our objectives. I am also in regular discussion regarding Board issues with 
our Senior Independent Director, Martin Wright, as well as Lim Hua Min 
who resides in Singapore but has held a stake in the business for over  
30 years.
We are aware of Lord Davies’s recommendations on Board diversity 
including the key issue of gender diversity, particularly given our present 
Board composition. There are no barriers to talented individuals 
succeeding at the highest levels and the Board recognises the governance 
benefits that breadth of perspective and diverse traits deliver. We look 
forward to the emergence of talented individuals as executives both 
internally and through recruitment with our whole-hearted 
encouragement supported by accessible training and regular open 
communication between Directors and staff.

Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Report by the Directors on corporate governance matters
year ended 31 March 201 7
The Company is committed to the Principles of Good Governance set  
out in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Further 
explanation of how the principles have been applied is also set out below 
and, in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Remuneration 
Committee Report.
Compliance
The Company has been in compliance with the code’s principles and 
provisions throughout the year ended 31 March 2017 except as follows:
– Contrary to code B.1.1 the Senior Independent Director, Martin Wright, 
Audit Committee Chair Robert Elliott and our Singapore-based Non-
Executive Director, Lim Hua Min, who is also a significant shareholder, 
have all served on the Board for more than nine years. The Board 
reviews their contribution every year and is satisfied that they remain 
independent. This is evidenced by the objectivity and critical detachment 
that underpin their continued provision of constructive challenge and 
support to Executive Directors and management. They will, therefore, be 
put forward for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 6 September 
2017. Robert Elliott will not be seeking re-election at the AGM.
– Contrary to code D1.1, the Group did not, during the year, have malus 
and clawback provisions in place to be able to recover or withhold 
variable pay from/to the Executive Directors. This is being addressed.
– Contrary to code D.2.1, the Company Chairman (D. M. Gelber) Chaired 
the Remuneration Committee during the year because he is considered 
to be independent by the Board for the reasons stated above. 
A new version of the Code was introduced in April 2016 which will apply  
to the Group for the first time next year in the year ended 31 March 2018, 
at which time the Board will report on its implementation of the  
new responsibilities.
The Board of Directors
At year end, the Board of Directors consisted of four Executive and five 
Non-Executive Directors. The full Board meets regularly and at least every 
alternate month throughout the year.
The Board is provided with appropriate information to enable it to 
discharge its duties. It has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it  
for decision making, including, inter alia, developing the future direction  
of the Group’s business, agreeing policies and procedures, approving  
material transactions, business risk reviews, budgets and borrowings and 
monitoring the Group’s progress. Decisions delegated to management are 
not specifically listed but are limited to £50,000 in value where financial 
commitments are necessary in the daily course of business and £100,000 
in value for investment and capital projects. All subsidiary Boards of 
Directors and other management or operational committees include at 
least one Main Board Executive Director who serves as the link between 
operational decision making between the Board and management.
Certain Executive and Non-Executive Directors of the plc Company are 
also Directors of the Boards of the main operating subsidiary companies 
which conduct regulated investment business, thereby playing an active 
part in decision making and control at an operating level.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive, occupied by D. M. Gelber and 
R. A. FitzGerald FCA respectively, are separated and the Board includes 
Non-Executive Directors, of whom D. M. Gelber, R. A. Elliott FCA, C. Bouch 
FCA and M. J. Wright are regarded as independent, and the remaining 
Directors believe they provide an objective viewpoint.
The Board has three established Committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee, the voting 
members of which are comprised entirely of Non-Executive Directors. 
Executive Directors are invited to attend these meetings where 
appropriate for them to do so.
All Non-Executive Directors have received a formal personal evaluation 
and are being offered for re-election at the Annual General Meeting where 
appropriate.
A satisfactory evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, its Directors 
and Committees has been conducted and reviewed. This entailed an 
evaluation of the summarised results of a widely used questionnaire.
During the year, the Directors, in their capacity as members of the  
Board/appropriate Committee, attended the following number

Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Report by the Directors on corporate governance matters continued
year ended 31 March 201 7
The Company’s procedures for ‘whistleblowing’, whereby colleagues may 
confidentially raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or other issues, has been reviewed by the Board and 
made available to approved persons and staff.
M. J. Wright, the Senior Independent Director, has served on the Board for 
21 years since the Company’s full listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
The firm of solicitors of which he is a Partner, Charles Russell Speechlys, 
provided legal services to the Group during the year totalling £324,000 
(2016: £60,000). The Board values his continuing contribution, particularly 
on legal matters, and has also determined that he is independent and that 
it would like him to continue.
Nomination Committee
The Committee consists of D. M. Gelber, M. J. Wright, R. A. Elliott,  
C. Bouch (from 31 March 2017) and H. M. Lim. It considers and makes 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors. When 
considering possible candidates, the Committee evaluates their skill, 
knowledge, experience and, in the case of Non-Executives, their 
independence and other commitments. The structure of the Board and  
its collective experience and skill set are assessed on the appointment  
or departure of any Director.
Two Nomination Committee meetings were held during the year to  
discuss succession planning for the main Board and key senior positions  
at operating subsidiary level.
During the year, David Hetherton resigned from his role of Wealth 
Management Director on 18 November 2016. Guy Jackson joined the 
Board on 21 September 2016 as Group Compliance Director and 
Company Secretary. Clive Bouch joined the Board on 31 March 2017 as  
a Non-Executive Director and was subsequently appointed Joint Chair of 
the Audit Committee on 18 May 2017. Neither an external search 
consultancy, nor open advertising, was used in the appointment process 
for Clive Bouch, who has been known to the Board and whose experience 
closely matched the requirements of the role.
Audit Committee
During the prior year, the Audit Committee consisted of M. J. Wright, D. M. 
Gelber, C. Bouch (from 31 March 2017) and R. A. Elliott FCA. R. A. Elliott 
Chairs the Committee and C. Bouch was appointed Joint Chair from 
18 May 2017. The Committee’s terms of reference include reviewing the 
scope and findings of the external audit, reviewing the plan and findings 
of the internal audit function, assessing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control procedures and the reporting of results. The 
Chief Executive attends these meetings by invitation a does G. B. Jackson,  
who as Company Secretary is also Secretary to this Committee.
During the prior year, the Company completed a competitive tender 
process for the position of statutory auditor at the point at which the  
five-year period of the present Audit Partner at Deloitte LLP had been 
completed, following which BDO LLP was appointed as auditors for  
the Group.
The Company’s internal and external auditors and the Executive Directors 
may, and do, attend Committee meetings by invitation. The Committee 
has a discussion with the external auditor at least once a year without 
Executive Directors being present, to ensure that there are no unresolved 
issues of concern. The Audit Committee met four times during the course 
of the year. The external auditor discloses the level of fees received in 
respect of the various services provided to the firm in addition to the 
statutory audit and has confirmed to the Audit Committee that the  
level of non-audit fees has not affected its independence. The Audit 
Committee’s policy is to use the most appropriate advisers for non-audit 
work, taking account of the need to maintain independence.
In August 2010, the Audit Committee approved the outsourcing of the 
Internal Audit function to a leading firm of auditors, Smith & Williamson, 
whose experience in the financial services sector provides the Board with 
additional assurance that an adequate control framework is in place.
As explained further in the Audit Committee report, the external and 
internal audit functions are monitored for effectiveness.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of M. J. Wright, H. M. Lim, C. Bouch 
FCA (from 31 March 2017) and its Chairman, D. M. Gelber. The Committee 
is responsible for agreeing the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and other key personnel of the Company. The full Board is responsible  
for agreeing the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive attends certain parts of meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee by invitation. Further details of the Company’s policies on 
Directors’ remuneration, service contracts and share options are given  
in the Remuneration Committee report.
A staff profit share scheme which enables all employees to share directly 
in the prosperity of the Group has been in operation for several years. 
Profit before tax for the current year eligible for this bonus calculation has 
fallen below the minimum threshold and, accordingly, an amount of £nil 
(2016: £nil) has been allocated to the scheme for the year being reported. 
An employee Share Incentive Plan incentivises employees to join with the 
Company in making regular joint purchases of shares in the Company to 
be held in trust for a minimum of three years. The Share Incentive Plan 
replaces the employee share option schemes previously in operation. 
Non-Executive Directors
Re-election of Non-Executive Directors is subject to shareholders’ approval. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors, 
as well as the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting.
Executive Directors
Executive Directors have service contracts of varying lengths, but 
maximum compensation for loss of office is limited to 12 months’ salary in 
all instances.
Directors’ emoluments are disclosed in the Remuneration Committee 
report.
Risk Management Committee and Compliance Committee
The Risk Management Committee ensures that all new initiatives, projects 
and products are formally assessed and evaluated for the degree of risk 
exposure and regulatory capital impact to the Group, so enabling strategies 
for the elimination, mitigation or avoidance of risk to be formulated.
The Compliance Committee ensures the Group is in compliance with all 
the regulatory and legal matters and to consider rule updates and 
guidance notes from the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Services 
Ombudsman, Financial Services Compensation Scheme and other UK 
regulatory bodies.
The Management Committee 
The Stockbroking Board has appointed a Management Committee to 
assist in the day-to-day management of the stockbroking subsidiary. 
The Committee is, inter alia, responsible for developing plans for 
implementing the strategy and advising on the allocation of personnel 
and capital resources.  29
Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communications with 
shareholders. The Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s Statements in this 
Report and Accounts include a detailed review of the business and future 
developments.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with  
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. The 
Chairman aims to ensure that all of the Directors are available at Annual 
General Meetings to answer questions. The proxy votes cast on each 
resolution proposed at general meetings are disclosed at those meetings.
Shareholders wishing to make contact directly with the Board should email 
the Company Secretary, Guy Jackson.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and has formalised the process for its review of internal 
control (including financial, operational and compliance controls as well as 
risk management) and defining the scope and frequency of reports to be 
received, both by the Board and the Audit Committee. There is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Company and Group. This process has been in operation 
throughout the year ended 31 March 2017 and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts and is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and the Board is satisfied that it accords with the relevant guidance. Due 
to the relatively small size of the Company and Group there is a simple 
organisational and reporting structure. Financial results and other 
information are regularly reported to the Board throughout the year. 
Operations are monitored closely.
The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s system 
of internal control and consider that the controls and procedures 
established are appropriate for the Company and Group. However, any 
system of internal control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group operates under a system of internal financial controls which 
have been developed and refined to meet its current and future needs. 
These include but are not limited to:
• the organisational structure and the delegation of authorities to 
operational management;
• procedures for the review and authorisation of capital investments;
• budgets and forecasts which are reviewed by the Board;
• the reporting and review of financial results and other operating 
information;
• accounting and financial reporting policies to ensure the consistency, 
integrity and accuracy of the Group’s accounting records; and
• financial and operating controls and procedures which are in place 
throughout the organisation and monitored through various means 
including routine and special reviews by the internal auditor. 
Going concern
The Group continues to maintain a robust financial position. Having 
conducted detailed cash flow and working capital projections and 
appropriate stress-testing on liquidity, profitability and regulatory capital, 
taking account of possible adverse changes in trading performance, the 
Board is satisfied the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
adequately; and that it will be able to operate within the level of its current 
financing arrangements and regulatory capital limits imposed by our 
regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Accordingly, the Board 
continues to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the outlook of the Company over a longer 
period than the 12 months required by the ‘Going concern’ statement in 
accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.
The assessment relied on the latest annual budget; the Group’s  
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP); and evaluation of 
the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance or solvency.
As a matter of good practice, and as part of the ICAAP required by the 
FCA, the firm performs a variety of stress tests. Two Group stress tests are 
performed through discussions with senior management, after considering 
the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. The stress points 
included the impact on revenues of a severe fall in global markets and 
the loss of major clients, two exposures prevalent in the financial sector
The stress tests enable the Board to:
• model a variety of external and internal events that impact the 
Budget, identifying the potential impact of stress events on income, 
costs, cash flow and capital; and
• assess the effectiveness of any management actions that may be 
taken to mitigate the impact of the stress events.
A reverse stress test allows the Board to assess scenarios and 
circumstances that would render its business model unviable,  
thereby identifying potential business vulnerabilities and ensuring the 
development of potential mitigating actions and invocation of  
recovery plans.
Following the assessment of the above, the Board concluded that the 
viability statement should cover a period of three years. Whilst the 
Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over  
a longer period, this period has been chosen because a three-year time 
horizon has a much greater degree of certainty, given the cyclical nature 
of the Group’s commission-based revenue stream and thus provides the 
basis for a more appropriate longer-term outlook.
Taking account of the Group’s current position and principal risks and the 
Board’s assessment of the Company’s prospects, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a period of at least 
three years. 30

Composition and constitution
The Board through its Nomination Committee reviews the composition of 
the Audit Committee (the Committee). New appointments are made by 
the Board based upon the recommendations of the Nomination 
Committee following consultation with the Committee Chairman.
After many years service as Director and Chair of the Committee, Robert 
Elliott has decided to step down from the Board at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. Until this date he will continue as Joint Chair of 
the Committee with Clive Bouch, who was appointed to the Board and the 
Committee on 31 March 2017. Clive was invited to attend several of the 
Committee meetings prior to his appointment as part of a consultancy 
engagement to assist the Committee in updating its terms of reference.
The Committee will comprise at least two independent Non-Executive 
Directors with appropriate experience. The current members of the 
Committee are the independent Non-Executive Directors Robert Elliott, 
David Gelber, Martin Wright and Clive Bouch.
The Board is satisfied that both Robert Elliott and Clive Bouch, being 
Chartered Accountants, have relevant financial experience and 
competence in accounting and/or auditing and that all members are 
financially literate and have experience of corporate financial matters. The 
Board is also satisfied that the experience of the members as a whole 
means the Committee has competence relevant to the sectors in which 
the Group operates.
David Gelber and Martin Wright have been Non-Executive Directors since 
2007 and 1996 respectively. Notwithstanding these tenures, for the 
reasons explained on page 27, the Board considers them to remain 
independent. David also Chairs the Board, but given the relatively small 
size of the Group and particularly his extensive broking and financial 
services experience, the Nominations Committee remains of the view it is 
appropriate that in accordance with C.3.1 of the 2014 Code he should 
continue as member of the Audit Committee.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference, which have been reviewed and 
updated during the year, are available on the Company’s website at 
www.wcgplc.co.uk.
Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the:
a. integrity and quality of financial reporting and disclosure;
b. selection and application of accounting policies and practices;
c. adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management systems and 
internal control environment;
d. Group’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements relevant to 
financial reporting and accounting;
e. appointment/reappointment, independence and performance of the 
external auditor, including the quality and effectiveness of the external 
audit;
f. integrity of significant financial returns to regulators;
g. effectiveness of internal audit;
h. arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other matters, and
i. other issues the Board may request the Committee’s opinion on.
Meetings
There were four formal meetings of the Audit Committee during 2016/17 
(four in 2015/16). The Committee members’ meeting attendances are set 
out in the Report by the Directors on corporate governance matters on 
page 27.
Audit Committee report
year ended 31 March 201 7
The Committee maintains a formal agenda of items that are to be 
considered at each Committee meeting and within the annual audit cycle, 
to ensure that its work is in line with the requirements of the 2014 Code 
and all areas of its remit are addressed. The items to be reviewed are 
agreed by the Committee Chairman on behalf of his fellow members. 
Each member has the right to require reports on additional matters of 
interest.
The Company Secretary, who is also the Compliance Director, acts as the 
Secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director normally attend Committee 
meetings. At the Committee’s request, other senior management are 
invited to present reports as relevant to enable the Committee to 
discharge its duties. The internal and external auditors are both invited to 
and do attend all meetings.
Committee activities
The work of the Committee during the year to 31 March 2017, in addition 
to evaluating the effectiveness of its own performance, fell into three 
main areas:
1. Accounting and financial reporting
The Committee reviewed the:
a.  annual and interim financial statements;
b.  significant financial reporting policy disclosures and judgements;
c.  the appropriateness of the preparation of the financial statements on 
a going concern basis;
d. long-term viability statement prior to Board approval; and 
e.  Annual Report to consider whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides information relevant to 
shareholders’ assessment of the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
2. Internal controls
The Committee:
a.  monitored the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls by reference to the ICAAP, summaries of business risk 
and mitigating controls, and reports and presentations from internal 
audit, external audit, other subject matter specialists and heads of 
compliance and risk;
b.  assessed the scope and effectiveness of the systems established to 
identify, manage, and monitor financial and non-financial risk;
c. reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing policy and conduct risk framework 
and policy;
d.  monitored and reviewed the plans, work, resources and effectiveness 
of the internal audit function together with its recommendations and 
management’s responses to its proposals;
e. challenged management on the effectiveness of controls over 
spreadsheets used in the financial and regulatory reporting processes; 
and
f.  reviewed actions taken in response to reports on internal controls in 
order to address any significant weaknesses identified, with particular 
focus during the year on conduct risk and protection of client assets.  31

Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3. External audit
The Committee:
a.  oversaw the appointment of BDO LLP (BDO) as auditor following the 
competitive tender process conducted in the prior year;
b.  reviewed the audit approach, scope of work to be carried out and audit 
findings;
c.  reviewed the auditor’s independence and objectivity;
d. considered the effectiveness of the external audit; and
e. considered the findings of the FRC’s report on its audit quality 
inspection of BDO.
External auditor
BDO was appointed at the AGM held on 3 August 2016 following a 
competitive tender. The Committee intend to conduct an audit tender 
process again before the tenth anniversary of BDO’s appointment.
BDO reports to the Committee on its actions taken to comply with 
professional and regulatory requirements to ensure its independence. 
Since year end, the Committee is in the process of updating its policy for 
the engagement of external auditors to perform non-audit work. The 
updated policy will set out more rigorous controls to ensure the external 
auditor’s independence is not impaired and will be published on the 
Company’s website www.wcgplc.co.uk. BDO also provides reports to the 
Financial Conduct Authority in respect of client assets and is engaged to 
undertake an AAF 01/06 review, being an assurance report on internal 
controls of the Group as a service organisation. BDO is best placed to 
perform this work in view of their independence, competencies and 
knowledge acquired through the external audit engagement and resulting 
efficiencies. No other services have been provided. Details of external 
audit and non-audit fees are disclosed in Note 10 on page 66 of the notes 
to the financial statements.
The performance of the external auditor has been monitored through  
a qualitative assessment of the services provided and takes account of 
feedback received from management. BDO’s knowledge of our sector, 
quality and experience of the individuals assigned, and effectiveness of 
communication are taken into account. As part of the Committee’s 
deliberations on audit quality and effectiveness, the co-Chairs of the 
Committee meet with the external audit partner to discuss this important 
matter and share feedback. The Committee is satisfied that the external 
audit process has operated effectively during BDO’s first year. 
The Committee reviews specific reports and best practice suggestions 
presented by the external auditor. The Committee discusses and acts 
upon the external auditor’s comments relating to internal financial control 
and on the preparation of the financial statements. The Committee 
reports any issues directly to the Board after each meeting. The 
Committee also meets with the external auditor without management 
being present at least once a year. The statutory audits have not resulted 
in any significant control issues that would require material adjustment to 
the accounts. 
Internal audit
The provision of internal audit activities is outsourced to Smith & 
Williamson LLP (S&W).
The internal audit function reports directly to the Committee. The internal 
audit plan and scope of work is reviewed and approved by the Committee 
each year after being appraised by management. The annual budget is 
agreed between the Committee Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
having regard to the planned scope of work.
The internal audit reports and its proposals are presented to the 
Committee. Management’s comments are tabulated and suggested 
actions debated. Issues arising are followed through.
During the year, internal audit carried out reviews of procedures around 
conduct risk, regional offices, reputational risk and fraud risk. The focus of 
internal audit in the coming year is the effectiveness of governance and 
Committee structures, data security and integrity of regulatory returns.
The Committee also monitors any other services that S&W provide to 
ensure the integrity and independence of the Group’s third line of defence 
is not compromised. During the year the only additional services S&W 
provided related to advice in respect of certain disclosures in the financial 
statements, the accounting treatment of new initiatives and the impact of 
recent changes in accounting guidance or standards.
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the internal audit service 
provided by S&W. The particular focus is on competence and capabilities, 
subject matter expertise, timely reporting and the quality of communication 
and recommendations. S&W also perform a self-appraisal, which is 
discussed with the Committee. The Committee is satisfied with the service 
provided by S&W and will continue with the arrangements. Areas of focus 
for the coming year will be more timely and executive summary reporting 
and improved communication of the scope of work undertaken.
Going concern and longer-term viability statement
Disclosures regarding the adoption of the going concern basis of 
financial statement preparation and the Directors’ viability statement 
are found on pages 29 and 63. In considering these disclosures 
the Committee reviewed the projections for the forthcoming year, 
current business performance against those projections, the stress 
scenarios set out in the Group’s ICAAP, current financial resources 
and capital expenditure plans. Specifically in respect of the viability 
statement, the Committee challenged the reasons for the period 
adopted and the consideration given to any key assumptions 
and dependencies. The Committee noted in particular that:
• the Group is following a conservative growth strategy;
• the payment of an interim and final dividend from the Group’s surplus 
cash resources and distributable reserves has been and continues to be 
a key financial objective of the Board;
• 86% of the Group’s financial resources at 31 March 2017 are held in 
cash or cash equivalents and there are no material restrictions on 
accessing or utilising required liquidity throughout the Group, including 
for the proposed final dividend in respect of the year;
• the Group’s regulatory capital at 31 March 2017 was 202% of its 
regulatory capital requirement and all regulated entities within the 
Group held capital in excess of their solo regulatory requirements;
• the Group had no structural debt obligations or critical dependencies 
on overdraft working capital funding;
• ICAAP stress scenarios demonstrate management actions to mitigate 
the impact of significant sensitivities such as the loss of key revenue 
producers, significant falls in markets, a large rogue trade, an 
operational failure, losses from fraud or cyber attack. In certain cases a 
key impact in such stress situations is the potential reduction or 
elimination of dividend payments;
• management have a reasonable basis to conclude any obligation to 
HMRC as provided for and disclosed in Note 25 on page 75 will be 
recovered in full from Liontrust Asset Management plc;
• financial commitment and estimated future cash consideration 
obligations as disclosed in Notes 30, 32 and 35 on page 77 are planned 
for; and
• management’s assessment of the contingent liability disclosed in 
Note 32 and 35 on page 77 is that no obligation will arise. 32
Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
In recent years the Group has reported significant non-recurring costs and there will be expenditures in 2017/18 relating to transitional office moving 
costs, such as new decoration, fitting out and void space. Notwithstanding the continuing incidence of such costs, executive management and the Board 
project positive cash flows and emphasise efficiency and cost management within the Group’s strategic initiatives.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
The main areas considered by the Committee are set out below:
Audit Committee report continued
year ended 31 March 201 7
Matter considered Action
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Consolidated Statement Of Financial Position includes goodwill of  
£4.4m and client lists of £8.3m. These balances arise on business 
combinations or hiring of individuals or teams of investment managers.
The goodwill arose on, and has been allocated to, the acquisitions of 
London York (£2.9m) and Barker Poland Asset Management (£1.49m), 
which continue as identifiable cash-generating units (CGUs). The year-end 
unamortised value of client lists attributed to these CGUs are £nil and 
£2.8m respectively, with the remaining balance being attributable to 
individuals or teams of investment managers hired.
Management assess any impairment of goodwill by comparing the book 
value of assets attributable to the CGUs to the higher of their fair value 
less cost to sell or value-in-use. The Committee reviewed management’s 
papers supporting the conclusion there was no impairment, with particular 
challenge regarding the assumptions used and adequacy of the 
disclosures (see Note 15 to the financial statements on page 68).
The values attributed to client lists are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives, being periods between 3 and 20 years. Management assess 
any further indicators of impairment by reference to the continuing value 
of Assets Under Management and Administration, peer comparisons, the 
loss of senior investment managers, the loss rate of clients, and other 
causes of possible outflows. The Committee reviewed management’s 
supporting papers in respect of indicators of impairment and amortisation 
periods and as there have been no impairment triggers identified, 
no impairment review of these intangible assets is required.
BDO’s findings were also discussed and considered by the Committee in 
drawing its conclusions on the appropriateness of judgements in this area 
and associated disclosures in the financial statements.
HMRC liability re: payments to former fund managers
As disclosed in previous interim and annual reports, HMRC assessed the 
Company as liable for Income Tax, National Insurance and interest in 
respect of payments made by the purchaser of Walker Crips Asset 
Managers Limited following its sale in 2012. Under the Sale and Purchase 
Agreement the purchaser and/or fund managers were considered liable for 
any such obligations. Previously this has been disclosed as a contingent 
liability, but in these financial statements full provision for the total 
estimated amounts due to HMRC of £1.7m has been made (see Note 25 
on page 75), together with recognition of an asset for the recovery the 
same amount from the purchaser included in other debtors as this is 
considered virtually certain.
The Committee reviewed the paper prepared by management in support 
of the accounting treatment. This included the rationale for the quantum 
of the liability and the reasons why the recovery from the purchaser is 
assessed as virtually certain, the latter reflecting written confirmation from 
the purchaser that they will meet the liability that falls due in full and 
assessment of their credit standing.
The Committee noted that the obligation and recovery are netted within 
administrative expenses rather than being recorded gross as expenditure 
and income respectively and challenged whether this is appropriate. 
Management considered that such grossing up would not provide 
meaningful information and that the matter is adequately disclosed in the 
financial statements. This explanation was accepted.
BDO’s findings were also discussed and considered by the Committee in 
drawing its conclusions on the appropriateness of judgements in this area 
and associated disclosures in the financial statements. 33

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Matter considered Action
Provisions
The financial statements include provisions and liabilities in respect of 
dilapidations (£0.24m), outstanding legal cases, customer complaints or 
claims (£0.33m), and future consideration expected to be payable in 
respect of acquisitions (£2.5m). These amounts are estimated with 
varying degrees of certainty.
The Committee considered management’s determination of the amounts 
provided and concluded they were reasonable based upon the 
information available.
The Committee also considered BDO’s findings when concluding on the 
reasonableness of the provisions and related disclosures.
Exceptional items
The Group classifies certain material items as exceptional to allow a 
clearer understanding of the underlying trading performance of the 
business. In 2016/17 these amounted to charges of £0.36m and in 
2015/16 they were £0.778m (see Note 7 on page 65).
The Committee requested, received and considered explanations from 
management setting out the description of items that would fall to be 
exceptional (see page 61), the reasons for the treatment of each item 
classified as exceptional in the year, and the proposed disclosures, 
including the reconciliations provided in the CEO’s Statement on page 8, 
challenging these to ensure clarity.
The Committee also discussed and considered the findings of BDO on the 
classification of disclosure of items identified as exceptional.
Performance evaluation
The Committee evaluates its performance each year, with the most recent one conducted in June 2017. The evaluation is based upon feedback to a 
questionnaire distributed to Committee members and others who regularly attend Committee meetings. The results are used to form the forward-looking 
agenda. The latest review concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively with certain opportunities for improvement, which will be 
implemented. These include more formal performance appraisals for all Committee members, more timely provision of papers for pre-meeting 
preparation and improved prioritisation of agenda items.

Remuneration report – introduction
This is the Remuneration Committee report for the year ended 31 March 
2017. It sets out the remuneration policy and remuneration details for 
both the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of the Company. It has 
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008  
as amended in August 2013 (referred to below as Schedule 8).
The report is split into three main areas:
• the statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  
set out opposite;
• the Annual report; and
• the Policy report.
The Annual report on remuneration provides details on remuneration in 
the period. The Policy report was approved by the shareholders at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting for a period of three years and is therefore 
now being put to the shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
A resolution to approve the Annual report on remuneration will also be put 
to this year’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 September 2017.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditor to report to the 
shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to 
state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 8. The parts of 
the Annual report on remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated 
in that report. The statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Policy report are not subject to audit.
Annual statement from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
This has been a further year of consolidation for the Group, with our focus 
remaining upon the implementation of the strategy to create a full service 
investment and wealth management group. Our senior management 
team has remained stable and basic salaries were increased marginally. 
Directors’ bonuses have been paid to certain Directors based on Group  
or divisional profitability, as set out on page 35.
Although various existing practices have been codified, no material 
remuneration policy changes were made in the year to 31 March 2017.  
As noted last year, having made significant progress in implementing 
Group strategy to restore profitability and refocus the Group, the 
Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Company’s remuneration 
arrangements to ensure that it maintains appropriate measures and 
processes for annual and long-term incentives.
This led to a new Directors’ remuneration policy that was developed by 
the Remuneration Committee which envisaged the introduction of a Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for certain members of the Executive team. No 
final decision has been taken on this aspect and we continue to consult 
with key shareholders.

Based on the Group’s results and profitability, the Committee has awarded discretionary annual bonuses payable in cash to the Executive Directors, 
including an adjustment of £326 relating to the prior year bonus paid to David Hetherton.
Outstanding share awards
There were no share options outstanding and not vested at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
All employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the SIP following three months of service. Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to 
a maximum of 10% of their gross salary in regular monthly payments (being not less than £10 and not greater than £150) to acquire Ordinary Shares in 
the Company (Partnership Shares). Partnership Shares are acquired monthly. For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one matching 
share. All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market by the Trustees and it is the intention of the Board to continue 
this policy in the year to March 2018.
Share schemes under which no awards were made in 2017
Awards under the 2006 Share Option Scheme have been historically granted to Directors; but the scheme has expired and no awards are outstanding for 
future vesting. Awards have not been made under the Scheme since 2006.

There have been no disclosable payments made to Directors after they have left office during the year.
Loss of office payments

The table above shows the movement in salary and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to 
that of the average employee. The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that the comparison of basic salary provides a more appropriate 
reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of 
employees. More junior staff receive a base salary and, in some cases, pension contributions. As such a comparison of the movement in benefits for the 
Chief Executive and the average employee was not considered to be meaningful and has not been included.
Performance graph
The graph below shows a comparison between the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance compared with the companies in the FTSE 
Small Cap Index. The graph compares the value, at 31 March 2017, of £100 invested in Walker Crips Group plc on 31 March 2009 with the value of £100 
invested over the same period in the FTSE Small Cap Index. This Index has been chosen to give a comparison with the average returns that shareholders 
could have received by investing in a range of other small UK public companies.
After the sale of our asset management and corporate finance subsidiaries in 2012 and 2013 respectively, the Group has gradually expanded and has 
reshaped the business model into two core profitable divisions.

Remuneration Committee governance
The Remuneration Committee is governed by formal terms of reference agreed by the Board. The terms of reference were reviewed during the year to 
ensure they continued to accurately reflect the remit of the Committee. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be viewed on the 
Company’s website. All of the Committee members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The members of the Committee during the last financial year and their attendance at the meetings of the Committee are shown in the Report by the 
Directors on corporate governance matters.
None of the Remuneration Committee members has any personal financial interests (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross 
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Remuneration Committee determines the individual remuneration packages of each 
Executive Director. The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation and assists the Committee in its deliberations, except when issues relating to his 
own remuneration are discussed. No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee can call for external reports and 
assistance. Independent legal advice may be sought by the Committee as required.
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy for senior employees below the Board, as well as the policy on pay and conditions of employees 
throughout the Group. These are considered when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration.
During the period, the Committee met twice and a number of issues were considered and discussed, including but not limited to:
• remuneration policy for Executive Directors, including structure and performance criteria for the annual divisional and bonus pool arrangements;
• determination of remuneration;
• approval of compensation arrangements;
• determination of annual incentive payable to Executive Directors in respect of the year to 31 March 2017;
• oversight of remuneration arrangements for senior Executives;
• review of the Company’s Pillar 3 remuneration disclosures; and
• review of the Committee’s terms of reference.
External directorships
None of the Executive Directors held external directorships during the current and prior year.
How the remuneration policy will be applied for the year from 1 April 2017 onwards
The base salary review in 2017 resulted in a decision to award no increase to the salaries of the Executives.

Directors’ remuneration policy report – to be approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM
This Directors’ remuneration policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 6 September 2017 and,  
if approved, will be effective from that date.
Scope
• The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) determines the Group’s policy on the Board Chairman’s Director fees and the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and other members of executive management including employees designated as code staff under the FCA remuneration Code. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Group’s website.
Fees policy for the Board Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors
The Board as a whole will determine the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, with Non-Executive Directors exempting themselves from 
discussions and voting.
The Committee takes into account the following objectives in determining the Directors’ remuneration policy 
• This policy has been designed to support the delivery of WCG strategic business objectives and corporate values, by attracting, retaining and 
motivating talented Directors and senior management of the calibre to manage the business successfully
• To reward and motivate good and above average performance
• To comply with the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code
Key principles
• To adopt a structure of fixed and variable remuneration that will take account of Group performance and will motivate Directors and staff to develop 
and expand the business responsibly
• To avoid creating incentives for excessive risk taking that exceeds tolerated risk levels of WCG or its risk appetite
• To adopt only incentive plans that align with the Group’s business strategy
• To make proportionate fixed and variable awards that are governed by this policy which should not prevent WCG from meeting its capital 
requirements and consolidating its capital base
• To ensure that all types of remuneration arrangement operated by WCG outlined in this policy are regularly reviewed
• Where appropriate to reward exceptional contribution with specific arrangements
• To apply consistency with the general remuneration culture prevalent throughout the Group
• To ensure that WCG does not pay variable remuneration through vehicles that facilitate avoidance of local regulation
The following tables summarise the components and policy for Directors’ remuneration packages.

Remuneration Committee discretion
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives payable, the Committee has 
certain operational discretions available that can be exercised in relation to Executive Directors’ remuneration including, but not limited to:
• amending performance conditions following a major corporate event or in circumstances in which the Committee considers that the impact of 
external economic influences is such that the original metrics and/or targets are no longer appropriate or where there is other political uncertainty 
having a significant impact on the business environment to ensure a fair and consistent assessment of performance;
• deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award;
• determining whether a leaver is a ‘good leaver’; and
• specific bonuses may be agreed with Executive Directors consistent with the key principles.
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the next Directors’ remuneration report.
Notes to the future policy table
Changes from previous approved policy
The following changes have been made from the policy previously approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
• Introduction of malus and clawback provisions to be applied to remuneration at the discretion of the Committee.
Differences in remuneration for Executive Directors compared to other employees
The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Company as a whole.
The Group applies a consistent remuneration philosophy for employees at all levels.
Fixed pay components for all employees, including specifically for new appointments and promotions to new positions, are benchmarked against relevant 
market comparators and the Committee takes account of the aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees when determining increases in 
fixed pay for Directors. Pension contributions are applicable on the same basis to all employees. All employees are eligible for performance-related annual 
bonus derived from a bonus pool linked to Group profitability. Certain senior employees (other than the Executive Directors) may become eligible to 
receive LTIP awards. 
Benchmarking
The Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors. Comparisons are made with 
other FTSE-listed companies of similar size and business profile. Practices in the private client investment management sector, and other related sectors, 
are also considered. Benchmark data is used by the Committee as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individual’s role and experience, 
and the relative size of the company and personal performance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.
Performance conditions and targets
The Remuneration Committee selects the performance metric of profitability because it encourages Executives to drive business strategy. 
Performance scenarios
Remuneration Committee report continued
year ended 31 March 201 7 43
Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Assumptions
Fixed pay is based on salary and benefits received in the 2017 financial year.
As there is no maximum or target bonus, we have taken the average of the bonuses paid to each Director over the last five years (or his tenure if shorter) 
for the on-target value and the highest bonus paid to each Director over that period as the maximum.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee will regularly compare the Group’s Directors’ remuneration policy with shareholder guidelines and takes account of the results of 
shareholder votes on remuneration. 
If any material changes to the remuneration policy are contemplated, the Committee Chairman will consult with major shareholders about these  
in advance. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report are provided in the Annual report on remuneration section 
of the Directors’ remuneration report. If there is a significant vote against any remuneration resolution, the Committee will endeavour to understand the 
reasons for the lack of support and to address shareholders’ concerns.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Group does not operate formal employee consultation on remuneration. However, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Group’s 
remuneration policies to their line managers or the Human Resources department. The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s 
remuneration policy in recruiting, retaining, engaging and motivating employees. 
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group, as this would prevent it from 
recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
External Non-Executive Director positions
Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and 
experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Company’s business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the 
individual’s ability to perform his duties for the Company. 
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Company’s business, any fees received are remitted to the Company. 
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Group’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. The Remuneration Committee is conscious of the importance of not paying more than is 
necessary to secure the best candidate. However, there may be circumstances in which a higher salary than that of the incumbent needs to be offered to 
attract a new Director into a role. As noted above, the annual bonus is discretionary and there is no maximum variable pay.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and 
shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive 
Director. This may involve the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. In considering any such payments the Committee would take account 
of the amount of remuneration foregone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration foregone. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these. 
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as 
relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may be permitted to 
continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders. 
For external and internal appointments, the Company may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts, letters of appointment and loss of office payments
Service contracts normally continue until the Director’s agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. The service contracts contain 
provision for early termination. The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’ notice periods to be limited to six months by either party. The incumbent 
CEO, Rodney FitzGerald, has a notice period of 12 months.
If the employing Company wrongfully terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the 
contract, the Executive Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to six or the agreed term of months’ total fixed pay (i.e. salary and benefits). 
Where an Executive Director is considered by the Committee to be a ‘good leaver’, circumstances in which the individual leaves because of retirement, 
redundancy, ill-health, death or disability, or otherwise at the Committee’s discretion, the Committee may consider a discretionary award of annual 
variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Company, although not 
for the period of any notice or ‘garden leave’.
In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no enhancement to these terms. 44

Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors’ remuneration policy includes any arrangements entered with a Director before 28 June 2012 that is unchanged 
since that date. Any other remuneration or termination payments made to a Director during the currency of this policy will be consistent with the terms of 
this policy. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the implementation section of this report as they arise.

Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in Note 26. The 
Company has one class of Ordinary Share which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the 
Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of 
the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
Where shares have been issued as consideration for new clients to 
investment advisers upon commencement with the Company, these 
shares are restricted from sale for periods of four to six years.
Voting rights of shares held by the Trustees of the Company’s Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) are not exercised unless the Trustee is directed to vote 
by the employee SIP participant.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles 
themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
Brief biographies of the Directors eligible and standing for election at the 
Annual General Meeting are set out on pages 24 and 25.
Ethical responsibility
Our clients specify any ethical preferences that they have when we 
construct their investment portfolios or make individual recommendations. 
We actively support the professional institutes and trade associations of 
which we are members to promote a strong ethical code of conduct.
Employment policy
It is the Group’s policy to give appropriate consideration to applications  
for employment from disabled persons, having proper regard to their 
particular aptitudes. For the purposes of training, career development and 
promotion, disabled staff, including any who become disabled in the course 
of their employment, are treated on equal terms with other employees.

Health and safety policy
The Board has a policy of adopting procedures, appropriate to its 
activities, to monitor, maintain and, where relevant, improve health and 
safety standards to safeguard the Group’s staff.
None of the Company’s activities involve any significant health and safety 
risks. During the year there were no injuries, illnesses or dangerous 
occurrences which needed to be reported under the Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995.
Eligible employees can benefit from the Group’s permanent health 
insurance scheme in the event of long-term illness preventing them from 
carrying out their function.
Insurance and indemnification of Directors
The Company has put in place insurance to cover its Directors and officers 
which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against any of them. 
In addition, the Company’s Articles of Association provide for the ability of 
the Company to grant qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as 
defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) for the benefit of the 
Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or 
have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers or office. 
Ordinary and special business
Resolutions will be placed before the Annual General Meeting to confer 
authority on the Company to allot equity securities of up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £933,070 and to authorise and empower the 
Company to allot equity securities.
The Companies Act 2006 permits a public company to purchase its own 
shares in accordance with powers contained in its Articles of Association 
and with the authority of a resolution of shareholders. The Directors 
believe that the Company should be authorised to take advantage of 
these provisions and, therefore, pursuant to the power contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, it is intended to propose a special 
resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to confer authority 
on the Company to purchase up to a maximum in aggregate of 10% of 
the Ordinary Shares of 6
2
/3 pence each in the share capital of the 
Company at a price or prices which will not be less than 6
2
/3 pence and 
which will not be more than 5% above the average of the middle market 
quotation derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for 
the ten business days before the relevant purchase is made.
The authority was given at the last Annual General Meeting of the 
Company for a period expiring at the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting. It is the Directors’ intention that a resolution for its 
renewal will be proposed at each succeeding Annual General Meeting. 
The Directors will only make use of the authority when satisfied that it is in 
the interest of the Company to do so. Shareholders should note that any 
Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company will either be cancelled and 
the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will accordingly be reduced or will 
be held as treasury shares.

Corporate governance
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and have 
elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the profit or loss for the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether the financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed 
in the preparation of the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business; 
and 
• prepare a Directors’ report, a Strategic report and Directors’ 
remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the 
financial statements are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with 
legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to 
the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

• The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted

true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
and loss of the Group.
• The Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and

Our opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union; 
 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice); and 
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What our opinion covers
We have audited the financial statements of Walker Crips Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2017, which comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of financial position, the Consolidated and Parent 
statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated statement of cash flows, the Parent Company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(FRC’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our assessment of and response to the risks of material misstatement and overview of the scope of our audit.
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Our Group audit approach was developed by obtaining an understanding of the Group’s activities, the key functions undertaken on behalf of the Board 
by management and the overall control environment. We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at the Group’s three main locations 
being London, Romford and York which were subject to a full scope audit. These locations represent the principal business units and account for all of the 
Group’s net assets, revenues and profit before tax. They also provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatements noted below.
Based on this understanding we assessed those aspects of the Group’s transactions and balances which were most likely to give rise to a material 
misstatement. We tailored our audit approach to address the specific risks in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. We detail below the risks which we considered to have the greatest 
effect on the overall audit strategy including the allocation of resources in the audit, and our audit response. The Audit Committee’s consideration of 
these risks is set out on page 32.
Risk description How our audit addressed the risk
Revenue recognition 
The Group’s revenue is made up of two distinct components, 
broking income and non-broking income.
Revenue recognition is considered to be a significant audit risk 
as it is a key driver of shareholder return to investors and there is 
judgement over the accrual or deferral of revenue, the 
treatment of performance measures and at the point at which 
it is probable that the revenue will be realised. 
We responded to this risk by performing a range of tests of detail covering all 
revenue streams. 
In particular, our audit testing included:
 – cut-off testing on stockbroking commission and investment management fees 
around the year end; 
 – recalculating a sample of management and performance fees, including 
accrued fees, based on underlying contracts, the value of Assets Under 
Management as agreed to third-party sources and tracing this sample through 
to invoice and bank receipt; and 
 – agreeing a sample of fees to invoice and bank receipts. 51

Risk description How our audit addressed the risk
Recognition and impairment of client lists intangible
Acquired client lists of £8,294,000 (2016: £7,992,000) are 
capitalised on the basis of the expected net discounted future 
cash flows over the life of the client list. 
Judgement is exercised in determining whether the 
consideration paid in respect of acquiring the client lists meets 
the criteria for capitalisation and if so, then the appropriate 
period for the capitalised costs to be amortised over. 
Judgement is also exercised in determining the underlying 
assumptions used in the impairment review.
These risks are explained further in Note 3 Key Sources of 
estimation uncertainty and in the disclosures in Note 16. 
In respect of acquired lists in the year we examined a sample of purchase 
agreements associated with the acquisition of the client lists to assess whether 
these costs met the IAS 18 capitalisation criteria.
Management have completed an assessment on each intangible at the year end 
which involved undertaking a review for indicators of impairments. 
We challenged this assessment by undertaking the following tests:
 – We compared the Useful Economic Life (UEL) of the intangibles against the 
actual client attrition rates. 
 – We challenged managements assessment of indicators of impairment by 
comparing to AUM and revenue generated from the intangible asset. 
Provisions for client claims and regulatory reviews 
Provisions are made for client claims based on management’s 
assessment of the likelihood of success of individual cases 
whilst taking into consideration factors such as the level of 
insurance cover and the progress of any claims referred to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service.
The provisions amounted to £328,000 (2016: £212,000) and 
are disclosed in Note 25. 
We obtained management’s analysis of claims and agreed this to the relevant 
correspondence and to the complaints register.
We also:
 – reviewed correspondence from the Group’s legal advisers where applicable; 
 – reviewed the level of insurance coverage in place and correspondence with 
brokers or underwriters; and
 – reviewed the accuracy of the provisioning basis in prior years.
In respect of the ongoing regulatory review we have challenged management’s 
assessment in respect of provisions for costs associated with these reviews.
Carrying value and impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill of £4,388,000 (2016: £4,388,000) relates to the 
Group’s Wealth Management division and the acquisition of 
Barker Poland Asset Management LLP. Judgement is exercised 
in determining the underlying assumptions used in the 
impairment review; the assumptions include the discount rate, 
operating margin and growth rate, which gives rise to the risk of 
material misstatement in the carrying value of goodwill.
These risks are explained further in Note 3 Key sources of 
estimation uncertainty and in the disclosures in Note 15.
We challenged management’s assessment of goodwill and the related impairment 
reviews by undertaking the following procedures: 
 – Reviewed the assumptions used in calculations. In particular the discount rate 
used to discount expected future cash flows. 
 – Performed sensitivity analysis using a range of acceptable discount factors. The 
discount rate used is a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the cash flows, we benchmarked individual components of the 
WACC to current market rates. 
 – Corroborated the calculations to forecasts, which we have examined as part of 
the going concern review, to check for consistency.
 – Compared cash-generating units results against forecasts made in the prior year.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the 
financial statements. We define planning materiality as the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic 
decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use 
to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality measure Purpose Basis and key considerations Quantum (£)
Financial statement materiality Assessing whether the financial statements as a whole 
present a true and fair view
Based on 5% of pre-tax profits 40,000
It is appropriate to set financial statement materiality for the Parent Company and the other components at a lower level than Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1,000, as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  52

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Statement regarding the Directors’ assessment of principal risks, going concern and longer-term viability of the Company
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 – the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; or
 – the Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any material disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatement in the Strategic report and Directors’ report.
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or 
 – is otherwise misleading
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the parts of the Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10 R(2). The Listing Rules also require that 
we review the Directors’ statements set out on page 31 regarding going concern and longer-term viability.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Notes to the accounts
year ended 31 March 2017
1. General information
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU). The Company financial statements are presented on pages 78 to 88.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical costs basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial 
statements.
Standards and interpretations affecting the reported results or the financial position
In the current year, no standards or interpretations, new or revised, have been adopted that have had a significant impact on the amounts reported in the 
financial statements.
Future new standards and interpretations
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 April 2016 and have 
not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. 
The effective dates of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are not until 2018, 2018 and 2019 respectively; the Group has decided not to implement these 
standards early.
In the current year, no standards or interpretations, new or revised, have been adopted that have had a significant impact on the amounts reported in the 
financial statements. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The Group has not adopted 
this standard early.
IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial assets and the timing and extent of credit provisioning. Although the Group has not 
quantified the impact of adopting the standard, it has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact, based on the profile of its financial 
instruments as at the balance sheet date.
Classification of financial assets 
The basis classification for financial assets under IFRS 9 is different from that under IAS 39. Financial assets will be classified into one of three categories: 
amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The held to maturity, loans and 
receivables and available-for-sale categories available under IAS 39 have been removed. In addition transfers between categories are different under 
IFRS 9. 
The Group does not expect the new classification bases to have a material impact on its financial assets. Those currently carried at amortised cost will 
continue to be classifies as such. 
Classification of financial liabilities 
The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains unchanged from that under IAS 39. The two categories are amortised cost or 
FVTPL (either designated as such, or held for trading).
The Group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and does not anticipate doing so. Therefore, under IFRS 9, the 
Group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The Group has not adopted 
this standard early.
IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers. Although the Group has not quantified the impact of adopting the 
standard, it has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact, based on its existing revenue streams. 
Net fee and commission income 
The Group charges initial fees in relation to certain business activities. Under IFRS 15, the Group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the 
work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and therefore fulfils any performance obligation(s). If so, then these fees can be 
recognised when charged, if not then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided. 
The Group does not expect this change to result in a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Client relationship intangibles 
Where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts, such costs are capitalised and amortised, where 
they are separable, reliably measurable and expected to be recovered, under IAS 18. 59
Financial statements
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. General information continued
IFRS 15 reinforces this view, stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover 
those costs. 
Therefore, the Group does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles. 
Transition
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending March 2019 using the retrospective approach.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU and the Group does not plan 
to adopt this standard early. 
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or financial leases. The Group will be required to recognise all leased with a term 
of more than 12 months as a right-of-use lease asset on its balance sheet; the Group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to 
make future lease payments. 
Although the Group has not quantified the impact of adopting the standard, it has conducted an initial assessment of the potential impact, based on its 
existing lease contracts.
Transition 
Definition of a lease
On a transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose whether to 
 – apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts; or 
 – apply a practical expedient approach and retain previous assessments of contracts which contain a lease obligation.
The Group intends to apply the practical expedient. 
Retrospective approach 
As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a:
 – retrospective approach; or
 – modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients. 
The Group is assessing the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts.
Potential impact
The Group’s total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The lease assets will be depreciated over the 
shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term. The lease liability will be reduced by lease payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability 
over the lease term.
On the Group’s statement of comprehensive income, the profile of lease costs will be front-loaded, at least individually, as the interest charge is higher in 
the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds. The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged.
In addition to the above impacts, recognition of lease assets will increase the Group’s regulatory capital requirement.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up 
to 31 March each year. 
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its powers over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained and no longer consolidated from 
the date that control ceases; their results are in the consolidated financial statements up to the date that control ceases. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, 
at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. 60
Financial statements
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Interests in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; that is 
when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements 
under the equity method.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed in future periods.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
(a) Client lists
Client lists are recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably 
whilst the risk and rewards have also transferred into the Group’s ownership.
Intangible assets classified as client lists are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to 
acquire funds by adding teams of investment managers.
Acquired client lists and businesses generating revenue from clients and investment managers are capitalised based on the expected future cash flows  
to be generated over the lives of the assets, discounted at an appropriate discount rate. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
expected useful lives of 3 to 20 years. The amortisation period and amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at least each  
financial year end.
Amortisation of intangible fixed assets is included within Administrative expenses – other in the consolidated income statement.
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
(b) Unit Trust Management Contracts
Acquired Unit Trust Management Contracts are capitalised as intangible assets based on an estimate of the expected future cash flows that those 
contracts will generate over their useful lives of ten years. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Own shares held
Own shares consist of treasury shares which are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for 
the sale of treasury shares is also recognised in equity with any difference being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised on sale of 
treasury shares.
Shares to be issued 
Shares to be issued represent the Group’s best estimate of the Ordinary Shares in the Group which are likely to be issued, following business combinations 
or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Group’s shares. Where shares are due to be issued within a year, the sum 
is included in current liabilities. Shares to be issued are dependent on the achievement of pre-defined targets and are treated as a liability until they are 
allotted and issued, at which time they are reclassified within equity. The Group had recognised as a liability the sum which has been issued and allotted 
to personnel associated with the Group in order to meet contractual commitments given as part of the recent expansion of its client base.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at a fair value of the consideration or receivable and represents gross commissions, interest receivable and fees in the course of 
ordinary investment business, net of discounts, VAT and sales related taxes. Gross commissions on stockbroking activities are recognised on those 
transactions whose bargain date falls within the financial year. Interest is recognised as it accrues in respect of the financial management year. Fees 
earned from managing various types of client portfolios, in the Investment Management division, are accrued evenly over the period to which they relate. 
Fees in respect of financial services activities in the Wealth Management division are accrued evenly over the period to which they relate. Fees earned 
from structured investments are recognised on the date the underlying security of the structured investment is traded. Dividend income is recognised 
when received.
Operating expenses and other charges are provided for in full up to the statement of financial position date on an accruals basis.

Exceptional items
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group identifies certain items of pre-tax income and expenditure and discloses them 
separately in the Consolidated income statement. Such items would include:
1. profits or losses on disposal, closure or impairment of assets or businesses;
2. corporate transaction and restructuring costs;
3. changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; and
4. non-recurring items considered individually for classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature or size.
The separate disclosure of these items allows a clearer understanding of the Group’s trading performance on a consistent and comparable basis, together 
with an understanding of the effect of non-recurring or large individual transactions upon the overall profitability of the Group.
The exceptional items arising in 2015/16 and 2016/17 are explained in Note 7 on page 65 and all fall under category 4 above. The related tax effect is also 
quantified and disclosed in Note 12 on page 67.
Deferred income
Income received from clients in respect of future periods to the transaction or reporting date are classified as deferred income within creditors until such time 
as value has been received by the client. 
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the 
presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) 
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the re-translation of monetary items, are included in the consolidated income 
statement for the period.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset (or 
group of related assets) is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If the estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to 
its estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment
Fixtures and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment. Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method on the following bases:
Computer hardware 33
1
/3% p.a. on cost
Computer software Between 20% and 33
1
/3% p.a. on cost
Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease
Furniture and equipment 33
1
/3% p.a. on cost
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in income. The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income. The residual values and estimated useful life of items within property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at least at each financial year end. Any shortfalls in carrying value are impaired immediately through profit or loss.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited directly to the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 62

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are predominantly settled within normal market cycles. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs, or at 
fair value, depending on the nature of the instrument held.
The Group’s policy is to de-recognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. 
The Group also de-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire. Where the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group will de-recognise the financial asset where it is deemed that the Group 
has not retained control of the financial asset.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Where securities 
are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value for the period are recognised through other comprehensive income until 
sold. Depending on the nature of the instrument held, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised 
in other comprehensive income, until the security is de-recognised, disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a 
known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is 
any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised and measured at fair value.
Bank overdrafts
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts are recorded at an amount equal to the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis in 
profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle 
that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial 
position date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Long-term liabilities – deferred cash consideration 
Amounts payable to personnel under recruitment contracts in respect of the client relationships, which transfer to the Group, are treated as long-term 
liabilities if the due date for payment of cash consideration is beyond the period of one year after the year end date. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and other personnel. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest and adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension schemes for selected employees. The contribution rate is based on annual salary and the 
amount is charged to the income statement on an accrual basis.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis. Benefits 
received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Dividends paid
The Group strives to pay consistent rising dividends annually to shareholders taking into account the need to reinvest cash into resources and personnel in 
order to maintain growth, deliver the implementation of its strategies, preserve appropriate levels of liquid resources and maintain sufficient headroom 
above its regulatory capital requirements. 
Impairment of non-financial items 
Costs incurred to acquire and bring to use non-financial assets are capitalised and amortised through profit or loss over their expected useful lives 
(three to five years).
Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position has been rigorously assessed.
In addition, Note 24 to the financial statements includes details of risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital.
The Group has healthy financial resources together with a long established, proven and tested business model. As a consequence, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current difficult climate.
After conducting enquiries, the Directors believe that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
3. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgements
Impairment of goodwill – estimation and judgement
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated. The fair value less costs to sell involves estimation of values based on the application of earnings multiples and 
comparison to similar transactions. The value-in-use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and apply a discount rate in order to calculate present value. The assumptions used and inputs involve judgements and create 
estimation uncertainty. These assumptions have been stress-tested as described in Note 15. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date 
was £4.4m (2016: £4.4m) as shown in Note 15.
Other intangible assets – judgement
Acquired client lists are capitalised based on current fair values. During the year the Company acquired several investment managers and the business of 
their clients. When the Group purchases client relationships from other corporate entities, a judgement is made as to whether the transaction should be 
accounted for as a business combination, or a separate purchase of intangible assets. In making this judgement, the Group assesses the acquiree against 
the definition of a business in IFRS 3. Payments to newly recruited investment managers are capitalised when they are judged to be made for the 
acquisition of client relationship intangibles. The useful lives are estimated by assessing the historic rates of client retention, the ages and succession 
plans of the investment managers who manage the clients and the contractual incentives of the investment managers. The Directors conduct a review  
of indicators of impairment and also consider a life of up to 20 years to be both appropriate and in line with peers.

5. Segmental analysis 
For segmental reporting purposes, the Group currently has two operating segments, Investment Management, being portfolio-based transaction 
execution and investment advice, and Wealth Management, being financial planning and pension advice. Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and 
liabilities are not considered to be allocable accurately, or fairly, under any known basis of allocation and are therefore disclosed separately.
The Investment Management division activities focus predominantly on investment management of various types of portfolios and asset classes.  
The Wealth Management division provides advisory and administrative services to clients in relation to their financial planning, life insurance, inheritance 
tax and pension arrangements. These divisions, both of which conduct business in the UK only, are the basis on which the Group reports its primary 
segment information.  64

Asset Management plc (Liontrust) in April 2012. As explained in Note 25, under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, this amount will be met by Liontrust by 
way of reimbursement under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Therefore a corresponding credit for the same amount has also been

14. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share for continuing operations is based on the post-tax profit for the financial year of £ 608,000 (2016: £795,000) 
and on 38,974,002 (2016: 37,678,525) Ordinary Shares of 6

 pence, being the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
The effect of options granted would be to reduce the reported earnings per share. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on 38,974,002 
(2016: 37,678,525) Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of 
potential Ordinary Shares.
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:

15. Goodwill continued
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination or intangible asset. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
London York CGU 2,901 2,901
BPAM CGU 1,487 1,487
4,388 4,388
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have first been determined based upon value-in-use calculations, which are based on discounted five year cash 
flow projections and terminal values. The key assumptions for these calculations are a pre-tax discount rate of 12%, terminal growth rates of 2.5% and 
the expected changes to revenues and costs during the five year projection period. The pre-tax discount rate is determined by management based on 
current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the CGUs. The terminal growth rate is determined by management based on 
assessment of past experience and future expectations, in light of anticipated market and economic conditions. Based upon the value-in-use calculations 
there was headroom of £3.2m. The base value-in-use cash flows were stress tested for an increase in discount rates and a 20% fall in net inflows. 
The discount rate would need to increase to 18.1 % for the London York CGU and 13.2% for Barker Poland Asset Management LLP (BPAM) for the 
recoverable amounts to equal the respective carrying values. The 20% fall in net inflows gives rise to a potential impairment of £130,000 and headroom 
of £57,000 respectively for the London York and BPAM CGUs.
 
Management also estimate the fair values less cost to sell for each CGU using average price earnings ratios, observed from publicly quoted shares in similar 
businesses, discounted for illiquidity and applied to historic earnings. The valuation ranges determined exceeded those using the value-in-use valuation 
approach.
Based upon the above assessments management has concluded there is no impairment to goodwill.

Financial assets held for trading
Fair value (Level 1) 1,086 1,237
Financial assets held for trading represent investments in equity securities and collectives that present the Group with opportunity for return through 
dividend income, interest and trading gains. The fair values of these securities are based on quoted market prices.
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 
based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The trading 
investments fall within this category;
 – Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The Group does not hold financial instruments in this category; and
 – Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). The Group’s available-for-sale investments fall within this category.
Further IFRS 13 disclosures have not been presented here as the balance represents 0.095% (2016: 0.094%) of total assets.
There were no transfers of investments between any of the Levels of hierarchy during the year.

Financial risk management
Procedures and controls are in place to identify, assess and ultimately control the financial risks faced by the Group arising from its use of financial 
instruments. Steps are taken to mitigate identified risks with established and effective procedures and controls, efficient systems and the adequate 
training of staff.
The Group’s risk appetite, along with the procedures and controls mentioned above, are laid out in the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process document prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The overall risk appetite for the Group is considered by management to be low, despite operating in a marketplace where financial risk is inherent in the 
core businesses of investment management and financial services.

24. Financial instruments and risk profile continued
The Group considers its financial risks arising from its use of financial instruments to fall into three main categories:
(i) credit risk;
(ii) liquidity risk; and
(iii) market risk.
Financial risk management is a central part of the organisation’s strategic management which recognises that an effective risk management programme 
can increase a business’ chances of success and reduce the possibility of failure. Continual assessment, monitoring and updating of procedures and 
benchmarks are all essential parts of the Group’s risk management strategy.
(i) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables or pledged collateral which is the risk that a client, market counterparty or 
recognised stock exchange will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Significant changes in the economy or a particular sector could result in losses 
that are different from those that the Group has provided for at the year-end date.
The Board is responsible for oversight of the Group’s credit risk. The Group accepts a limited exposure to credit risk but aims to mitigate and minimise the 
risk through various methods.
Trade receivables (includes settlement balances)
Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment of cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a 
security or receipt of cash. Settlement balances arise with clients, market counterparties and recognised stock exchanges.
In the vast majority of cases, control of the stock purchased will remain with the Group until client monetary balances are fully settled.
Where there is an absence of securities collateral, clients are usually required to hold sufficient funds in their managed deposit account prior to the trade 
being conducted. Holding significant amounts of client money helps the Group to manage credit risks arising with clients. Many of our clients also hold 
significant amounts of stock and other securities in our nominee subsidiary company, providing additional security should a specific transaction fail to be 
settled and the proceeds of such securities disposed of can be used to settle all outstanding obligations.
In addition, the client side of settlement balances are normally fully guaranteed by our commission-sharing approved persons who conduct transactions 
and manage the relationships with our mutual clients.
Exposures to market counterparties also arise in the settlement of trades or when collateral is placed with them to cover open trading positions. Market 
counterparties are usually other FCA-regulated firms and are considered creditworthy, some reliance being placed on the fact that other regulated firms 
would be required to meet the stringent capital adequacy requirements of the FCA.

financial position. 74

24. Financial instruments and risk profile continued
Concentration of credit risk
In addition, daily risk management procedures to actively monitor disproportionately large trades by a customer or market counterparty are in place.  
The financial standing, pattern of trading, type and size of security or instrument traded are amongst the factors taken into consideration.
(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due.
Historically, sufficient underlying cash has been prevalent in the business for many years as the Group is normally cash-generative. The risk of unexpected 
large cash outflows could arise where large amounts are being settled daily of which only a fraction forms the commission earned by the Company.  
This could be due to clients settling late or bad deliveries to the market or CREST, also resulting in a payment delay from the market side.
The Group’s policy with regard to liquidity risk is to carefully monitor balance sheet structure and borrowing limits, including:
 – monitoring of cash positions on a daily basis;
 – exercising strict control over the timely settlement of trade debtors; and
 – exercising strict control over the timely settlement of market debtors and creditors.
The Group holds its cash and cash equivalents spread across a number of highly rated financial institutions. All cash and cash equivalents are short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash without penalty.
All the regulated Group subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of FCA Liquidity standards if they are within the scope of the rules in the FCA Handbook 
chapter IFPRU 7.
During the year, the Group made contractual undiscounted cash payments of £1,098,000 being deferred cash consideration for acquisition of  
intangible assets.

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates or equity prices, on financial assets and liabilities will affect the Group’s 
results.
They relate to price risk on available-for-sale and trading investments and are subject to ongoing monitoring.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values as they have been revalued at  
31 March 2017 using closing market prices.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax decrease to net assets of £108,600 (2016: £123,700). A 10% rise would have  
an equal and opposite effect.
The impact of foreign exchange and interest rate risk is not material and is therefore not presented.

1 A provision is included in respect of a potential income tax and national insurance liability relating to payments to two former fund managers of Walker Crips Asset Managers Limited, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary, which was sold to Liontrust Asset Management plc (Liontrust) in April 2012. Under the terms of the 2012 Sale and Purchase Agreement, to the extent that this liability 
crystallises, the cost is to be met by Liontrust. The Board has concluded that recovery from Liontrust would be virtually certain and, in accordance with IAS 31, an offsetting debtor has been 
crystallised with no net impact on the income statement. See Note 10.
2 These provisions relate to outstanding claims and complaints from third parties which, in the opinion of the Board, need providing for after taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding each claim or complaint.

during the year was attributable to the Company issuing shares to personnel under recruitment contracts, the profit for the year less dividends paid.  76

26. Called-up share capital continued
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to:
 – safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
 – maintain a strong capital base in a cost-efficient manner to be able to support the development of the business when required;
 – optimise the distribution of capital across Group companies, reflecting the requirements of each business;
 – strive to make capital freely transferable across the Group where possible; and
 – comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Walker Crips is classified for capital purposes as an investment management group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), which is presented to the FCA on request. Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules. 
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets. The ICAAP 
compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the FCA’s Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodology. The Group has 
adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk 
component. Capital management policy and practices are applied at both Group and entity level.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are 
monitored and forecast to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against 
adverse business conditions.
Regulatory capital
No breaches were reported to the FCA during the financial years ended 31 March 2016 and 2017. 
The Company holds 750,000 of its own shares, purchased for total cash consideration of £312,000. In line with the principles of IAS 32 these treasury 
shares have been deducted from equity. No gain or loss has been recognised in the income statement in relation to these shares.
27. Reserves
Apart from share capital and share premium, the Group holds reserves at 31 March 2017 under the following categories:
Own shares held (£312,000) – the negative balance of the Group’s own shares, which have been bought back and held in treasury.
Retained earnings (£11,165,000) – the net cumulative earnings of the Group not paid out as dividends retained to be reinvested in our core, or 
new, business. 
Other (£4,668,000) – the cumulative share premium on the issue of shares as deferred consideration for corporate acquisitions.
28. Share-based payments

Capital commitments
At the end of the year, there were capital commitments of £168,000 (2016: £nil) contracted but not provided for and £nil (2016: £104,000) capital 
commitments authorised but not contracted for.
Lease commitments
The Group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.

Within one year 541 625
Within two to five years 423 457
More than five years 48 –
31. Related parties 
Directors, employees, related parties and their close family members have dealt on standard commercial terms with the Group. The commission earned 
by the Group included in revenue through such dealings is as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Commissions received from Directors, employees, approved persons and their family 186 96
Other related parties include Charles Russell Speechlys, of which M. J. Wright, Non-Executive Director, is a Partner. Charles Russell Speechlys provides 
certain legal services to the Group on normal commercial terms and the amount paid and expensed during the year was £324,000 (2016: £60,000) 
included in administrative expenses or other receivables if the costs are reimbursable.
Commission of £8,562 (2016: £3,965) was earned by the Group from Phillip Securities (HK) Limited (a Phillip Brokerage Pte Limited company, where  
H. M. Lim is a shareholder) having dealt on standard commercial terms. Additionally, some custody services are provided by Phillip Securities Pte Ltd  
(in Singapore, where H. M. Lim is a Director), again all on standard commercial terms, both these items being included in revenue.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are accordingly not disclosed.
Remuneration of the Directors who are the key management personnel of the Group totalled £1,117,000 (2016: £773,000).
32. Contingent liability
During the year, two Group companies, Walker Crips Group plc (WCG) and Walker Crips Stockbrokers Limited (WCSB), received draft proceedings in 
respect of a potential claim, from a former listed corporate client of Keith Bayley Rogers & Co (KBR), a former subsidiary of the Group. The corporate client 
alleges that its former Executive Chairman and his associates misappropriated assets of £5.6m from it between 2010–2014 and used these assets to 
purchase and sell shares in the client through the brokerage of WCG, WCSB and KBR. The client asserts that WCG and WCSB acted dishonestly to assist 
the Chairman to perpetrate the alleged fraud and was party to an unlawful means conspiracy to cause it loss. It is also claimed that WCG, WCSB are 
vicariously liable for any wrongdoing on the part of KBR. The potential quantum of the claim is in excess of £1m. 
The claims are strenuously denied by the Directors and the Directors consider the claim to be without any merit, as supported by a legal opinion obtained 
by WCG and WCSB, which advises that the claims are ‘weak’. A detailed response denying liability for the claims was submitted to the client’s 
representatives in December 2016. The Directors have heard nothing further from the former KBR client since then.
33. Subsequent events
There are no material events arising after 31 March 2017, which have an impact on these financial statements.
34. Prior year adjustment 
An adjustment has been made to retained earnings brought forward at 1 April 2015, as shown in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, to 
reflect unused holiday entitlement costs of £148,000 at 31 March 2015 together with the tax impact of £29,000. This has had the effect of increasing 
trade and other payables by £148,000, reducing tax liabilities by £29,000 and reducing retained earnings by £119,000 as at 31 March 2015 and 2016. 
Movements in the liability since are considered immaterial and there is therefore no impact to profit before tax for subsequent years. 
35. Long-term liability – deferred cash consideration 
2017
£000
2016
£000
Amounts due to personnel under recruitment contracts/acquisition agreements 372 1,556
These amounts are based on fixed contractual terms and the fair value of the liability approximates carrying value, due to the consistency of the 
prevailing market rate of interest when compared to the inception of liability. 78

36. Significant accounting policies 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial 
instruments as specified in the accounting policies below, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies (see Note 37).
The financial statements are presented in the currency of the primary activities of the Company (its functional currency). For the purpose of the financial 
statements, the results and financial position are presented in Sterling (£). The principal accounting policies have been summarised below. They have all 
been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has chosen to early adopt the amendments to FRS 102, paragraph 34.22, which revise the disclosure requirements for financial institutions, 
specifically in relation to the fair value hierarchy, as presented within Note 46. These amendments were approved for issue on 3 March 2016 and are 
otherwise effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The Company has chosen to adopt the disclosure exemption in relation to the preparation of a cash flow statement under FRS 102.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets comprise fixtures and equipment and are recorded at the point at which payment is made at cost. Fixtures and equipment are 
stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method on the following bases:
Computer hardware 33 
1
/
3
% p.a. on cost
Computer software Between 20% and 33 
1
/
3
% p.a. on cost
Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease
Furniture and equipment 33 
1
/
3
% p.a. on cost
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets
Client lists and Unit Trust Management Contracts
Acquired client lists and businesses are recognised when acquired, generating revenue from clients and investment managers are capitalised based on 
the expected future cash flows to be generated over the lives of the assets, discounted at an appropriate discount rate. These costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of 10 to 20 years.
Acquired Unit Trust Management Contracts are capitalised as intangible assets based on an estimate of the expected future cash flows that those 
contracts will generate over their useful lives of ten years. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Client lists are recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably 
whilst the risk and rewards have also transferred into the Company’s ownership.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset 
(or group of related assets) is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If the estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is 
reduced to its estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and any deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current tax charges arising on the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income are also recorded in this statement.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or 
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are not discounted. 81
Financial statements
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
36. Significant accounting policies continued
Own shares held 
Own shares consist of treasury shares which are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for 
the sale of treasury shares is also recognised in equity with any difference being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised on sale of 
treasury shares. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument.
Deferred income
Income received from clients in respect of future periods to the transaction or reporting date are classified as deferred income within creditors until such 
time as value has been received by the client. 
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at cost including transaction costs or at 
fair value depending on the nature of the instrument held.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired, or the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership.
Investments are classified as basic financial instruments and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Where securities are held for 
trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Valuation of investments
The fair valuation of the Company’s basic financial instrument investments is based upon the underlying market price and volatility which may be subject 
to fluctuation from year to year (see Note 46 for further information).
Debtors
Accrued income and other debtors are classified as basic financial instruments and measured at initial recognition at transaction price. Debtors are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. A provision is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a 
known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is 
any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified as fair value through 
profit or loss. No liabilities are held for trading.
Share-based payments
Shares to be issued represent the Company’s best estimate of the Ordinary Shares in the Company which are likely to be issued following business 
combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Company’s shares. Where shares are due to be issued 
within a year, the sum is included in current liabilities.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based upon management’s best estimate for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For employees and account executives of a subsidiary of the Company, the share-based payment is accounted for as a capital contribution in the 
respective subsidiary. The subsidiary will then take a charge to its income statement in respect of the share-based payment.
Shares to be issued
Shares to be issued represent the Company’s best estimate of the Ordinary Shares in the Company which are likely to be issued the following business 
combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Company’s shares. Where shares are due to be issued 
within a year, the sum is included in current liabilities. Shares to be issued are dependent on the achievement of predefined targets and are treated as a 
liability until they are allotted and issued, at which time they are reclassified within equity. The Company had recognised as a liability the sum which has 
been issued and allotted to personnel associated with the Company in order to meet contractual commitments given as part of the recent expansion of 
its client base. 82

Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis. Benefits 
received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Going concern
After conducting enquiries, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The Company’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, has been rigorously assessed.
37. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and 
judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet 
date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Intangible and financial assets – judgement
Acquired client lists are capitalised based on current fair values. During the year the Company acquired several investment managers and the business of 
their clients. By assessing the historic rates of client retention, the ages and succession plans of the investment managers who manage the clients and the 
contractual incentives of the investment managers, the Directors consider a life of up to 20 years to be both appropriate and in line with peers.
Financial assets comprise equity investments which are held for trading, with fair value determined by the market price of each investment.
The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires significant judgement by the Directors when using peer comparisons to rationalise our 
assessments. The Directors consider observable data to be that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and 
verifiable, not proprietary, provided by multiple, independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.

Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 enacted reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. 
Finance Act 2016 enacted a reduction in the 18% rate to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. These changes to corporation tax rates impacted the 
deferred tax charge and closing deferred tax position for 2017. 
It is estimated that £155K of timing differences will reverse in the next 12 months. This is mainly due to an anticipated utilisation of the losses being 
carried forward at 31 March 2017.

46. Fair value disclosures
FRS 102 requires a three-level hierarchy disclosure for categorising financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and requires enhanced disclosures 
about fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy classifies financial assets and liabilities according to the source of inputs ranked according to 
availability of observable market prices used in measuring fair value as follows:
 – Level 1 – The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. The 
Company’s trading investments fall within this category;
 – Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable (i.e. developed using market data) for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly. The Company does not hold financial instruments in this category; and
 – Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable) for the asset and liability. The Company’s basic financial instruments held 
at fair value (within fixed asset investments) fall within this category.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety should be determined on the basis of the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The categorisation of the Company’s investments within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the investments and does not 
necessarily correspond to the Directors’ perceived risk of the investments. 
The following tables analyse within the fair value hierarchy the Company’s investments measured at fair value:

Determining the fair value of the Company’s investments requires judgement and considers factors specific to the investment. The valuation policies 
applied by the Directors are detailed in Note 37.

47. Risk management policies
Procedures and controls are in place to identify, assess and ultimately control the financial risks faced by the Company arising from its use of financial 
instruments. Steps are taken to mitigate identified risks with established and effective procedures and controls, efficient systems and the adequate 
training of staff.
The Company’s risk appetite, along with the procedures and controls mentioned above, are laid out in the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process document prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The overall risk appetite for the Company and for the Group as a whole is considered by management to be low, despite operating in a marketplace where 
financial risk is inherent in the core businesses of investment management and financial services.
The Group considers its financial risks arising from its use of financial instruments to fall into three main categories:
(i) credit risk;
(ii) liquidity risk; and
(iii) market risk.
Further information on the disclosures and policies carried out by the Company and the Group are made in Note 24 of the consolidated 
financial statements.

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates or equity prices will affect the Group’s income.
These relate to price risk breached on available-for-sale and trading investments and closely monitored using limits to prevent significant losses.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values as they have been revalued at  
31 March 2017 using closing market prices.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax decrease to net assets of £57,000 (2016: £51,800). A 10% rise would have  
an equal and opposite effect.

During the year the Company allotted nil Ordinary Shares (2016: nil Ordinary Shares) in connection with the exercise of share options. The Company 
received £nil consideration during the year in respect of the exercise of share options (2016: £nil).
During the year 3,462,377 new Ordinary Shares were issued and allotted to various personnel associated with the Company in order to meet contractual 
commitments made by the Company as part of the ongoing expansion of its client base. 
The Company holds 750,000 of its own shares, purchased for total cash consideration of £312,000. In line with the principles of FRS 102, section 11, 
these treasury shares have been deducted from equity. No gain or loss has been recognised in the profit and loss account in relation to these shares.

Walker Crips is classified for capital purposes as an investment management group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), which is presented to the FCA on request. Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules. 
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets. The ICAAP 
compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the FCA’s Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodology. The Group has 
adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk 
component. Capital management policy and practices are applied at both Group and entity level.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are 
monitored and forecast to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against 
adverse business conditions.
Apart from share capital and share premium, the Company holds reserves at 31 March 2017 under the following categories:
Own shares held (£312,000) – the negative balance of the Company’s own shares, which have been bought back and held in treasury.
Profit and loss account (£9,474,000) – the net cumulative earnings of the Company not paid out as dividends retained to be reinvested in our core,  
or new, business.
Other (£4,668,000) – the cumulative share premium on the issue of shares as deferred consideration for corporate acquisitions.

Key management are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, controlling and directing the activities of the Group, or in relation to 
the Company, the Company. In the opinion of the Board, the Group and the Company’s key management are the Directors of Walker Crips Group plc. 
Total compensation to key management personnel is £1,116,803 (2016: £772,593).
52. Contingent liability 
During the year, two Group companies, Walker Crips Group plc (WCG) and Walker Crips Stockbroker Limited (WCSB) received draft proceedings in respect 
of a potential claim, from a former listed corporate client of Keith Bayley Rogers & Co (KBR) a former subsidiary of the Group. The corporate client alleges 
that its former Executive Chairman and his associates misappropriated assets of £5.6m from it between 2010 and 2014 and used these assets to 
purchase and sell shares in the client through the brokerage of WCG, WCSB and KBR. The client asserts that WCG and WCSB acted dishonestly to assist 
the Chairman to perpetrate the alleged fraud and was party to an unlawful means conspiracy to cause it loss. It is also claimed that WCG, WCSB are 
vicariously liable for any wrongdoing on the part of KBR. The potential quantum of the claim is in excess of £1m.
The claims are strenuously denied by the Directors and the Directors consider the claim to be without any merit as supported by a legal opinion obtained 
by WCG and WCSB, which advises that the claims are ‘weak’. A detailed response denying liability for the claims was submitted to the client’s 
representatives in December 2016. The Directors have heard nothing further from the former KBR client since then.
53. Subsequent events 
There are no material events arising after 31 March 2017, which has an impact on these financial statements.
54. Prior year adjustment
An adjustment has been made to retained earnings brought forward at 1 April 2015, as shown in the Company statement of changes in equity, to reflect 
the tax impact of £3,000, relating to unused holiday entitlement costs of £15,000 as at 31 March 2015, recorded in the Group Company Barker Poland 
Asset Management LLP (BPAM). This has the effect of reducing tax liability and increasing retained earnings by £3,000 as at 31 March 2015 and 2016. 
Movements in the liability since are considered immaterial and there is therefore no impact to taxation for subsequent years.  88

Notes on resolutions
The following paragraphs explain, in summary, the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (the Meeting).
Resolution 1: Receipt of the 2017 Report and Accounts
The Directors of the Company must present their report and the annual accounts to the Meeting and shareholders may raise any questions on the Report 
and Accounts under this resolution.
Resolution 2: Approval of the 2017 Directors’ remuneration report
In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act, shareholders are requested to approve the Directors’ remuneration report (other than the 
Directors’ remuneration policy set out on pages 40 to 44), which can be found on pages 34 to 39 of the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 
2017. The vote is advisory only and does not affect the actual remuneration paid to an individual Director.
Resolution 3: Approval of the 2017 Directors’ remuneration policy
Under section 439A of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors’ remuneration policy is required to be put to shareholders for approval, and the vote is 
binding. Accordingly, shareholders are asked to approve the Directors’ remuneration policy set out on pages 40 to 44 of the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 31 March 2017.
If approved by the shareholders, the policy is intended to be valid for a period of three years from 1 April 2018. Once in effect, the Company will not be 
able to make a remuneration payment to a current or prospective Director or a payment for loss of office to a current or past Director, unless that 
payment is consistent with the policy or has otherwise been approved by a resolution of the shareholders of the Company.
Resolution 4: Final dividend
Shareholders are being asked in Resolution 4 to approve a final dividend of 1.29 pence per Ordinary Share for the year ended 31 March 2017. If you 
approve the recommended final dividend, this will be paid on 15 September 2017 to all ordinary shareholders who were on the register of members at the 
close of business on 1 September 2017.
Resolutions 5 to 11: Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that at each Annual General Meeting, Directors who were in office at the time of the previous two Annual 
General Meetings and who have not been elected or re-elected in that period must retire by rotation. A retiring Director is eligible for re-election. This year, 
Mr Rodney FitzGerald and Mr Sean Lam are retiring in this manner and are seeking re-election.
Mr David Gelber, Mr Martin Wright and Mr Hua Min Lim are retiring because each of them have been Non-Executive Directors for more than nine years 
and Mr Robert Elliott is not seeking re-election. Mr Gelber, Mr Wright and Mr Lim are seeking re-election.
In addition, Mr Guy Jackson and Mr Clive Bouch, who were appointed by the Directors since the Annual General Meeting in 2016, are retiring in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and are seeking re-election.
The biographies of the Directors eligible and standing for re-election at the Meeting are set out on pages 24 and 25 in the 2017 Report and Accounts.
Resolution 12: Appointment of auditor
The Company is required to appoint its auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the shareholders and is usually appointed to 
hold office from the conclusion of an Annual General Meeting until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked in resolution 12 to approve the appointment of BDO LLP as auditor of the Company from the conclusion of the 
Meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting at which accounts are laid.
Resolution 13: Remuneration of the auditor
The resolution also authorises the Directors, in accordance with standard practice, to set the remuneration of the auditor. In accordance with its terms of 
reference, the Audit Committee will approve the terms of engagement and the level of audit fees payable by the Company to the auditor and 
recommend them to the Board.
Resolution 14: Renewal of the Directors’ authority to allot shares
Resolution will be proposed before the Meeting to confer authority on the Directors to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any 
security into shares of up to an aggregate nominal amount of £933,070 (being one-third of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 28 July 2017). This resolution, which is an ordinary resolution, will replace the authority given to the Directors at the last Annual General 
Meeting on 3 August 2016.
750,000 shares are held in treasury as at 28 July 2017 (representing approximately 2% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) 
on that date).
The Directors have no present intention to issue new Ordinary Shares in addition to commitments disclosed in the Annual Report. However, the Directors 
consider it prudent to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that this authority provides.
This authority will expire on the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or the date falling 15 months from the date of the passing of the 
resolution, whichever is the earlier. 92

Resolution 15: Renewal of the Directors’ authority to disapply pre-emption rights
Resolution will be proposed before the Meeting to confer authority on the Directors to allot equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £279,921 (being 10% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 28 July 2017) as if section 561(1) of the Companies Act 
2006 did not apply. This resolution, which is a special resolution, will replace the authority given to the Directors at the last Annual General Meeting on 
3 August 2016.
The Directors have no present intention to make use of this authority and will only do so when satisfied that it is in the interest of the Company.
This authority will expire on the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or the date falling 15 months from the date of the passing of the 
resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 16: Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares
The Companies Act 2006 permits a public company to purchase its own shares in accordance with powers contained in its Articles of Association and 
with the authority of a resolution of shareholders. The Directors believe that the Company should be authorised to take advantage of these provisions 
and therefore, pursuant to the power contained in the Company’s Articles of Association, it is intended to propose a special resolution at the Meeting to 
confer authority on the Company to purchase up to a maximum in aggregate of 10% of the Ordinary Shares of 6
2
/
3
 pence each in the share capital of the 
Company at a price or prices which will not be less than 6
2
/
3
 pence and not be more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotation derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the ten business days before the relevant purchase is made.
The authority was given at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company for a period expiring at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting. 
It is the Directors’ intention that a resolution for its renewal will be proposed at each succeeding Annual General Meeting. The Directors will only make 
use of the authority when satisfied that it is in the interest of the Company to do so. Shareholders should note that any Ordinary Shares purchased by the 
Company will either be cancelled and the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will accordingly be reduced or will be held as treasury shares.
Shareholders may further note that the total number of warrants and options to subscribe for equity shares in the Company that are outstanding as at 
28 July 2017 is nil.
This authority will expire on the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or the date falling 15 months from the date of the passing of the 
resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 17: Notice period for general meeting
The notice period for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period which cannot be less than 14 clear 
days. Annual general meetings will continue to be called on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
Resolution 17, which is a special resolution, will enable the Company to call general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) on 14 clear days’ 
notice. The Directors believe that this is in the best interests of the shareholders and it is intended that this shorter notice period would not be used as a 
matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of 
shareholders as a whole.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2018 when it is intended that a similar resolution to renew the authority will 
be proposed.
 
Shareholder notes
The following pages provide more detailed information about your voting rights and how you may exercise them.
Entitlement to attend and vote
1. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those members registered on the 
Company’s register of members at:
• 6.00 p.m. on 4 September 2017; or
• if this Meeting is adjourned, at 6.00 p.m. on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Appointment of proxies
2. If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in Note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to 
attend, speak and vote at the Meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the 
procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the 
Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your 
behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more 
than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy your proxy card or contact Neville 
Registrars Limited to obtain an extra proxy card on 0121 585 1131.
5. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting 
indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit 
in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.

Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy form
6. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
• completed and signed;
• sent or delivered to Neville Registrars Limited, Neville House, 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands, B63 3DA; and
• received by Neville Registrars Limited no later than 11.00 a.m. on 4 September 2017.
 In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the 
Company or an attorney for the Company.
 Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be 
included in with the proxy form.
Appointment of proxies through CREST
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting and 
any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from https://my.euroclear.com/euilegal). CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such 
instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to 
the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent ID (7RA11) by 
no later than 11.00 a.m. on 4 September 2017, or, in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours before the adjourned meeting. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored 
member, or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
8. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior 
holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in 
respect of the joint holding (the first name being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
9. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt of 
proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off 
time will be disregarded.
 Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, 
please contact Neville Registrars Limited on 0121 585 1131.
 If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of the proxies will 
take precedence. 94

Termination of proxy appointments
10. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to 
revoke your proxy appointment to Neville Registrars Limited, Neville House, 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands B63 3DA. In the case of a 
member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the Company or 
an attorney for the Company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of 
such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice. The revocation notice must be received by Neville Registrars Limited no later 
than 11.00 a.m. on 4 September 2017.
 If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified then, subject to the paragraph directly below, 
your proxy appointment will remain valid.
 Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the 
Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
Corporate representatives
11. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member 
provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share.
Issued shares and total voting rights
12. As at 27 July 2017 (being the latest practicable day prior to the date of this notice), the Company’s issued share capital comprised 42,738,158 
Ordinary Shares of 6
2
/
3
 pence each. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company. The Company held 
750,000 Ordinary Shares in treasury on 27 July 2017 and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 27 July 2017 is 41,988,158.
Communication
13. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of meeting or any related documents (including the letter with which this notice 
of meeting was enclosed and proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
Website giving information regarding the Meeting
14. Information regarding the Meeting, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, is available from www.wcgplc.co.uk.
Questions at the Meeting
15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, the Company must answer any question you ask relating to the business being dealt with at the 
Meeting unless (i) answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential 
information; (ii) the answer has already been given on the Company’s website in the form of an answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the 
interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the question be answered.
Website publication of audit concerns
16. Pursuant to section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, where requested by members meeting the qualification criteria set out in that section, the 
Company must publish on its website a statement setting out any matter that such members propose to raise at the Meeting relating to either (i) the 
audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Meeting; or (ii) the 
circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which the Annual Report and Accounts 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006.
 Where the Company is required to publish such a statement on its website:
• it may not require the members making the request to pay any expenses incurred by the Company in complying with the request;
• it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor no later than the time the statement is made available on the Company’s website; and
• the statement may be dealt with as part of the business of the Meeting.
Nominated person
17. If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (Nominated Person), you may 
have a right under an agreement between you and the member of the Company who has nominated you to have information rights (Relevant 
Member) to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the Meeting. If you either do not have such a right or if you have such a 
right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an agreement between you and the Relevant Member to give instructions to the 
Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting rights. Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant 
Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries 
relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the 
Company expressly requests a response from you.

1. As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of 
the Company. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes.
2. Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the 
meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. To appoint as your proxy a person other than 
the Chairman of the meeting, insert their full name in the space above. If you sign and return this proxy form with no name inserted in the box, the 
Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman, you are responsible 
for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any comments on your behalf, you 
will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the relevant instructions directly.
4. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please indicate the number of shares in relation to which they are 
authorised to act as your proxy. If left blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement (or, if this proxy form 
has been issued in respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated account).
5. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more

as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you).
6. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with an ‘X’. To abstain from voting on a resolution, select the relevant 
‘Vote withheld’ box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the 
resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from 
voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.

precedence.
