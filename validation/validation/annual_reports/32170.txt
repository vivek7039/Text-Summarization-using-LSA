Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Chairman’s statement
Assura’s purpose is to provide 
GPs and patients with the 
buildings they need today 
for the NHS of tomorrow.
Simon Laffin
Non-Executive Chairman
Dear Shareholder 
Assura has continued 
to grow over the last 
12 months.
 
Our property portfolio expanded 
significantly, through both acquisitions 
and new developments. In the past year 
we have added £170 million of property 
and this, together with the £141 million 
of property additions in the previous 
year, has increased our net rental 
income by 16% to £67.9 million. We 
are now the UK’s largest developer and 
owner-manager of primary healthcare 
property with a property portfolio 
valued at over £1.3 billion.
The increased scale of our operations 
and our strong financial position have 
assisted us in obtaining better terms 
on our debt. We have signed new 
unsecured debt facilities of £350 million, 
lowering the overall cost of borrowings 
by 78 basis points to 4.06%.
Last year we set a lower medium-term 
loan to value (“LTV”) target range of 
between 40% and 50%. At the year 
end our LTV was 37%, well positioned 
relative to this range. We are continuing 
to source attractive investment 
opportunities and we currently have a 
pipeline of further property acquisitions 
and developments of £153 million 
in solicitors’ hands. This will in time 
increase the LTV. We shall continue 
to monitor what the right LTV range 
is for the Company.
A key part of our strategy is our 
unique proposition of offering all of 
the elements of the property service 
for GPs. This provides GPs with a 
long-term partner approach throughout 
the lifecycle of a medical centre, from 
first idea of a new surgery through: 
the NHS business case; development 
and build of the new surgery; moving 
in; disposal of the old property; and 
maintenance of the premises over 
the next 25 plus years. Our ability to 
“develop, invest and manage” gives us 
a crucial advantage when securing new 
development opportunities and other 
asset management initiatives with GPs. 
Moreover, it provides a highly scalable 
model that means that, as we grow, 
the benefits of scale accrue to 
shareholders and drive our progressive 
dividend policy and shareholder returns. 
The benefit of this model has been 
illustrated again this year as rent roll 
rose by 17% to £74.4 million and EPRA 
earnings rose by 58% to £40.3 million.

4  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dividends
We aim to deliver superior risk adjusted 
returns to our shareholders. A key 
component of this return is a growing, 
covered dividend. In January 2017 the 
Board increased our quarterly dividend 
payment by 9% to 0.60 pence per 
share or 2.4 pence per share on an 
annualised basis. This represents an 
increase of over 33% from the level of 0.45 
pence per share paid three years ago.
Shareholder engagement
We are committed to the highest 
standards of financial transparency 
and believe a significant investment 
in investor relations activity is a key 
responsibility for any public company. 
We have held 95 meetings with 
investors during the year and I am 
delighted to welcome a number of 
new shareholders onto our register. 
Our people and the Board
The past year was marked by the tragic 
death of our previous CEO, Graham 
Roberts. Graham stepped down in 
March 2016 and passed away in July, 
having been suffering from cancer. 
Graham was a great leader and CEO 
for Assura over his four years in charge, 
delivering a period of remarkable 
success which saw the Group grow from 
a market capitalisation of £152 million to 
become a FTSE 250 company valued at 
over £900 million. He had a clear vision, 
inspired investor confidence and built a 
strong team, all of which transformed 
Assura into a leading player in the sector.
I became Executive Chairman in March 
last year to cover for Graham’s absence. 
In October 2016, the Board appointed 
Jonathan Murphy as Interim CEO and 
confirmed him as permanent CEO in 
February 2017. Jonathan had been 
Finance Director since January 2013. 
He brings extensive knowledge and 
experience to the role, as well as the 
commitment and ability to continue to 
deliver on our strategy. We are currently 
recruiting for a new Finance Director.
I am delighted to welcome Andrew 
Darke onto the Board as Property 
Director. Andrew has been with Assura 
since its flotation in 2003 and brings to 
the Board an unparalleled knowledge 
and understanding of the specialist 
primary care property market.
We have 43 people employed in 
Assura and, on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them all for their 
hard work, dedication and contribution 
to the success of the business through 
such a busy year.
Our investment case
By following our strategies we can deliver long-term 
shareholder value through:
  Low volatility of property returns
  Low default risk
  Linkage to cost inflation
  Scalable, internally managed model
  Covered, progressive dividends
  Excellent risk adjusted returns.
Culture, values and ethics 
The NHS is Assura’s prime customer, 
accounting for 86% of our total rent roll. 
We strongly support the NHS and believe 
in its vital role in the country’s health. We 
aim to provide the NHS, GPs and patients 
with the buildings needed for the NHS 
of today and tomorrow. These buildings 
provide the essential social infrastructure 
required to improve the health of the 
communities in which we operate. We 
direct private sector capital to provide, 
develop and enhance primary care 
premises. Some 6% of the UK’s NHS 
patients now use our premises.
This important social dimension to 
our work is reflected in our alignment 
with the values of the NHS and our 
commitment to the highest standards 
of ethics and integrity. We have robust 
ethical policies and control procedures 
which help us ensure that good 
business ethics are embedded across 
the Group. The Government and NHS 
control both new asset investment and 
rental increases, based on a transparent 
market mechanism. This reflects the 
mutually beneficial partnership that 
we have with the public sector.
For a number of years, we have been 
working on designing and developing 
an energy neutral building, which brings 
together the latest thinking in sustainable 
design practice and construction 
techniques. Our first project under this 
initiative is now nearing completion and 
we hope to apply these innovative 
approaches to future schemes in our 
development pipeline. This is in addition 
to our commitment to meeting the highest 
possible BREEAM accreditation for our 
schemes as evidenced by us achieving 
a “Very Good” accreditation for both 
properties completed in the year.
Looking ahead
With the support of our shareholders, 
Assura has the strongest balance sheet 
in the sector and we are well placed 
to continue investing in what remains a 
very fragmented market. In addition, we 
remain focused on carefully managing 
our existing portfolio with our in-house 
management team continuing to deliver 
the highest standard of customer 
service and operational excellence for 
the nation’s GPs, while also maximising 
the value of our portfolio through asset 
management initiatives.
Although the NHS and primary care 
policy consensus across all mainstream 
parties is now more positive than ever 
before, we remain frustrated by the 
slow progress in transforming policy 
into meaningful investment in primary 
care premises. It looks as if the general 
election will result in a continuity 
in basic primary care strategy by 
whichever party wins it. Everyone 
seems to agree that better healthcare 
hinges on more care being provided 
in the primary care sector. Having more 
doctors and better leveraging of their 
skills through ancillary healthcare 
professionals will require more and 
better premises. We are ready to 
support this essential investment in the 
infrastructure of the NHS by offering the 
right skills, relationships and capital to 
make the plans a reality on the ground.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information CEO review
Investment in primary care 
premises is an essential  
enabler for the necessary 
NHS transformations.
Jonathan Murphy 
CEO
Overview
A year of political disruption has 
contributed towards uncertainty in 
the financial and commercial property 
markets. Despite this backdrop Assura 
has continued to deliver superior risk 
adjusted returns built on a secure and 
long-term income stream funded by 
the NHS. In the past year, our property 
return was 9.7%, driven by an income 
return of 5.3% and an increase in 
property values adding a further 4.4%. 
At the end of the financial year, in 
March, Sir Robert Naylor released 
his landmark review of the NHS 
estate highlighting the crucial role 
for primary care premises in enabling 
the policy imperatives of dramatically 
increasing evening and weekend GP 
appointments, encouraging practices 
to work together in networks or hubs 
and increasing significantly the primary 
care workforce. It is now clear that 
mainstream thinking recognises that 
investment in primary care premises is 
an essential enabler to the necessary 
NHS transformation. Assura’s bespoke 
approach, one that works for the NHS, 
for GPs, for wider community health 
teams and for patients, is well suited 
to deliver what is required.

6  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Delivering long-term 
outperformance in 
property returns
Assura is a constituent of the IPD All 
Healthcare Index and over the last five 
years we have delivered an annualised 
ungeared return of 8.9% This level of 
consistent performance over a long 
period is a testament to the skills and 
dedication of our property team and 
to the specialist knowledge we have 
in our sector. 
The strong returns achieved in this 
five-year period are even more 
creditable given the development 
activity of this time has been at 
historically low levels, as development 
activity is a key driver of Assura’s 
returns in two ways. Firstly, we are 
typically able to source developments 
at an effective yield on cost that is 
100 basis points higher than through 
acquisitions. Secondly, developments 
provide evidence of construction cost 
inflation that drives rental growth. 
Our 398 medical centres have a rent roll 
of £74.4 million with the geographically 
diverse nature of the portfolio allowing 
us to serve more than 6% of the UK’s 
population. Our investment approach is 
to identify those assets we believe are 
best in class in their local catchment 
areas. By acquiring those assets that 
provide a broad range of services to 
their local communities, we believe 
these will provide greater prospects 
for lease renewal on expiry and so 
drive greater property returns over 
the long term.
A good example of this approach can 
be seen in our acquisition of Donnington 
Medical Practice in Shropshire. This 
centre serves over 12,500 patients and 
provides 17 additional services on site 
including blood pressure and coronary 
heart disease prevention, dermatology, 
minor surgery, and smoking cessation 
programmes. 
For key properties, we are not afraid 
to acquire shorter leases, and use our 
property skills to redevelop or enhance 
the premises, whilst seeking to re-gear 
the lease to a longer period.
Net initial yield movement
 
The attractiveness of the sector has resulted in a stable yield profile with modest 
yield compression in recent years.

Rental income
The key driver of our property return is the 
income from our long-term leases. In the 
year rental growth was 1.6% from settled 
rent reviews. Most of our rent reviews are 
on an open market basis, set by reference 
to rental awards agreed with the District 
Valuer on new schemes. This means 
that they are influenced by land and 
construction cost inflation over the 
medium term. Over recent years there 
has been significant inflation in these 
costs, but this increased cost is not yet 
fully reflected in our passing rents as the 
slowdown in new schemes has reduced 
the evidence of that inflation. Our portfolio 
is well placed to capture this rental growth 
once new developments recommence 
and this gives us confidence for the 
medium-term prospects for rental growth 
in our sector.
Capital growth
The balance of our ungeared annualised 
return is generated from capital growth, 
which has seen a like-for-like valuation 
growth of 5.6% in the past year. This 
increase has primarily come from 
a movement in yields with our net 
equivalent yield moving by 23 basis 
points in the past year. The portfolio 
net initial yield as at 31 March 2017 
was 5.10%.
We completed two developments 
during the year at a total development 
cost of £13.8 million. This has added 
£0.7 million to our annual rent roll. 
We also add value through active asset 
management of our properties, working 
with our GP tenants on proposals for 
physical extensions or agreeing new or 
extended lease terms. During the year 
we agreed four extensions, 15 new 
leases and 10 lease extensions. 
Together this asset management 
activity added a further £0.4 million 
to our rent roll. 
The combined impact of our investment 
and asset management activity has 
been to achieve a 7% growth in EPRA 
NAV to 49.4 pence per share.
www.assuraplc.com  7
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information CEO review continued
contributor to the £236 million increase 
in investment property in the year. 
This has enabled our rent roll to grow 
by 17% to £74.4 million. 
Our in-house development team is 
currently busier than it has been for a 
number of years. Although completed 
schemes in the year numbered only two 
sites, for a gross development cost of 
£13.8 million, the number of potential 
opportunities has increased markedly. 
We are currently on site at a further six 
schemes with a gross development cost 
of £31 million, which is a significant uplift 
from this time last year. The pipeline 
remains strong, with a further eight 
schemes with a gross development 
cost of £36 million where we expect 
to be on site within the next 12 months.
This increased level of activity is 
encouraging. The schemes we are 
working on are being driven by pressing 
local requirements; however, we are yet 
to see the full effect of national policy 
imperatives or programmes. The 
potential for the Sustainability and 
Transformation Plans (“STPs”) and the 
Estates and Technology Transformation 
Fund is real, though we are not yet 
seeing that potential converted into 
significant investment.
We remain optimistic that these 
central initiatives will result in increased 
investment in the future. We have the 
skills, resources and capital to support 
and benefit from these plans when they 
convert into action. 
Funding further growth
At the year end we had an immediate 
acquisition pipeline of £86 million 
and we continue to identify new 
opportunities that meet our 
acquisition criteria.
To support this continued expansion 
of the portfolio, we have been active 
in sourcing new funding over the past 
year. In May 2016, we agreed a £200 
million unsecured revolving credit facility 
with a club of four banks at an initial 
margin of 150 basis points. At the year 
end we had utilised £100 million of 
these facilities and so to provide further 
scope for expansion we have now, in 
May 2017, increased this facility to 
£250 million on the same terms.
Maximising operational 
efficiency
The property additions have been 
integrated by our in-house property 
management team, which is delivering 
sector-leading tenant satisfaction 
across our portfolio. In our annual tenant 
satisfaction survey over 95% of our 
tenants said they would recommend us 
as potential landlords to other GPs, and 
our GPs remain our greatest source of 
referrals for new business. We remain 
focused on understanding their evolving 
needs and demands, so we can be at 
the forefront of the significant investment 
required in improving premises in 
the future.
Our team of portfolio and investment 
managers has responsibility for 
identifying value enhancing asset 
management opportunities, such as 
lease extensions and redevelopments 
within our existing estate, as well as 
new acquisition opportunities.
This structure enables us to ensure that 
we can maximise the efficiency with 
which we can translate increased rental 
income into underlying profit and hence 
dividends. In the year we have delivered 
a 58% growth in EPRA earnings to 
£40.3 million. This has been achieved 
from 21% growth in our investment 
property value and a reduction in our 
EPRA Cost Ratio from 17% to 14%.
The overall impact of all of these factors 
has enabled us to increase our quarterly 
dividend from January 2017 by 9% to 
0.60 pence per share.
Continued focus on our 
specialist sector
Assura represents a unique proposition 
in our sector as we act as investor, 
developer and manager of our 
properties. This gives us an unrivalled 
knowledge and understanding of the 
requirements of GPs for their premises. 
We also maintain a database of every 
primary care property in the UK that 
enables us to identify and analyse 
potential acquisition opportunities. 
This exceptional market knowledge has 
been a key contributor to our continued 
success in expanding our portfolio 
during the year and we closed the year 
with a portfolio of 398 properties and 
a valuation in excess of £1.3 billion.
The ongoing growth in the portfolio 
has largely been achieved through 
continued acquisitions. In the year 
we completed £156 million of property 
additions, which was the largest

funding at an attractive rate. This 
unsecured funding increases operational 
flexibility and reduces transaction costs 
associated with financing the expanding 
property portfolio. 
These new facilities highlight that the 
increased financial strength of Assura is 
enabling us to source new unsecured 
funding at attractive rates. We have 
sustained a strong, long-term and 
diversified debt profile, with 81% of our 
borrowings now at fixed rate with an 
average maturity of 8.7 years, while 
delivering a reduction in our weighted 
average cost of debt from 4.84% 
to 4.06%.
The loan to value ratio at the year 
end was 37%, which provides further 
capacity for growth as we maintain 
a medium-term target range of 40% 
to 50%.
Market developments
Our purpose is simple: to provide GPs 
and patients with the buildings they 
need now, for the NHS of today and 
tomorrow. Providing a wider range 
of health services closer to home, 
from a broader range of primary care 
professionals, is both more convenient 
for patients and significantly less 
expensive for the NHS. Without the right 
buildings, however, the plans cannot 
be delivered. The outdated and unfit 
converted residential stock of surgery 
premises must evolve into purpose built 
medical centres, with the capacity and 
the capability to meet the challenges 
the NHS will face in the future.
Given the complex pressures on our 
National Health Service, it is perhaps 
no surprise that the prosaic matter of 
bricks and mortar rarely makes it to the 
top of the policy agenda. However, in the 
past year the importance of improving 
the quality of physical infrastructure has 
been explicitly recognised as being part 
of the solution. 
Local STPs delivered this year set 
out the optimal design for services 
in 44 geographical areas. As ever, 
there is a huge variety in the detail of the 
documents. There is a common thread 
across all the plans that the primary 
care estate will be a crucial enabler 
of what they are trying to deliver. 
The plans highlight the need for a 
significant increase in the primary 
care workforce – with the potential 
scope going significantly beyond 
the recruitment of new GPs. More 
community pharmacists, nurse 
practitioners, physician associates and 
mental health therapists will operate 
from the primary care setting; however, 
if primary care premises do not have 
the capacity to host them, these 
desperately needed boosts to staffing 
levels simply cannot be achieved. 
A larger workforce represents a shift 
into a greater provision of primary care 
at scale. This reflects that larger scale 
practices can more easily manage extra 
services and extended hours, as well as 
potentially delivering greater efficiencies 
in operations and back office functions. 
To this end, there are a number of different 
ways that GPs can work together: 
through formal alliances, federations and 
clusters of merged practices. All models 
of working at scale rely upon larger and 
more modern buildings. 
Yet the level of government investment 
in primary care premises remains at 
historically low levels. The Estates and 
Technology Transformation Fund, 
offering £900 million of much-needed 
investment for both GP premises and 
surgery technology, has not resulted in 
significant progress for buildings. 
Demand for funding far outstrips supply, 
and the pace of projects cannot hope 
to match this demand. We must wait 
to see how much of the pledged 
£325 million of additional capital for 
the most advanced STPs filters through 
to improve primary care estate, and we 
await more detail on NHS England’s 
vision to create 150 urgent treatment 
centres to take the pressure off 
A&E units.
Of course, health policy and health 
economics are extremely complex, so 
we engage regularly with the NHS and 
government to make the case for further 
investment in primary care infrastructure, 
both through our expanding in-house 
capability and through our chairing of the 
British Property Federation’s Healthcare 
Committee. We believe that our model 
offers the best solution to the NHS’s 
capital problem for primary care estate, 
so we work hard to ensure policymakers 
have a clear understanding of the benefits 
it can bring. 
There is no doubt that the policy 
backdrop is more positive than it has 
been for a number of years. However, 
there is a risk that this fails to convert 
into significant investment on the 
ground. In recent years investment 
has dropped to historically low levels 
despite a number of seemingly positive 
central initiatives. 
Outlook
With a general election just a few weeks 
away, all eyes will be on the next steps 
for NHS policy after 8 June. Whatever 
the make-up of Parliament, however, 
the fundamentals for primary care estate 
will remain steadfast: to reduce pressure 
on hospitals, improve access to general 
practice and help the people who rely 
on health services the most to reach them 
closer to home, GP surgery buildings and 
primary care premises must be fit for the 
future. Assura is uniquely placed both to 
deliver and support in this time 
of unprecedented change.

10  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The value we create
We develop, invest and manage a portfolio 
of primary care medical centres across the UK. 
We aim to generate attractive long-term 
financial and social returns for our shareholders 
and wider stakeholders by developing and 
investing in high quality, sustainable medical 
centres that provide crucial infrastructure for 
their local health economy. 
Our team of development managers works with 
our design and development partners to provide 
bespoke, community-led property solutions for 
each of our healthcare partners. We monitor and 
manage the process from design through to 
delivery of the completed building. 
Our investment managers work to identify 
opportunities to build lasting relationships 
with GPs, helping them to realise their long-term 
ambitions for their practice and growing our 
portfolio to provide scale benefits to our investors. 
Our team of property surveyors supports the 
evolving requirements of our tenants, liaising 
frequently to assist their efficient operation. This 
integrated approach enables us to benefit both the 
tenants and our shareholders in securing lease 
renewals, property extensions or co-locating 
appropriate partners such as pharmacies. 
Our competitive strengths
We are unique in offering GPs a full property service, so a 
partnership with Assura is a long-term approach. Our ability 
to “develop, invest and manage” gives us a crucial advantage 
when securing new development opportunities and other 
asset management initiatives. Moreover, our internally 
managed structure provides a highly scalable model that 
means as we grow, the benefits of scale accrue to 
shareholders, and drive our progressive dividend policy.
Key beneficiaries of our value creation:
GP customers
Our purpose built medical centres provide the essential 
infrastructure to allow GPs to provide a broader range 
of healthcare services in the community.

(“STPs”)
This year saw publication of the 44 
STPs across the country, each with its 
own unique estates needs. It is clear 
that improvement and development – 
both of existing estate and of new 
premises – will be fundamental to 
delivering on the NHS’s goals of moving 
services, tests and treatments from 
acute to primary care, expanding 
access to general practice and 
increasing the primary care workforce. 
We are engaging with STP leads around 
the country on how we can help, with 
our expertise and access to capital. 
The value of culture
All of our development projects start – 
and end – with the patients, GPs 
and other health staff who will use 
the buildings. We pride ourselves 
on investing the time to really 
understand how the spaces we 
create will need to look, feel and 
perform for everyone who uses them.

West Gorton Medical Centre 
The contrast between this surgery’s old building – with its lack 
of natural light, metal shutters and decaying exterior – and its 
brand new space just across the road in West Gorton, Greater 
Manchester could hardly be more striking. But this building is 
unique for more than just its visual design. Using the very latest in 
solar technology, it is designed to be carbon neutral, generating 
its own energy for heating and lighting. Set to open to patients 
in May 2017 , staff cannot wait to make the move. 
This year, we are also:
  on site with a brand new building for Woodville Surgery 
in Swadlincote, Derbyshire – that will offer a range of 
consulting and treatment rooms as well as a pharmacy 
to serve the 9,000 patients; 
  funding conversion of a former school building into a 
fit-for-purpose medical centre for Wivenhoe Surgery,

underpin every investment we make. We 
listen to and work with them to identify 
opportunities to grow and add value to our 
portfolio, giving primary care teams the 
infrastructure they need to do their job most 
effectively. Much of our investment work is 
driven by word of mouth – our reputation 
precedes us for taking excellent care of our 
buildings for the people who use them.

Manage
For every GP, practice manager 
and patient using our buildings, our 
in-house team of property surveyors 
is here to help. Whatever the issue, 
from getting the boiler serviced to 
creating more space, they are here 
to look after the ever-growing number 
of buildings in the Assura family. Every 
GP surgery and primary care centre is 
different, responding to and innovating 
for its own unique local health picture 
and pressures. 
We take the time to understand those 
pressures; our knowledge of the local 
context in which our buildings operate 
is a vital part of our bespoke service. 
The feedback we get shows why we 
put that intelligence at the heart of our 
business. Almost all of our tenants (over 
95%) tell us they are satisfied with their 
relationship with Assura while a similar 
proportion would recommend us to 
other GPs and practice managers.
The value of culture
While we are only ever a phone call 
or email away for our tenants, we are 
firm believers in the value of regular 
face-to-face contact. From John O’Groats 
to Land’s End, our team is on the road 
paying regular visits to every property 
we own to ensure everything is running 
smoothly. That personal touch makes 
all the difference.

16  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ready for the long term at Long Lane
With three practices merged into one building, Long Lane 
Surgery in Coalville, Leicestershire was bursting at the seams. 
With investment from Assura and a grant from NHS England’s 
Estates and Technology Transformation Fund, the surgery has 
been fully refurbished this year with a new minor operations suite, 
eight new clinical rooms, administration space, and improved 
reception and waiting areas. With careful planning over the last 
year, the surgery has been able to continue its work throughout 
the renovations – and we have managed the entire process. 
“The Assura team has worked closely with the builders 
to make this a reality. Together, they’ve carried out a 
phenomenal remodelling – literally moving the walls of the 
building out in every direction, while service as usual for our 
patients continued on site. We now have the space and 
functionality to take us into the next stages of primary care, 
and provide our patients with a whole range of new services 
closer to home.” Dr Nick Pulman, lead GP, Long Lane Surgery.

on the environment. 
We continue to support charities in making a difference 
to health in our local communities. In the past year this

In order to sustain the leadership position, we need to

a wide range of key performance indicators (“KPIs”). These 
can be distilled into three key areas. Firstly, Total Property

  We have delivered rental growth of 1.6% from rent reviews

and our growth in net asset value (“NAV”). Lastly, we consider 
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) as measured by the stock 
market, which reflects the value of dividends paid and the 
relative movement in our share price over the period. 
These measures are complementary and should build on 
each other although the share price movement is also affected 
by other external factors outside of our control. By managing the 
Property Return and Accounting Return over the medium term 
we should be able to deliver a superior TSR to our investors. 
This overriding objective is reflected in the long-term management 
incentive schemes implemented, with rewards linked to both 
TSR and NAV growth over a three-year period. Further detail 
is provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 65. 
In order to achieve these objectives, we have four strategic 
priorities and how we monitor ourselves against them is

Managing our resources to 
maximise value in the long-term.
What makes us unique is 
our emphasis on long term 
relationships to support 
our “develop, invest and 
manage” business model, 
aiming to create value for 
all stakeholders.
Brand
We place great value on our reputation 
as a long-term partner to our GP 
tenants, supporting them through the 
lifecycle of their medical centre. This 
reputation and our excellent relationships 
within the GP community lead to off 
market acquisition opportunities with 
GPs as our greatest source of referrals. 
Our established track record in 
providing state of the art primary 
care premises helps secure our 
appointment on developments. 
People
We have a small but very 
knowledgeable, skilled and focused 
team. Our internally managed model is 
highly scalable and our development 
capability enables us to grow the 
business without significant increase 
in overheads. 
We recognise that our success 
depends on the quality of our people 
and we encourage all of our employees 
to reach their full potential. Staff who 
wish to undertake relevant training are 
supported through study support and 
paid study leave, and we currently have 
nine members training for professional 
qualifications, including accountancy, 
chartered secretarial, chartered 
surveyor and marketing. We also seek 
to promote from within and there have 
been several internal promotions during 
the past few years. 
We strive to provide a great place to 
work and focus on employee wellbeing, 
providing private medical insurance, 
a cycle to work scheme and other 
incentives to promote a healthy lifestyle. 
We understand the value of gender 
diversity and the structure and 
gender makeup of the Board, senior 
management team and employee 
workforce is shown on page 27. 
Our whistleblowing hotline allows staff 
and suppliers to raise any issues of 
concern in complete confidence. No 
issues have been raised this year.
All of the above help us to attract, 
engage and develop our people to 
enable the effective delivery of the 
Group’s strategy over the long-term.

is a key priority for the business and 95 
investor meetings have been held in the 
year. We engage with our shareholders 
in an open and transparent way.
We have continued to strengthen 
our financial position through reducing 
our financing costs and improving 
the financial structure to make it more 
appropriate to support our business. 
We have diversified our debt funding 
and obtained unsecured lending 
through a revolving credit facility 
and a US private placement. Having 
these unsecured facilities increases 
operational flexibility and reduces 
transaction costs associated with 
financing properties. We are grateful 
to our shareholders and debt providers 
for their support.
Customer relationships
Our dedicated team of asset managers 
looks after our tenants’ property needs 
through regular communication and 
a supportive approach to property 
management.
Customer satisfaction is vital for the 
business and we monitor this through 
regular surveys. In our most recent 
survey, over 95% of tenants who 
responded said they would recommend 
us as potential landlords to other GPs. 
We seek to develop a long-lasting 
relationship with GPs, working 
to meet their current and future 
premises aspirations.

The NHS
This is a particularly challenging time for 
the NHS, as the headlines remind us 
every day. And behind those headlines, 
primary care estate sits as a relatively 
unheard story – yet recognised this year 
as second only to workforce in the list 
of factors that will ensure a sustainable 
future for primary care. 
We believe the primary care estate 
is a fundamental part of the NHS 
conversation: without the right 
buildings, in the right places for 
patients, many GPs simply will not have 
the infrastructure they need to offer 
extended appointment hours, digital 
consultations and more services, tests 
and treatment in the community. We 
have welcomed the Government’s focus 
on this issue this year, with the ongoing 
Estates and Technology Transformation 
Fund, the Naylor Review highlighting the 
important role of private investment for 
primary care premises and additional 
capital announced for the most 
advanced STPs. However, it is clear 
that despite these initiatives, investment 
in the primary care estate still is not 
moving far enough or fast enough to 
meet the changing needs of GPs and 
to support the shift of services out 
of hospital and closer to home. 
We are investing in specialist, in-house 
expertise to help us engage with and 
inform NHS organisations, national 
and local government, sector bodies, 
patient groups and academics on ways 
in which we can help ensure the right 
primary care estate is in place today for 
the NHS of tomorrow. We are proud to 
chair the British Property Federation’s 
Healthcare Committee, working with 
our colleagues and partners across 
health and social care property to 
provide data, expert analysis and

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Risk management
Effective risk management is crucial 
in delivering our strategic objectives.
Risk management is the 
responsibility of the Board, 
which sets the risk appetite 
and tolerances for the 
business, determines the 
nature and extent of the 
principal risks the Company 
is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives 
and ensures that risk 
management and internal 
controls are embedded in 
the business’s operations.
We target above market, risk adjusted 
returns in our chosen healthcare real 
estate assets, by developing assets 
ourselves (as opposed to purchasing 
only completed developments) and using 
debt to gear returns up to 50% loan to 
value (“LTV”). However, we seek to avoid, 
trap or heavily mitigate risks in all other 
areas of the business, including:
  Property event risk – by full insurance 
cover, full due diligence and 
committed funds for acquisitions
  Development risk – by only undertaking 
developments where there is already 
an agreement for lease in place
  Control risk – by clear management 
controls and Board reporting
  Gearing risk – we maintain an 
appropriate range of lenders and debt 
maturities with variable rate debt being 
restricted to one third of our loan book, 
on gearing up to 50% LTV
  Political risk – which could limit future 
growth but does not affect the 
current business assets.
The Risk Committee met six times in 
the year, to review the risk register, 
identify emerging risks and conduct 
“deep dives” into individual risks to 
ensure that sound assurance is in 
place. The Risk Committee reports to 
the Audit Committee, which regularly 
monitors risk management and 
internal control systems and reports 
to the Board.
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the business. These are the risks which 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity and 
are summarised on pages 30 to 33.
The Board has also considered which 
of the Group’s strategic objectives may 
be affected by these risks and its 
findings are set out in the table below.
During the year the Risk Committee, 
Audit Committee and the Board 
considered the impact of Brexit (on 
the basis that the Group is a wholly 
UK based operation with no reliance 
on exports) and concluded that it did 
not, in itself, constitute a significant risk 
to the business. Cyber security was 
investigated and, following an upgrade 
to the IT systems, security and 
processes during the year, it was 
considered that an appropriate level 
of risk mitigation was in place.

28  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 
(“the Code”), the Board has conducted a 
review of the Company’s current position 
and principal risks to assess the 
Company’s longer-term viability.
A five-year period is considered 
appropriate for this review as this 
corresponds with the Company’s 
strategic planning timeframe. In 
addition, the long-term nature of 
leases and debt facilities supports 
an assessment over this period.
Company forecasts are prepared using 
a comprehensive financial model which 
projects the income statement, balance 
sheet, cash flows and key performance 
indicators over the relevant timeframe. 
The model allows various assumptions 
to be applied and altered in respect 
of factors such as level of investment, 
investment yield, availability and cost 
of finance, rental growth and potential 
movements in interest rates and 
property valuations.
Having made reference to the principal 
risks facing the Company, as laid out on 
pages 30 to 33, sensitivities which are 
considered severe but within the realms 
of possibility have been applied to the 
assumptions to review the potential 
impact on the Company’s results and 
financial position. Specific sensitivities 
applied include increases in interest 
rates, a prolonged downturn in property 
investment valuations, an increased 
risk of tenant default and a sustained 
absence of rent review growth. This 
assessment has not assumed any 
significant changes to government 
policy with respect to NHS estates 
strategies or the GP reimbursement 
model, or any specific implications 
as a result of Brexit. 
Based on this consideration of 
principal risks and the forecasting 
exercise completed, the Board has 
a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the five-year period 
assessed. The Board considers that 
the long-term nature of the leases and 
financing arrangements in place means 
that the business model would remain 
viable in the event that further growth 
of the business was not achieved.

The current appetite for lending into the sector is very strong, given the quality of the underlying cash flows and, during the year, the Group obtained £300 million 
of unsecured debt at attractive rates.

Property valuations are 
inherently uncertain and 
subject to significant 
judgement.
A fall in property values or 
income could adversely 
affect bank covenants.
Breach of covenants could 
lead to forced asset 
disposals which could 
reduce the Group’s net 
assets and profitability.
Valuations and yields are 
regularly benchmarked 
against comparable 
portfolios.
The Board has established 
a target range for a net LTV 
ratio over the medium term 
of 40% to 50%. All financial 
forecasting, including 
for new acquisitions, 
considers gearing and 
covenant headroom.
The Group engages two 
external valuers to review 
property valuations.
The valuations are formally 
reviewed by the Board twice 
a year.
Covenant headroom 
and gearing are regularly 
monitored with reference 
to possible valuation 
movements and future 
expenditure.
The Board regularly reviews 
the capital structure of 
the Group.
It is possible to dispose

The level of gearing is currently at 37% and this provides generous covenant headroom.

Development risk could 
adversely impact the 
performance of the Group as 
a result of cost overruns and 
delays on new projects.
The Group has a dedicated 
and experienced 
development team.
The Group’s policy is to 
engage in developments 
that are substantially pre-let 
with fixed price or capped 
price build contracts.
A high level of due diligence 
is undertaken before works 
commence and detailed 
designs are negotiated to 
prevent variations.
Regular reviews are 
conducted of latest cost 
estimates as each project 
progresses.
We remain confident of our 
ability to manage this risk 
through our experienced 
team of development 
surveyors and reduce 
the potential risk through 
the use of fixed price 
contracts and the use 
of performance bonds.

Not all rent reviews 
are upwards only and 
challenges to reviews and 
appeals could lead to lack 
of rental growth.
The Group engages 
experienced third parties 
to conduct rent reviews.
Leases are carefully 
reviewed on acquisition and 
the Group does not acquire 
leases with a tenant right 
to trigger a downward 
rent review.
The Group targets Retail

Loss of income could

A year of growth delivering  
further scale benefits.
Portfolio as at 31 March 2017 
£1,315.3 million (2016: 
£1,088.0 million)
Our business is built on our investment 
portfolio of 398 properties, with a 
passing rent roll of £74.4 million 
(2016: £63.8 million), 86% of which is 
underpinned by the NHS. The WAULT 
is 13.2 years and 75% of the rent roll 
will still be contracted in 2027 .
At 31 March 2017, our portfolio of 
completed investment properties was 
valued at a total of £1,315.3 million (see 
Note 10 to the accounts, 2016: £1,088.0 
million), which produced a net initial 
yield (“NIY”) of 5.10% (2016: 5.29%). 
Taking account of potential lettings 
of unoccupied space and any uplift 
to current market rents on review, our 
valuers assess the net equivalent yield 
to be 5.29% (2016: 5.52%). Adjusting 
this Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors standard measure to reflect 
the advanced payment of rents, the true 
equivalent yield is 5.47% (2016: 5.72%).
Our EPRA NIY, based on our passing 
rent roll and latest annual direct property 
costs, was 5.05% (2016: 5.23%).

Net rental income 67.9 58.4
Valuation movement 56.5 36.4
Total Property Return 124.4 94.8
Expressed as a percentage of opening 
investment property plus additions, 
Total Property Return was 9.7% 
compared with 8.9% in 2016. 
Our annualised Total Return over the 
five years to 31 December 2016 as 
calculated by IPD was 8.9% compared 
with the IPD All Healthcare benchmark 
of 7.0% over the same period.
The valuation gain in the year of £56.5 
million represents a 5.6% uplift on a 
like-for-like basis net of actual purchase 
costs associated with properties acquired 
during the year. The uplift has arisen due 
to the downward pressure on yields with 
increased demand for assets in the 
sector. Despite the downward pressure, 
the NIY on our assets continues to 
represent a substantial premium over 
the 15-year gilt which traded at 1.49% 
at 31 March 2017 . 
Investment and 
development activity
We have invested substantially during 
the period, with this expenditure split 
between investments in completed 
properties, developments, forward 
funding projects, extensions and 
fit-out costs enabling vacant space

The bulk of the growth in our investment 
portfolio has come from the acquisition 
of 76 properties, seeing us invest £155.6 
million during the period. Details of our 
properties valued over £10 million are 
on page 3.
Despite the continued delay in NHS 
approval of new developments, we have 
completed two developments during 
the period (both under forward funding 
agreements) with a total development 
cost of £13.8 million. This has added 
£0.7 million to our annual rent roll and 
generated a 5.0% yield on cost.

Portfolio management
We have continued to deliver rental 
growth and have successfully 
concluded on 156 rent reviews during 
the year to generate a weighted average 
annual rent increase of 1.57% (2016: 
1.20%) on those properties. Our 
portfolio benefits from a 28% weighting 
in fixed, RPI and other uplifts which 
generated an average uplift of 2.49% 
during the period. The majority of our 
portfolio is subject to open market 
reviews and these have generated 
an average uplift of 0.88% during 
the period. 
We have a dedicated team of 
asset managers who are in regular 
communication with our customers and 
we monitor progress through regular 
customer satisfaction surveys. 
During the period we have secured 
15 new tenancies with an annual rent 
roll of £0.4 million covering 4,377 square 
metres. Our EPRA Vacancy Rate was 
2.1% (2016: 3.0%).
Administrative expenses
The Group analyses cost performance 
by reference to EPRA Cost Ratios 
(including and excluding direct vacancy 
costs) which were 13.7% and 12.4% 
respectively (2016: 16.5% and 16.0%). 
We also measure operating efficiency 
as the proportion of administrative 
costs to the average gross investment 
property value. This ratio during the 
year was 0.57% (2016: 0.60%) and 
administrative costs stood at £7.0 
million (2016: £6.1 million).

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Financing
In May 2016, we replaced our existing 
£120 million revolving credit facility with 
a new five-year £200 million facility on 
an unsecured basis. The initial interest 
rate is 150 basis points above LIBOR, 
subject to leverage. Subsequent to the 
year end, we have further extended this 
facility to £250 million. 
In October 2016, we announced that 
the Group had signed agreements in 
the US private placement market for 
new unsecured, 10-year notes totalling 
£100 million. These have a fixed interest 
rate of 2.65% and were drawn in full.

Alternative Performance 
Measures ("APMs")
The financial performance for the year 
is reported including a number of APMs 
(financial measures not defined under 
IFRS). We believe that including these 
alongside IFRS measures provides 
additional information to help 
understand the financial performance 
for the year and calculations with 
reconciliations back to reported IFRS 
measures are included where possible. 
Underlying profit is no longer reported, 
to avoid confusion, being similar to the 
industry standard EPRA measure.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share (“EPS”) 
on profit for the period was 5.8 pence 
(2016: 2.2 pence). 
EPRA EPS, which excludes the 
net impact of valuation movements, 
non-recurring finance costs and 
gains on disposal, was 2.4 pence 
(2016: 2.0 pence). 
Based on calculations completed in 
accordance with IAS 33, share-based 
payment schemes are currently 
expected to be dilutive to EPS, with 
3.3 million new shares expected to be 
issued. The dilution is not material as 
illustrated by the table below:

Total dividends paid in the year to

(2016: £27.2 million) or 2.25 pence 
per share (2016: 2.05 pence per share). 
£5.1 million of this was satisfied through 
the issuance of shares via scrip.
36  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 As a REIT with the requirement to 
distribute 90% of taxable profits, the 
Group expects to pay out as dividends 
at least 90% of recurring cash profits. 
All dividends paid during the year were 
normal dividends (non-PID) with an 
associated tax credit, as a result of 
brought forward tax losses and 
available capital allowances. It is 
expected that some proportion of 
dividends paid out in the 2017/18

a PID element.

acting as Executive Chairman. Jonathan 
Murphy was appointed Interim CEO in 
October 2016 and my role reverted to 
Non-Executive Chairman. 
Chairman’s introduction to governance
Good governance is essential 
to support the delivery of 
our strategy.
Simon Laffin
Non-Executive Chairman
40  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We were delighted to confirm 
Jonathan’s permanent appointment 
as CEO in February 2017. We also 
welcomed Andrew Darke, Property 
Director, to the Board in October 2016, 
retaining responsibility for the property 
operations and developments. 
Relations with shareholders
Effective communication with shareholders 
is a key priority and 95 investor meetings 
have been held during the year. 
Shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in 
July where all Board members will be on 
hand to answer questions. 
Performance evaluation
As in previous years we carried out 
an internal evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees. Further details on the 
process and results are set out on 
page 47. 
The Board was content, given its small 
size and its strong spirit, that this year’s 
review was conducted internally and 
at no cost. This was overseen on a 
confidential basis by Orla Ball, our 
Company Secretary. We will keep under 
review the need for an independent 
external agency to assist the process.
Effectiveness
I believe that the Board has an effective, 
well-balanced structure. Board 
members have a wealth of skills and 
experience, as shown on pages 44 and 
45, which enable them to challenge, 
motivate and support the business. 
I consider that all the Directors continue 
to devote sufficient time to discharging 
their duties to a high standard and 
remain committed to their roles. 
Remuneration
We were pleased to have received 
over 99% of votes in favour of both our 
Remuneration Policy and Remuneration 
Report at the 2016 AGM and I am 
grateful to shareholders for the level of 
engagement and support during the year.
Compliance with the Code 
As a Board we believe that good 
governance will support the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy. 
In accordance with the Listing Rules, 
I confirm that throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2017, the Company 
was compliant with all the relevant 
provisions as set out in the Code save 
for during the period when I acted as 
Executive Chairman. The Company 
ceased to be a “smaller” company as 
defined by the Code from 1 April 2017, 
and as such my membership of the 
Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee does not comply with Code 
Provisions C.3.1 and D.2.1. We believe 
that, given the quality of the Board, this 
has in no way adversely affected our 
performance and controls. We have 
commenced the search for a new 
independent Non-Executive Director 
who will join these Committees and 
ensure that we comply with Code 
Provision B.1.2, which requires at least 
half the Board to be independent, when 
a new Finance Director is appointed. 
I am pleased to confirm that the 
Company is compliant with all other 
provisions of the Code at the date of 
this Annual Report.

  All Directors retired and were

Role of the Board
The Company has an effective Board 
which is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Company by 
directing and supervising its activities. 
The Board has approved a schedule 
of matters reserved for decision by 
the Board. This includes all corporate 
acquisitions or corporate disposals, 
debt raising above £50 million, the 
Remuneration Policy, the annual 
budget approval and amendments 
to delegated authorities.
The Board meets at least six times per 
year for scheduled meetings. It also 
meets as required to consider any 
important or urgent business.
The relevant Board committees are 
shown below.
Relations with shareholders
The Board welcomes open 
communication with its shareholders 
and works with its stockbrokers Liberum 
Capital and Stifel to ensure that an 
appropriate level of communication 
is maintained. The dialogue with 
shareholders is facilitated by a series of 
investor relations mechanisms, including 
regular meetings between the Executive 
Directors, institutional investors, sales 
teams and industry/sector analysts. 
Feedback from these meetings is 
regularly relayed to the Board in order 
to ensure that all Board members, and 
Non-Executive Directors in particular, 
develop an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders. This process 
augments the regular dissemination of 
annual reports and other market updates. 
Copies of these announcements and any 
accompanying presentational materials 
are available on the Company’s website 
at www.assuraplc.com.
The Board responds to ad hoc requests 
for information from shareholders and 
all shareholders have access to the 
Board, with an opportunity to raise 
questions at the AGM and other 
shareholder meetings. 
The Board, together with its 
professional advisors, actively 
analyses the shareholder register.
Accountability
The Board understands its 
responsibility to present a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of 
the Group’s position and prospects, 
to assess the principal risks facing the 
Group, to ensure that there are effective 
systems of risk management and internal 
control and to provide a statement as 
to the Group’s long-term viability. The 
steps it has taken to comply with these 
requirements are set out in this section 
of the Annual Report.

Board activities in the year 
The table below shows a selection of Board activities in the financial year. 
Board Committees
To assist in its Corporate Governance 
responsibilities, the Board has 
established standing Committees. 
All Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman served on all Committees. 
This was appropriate given the 
relatively small size of the Board. Each 
Committee follows Terms of Reference 
which are reviewed annually and are 
available on the Company’s website. 
However, Simon Laffin stepped down 
from the Audit Committee during his 
period as Executive Chairman.
Information flow
The Board manages the Group’s 
growth closely and secures its 
understanding of the business through 
comprehensive Board papers, which 
include minutes of all Executive Board 
meetings, and also through staff 
presentations. 
At least one Board meeting a year is held 
at the Group’s head office in Warrington 
and Board members meet staff in an 
informal setting before the meeting to 
encourage feedback and foster a closer 
relationship between staff and the Board.
Time commitments
Other directorships of the Board 
members are set out on pages 44 and 
45. Executive Directors are permitted 
to serve on other boards if they can 
demonstrate this will not interfere with 
their time commitment to the Company. 
At present, neither of the Executive 
Directors holds any Non-Executive 
Director positions.
The Nominations Committee remains 
satisfied that all Directors devote 
sufficient time to discharging their 
duties to a high standard and are 
committed to their roles. 
Induction and 
professional development
On appointment, new Directors receive 
a full briefing on the role, duties and 
responsibilities of a director of a listed 
company, and on the Company and 
its Board. An induction pack with 
important information is provided. 
Training needs are reviewed annually 
as part of the Board evaluation.
Each Board member is permitted to 
take professional advice on any matter 
which relates to their position, role and 
responsibilities as a director at the cost 
of the Company, and have access to 
the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who advises the Board on 
Corporate Governance matters. 
46  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Corporate 
Governance best practice, it is the 
Company’s policy that all Directors will 
submit themselves for re-election at the 
2017 AGM. All Directors resigned and 
were re-elected at the 2016 AGM.
Board and Committee 
performance evaluation 
An internal evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees was carried out during 
the year. Board members completed a 
comprehensive questionnaire, returning 
it confidentially to the Company 
Secretary, who prepared an anonymous 
summary of the results. 
The feedback was extremely positive. 
The only significant points to arise were:
  The continued need for succession 
planning for all roles at the 
appropriate time 
  The benefit of a greater diversity 
of skills at Board level
  The requirement for a further  
Non-Executive Director to ensure 
compliance with the Code
  A need for further strategic 
discussion and consideration 
of emerging issues.

Key activities of the Committee
Board and Committee changes
The Committee met six times through 
the year, tackling a number of significant 
issues. In particular, it debated how to 
respond to the absence from work and 
then sad death of our CEO, Graham 
Roberts, both in the short term and 
for longer-term succession. In the first 
instance, the Committee decided to 
appoint me as Executive Chairman 
in March 2016 when Graham Roberts 
took three months’ sick leave during 
his treatment for cancer. Following 
Graham’s sad death in the summer, 
the Committee began an extensive 
search for a new CEO, first by selecting 
executive recruitment firm Odgers 
Berndtson (which has no other 
connection with Assura), from a shortlist 
of three such firms, to assist with the 
process. The firm's brief was to provide 
a long and then a short list of external 
candidates, together with consideration 
of any internal candidates. A long list 
of potential candidates was reviewed 
by the Committee and from this, 
a short list selected. The Committee 
then interviewed a number 
of candidates. 
In October 2016, the Board appointed, 
on the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee, Jonathan 
Murphy as Interim CEO, enabling 
me to revert to my former role as 
Non-Executive Chairman. 
In February 2017, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that 
Jonathan Murphy was the best 
candidate for the role, and so the Board 
approved his appointment. Jonathan 
had proved himself a capable leader 
whilst Interim CEO and with his 
knowledge and experience gained 
as Finance Director, the Committee 
considered him to be the right person 
for the role. 
The Committee also recommended 
that Andrew Darke be appointed to 
the Board as Property Director. The 
Board approved this appointment 
in October 2016.
48  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Commitments of the Chairman 
I am also Non-Executive Chairman of 
Flybe Group plc and Non-Executive 
Director at Watkin Jones plc. The 
Committee considered that I manage 
my time effectively in order to allocate 
sufficient time to each of my roles.
Diversity 
The Board believes that a diverse 
workforce and management team 
improve the culture of the organisation 
and add value to the business as 
a whole. Odgers Berndtson was 
particularly tasked with searching for 
possible CEO candidates who could 
increase the diversity of the Board.
The Board targeted having at least 
20% female representation, which 
was achieved in 2012. 
The Committee will continue to 
consider gender and wider aspects of 
diversity such as experience, nationality, 
disability and age when recommending 
any future Board appointments and 
recruitment firms are instructed to 
include a diverse list of candidates for 
the Committee’s consideration. Final 
appointments will always be made 
on merit.
Succession planning
Succession planning was a focus of the 
Committee during 2016.
The Committee considered the 
immediate cover required for the 
CEO position as well as considering 
development of talent within the 
business to fill more senior roles 
over the medium and long term. 
The Committee acknowledges that 
given the size of the workforce there will 
not be successors for every senior role. 
However, the culture of the business 
is to develop our people and promote 
from within where possible. 
The Committee has identified the need 
for a further Non-Executive Director to 
ensure compliance with the Code and 
has appointed recruitment firm The 
Zygos Partnership to assist with the 
search process. 
Following Jonathan Murphy’s 
appointment as CEO, the position of 
Finance Director must now be filled 
and Warren Partners has been selected 
to assist with the recruitment process. 
Jonathan will continue to fulfil the 
Finance Director role until a suitable 
candidate is found.
Board performance evaluation 
The Board has reviewed its 
performance, and the performance 
of its Committees and individual 
Directors based on an internal 
evaluation overseen by the Company 
Secretary on a confidential basis in 
January 2017. The Board concluded 
that its access to relevant information 
is good, the strategy and goals of the 
Company are clear and discussions 
around the boardroom table are 
constructive and challenging. The 
Board continues to have an appropriate 
mix of skills and experience as shown 
in the strengths table on page 47 
which will be supplemented by the 
skills of the new Finance Director and 
Non-Executive Director once appointed.
The Nominations Committee also 
met in the absence of the Chairman to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance. 
There were no major changes adopted 
in the way the Board operates.

50  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Audit Committee 
(“the Committee”), I have pleasure 
in setting out below the formal report 
on its activities for the year ended 
31 March 2017.
The Committee is aware of the 
Code’s requirements in relation to risk 
and the monitoring of internal control 
systems. During the year the Committee 
received minutes from the meetings 
of the Risk Committee, reviewed the 
risk register, monitored the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems and was kept appraised of the 
upgrades being made to the IT systems, 
security and processes. The Committee 
has not identified any significant failings 
or weakness in these control systems 
during the year. 
The Committee performs a detailed 
review of the content and tone of the 
Annual Report and half year results 
and has satisfied itself that there are 
robust controls over the accuracy 
and consistency of the information 
presented. Accordingly, the Committee 
has advised the Board that the Annual 
Report taken as a whole is “fair, 
balanced and understandable” and 
provides the information necessary 
for the shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Company ceased to be a “smaller” 
company as defined by the Code on 
1 April 2017 and as such membership 
of the Audit Committee does not 
comply with Code Provisions C.3.1. We 
have commenced the search for a new 
independent Non-Executive Director 
to join the Committee.
Significant financial reporting 
matters
  Valuation of investment properties, 
including those under construction – 
valuations and yields are discussed 
with management and benchmarked 
against comparable portfolios. The 
two external valuers present to and 
are challenged by the Committee on 
their valuations.
  Validity of the going concern basis 
and the availability of finance going 
forward – the Committee considers 
the financing requirements of the 
Group in the context of committed 
facilities and evaluates management’s 
assessment of going concern and 
the assumptions made. The external 
auditor also reports to the Committee 
following its review.
  Viability statement – the Committee 
considered the viability statement 
proposed for inclusion in the Annual 
Report and the supporting analysis 
produced by management. The 
statement was approved for inclusion 
in the 2017 report and appears on 
page 29.
Other financial reporting 
matters
In addition to the significant financial 
reporting matters discussed above, 
the Committee considers other financial 
reporting matters as and when they 
arise to ensure appropriate treatment 
in the accounts. 
During the year this included the 
following:
  Share-based payment charges for 
the Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) and 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”).
  Distributable reserves within the Group.
  Presentation of non-recurring 
expenses such as loan issue costs 
written off.
  Internal restructuring plan for 
banking purposes.
We are satisfied that there were no 
matters arising from each of the above 
that we wish to draw to the attention 
of the shareholders.
Internal controls
The Group’s internal control systems 
include a detailed authorisation process, 
formal documentation of all transactions, 
a robust system of financial planning 
(including cash flow forecasting and 
scenario testing) and a robust appraisal 
process for all property investments. 
Changes to internal controls, or controls 
to respond to changing risks identified, 
are addressed by the Risk Committee 
with appropriate escalation to the Audit 
Committee as required. 
Internal audit
The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the current level of control and risk 
management within the business 
adequately meets the Group’s current 
needs. The Committee considers that 
the additional cost of an internal audit 
department is not currently justified. 
However, specific pieces of work are 
commissioned by the Audit Committee 
to examine particular processes and 
controls as deemed necessary. 
Audit/non-audit fees payable 
to external auditor
The external auditor did not carry out 
any services beyond the audit of this 
Annual Report and review of the interim 
accounts. The fees paid to the external 
auditor are disclosed in Note 4(a) to the 
accounts, and the policy for non-audit 
services is in the Audit Committee 
Terms of Reference available on 
our website.
Effectiveness of external 
audit process
The Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process, initially reviewing and 
challenging the audit planning 
memorandum prepared by Deloitte 
and then monitoring fulfilment of this 
plan. The Committee received regular 
feedback from management on the 
service and support provided by Deloitte, 
had a meeting at the end of the audit 
to discuss judgements and concluded 
that the external audit was carried out 
efficiently and effectively with objective, 
independent challenge. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommends Deloitte’s 
re-appointment at the 2017 AGM.
Deloitte was appointed following a 
competitive tender in March 2012 and 
the latest date by which the Company 
is required to tender and appoint an 
external auditor is for the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2022. The current lead 
auditor, Rachel Argyle, was appointed 
in March 2015. There are no current 
intentions to conduct an audit tender 
in the next 12 months.

52  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
introduce the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 March 
2017. This report has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee (“the 
Committee”) and approved by the 
Board. The report is split into two parts:
  The Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy – which provides an 
“at a glance” summary of the 
Remuneration Policy for which 
shareholder approval was obtained 
at the 2016 AGM and which will 
continue to apply without amendment 
for the forthcoming year.
  The Annual Report on 
Remuneration – which sets out 
payments and awards made to the 
Directors and details the link between 
Company performance and 
remuneration for the 2016/17 
financial year. 
We were very pleased to secure 
such strong levels of support from 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM for our 
new Remuneration Policy, with over 
99% of votes in favour of this resolution 
and the accompanying resolution to 
establish the new PSP. As no changes 
are proposed to the existing policy, 
only one remuneration resolution will 
be tabled at the 2017 AGM, i.e. the 
advisory shareholder vote on the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Context to the Committee’s 
decisions
The last financial year marked a further 
period of success for Assura, with 
continued strong growth. See our 
Business Review on pages 34 to 39. 
2016/17 also saw various changes in 
the structure of our Executive Board to 
reflect Graham Roberts’ very sad death.
It was in this context that the 
Committee made its key decisions, 
which included:
  Agreeing to pay Jonathan Murphy 
a non-pensionable and non-bonus 
attracting salary supplement of 
£5,417 per month to reflect his 
assuming the role of Interim CEO 
between 3 October 2016 and 
27 February 2017 (when he was 
appointed to the role of CEO and 
became entitled to a base salary 
of £335,000)
  Agreeing the package of Andrew 
Darke upon his appointment to 
the Board as Property Director
  Determining the approach to 
Graham’s remuneration following 
his death
  Reflecting another year of strong 
performance, determining that the 
Executive Directors earned bonuses 
equal to 72.8% and 65.5% of salary 
for Jonathan Murphy and Andrew 
Darke respectively. Further details of 
how this bonus outturn was 
calculated can be found on page 58.
  Making the first awards under 
Assura’s new PSP which will vest 
based upon performance against a 
blend of absolute NAV per share and 
TSR growth targets
  Confirming that the next outstanding 
tranche of the VCP awards could 
vest, the minimum TSR threshold 
having been met for that tranche (as 
described more fully on page 60).
Remuneration in 2017/18
We do not intend to alter our approach 
to executive remuneration in the 
forthcoming year, the main features 
of which will be:
  Base salaries: Jonathan Murphy’s 
and Andrew Darke’s base salaries 
will be £335,000 (unchanged) and 
£225,000 (increased by £5,000) 
respectively. 
  Annual bonus: We will retain the 
current approach to bonus target 
setting and assessment. Therefore, 
the performance objectives set under 
the annual bonus will continue to 
relate to matters such as value-added 
opportunities (within the portfolio and 
from market activity), financial targets, 
customer satisfaction, etc. Jonathan 
Murphy’s maximum bonus 
opportunity will be 100% (reflecting 
our policy for the CEO role), with 
Andrew Darke’s maximum bonus 
being 75% of salary. A deferred share 
element was introduced into the 
annual bonus plan as part of last 
year’s policy review, under which up 
to 50% of any bonus earned by an 
Executive Director is deferred into 
shares for two years to the extent 
that the Executive Director does not 
already hold shares worth at least 
300%. Clawback/malus provisions 
will continue to apply.
  Long-term incentives: A further 
round of awards will be made under 
the PSP over shares worth 150% 
of salary, which will vest based on 
performance against a blend of 
absolute NAV per share and TSR 
growth targets. A two-year post 
vesting holding period will also apply 
(unless shares worth 300% of salary 
are already held), with clawback/
malus provisions also applying.
In conclusion
I trust you find this report helpful and 
informative. I look forward to receiving 
your support for the resolution on the 
Annual Report on Remuneration at our 
forthcoming AGM.

POLICY AND PRACTICE 
“AT A GLANCE”
Shareholder approval was obtained at 
the 2016 AGM for a new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. This policy has 
been developed with regard to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and is felt 
to be appropriate to support the 
long-term success of the Company 
while ensuring that it does not promote 
inappropriate risk taking. More 
particularly, the policy is framed to 
support the Company’s strategic 
drivers, which are set out on pages 18 
and 19. The Committee aims for the 
policy and its use of performance 
metrics to support shareholder value 
creation by incentivising sustainable 
performance consistent with the 
strategic drivers and appropriate risk 
management and that:
  The interests of shareholders and 
management should be aligned
  Excessive risk taking should be 
discouraged and effective risk 
management given due consideration
  It should retain and motivate, based 
on selection and interpretation 
of appropriate benchmarks
  Poor performance should not 
be rewarded
  The long-term interests of the 
Company should be promoted.
Our goal is to maximise returns for 
shareholders over the long term. Our 
success is measured by three KPIs:
  Total Property Return – measuring 
income and capital appreciation 
generated from the portfolio.
  Total Accounting Return – measuring 
total reported returns for the 
Company after all overheads and 
including the effect of leverage.
  Total Shareholder Return – the 
dividend and capital appreciation 
experienced by shareholders.
Our remuneration arrangements either 
directly or indirectly encourage delivery 
of outstanding performance against 
these KPIs. The table below shows 
progress on the three KPIs over the last 
three years:
Total Property Return 24.1%
Total Accounting Return 28.0%
Total Shareholder Return 49.7%
Our full policy can be found in last 
year’s Report and on our website  
(www.assuraplc.com). However, for 
convenience we have set out opposite 
a summary of the policy’s key terms:
Remuneration Report continued
54  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Element Operation Maximum opportunity
Fixed remuneration
Base salary An Executive Director’s base salary is considered by the 
Committee on appointment and then reviewed 
periodically or when an individual changes position or 
responsibility. When making a determination as to the 
appropriate salary level, the Committee first considers 
remuneration practices within the Group as a whole and, 
where considered relevant, conducts objective research 
on companies within the Company’s peer group. The 
results of any benchmarking will only be one of many 
factors taken into account by the Committee. Other 
factors include:
  Individual performance and experience
  Pay and conditions for employees across the Group
  The general performance of the Company
  The economic environment.
In the normal course of events, increases in the Executive 
Directors’ salaries will not exceed the average increase for 
employees, save where there is a clear misalignment with 
market levels. However, individuals who are recruited or 
promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their 
salaries set below the targeted policy level until they 
become established in their role. In such cases 
subsequent increases in salary may be higher than 
the average until the target positioning is achieved.
Pension/benefits A market competitive suite of benefits is provided, which 
are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain 
appropriate.
Executive Directors can receive pension contributions to 
personal pension arrangements or, if a Director is 
impacted by annual or lifetime limits on contribution levels 
to qualifying pension plans, the balance (or all) can be 
paid as a cash supplement. 
Benefit values vary year on year depending on premiums 
and the maximum value is the cost of the provision of 
these benefits.
The maximum employer’s contribution is 20% of base 
salary. Actual contributions are currently 13.5% for the 
CEO and the Property Director.
Performance-based variable remuneration
Bonus Pay-outs may be made in a mix of cash and deferred 
shares determined by the Committee following the 
financial year end, based on achievement against 
a range of financial and strategic targets which 
may include (but are not limited to):
  Delivering specific added-value activities
  Delivering financial goals
  Improving operational performance
  Developing the performance capability of the team.
Bonus payments are not pensionable, but are subject 
to clawback provisions.
The maximum annual bonus for Executive Directors is 
100% of salary. At threshold performance 0% of 
maximum can be earned.
At target up to 75% of maximum can be earned.
Long-term incentives Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil/nominal 
cost options or conditional awards which vest to the 
extent performance conditions are satisfied over a period 
of at least three years, with a post vesting holding period 
also potentially applying. Vested awards may also be 
settled in cash. Clawback and malus provisions apply 
to PSP awards.
150% of base salary in normal circumstances (up 
to 300%, if the Committee considers that it is in 
shareholders’ interests to do so, e.g. if exceptional 
circumstances exist relating to a recruitment).
Shareholding requirement Executive Directors may not sell any shares acquired via 
any share-based incentive plan if the sale would take their 
shareholding below the shareholding requirement.
The Executive Directors are expected to acquire shares 
equal to at least 300% of their salary. At the Committee’s 
discretion this may be acquired over a timeframe 
determined by the Committee.
The full policy also provides full details of our approach to:
  Setting performance targets for the annual bonus and PSP
  Committee discretions
  Differences between our approach to remuneration for Executive Directors and the wider workforce
  Travel and hospitality
  Considering the views of our shareholders
  Recruitments, terminations and service contracts
  Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
  External appointments.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Illustrations of application of Remuneration Policy 
The policy of the Committee is to align Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders and to give the Executive 
Directors incentives to perform at the highest levels. To achieve this, the Committee seeks to ensure that a significant proportion 
of the remuneration package varies with the performance of the Company and that targets are aligned with the Company’s 
stated business objectives.
The composition and total value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration package for the financial year 2017/18 at minimum, 
on-target and maximum performance scenarios are set out in the charts below:

REMUNERATION – UNAUDITED 
UNLESS STATED
This Annual Report on Remuneration 
contains details of how the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy for Directors was 
implemented during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2017. This report has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
and the Regulations. An advisory 
resolution to approve this report will be 
put to shareholders at the AGM.
Consideration by the 
Committee of matters relating 
to Directors’ remuneration
The members of the Committee during 
2016/17 were Jenefer Greenwood 
(Committee Chairman), Simon Laffin 
and David Richardson. The members of 
the Committee have no personal 
financial interest, other than as 
shareholders, in matters to be decided, 
and no potential conflicts of interest 
arising from cross-directorships. Other 
than Mr Laffin, the Non-Executives have 
no day to day involvement in running 
the business.
The Committee is responsible for 
recommending to the Board the 
remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and the senior management 
and for setting the remuneration 
packages for each Executive Director. 
The Committee sets the fees of the 
Chairman and the fees for the Non-
Executive Directors are set by the 
Chairman in conjunction with the CEO. 
The Committee also has oversight of 
the remuneration policy and packages 
for other senior members of staff. The 
written Terms of Reference of the 
Committee are available on the 
Company’s website and from the 
Company on request.
The Committee held eight meetings 
during the year. Its activities during 
and relating to the financial year 
2016/17 included:
  Consideration of objectives and 
targets for annual bonuses
  Consideration of annual pay awards 
and bonuses
  Overseeing the continued vesting 
of awards under the VCP
  Commencing operation of the 
new PSP
  Addressing remuneration-related 
issues arising from the changes 
to the Executive Board
  Preparing this report.
Advisors to the Committee 
During 2016/17 the Committee received 
advice from FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP (“FIT”), its independent 
advisor. FIT is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and, 
as such, voluntarily operates under the 
code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The 
Committee reviewed the nature of the 
services provided by FIT and was 
satisﬁed that no conﬂict of interest 
exists or existed in the provision of 
these services. The total fees paid 
to FIT in respect of services to the 
Committee during the year were 
£42,500. Fees were determined based 
on the scope and nature of the projects 
undertaken for the Committee.
The Committee also sought the views 
of Jonathan Murphy during the year. 
The CEO is given notice of all meetings 
and, at the request of the Chairman 
of the Committee, attends part of the 
meetings. The CEO may request that

Benefits
Taxable benefits comprised health insurance, death in service benefits, critical illness, group income protection and company 
car allowance.
2016/17 annual bonus plan outcome 
In determining the award for 2016/17 , the Committee took into account the Company’s financial performance and achievements 
against key short-term objectives established at the beginning of the year. This involved establishing in advance what would constitute 
success for good, strong or outstanding performance. The performance targets and performance are summarised below.
It is the Committee’s approach to view the performance in the round at the end of the year, taking into account extraneous 
events and changing priorities, where relevant. The key success factors for the year were identified as continuing to increase the 
investment portfolio and to reduce the overall cost of borrowing. For 2016/17 the maximum potential bonus awards were 100% 
of salary for Graham Roberts as CEO and 75% of salary for Jonathan Murphy and Andrew Darke.
Following Graham Roberts’ resignation due to ill-health in June 2016 no bonus was paid to him relating to 2016/17.

The Committee reviewed the performance of Jonathan Murphy. His financial targets were as above, overall being rated Strong. 
His individual targets were to: develop a data analytic tool to financially appraise current and prospective tenants; deepen his 
understanding of the wider healthcare property market; sustain excellent communication with the Board; and deliver an 
operational efficiency and savings plan. The Committee concluded that Jonathan had performed strongly on all these 
objectives. It also noted that Jonathan assumed additional responsibility during the year following the resignation of Graham 
Roberts and was appointed Interim CEO on 1 October 2016, and confirmed as CEO on 27 February 2017.  
 
As a result, the Committee decided to award Jonathan a bonus of £177,652 equating to 72.8% (93.2% of maximum bonus) of 
his total salary (excluding the salary supplement paid to him while acting as Interim CEO). 
 
The Committee also considered the performance of Andrew Darke. His financial targets were as above, overall being 
rated Strong. 
His individual targets were to: strengthen and develop the property team; deepen his understanding of the wider healthcare 
property market; sustain excellent business performance communication with the Board; and continue to enhance the GP 
property market database.
The Committee concluded that Andrew had performed strongly on these objectives. As a result the Committee decided 
to award Andrew a bonus of £144,100, equivalent to 65.5% (87.3% of maximum bonus) of annual base salary. 
Up to 50% of any bonus earned by an Executive Director must be deferred into shares for two years to the extent that the 
Executive Director does not already hold shares worth at least 300% of salary. While Andrew Darke holds the requisite number 
of shares, Jonathan Murphy does not, resulting in a portion of his bonus being deferred. 
58  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Total pension entitlements
No Executive Director or any member of staff is entitled to a defined benefit pension arrangement. Graham Roberts, Jonathan 
Murphy and Andrew Darke received payments in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 20.0%, 13.5% and 13.5% of salary 
respectively for 2016/17.
Vesting of long-term incentive awards (audited)
Value Creation Plan
As reported previously, to take account of three significant capital raising events, certain adjustments were made to the VCP 
pay-out algorithm to ensure the potential VCP benefit created at each Measurement Date was:
  Attributable to management’s performance/achievement of the VCP performance conditions (i.e. an 8% p.a. return to 
shareholders must be achieved before any value is created for participants); and
  Aligned with the value created for shareholders during the relevant measurement period.
More particularly, the Committee amended the Threshold Price applicable to the first Measurement Date (i.e. 20 August 2015) 
whereby, for each capital raising event (to be known as “Tranches”), a Threshold Price was set which must be exceeded before 
any value could be earned by participants. The paragraphs below summarise the alterations.
The Threshold Price applicable to each Tranche of shares at the first Measurement Date was set as follows:
Tranche
Shares
(m) 
Original 
Threshold 
Price 
(pence)
New 
Threshold 
Price 
(pence)
Share capital at the start of the VCP 1 529.5 39.37 39.37
Capital issued for MP Realty Holdings Ltd acquisition 2 44.3 39.37 44.95
Capital issued following placing/offer to shareholders 3 414.3 39.37 45.06
Capital issued for Metro MRI Ltd acquisition 4 18.8 39.37 51.29
Each Tranche under the VCP was tested on the first Measurement Date and on 20 August 2015 was subject to the original 
terms and conditions of the VCP, except that, as shown above, each Tranche had its own Threshold Price.
At subsequent Measurement Dates (i.e. one and two years after the first Measurement Date), it was determined that the 
methodology for determining the Threshold Price for each Tranche will be the same whereby the Threshold Price for each 
Tranche will be the higher of:
  The highest return achieved at any previous Measurement Date (treated as separate Tranches); and
  8% p.a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital raising price/price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4 
(and others if further capital raising events occur).
Each Tranche has its own minimum return threshold which must be achieved before any awards earned and deferred at 
previous Measurement Dates vest at the second or third Measurement Dates. This means that awards rolled over (i.e. accrued 
but not vested) from previous Measurement Dates must sustain an 8% p.a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital 
raising price/price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4.
The maximum aggregate number of shares that can be issued to satisfy awards under the VCP to all participants remained 
limited to 25 million. Therefore, no adjustments were made to the cap on the number of shares that could be earned under the 
VCP as a result of the changes to the share capital.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information As previously reported, the first Measurement Date occurred on 20 August 2015. The table below sets out the actual value 
creation under the VCP as calculated at the first Measurement Date, using (as prescribed in the plan rules) the average share 
price over three months following the announcement of the Company’s financial results for the 2014/15 financial year plus 
dividends paid on shares in issue:

Value created C-T 21.9625 13.72 13.16 6.48
As per the VCP performance condition, the total participant benefit available was 10% of the above value created for each 
Tranche multiplied by the number of shares in each Tranche, which amounts in total to £17.8 million. As a consequence of the 
Company’s strong performance up to the first Measurement Date, the VCP units converted virtually in full into nil-cost options 
over 24,999,950 shares (out of the total 25 million pool). This resulted in Graham Roberts’ units converting into 11,779,255 
nil-cost options, Jonathan Murphy’s into 5,153,423 options and Andrew Darke’s into 5,889,627 options.
Under the rules, 50% of any shares that accrued at the first Measurement Date (in the form of nil-cost options) became 
exercisable at the first Measurement Date, 50% of the remainder become exercisable at the second and 100% at the third, 
provided the minimum return thresholds for each Tranche are achieved at each Measurement Date. 
On 25 September 2015 Messrs Roberts and Murphy exercised the first 50% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving 
(after the payment of income tax and NICs) 3,121,503 and 1,365,657 shares respectively. The share price on 25 September 2015 
was 54.25 pence.
On 30 August 2016 Messrs Murphy and Darke exercised the next 25% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving 
(after the payment of income tax and NICs) 682,829 and 780,376 shares respectively. The share price on 30 August 2016 
was 58.5 pence.
Graham Roberts held outstanding awards under the VCP on his death. The Committee exercised its discretion to allow these 
outstanding awards (including the Tranche that was due to vest in 2017) to vest at the same time as the 2016 award using the 
minimum return threshold used in 2016 (this award already having provisionally vested in full in 2015). 
The impact of the conversion of the Executive Directors’ units into nil-cost options and the above exercises is set out in the table below:

monitors the levels of share grants and the impact of these on the ongoing requirement for shares. In accordance with 
guidelines set out by the Investment Association the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital 
in a rolling 10-year period to employees under all its share plans, with an inner 5% limit applying to discretionary plans.
There has been no movement in Directors’ shareholdings since the year end.
Performance graph and table
The Committee believes that the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the supporting reward structure provide clear 
alignment with the Company’s performance. The Committee believes it is appropriate to monitor the Company’s performance 
against the FTSE All Share Real Estate Investment Trusts index for these purposes.

1. Both Graham Roberts’ and Jonathan Murphy’s remuneration details have been included as they both served as CEO during the year.
2. Includes base salary, taxable benefits, bonus payments for the relevant financial year, long-term incentive awards that vested for performance related 
to the financial year and cash in lieu of pension.
3. Nigel Rawlings ceased to be a Director with effect from 30 April 2012. The bonus of £100,000 was a one-off award reflecting his contribution to selling 
the Pharmacy business.
4. Richard Burrell ceased to be a Director on 15 March 2010.
5. During the financial year 2009/10 Richard Burrell was CEO from 1 April 2009 until 15 March 2010 when Nigel Rawlings assumed the position. The 
amounts above are therefore reflective of the relative lengths of service.
Percentage change in the CEO’s remuneration
The table below compares the percentage increase in the CEO’s pay (including salary and fees, taxable benefits and annual 
bonus) with the wider employee population. The Company considers the 43 full-time employee population, excluding the 
Executive Board, to be an appropriate comparator group:

The remuneration of Graham Roberts on his death was approached as follows:
  Graham received his usual pay, pension and car allowance plus contractual benefits up to his death. 
  Graham did not receive any bonus relating to the year.
  Graham held outstanding awards under the VCP on his death. The Committee exercised its discretion to allow these 
outstanding awards (including the Tranche that was due to vest in 2017) to vest at the same time as the 2016 award using the 
minimum return threshold used in 2016 (these awards already having provisionally vested in full in 2015).

Executive Directors
Salary
In setting salary levels for 2017/18 for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered a number of factors, including 
individual performance and experience, pay and conditions for employees across the Group, the general performance of the 
Company, pay levels in other comparable companies and the economic environment. The salaries for 2017/18 and the relative 
increases are set out below:

Notes
1. Jonathan Murphy’s salary at the 2016/17 year end. 
2. Salary on appointment as Director. 
Pension and benefits
As was the case last year, Jonathan Murphy and Andrew Darke will receive payments in lieu of pension contributions equivalent 
to 13.5% of salary respectively. Benefits will be provided in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2017/18 will be 100% of salary for Jonathan Murphy and 75% of salary for Andrew Darke.
The performance objectives under the annual bonus plan for 2017/18 will continue to relate to value-added opportunities, 
within the portfolio and from market activity and financial targets. The Committee is of the opinion that the precise performance 
targets for the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose 
them before the start of the financial year. Appropriate levels of disclosure of the actual targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-
outs. The Committee will also follow the practice of previous years and view the weightings for bonus purposes at the end of the 
year, having regard to all known factors.
As was the case with the 2016/17 bonus, a deferred share element will apply, under which up to 50% of any bonus earned by 
an Executive Director will be deferred into shares for two years to the extent that the Executive Director does not already hold 
shares worth at least 300% of salary.
Long-term incentives
A further grant of awards will be made under the PSP to Jonathan Murphy and Andrew Darke over shares worth 150% of salary 
which will vest subject to the extent to which the following performance conditions are satisfied. A post vesting holding period 
will also apply to the extent that, on vesting, a participant does not comply with the shareholding guideline in place at that time 
(currently 300% of salary).

Financial and business 
reporting
The Directors present their Annual 
Report and Accounts on the affairs of 
the Group, together with the financial 
statements and auditor’s report, for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. The 
Corporate Governance Statement set 
out on page 41 forms part of this report.
The Directors’ Report and the other 
sections of this Annual Report contain 
forward-looking statements. The extent 
to which the Company’s shareholders 
or anyone may rely on these forward-
looking statements is set out in the 
Glossary on page 105.
Principal activities
Assura plc is a leading primary care 
property investor and developer. It owns 
and procures good quality primary care 
properties across the UK.
The subsidiary and associated 
undertakings are listed in Note 9 
to the accounts.
Business review
The Group is required to include a 
business review in this report. The 
information that fulfils the requirements 
of the business review can be found on 
pages 34 to 39, which are incorporated 
in this report by reference. 
Going concern 
Assura’s business activities together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
performance are set out in the business 
review on pages 34 to 39. In addition, 
Note 23 to the accounts includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has facilities from a number 
of financial institutions, none of which 
are repayable before May 2021 other 
than modest annual amortisation. In 
addition to surplus available cash of  
£23.3 million at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
£43.7 million), the Group has undrawn 
facilities of £100 million at the balance 
sheet date.
The Group’s primary care property 
developments in progress are all 
substantially pre-let.
The Group has adequate headroom in 
its banking covenants. The Group has 
been in compliance with all financial 
covenants on its loans throughout 
the year.
The Group’s properties are substantially 
let with rent paid or reimbursed by the 
NHS and they benefit from a weighted 
average lease length of 13.2 years. They 
are diverse both geographically and 
by lot size and therefore represent 
excellent security.
The Group’s financial forecasts show 
that borrowing facilities are adequate 
and the business can operate within 
these facilities and meet its obligations 
when they fall due for the foreseeable 
future. The Directors believe that the 
business is well placed to manage its 
current and reasonably possible future 
risks successfully.
Accordingly, the Board considers it 
appropriate that the financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern 
basis of accounting and there are no 
material uncertainties to the Company’s 
ability to continue to prepare them on 
this basis over a period of at least 12 
months.
Long-term viability statement 
The Company’s viability statement is on 
page 29.
Internal controls and 
risk management
The Board accepts and acknowledges 
that it is both accountable and 
responsible for ensuring that the Group 
has in place appropriate and effective 
risk management and internal control 
systems, including financial, operational 
and compliance control systems.
The Board monitors these systems on 
an ongoing basis and this year’s review 
found them to be operating effectively. 
Dividends
Details of the dividend can be found 
in Note 19 to the accounts. The Group 
benefits from brought forward tax 
losses, which results in all dividends 
paid during the year being paid as 
ordinary dividends with an associated 
tax credit.
Details of the Group’s dividend policy 
can be found in the business review on 
page 37.
Supplier payment policy
The Group has not signed up to any 
specific supplier payment code; it is 
Assura’s policy to comply with the 
terms of payment agreed with its 
suppliers. Where specific payment 
terms are not agreed, the Group 
endeavours to adhere to the suppliers’ 
standard payment terms. As at 31 
March 2017, the average number of 
days taken by the Group to pay its 
suppliers was 10 days (2016: 22 days). 
Post balance sheet events
Subsequent to the year end, the 
revolving credit facility has been 
extended to £250 million.
Directors’ liability insurance
The Company has arranged insurance 
cover in respect of legal action against 
its Directors.

68  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
have also chosen to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements under 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under 
company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, 
IAS 1 requires that Directors:
  Properly select and apply accounting 
policies
  Present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information
  Provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
  Make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
  The financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
  The strategic report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
  The Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position and 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risk
The key risk that we identified in the current year was the valuation of the property portfolio excluding properties under development.
Materiality
The materiality applied in the current year was £16.0 million, which was determined on the basis of 2% of net assets, and specific 
materiality applied was £1.9 million, which was determined on the basis of 5% of EPRA earnings (as defined on page 38).
Significant changes in our approach
The following significant changes in our approach from the prior year comprise:
Materiality
  In the prior year materiality was determined with reference to profit before tax, of which it represented 5%, whereas for the current 
year we have determined materiality for the Group based upon net assets with a lower specific materiality based upon the EPRA 
profit measure. 
Risk identification
  In the prior year we identified a key risk in relation to acquisitions. Although the Group has made corporate acquisitions in the year 
ended 31 March 2017, this was not an area that had a significant effect on our audit strategy nor the allocation of resources in the 
audit, hence it is not considered to be a key risk in the current year.
  We have also refined our key risk regarding valuation of the property portfolio to exclude the valuation of properties under 
development as a significant risk of material misstatement. 
70  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained on page 66 of the Directors’ Report 
and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the 
Group contained within the Strategic Report on page 29.
We are required to state whether we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:
  the Directors’ confirmation on page 28 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
  the disclosures on pages 30 to 33 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
  the Directors’ statement on page 66 of the Directors’ Report 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
  the Directors’ explanation on page 29 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify any material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those 
standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risk of material misstatement described below is that which had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Valuation of property portfolio excluding properties under development
Risk description
The Group owns and manages a portfolio of 398 modern primary healthcare properties that are carried at fair value in the financial 
statements. The portfolio is valued at £1,315.3 million as at 31 March 2017 and comprises the majority of the assets in the Group 
balance sheet. 
The Group uses professionally qualified external valuers, Savills and Jones Lang LaSalle (“the Valuers”), to fair value the Group’s 
portfolio twice annually. The Valuers are engaged by the Directors and perform their work in accordance with the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation – Professional Standards. The Valuers used by the Group are well-known firms and have 
considerable experience in the markets in which the Group operates.
The valuation of the portfolio is inherently subjective and is underpinned by a number of assumptions. The existence of significant 
estimation uncertainty, coupled with the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property valuations, when 
aggregated, could result in a material misstatement on the income statement and balance sheet, warrants specific audit focus in this 
area.
In determining a property’s valuation, the Valuers take into account property-specific information such as current tenancy agreements 
and rental income attached to the asset. The portfolio (excluding development properties) is valued by the investment method of 
valuation. Key inputs into the valuation exercise are yields and Estimated Rental Value (“ERV”), which are influenced by prevailing 
market yields, comparable market transactions and the specific characteristics of each property in the portfolio. 
Valuation of property represents a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group, as described in the Group’s accounting policies 
on page 80, and a significant financial reporting matter considered by the Audit Committee, as described on page 51. 
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Given the inherent subjectivity involved in the valuation of investment properties, the need for deep market knowledge when 
determining the most appropriate assumptions, and the technicalities of a valuation methodology, we engaged our internal valuation 
specialists (qualified chartered surveyors) to assist us in our audit of this key risk area.
We read the valuation reports for all properties and attended meetings with each of the Valuers. We confirmed that the valuation approach 
for each was in accordance with RICS guidance and suitable for use in determining the carrying value in the Group balance sheet.
We assessed the Valuers’ qualifications and expertise and read their terms of engagement with the Group to determine whether there 
were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or may have imposed scope limitations upon their work. We also considered 
other engagements which exist between the Group and the Valuers. 
We carried out procedures, on a sample basis, to test whether property-specific data supplied to the Valuers by management reflected 
the underlying property records held by the Group and which had been tested during our audit. 
We assessed management’s process for reviewing and challenging the work of the external Valuers, including management’s experience 
and knowledge to undertake this activity. We observed discussions between management and the Valuers which evidenced that 
alternative assumptions and recent market transactions were considered and evaluated before the final valuation was determined.
We compared the yields used by the Valuers to an estimated range of expected yields, determined via reference to published 
benchmarks, and to recent transactions. We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are not so readily 
comparable to published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value and void rates. Additionally, we evaluated year-on-year 
movements in capital value with reference to published benchmarks. Where assumptions were outside the expected range or 
otherwise deemed unusual, and/or valuations appeared to experience unexpected movements, we undertook further investigations 
and, when necessary, held further discussions with the Valuers in order to challenge the assumptions.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the degree of the estimation and sensitivity to key assumptions 
made when valuing these properties disclosed in Note 10. 
Key observations
We found that the assumptions used in the valuations were supportable in light of available and comparable market evidence.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
72  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Materiality Overall Group materiality 
£16.0 million. 
Specific Group materiality  
£1.9 million. Applied to EPRA 
impacting balances.
Basis for determining materiality 2% of net assets. <5% of EPRA earnings.
Rationale for the benchmark applied In arriving at this judgement we had regard 
to the carrying value of the Group’s assets, 
acknowledging that the primary 
performance measure of the Group is the 
carrying value of investment property.
In addition to net assets, we consider 
EPRA earnings to be a critical financial 
performance measure for the Group and we 
applied a lower threshold of £1.9 million based 
on less than 5% of that measure for testing 
of all impacted balances, classes 
of transactions and disclosures.
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.5 million for 2015/16. This was determined with reference to 
profit before tax, of which it represented 5%. For 2016/17 we have determined materiality for the Group based upon net assets with a 
lower specific materiality based upon the EPRA profit measure. Given the growth in the business through acquisitions, we consider that 
these two measures better align with the principal considerations of the shareholders of the Group, and are more aligned to practices 
observed with industry peers. This is a change to the approach adopted last year. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £800,000 (2016: £30,000), 
or £95,000 for differences impacting EPRA, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its internal and external environment. This included 
assessing Group-wide controls, assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level, and in particular looking at where the 
Directors make subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates or adoption of accounting policies that 
are underpinned by a number of assumptions. As in all our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The Group is audited in its entirety by the Group audit team. Our audit work on the individual subsidiary entities was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality. This results in full scope audit procedures performed 
on 99% of the Group’s net assets. At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to 
conclude that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
  the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
www.assuraplc.com  73
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if 
in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we 
have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the accounts 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 
 
1. Corporate information and operations 
Assura plc (“Assura”) is incorporated in England and Wales and the Company’s Ordinary Shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. 
As of 1 April 2013, the Group has elected to be treated as a UK REIT. See Note 6 for further details. 
2. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments 
and investment properties, including investment properties under construction and land which are included at fair value. The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and interpretations adopted by the European Union 
and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Standards affecting the financial statements 
The following standards and amendments became effective for the Company in the year ended 31 March 2017. The 
pronouncements either had no material impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes in presentation and 
disclosure only: 
n Annual improvements 2010–2012 cycle 
n Annual improvements 2011–2013 cycle 
Standards in issue not yet effective 
The following standards and amendments are in issue as at the date of the approval of these financial statements, but are not yet 
effective for the Company. The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed below will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Company in future periods but are continuing to assess the potential impact (effective for 
periods beginning on or after the date in brackets). In particular, lease income is outside the scope of IFRS 15 and as the Group is 
a lessor, IFRS 16 is not expected to materially impact the treatment of leases to tenants.  
n IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (1 January 2018)  
n IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (1 January 2018) 
n IFRS 16 Leases (not yet endorsed in the EU)  
n Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of share-based payment transactions (1 January 2018) 
n Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative (1 January 2017) 
n Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (1 January 2017) 
n Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle 
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors’ Report on page 66 and are 
presented in sterling.  
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, liabilities and cash flows of entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements. All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation. 
Key sources of estimation and uncertainty  
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are discussed below. 
Property valuations 
The key source of estimation and uncertainty relates to the valuation of the property portfolio, where a valuation is obtained 
twice a year from professionally qualified external valuers. The evidence to support these valuations is based primarily on recent, 
comparable market transactions on an arm’s length basis. However, the assumptions applied are inherently subjective and so 
are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Property valuations are one of the principal uncertainties of the Group. Details of the 
accounting policies applied in respect of valuation are set out on page 80 and they key unobservable inputs relating to the 
valuations are set out in Note 10.

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors do not consider there to be 
significant judgements applied with regards to the policies adopted.  
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities. 
In the Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment. In addition, the 
Company recognises dividend income when the rights to receive payment have been established (normally when declared and 
paid). 
Where properties are acquired through the purchase of a corporate entity but the transaction does not meet the definition of 
a business combination under IFRS 3, the purchase is treated as an asset acquisition. Where the acquisition is considered a 
business combination, the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is held 
as goodwill, initially recognised at cost with subsequent impairment assessments completed at least annually. Where the initial 
calculation of goodwill arising is negative, this is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Property portfolio 
Properties are externally valued on an open market basis, which represents fair value, as at the balance sheet date and are 
recorded at valuation. 
Any surplus or deficit arising on revaluing investment properties and investment property under construction (“IPUC”) is recognised 
in the income statement. 
All costs associated with the purchase and construction of IPUC are capitalised including attributable interest. Interest is 
calculated on the expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant and otherwise on the average rate applicable to 
short-term loans. When IPUC are completed, they are classified as investment properties.  
In determining whether leases and related properties represent operating or finance leases, consideration is given to whether the 
tenant or landlord bears the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development 
properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value. 
Where an investment property is held under a head lease it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on 
acquisition and the present value of minimum ground rent payments. The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder is 
included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.  
The market value of investment property as estimated by an external valuer is increased for the unamortised pharmacy lease 
premium held at the balance sheet date. 
Net rental income 
Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. A rent adjustment 
based on open market estimated rental value is recognised from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews. 
Pharmacy lease premiums received from tenants are spread over the lease term, even if the receipts are not received on such 
a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease.  
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through 
service charges is charged to the income statement.

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Gains on sale of properties 
Gains on sale of properties are recognised on the completion of the contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value 
at the end of the previous reporting period, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted 
as appropriate.  
Other investments are shown at amortised cost and held as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate.  
Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs are spread over the period to redemption at a constant rate on the carrying amount 
of the liability.  
Financial instruments 
Where the Group uses derivative financial instruments, in the form of interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with 
interest rate fluctuations they are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at their fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments. The resulting gains or losses are 
recognised through the income statement.  
Cash equivalents are limited to instruments with a maturity of less than three months. 
Tax 
Current tax is expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period and is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable (or tax deductible). 
Deferred tax is provided on items that may become taxable at a later date, on the difference between the balance sheet value 
and tax base value.  
Income statement definitions 
EPRA earnings represents profit calculated in accordance with the guide published by the European Public Real Estate 
Association. See Note 7 for details of the adjustments. Underlying profit is no longer reported to avoid confusion, being very similar 
to the industry standard EPRA EPS measure which is now reported. 
Capital and other represents all other statutory income statement items that are excluded from EPRA earnings. 
Employee costs 
Defined contribution pension plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Share-based employee remuneration 
Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which 
they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight line basis. The fair value of share 
options is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors 
including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk free interest rate. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been 
applied to share options granted. 
Segmental information 
The Group is run as one business and as such no segmental analysis is presented for the current or prior year results.

Expenses not deductible for tax purposes – 0.6 
Movement in unrecognised deferred tax (0.5) 0.5 
 (0.1) 0.9 
The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 April 2013. The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Group’s 
property rental business from corporation tax. Gains on properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for 
trading or sold in the three years post completion of development. The Group will otherwise be subject to corporation tax at 19% 
in 2018 (2017: 20%). 
The Group tax (credit)/charge relates to its non-property income. As the Group has sufficient brought forward tax losses, no tax 
is due and so the amount represents the movement in deferred tax. The movement in part relates to brought forward losses 
that have been utilised during the year, with the remainder representing a change in the estimated losses that will be utilised 
in the future.  
As a REIT, the Group is required to pay Property Income Distributions (“PIDs”) equal to at least 90% of the Group’s rental profit 
calculated by reference to tax rules rather than accounting standards. In the year to 31 March 2016, the taxable rental profit of 
the Group was £nil as a result of capital allowances available, and consequently no PID was required. A small PID is expected to 
be required for the year to 31 March 2017 which will be distributed in due course within the usual quarterly dividends and in 
advance of the payment deadline of 31 March 2018. 
To remain as a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Group’s 
qualifying activities and the balance of business. The Group remains compliant at 31 March 2017. 
Further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have been substantively enacted; the rate reduced to 19% from 1 April 2017 
and will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax.

potential issuance of a further 3.2 million (2016: 11.2 million) shares in September 2017. Options issued under the PSP are not 
currently considered dilutive.

10. Property assets 
Investment property and investment property under construction (“IPUC”) 
Properties are stated at fair value, which has been determined for the Group by Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang 
LaSalle as at 31 March 2017. The properties have been valued individually and on the basis of open market value in accordance 
with RICS Valuation – Professional Standards 2014 (“the Red Book”). Valuers are paid on the basis of a fixed fee arrangement, 
subject to the number of properties valued. 
Initial yields mainly range from 4.40% to 5.00% (2016: 4.65% to 5.25%) for prime units, increasing up to 8.00% (March 2016: 
6.15%) for older units with shorter unexpired lease terms. For properties with weaker tenants and poorer units, the yields 
range from 6.00% to 12.00% (March 2016: 6.15% and over 8.0%) and higher for those very close to lease expiry or those 
approaching obsolescence.  
A 0.25% shift of valuation yield would have approximately a £68.1 million (2016: £54.2 million) impact on the investment 
property valuation.

10. Property assets continued 
Descriptions and definitions relating to valuation techniques and key unobservable inputs made in determining fair values are 
as follows: 
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 3 fair values  
The valuations have been prepared on the basis of fair market value which is defined in the RICS Valuation Standards as “the 
estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an 
arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.” 
Unobservable inputs 
These include: estimated rental value (“ERV”) based on market conditions prevailing at the valuation date; estimated average 
increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual situations; equivalent yield (defined as the weighted average 
of the net initial yield and reversionary yield); and the physical condition of the property determined by inspections on a 
rotational basis. A decrease in the ERV would decrease market value. A decrease in the equivalent yield would increase the 
market value. An increase in the remaining lease term would increase the fair value. 
11. Property, plant and equipment 
The Group holds computer and other equipment assets with cost of £1.0 million (2016: £0.7 million) and accumulated 
depreciation of £0.6 million (2016: £0.5 million), giving a net book value of £0.4 million (2016: £0.2 million). 
Additions during the year were £0.3 million (2016: £0.2 million) and depreciation charged to the income statement was £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.1 million).

The Group has the following bank facilities: 
1. 10-year senior secured bond for £110 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.75% maturing in December 2021. The secured bond 
carries a loan to value (“LTV”) covenant of 75% (70% at the point of substitution of an investment property or cash) and an 
interest cover requirement of 1.15 times (1.5 times at the point of substitution). In addition, the bond is subject to a WAULT 
covenant of 10 years which, if breached, gives the bondholder the option to change the facility to an amortising basis.  
2. Loans from Aviva Commercial Finance with an aggregate balance of £213.8 million at 31 March 2017 (2016: £217.8 million). 
The Aviva loans are partially amortised by way of quarterly instalments and partially repaid by way of bullet repayments falling 
due between 2024 and 2044 with a weighted average term of 13.8 years to maturity; £4.3 million is due within a year. These 
loans are secured by way of charges over specific medical centre investment properties with cross-collateralisation between 
the loans and security. The loans are subject to fixed all-in interest rates ranging between 4.11% and 6.66% and a weighted 
average of 5.43%. The loans carry a debt service cover covenant of 1.05 times and an LTV covenant of 70%, calculated 
across all loans and secured properties. 
 In November 2015, in line with the debt reduction plan announced in the Prospectus for the October 2015 equity raise, 
£182.0 million of loans were repaid along with associated early repayment costs of £34.1 million. 
3. Five-year club revolving credit facility with RBS, HSBC, Santander and Barclays for £200 million on an unsecured basis at an 
initial margin of 1.50% above LIBOR, expiring in May 2021. The margin increases based on the LTV of the subsidiaries to 
which the facility relates, up to 2.0% where the LTV is in excess of 50%. The facility is subject to a historical interest cover 
requirement of at least 175%, maximum LTV of 60% and a weighted average lease length of seven years. As at 31 March 
2017, £100 million of this facility was drawn. This facility replaced the previous £120 million secured revolving credit facility. 
Subsequent to the year end, the available facility has been increased to £250 million. 
4. 10-year notes in the US private placement market for a total of £100 million. The notes are unsecured, have a fixed interest 
rate of 2.65% and were drawn on 13 October 2016. The facility is subject to a historical interest cover requirement of at least 
175%, maximum LTV of 60% and a weighted average lease length of seven years. 
The Group has been in compliance with all financial covenants on all of the above loans as applicable throughout the year.

to discharge the monetary liability for the acquisition of investment properties held in corporate vehicles. The shares were valued 
based on the closing share price the day before issuance with this amount appropriately allocated between share capital and 
share premium.

A scrip dividend alternative was introduced with effect from the January 2016 quarterly dividend. Details of shares issued in lieu 
of dividend payments can be found in Note 18. 
The dividends paid do not include any PIDs as defined under the REIT regime. 
20. Share-based payments 
As at 31 March 2017, the Group had two long-term incentive schemes in place – the Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) and the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
The long-term incentive arrangements are structured so as to align the incentives of relevant Executives with the long-term 
performance of the business and to motivate and retain key members of staff. To the extent practicable long-term incentives 
are provided through the use of share-based (or share-fulfilled) remuneration to provide alignment of objectives with the Group’s 
shareholders. Long-term incentive awards are granted by the Remuneration Committee, which reviews award levels on a case 
by case basis. 
As at 31 March 2017, the Employee Benefit Trust held a total of 61,898 (2016: 1,256,714) Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each 
in Assura plc. Previous long-term incentive plans have lapsed without vesting. 
Value Creation Plan 
As at 31 March 2017, a total of 3,305,149 nil-cost options were outstanding to employees (including 2,760,761 outstanding to 
Executive Directors as detailed in the Remuneration Committee Report).  
Participants have the opportunity to receive 10% of the total value created for shareholders above a threshold price determined 
at three Measurement Dates in a five-year measurement period from March 2012 to March 2017. Before any awards vest, which 
are granted as nil-cost options on conversion of any value created, a minimum level of Total Shareholder Return of 8% per annum 
compound growth from the Base Price at each Measurement Date must be achieved.  
At the first Measurement Date in August 2015, nil-cost options over 24,999,450 Ordinary Shares were awarded to scheme 
participants. 50% of these were exercisable in September 2015 with the remainder exercisable in 2016 or 2017 subject to 
achievement of certain performance hurdles. Further details in respect of the VCP are provided in the Remuneration Committee 
Report on pages 59 and 60. 
Performance Share Plan 
During the year, 1,137,931 nil-cost options were awarded to Executive Directors under the newly created PSP. Participants’ 
awards will vest if certain targets relating to TSR and growth in NAV are met, as detailed in the Remuneration Committee Report.

20. Share-based payments continued 
The fair value of the newly issued PSP equity settled units granted during the year was estimated as at the date of grant using the 
Stochastic Model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which units were granted. The following table lists the inputs 
to the models used for the year ended 31 March 2017: 
 2017 
Expected share price volatility (%) 23 
Risk free interest rate (%) 0.03 
Expected life of units (years) 3 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily 
be the actual outcome. 
The fair value of the units granted in 2017 was £454,600 based on the market price at the date the units were granted. This cost 
is allocated over the vesting period. The cost allocation for all outstanding units in the period was a charge of £318,000 (2016: 
£468,500) and a credit has been recorded during the year in respect of the lower than expected employer national insurance 
contributions payable on the awards that vested during the period so that the total income statement charge was £0.1 million 
(2016: £1.9 million). 
As at 31 March 2017, 1,137,931 share options were outstanding (2016: nil).

23. Derivatives and other financial instruments 
The Group holds cash and liquid resources as well as having debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.  
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments and properties are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and 
capital risk. The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into 
with the Group.  
In the event of a default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental income shortfall and may incur additional costs, 
including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property. Given the nature of the Company’s tenants and 
enhanced rights of landlords who can issue proceedings and enforcement by bailiffs, defaults are rare and potential defaults are 
managed carefully by the credit control department. The maximum credit exposure in aggregate is one quarter’s rent of circa 
£18 million; however, this amount derives from all the tenants in the portfolio and such a scenario is hypothetical. The Group’s 
credit risk is well spread across circa 800 tenants at any one time. Furthermore the bulk of the Group’s property income derives 
from the NHS or is reimbursed by the NHS, which has an obligation to ensure that patients can be seen and treated and steps 
in when GPs are unable to practise, hence the risk of default is minimal. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.

23. Derivatives and other financial instruments continued 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments. 
Investments in property are relatively illiquid; however, the Group has tried to mitigate this risk by investing in modern purpose 
built medical centres which are let to GPs and NHS PropCo. In order to progress its property investment and development 
programme, the Group needs access to bank and equity finance, both of which may be difficult to raise notwithstanding the 
quality, long lease length, NHS backing, and geographical and lot size diversity of its property portfolio. 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring that it has a spread of sources and maturities. 
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio. These non-cancellable leases have 
remaining terms of up to 30 years and have a weighted average lease length of 13.2 years. All leases are subject to revision of 
rents according to various rent review clauses. Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases along 
with trade and other receivable as at 31 March are as follows:

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities, including interest, at 31 March 2017 and 
31 March 2016 based on contractual undiscounted payments at the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. 
The total contracted discounted payments are higher than the total minimum rentals receivable due to the rent receivable not 
including any residual values on properties at the end of the lease contract. In practice, the Group expects a significant renewal 
of leases at the end of the lease term.

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s cash deposits and, as debt 
is utilised, long-term debt obligations. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using fixed rate debt, or by interest rate 
swaps, for the majority of loans and borrowings although the Group will accept some exposure to variable rates where deemed 
appropriate and restricted to one third of the loan book. The swaps are revalued to their market value by reference to market 
interest rates at each balance sheet date. 
The ageing analysis of the financial assets and liabilities excluding trade receivables and payables of the Group at 31 March 2017

In November 2011 the Group issued a £110.0 million 10-year senior secured bond at 4.75%. 
Aviva loans decreased during the period to £213.8 million (2016: £217.8 million). The Aviva loans are partially amortised by way 
of quarterly instalments and partially repaid by way of bullet repayments falling due between 2024 and 2044. £4.3 million 
is due within a year. These loans are secured by way of charges over specific medical centre investment properties with  
cross-collateralisation between the loans and security. The loans are subject to fixed all-in interest rates ranging between  
4.11% and 6.66%. 
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £200 million which expires in 2021. Interest is charged at an initial rate of LIBOR 
plus 1.5%, subject to LTV.

The Group is exposed to the valuation impact on investor sentiment of long-term interest rate expectations, which can impact 
transactions in the market and increase or decrease valuations accordingly. 
Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain 
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may make disposals, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders or issue new shares.  
The Group monitors capital structure with reference to LTV, which is calculated as net debt divided by total property. The LTV 
percentage on this basis is 37% at 31 March 2017 (30% at 31 March 2016).

Group accounts. 
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 4. a) to the Group accounts. Disclosure of individual

The Company directly holds investments in Assura Group Limited and Assura IH Limited, which are both intermediate holding 
companies for the property owning subsidiaries in the Assura plc group. 
During the period the Company received a dividend of £150 million from its wholly owned subsidiary company, Assura Group 
Limited, which was settled by clearing an intercompany balance owed by Assura plc to Assura Group Limited. The resulting 
reduction in net assets of Assura Group Limited led to management completing an impairment assessment of the investment held 
in Assura Group Limited. Following this assessment, an impairment charge of £111.7 million was recorded. A corresponding 
amount has been transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings which is considered distributable.

F. Risk management 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with 
the Company.  
Credit risks within the Company derive from non-payment of loan balances. However, as the balances are receivable from 
subsidiary companies the risk of default is considered minimal. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.  
The Company balance sheet largely comprises illiquid assets in the form of investments in subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries, 
which have been used to finance property investment and development activities. Accordingly the realisation of these assets may 
take time and may not achieve the values at which they are carried in the balance sheet. 
The Company had trade and other payables of £1.0 million at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: £1.5 million). 
There are no differences between the book value of cash and trade payables, nor is there any meaningful interest rate sensitivity.
