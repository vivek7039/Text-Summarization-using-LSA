Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder,
During 2017 conditions for the oil and gas 
industry worldwide and for Russia generally 
have been more stable than in the recent 
past. This stability has enabled Volga Gas to 
undertake important steps to enhance its 
operations materially, the most important 
of which was switching the gas sweetening 
process utilised at the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant, the Group’s principal 
production facility, to a Redox-based system. 
This has reduced the chemical costs of the 
operation and has eliminated the need to 
dispose of bulky spent processing chemicals. 
During the implementation of this process, 
and whilst the operational team optimises 
the management of the new process, the 
plant throughput has had to be reduced. 
However, with the improved oil and gas 
market conditions, this has not had as 
material an impact on the Group’s revenues 
in 2017 as may otherwise have occurred.
The change to a Redox gas sweetening 
process was achieved with only modest 
capital expenditure as minimal modifications 
to the existing plant were required. 
During 2017 , the main focus of the capital 
investment was in two projects that are 
expected to provide incremental revenues 
material impact in reducing the operating 
profits of the Group to US$0.1 million 
(2016: US$2.51 million), due to an increase 
in the depletion charge to US$8.6 million 
(2016: US$5.0 million). Further details of 
the impact of the reduction of the reserves 
are set out in the operating and financial 
reviews between pages 6 and 11.
In spite of the reduction in reserves, the 
Group still holds significant, fully developed 
reserves in its three principal fields. These 
reserves form the basis of sustainable 
production with growth potential in the near 
term. These assets provide a platform for 
the Group to grow in the future, through 
successful exploration and by selective  
value-accretive acquisitions. The Board 
believes that Volga Gas has a stable 
foundation and the financial and 
operational capability to develop and 
extend these assets to provide long-
term value for our shareholders.
The Board remains committed to a policy 
of enhanced dividend distribution and 
is planning to modify its dividend policy 
towards higher rates of distribution, having 
in mind the requirements of the business and 
the need to maintain its financial strength. 
Within these constraints, the Board would 
consider distributing up to 75% of its free 
cash flow as dividends. For the time being 
however, the Board considers it prudent 
to defer a decision on the dividend level 
until the incremental cash flow from the 
investments undertaken in 2017 begins to be 
realised. A further decision will be taken by 
the interim results stage in September 2018.
While the immediate outlook for the oil 
industry remains broadly positive, the 
finances of the Group will continue to be 
conservatively managed. Capital investment 
commitments will continue to be at a 
modest rate and focused on enhancing 
the profits from the gas and condensate 
production and on optimising the production 
from the reserves of the Company.

and cash flow to the Group: the construction 
of a plant at the gas processing facility to 
capture for sale the liquid petroleum gases 
(“LPG”) – propane and butane – that are 
currently vented and flared; and the drilling 
of a new horizontal oil well to access the 
hitherto undeveloped reserves in the Uzen 
oil field located in the Group’s Karpenskiy 
licence area. The LPG project is expected to 
commence producing and selling product 
from April 2018. When it is fully operational, 
the LPG plant could add up to 400 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day of incremental 
sales volumes. These projects are discussed 
in greater detail by the Chief Executive 
Officer in the Operational Review.
Given the constraints to gas and condensate 
production experienced in 2017 , the Board 
is pleased to report that revenues have been 
broadly maintained at US$37.1 million (2016: 
US$39.4 million), EBITDA at US$8.8 million 
(2016: US$9.6 million) and operating cash 
flow before working capital movements at 
US$9.0 million (2016: US$10.4 million). This 
has enabled the Group to undertake an 
increased capital expenditure programme 
during 2017 and, in spite of some overruns 
in the costs of the Uzen horizontal well, to 
end the year with healthy cash balances 
and remain in a positive net cash position 
after taking into account borrowings. This 
is in addition to paying US$5.0 million in 
dividends to shareholders in 2017 (2016: nil).
Unfortunately, Volga Gas has recently 
experienced higher formation water content 
at certain production wells at Vostochny 
Makarovskoye (“VM”) and so the Board 
thought it appropriate to commission an 
updated independent reserves report and 
prudent to adopt its findings in full. This 
report, dated 12 April 2018, has resulted in 
a 27% reduction in the proved reserves and 
a 28% reduction in the proved and probable 
reserves of oil, gas and condensate and 
we are actively looking into technical and 
operational solutions to mitigate the impact 
of the reserves reduction. The reserves 
reduction is caused by a recalculation of 
recovery rates from the VM and Dobrinskoye 
gas fields, rather than any changes to the 
geological model or estimates of original 
hydrocarbons in place. This has had a   05 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Chief Executive’s Report
The principal objective for Volga Gas in 
2017 was to effect a transformation in 
the technology used to process the gas 
and condensate at the Dobrinskoye gas 
plant, from which the Group derives the 
overwhelming majority of its production, 
revenue and profits. During 2016 and early 
2017 , after extensive investigations and pilot 
tests, management concluded that a switch 
to Redox-based sweetening would be most 
advantageous – not only for reduced cost 
but also for the elimination of waste material 
that required disposal. This also had the 
advantage that it could be implemented with 
minimal modifications to the existing plant, 
saving significantly on capital expenditure 
that other alternatives would require.
In May 2017 , we commenced the switch 
to Redox processing and from June 
2017 onwards all of the gas processed at 
Dobrinskoye was with Redox. Although the 
change was achieved at low capital cost, 
in the first months after implementation, 
the plant throughput was kept at low 
levels while the process management was 
optimised. Throughput at the gas plant was 
gradually increased and in December 2017 
was averaged 533,000 m
3
 per day (18.8 
mmcf/d). However, the period of lower 
throughput at the gas plant was primarily 
responsible for an overall reduction in Group 
production, being 24% lower than 2016.
Offsetting the reduction in volumes in 
2017 , oil prices and the Russian Ruble both 
recovered steadily through the year and 
consequently the impact of lower sales 
2018 objectives and medium-term 
strategy
Management has the following key objectives 
in 2018:
— To increase the efficiency and processing 
capacity at the gas plant using Redox gas 
sweetening from the rate of 533,000 m
3
 
per day achieved at the end of 2017.
— Having nearly completed construction of 
the LPG plant, to commence production 
and optimise the marketing of the product.
— To complete the reservoir and technical 
studies on the VM field and to commence 
actions including workovers and 
reperforations of the well bores to 
mitigate future formation water 
production, thereby restoring maximum 
gas production and the extraction of 
reserves in place.
— Optimise the production of oil from the 
new horizontal well Uzen #101 and to 
manage the more mature oil wells in 
the field.
Current trading and outlook
Between January and March 2018, Group 
production averaged 4,084 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day, in line with management’s 
plan, given the anticipated higher levels of 
planned maintenance downtime in the period. 
For the coming months, management expects 
to maintain an average daily production of gas 
and condensate in the region of 3,800 boepd, 
resulting in Group production of 
approximately 4,500 boepd, excluding 
incremental volumes from the LPG project, 
which when the project is fully operational is 
expected to add a further 400 boepd. 
International oil prices strengthened 
at the start of 2018 and have remained 
relatively stable. Although it is a minor 
part of the Group’s output, oil production 
has increased as a result of additional 
volumes from the horizontal well Uzen 
#101 which has more than offset the 
natural decline in the mature oil wells.
In the current environment, and at current 
production rates to which may be added 
additional sales of LPG, management expects 
the Group’s financial performance in 2018 
to improve on that of 2017. Meanwhile, 
new capital expenditure commitments 
remain within projected cash generation, 
permitting a resumption of a sustainable 
distribution policy for shareholders.

volumes on the financial performance 
of the Group was less than it may have 
been otherwise. This is discussed in 
greater detail in the Financial Review.
In addition to the switch to Redox gas 
sweetening, the two major projects 
undertaken by Volga Gas during 2017 
were the construction of an LPG unit 
at Dobrinskoye and the drilling of the 
horizontal well Uzen #101 on the Uzen 
oil field in our Karpenskiy licence. These 
projects were the main use of the capital 
investment undertaken by Volga Gas in 2017 
and are expected to contribute materially 
to future revenues and profits. I will cover 
these projects in greater detail below.
Reserves update
Subsequent to the 2017 year end, the 
Company commissioned a new independent 
reserve report by OOO Geostream Assets 
Management (“Geostream”) as, late in 2017 , 
the presence of increased formation water 
was observed during gas production from 
certain of the production wells on the VM 
field. The report, dated 12 April 2018, has 
resulted in a reduction of 27% in the proved 
and of 28% in the proved plus probable 
reserve numbers for the Group’s oil and gas 
reserves. Although the estimate of original 
hydrocarbons in place is unchanged, the 
presence of formation water during gas 
production has led Geostream to apply a 
more conservative calculation of ultimately 
recoverable reserves from the VM field.
Management considers the new reserve 
estimates to be consistent with the currently 
available field data and, accordingly, has 
adopted the revised reserve estimates 
as the Group’s oil, gas and condensate 
reserves for the 2017 year-end accounts. The 
Group’s reserve statement is shown in the 
Operational Review on page 9. The impact 
of the reserve revision has been to increase 
the depletion, depreciation and amortisation 
charge of the Group compared to 2016, with 
consequent reductions in the profit and net 
book value of the Group’s assets. While the 
reserve revisions have not triggered any 
impairment charges, subsequent reserve 
evaluations may or may not lead to further 
revisions which may impair the assets. 
Following the revised reserve estimates that 
have been adopted, we are actively looking 
into technical and operational solutions 
to mitigate the impact of the reserves 
reductions and to maximise gas production 
through the Dobrinskoye gas plant. 06 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Operational Review
Operations overview
Operations overview
As outlined on the previous page, Group 
production in 2017 , at an average daily rate 
of 4,948 boepd, was 24% lower than the 
6,507 boepd achieved in 2016. The principal 
reason for this was the planned reduction of 
gas processing plant throughput necessary 
as the Redox-based gas sweetening process 
was implemented and optimised over a 
period of several months. There was also 
some decline in the mature production 
wells in the Uzen oil field and the increased 
presence of formation water in certain of 
the production wells at VM in late 2017. 
The impact on revenues was partly offset by 
a continued recovery in oil prices through 
the year and the Ruble stabilising at higher 
levels. As a result of the lower proportion 
of export sales in 2017 , taking into account 
selling expenses, netback revenues 
(defined as revenues less selling expenses 
as shown in the income statements) in 
2017 were US$34.8 million, only marginally 
lower than the US$35.4 million in 2016. 
The benefits of savings from the lower 
process chemicals costs were offset by 
higher rates of Mineral Extraction Tax arising 
from higher oil prices and the scheduled 
adjustments to the rate formulas and 
by increases in administrative expenses. 
As a consequence, EBITDA for 2017 was 
US$8.8 million (2016: US$9.6 million).
Besides the implementation of Redox-based 
processing at the Dobrinskoye gas plant, 
the key operational activities in 2017 were 
construction of the LPG plant and, in the 
separate oil production business, the drilling 
of new horizontal wells on the Uzen field.  07 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Gas/condensate production
The Dobrinskoye and VM fields are managed 
as a single business unit. Production from 
the fields is processed at the gas plant 
located next to the Dobrinskoye field, 
extracting the condensate and processing 
the gas to pipeline standards before input 
into Gazprom’s regional pipeline system 
via an inlet located at the plant. The VM 
field was developed with wells drilled by 
Volga Gas, while the Dobrinskoye wells 
were acquired from previous licensees.
By the end of 2016, development drilling 
on the VM field was essentially completed, 
with a total of four wells in the principal 
reservoir, the Evlano Livinskiy carbonate, 
and a further well in the secondary 
Bobrikovskiy sandstone reservoir. 
Production during 2017 averaged 19.1 
mmcf/d of gas and 1,163 bpd of condensate 
(2016: 25.5 mmcf/d of gas and 1,557 bpd 
condensate) an overall decrease of 25% in 
equivalent barrels of oil terms. As outlined 
above, this was principally a result of the 
decision to operate the gas processing 
plant at lower throughput rates as the 
Redox processing was implemented and 
optimised. Between June 2017 and 
December 2017 , the daily throughput 
increased steadily, as discussed below, 
and production increased accordingly.
Between January and April 2017 , while 
the gas was being sweetened with the 
old Sulfanox process, production was 
generally running at close to the gas plant’s 
maximum physical capacity and averaged 
30.5 mmcf/d of gas and 1,730 bpd of 
condensate. However, during late 2017 and 
early 2018, the presence of formation water 
in certain of the production wells on VM 
was detected. Consequently, management 
commissioned a new reserve report. The 
report, date 12 April 2018, concluded that 
as a result of more conservative calculation 
of ultimate recovery rates, the Company 
should recognise a significant reduction 
in reserves, mainly in the VM field. 
Management is looking into technical 
and operational solutions to mitigate the 
impact of the reserves reductions, including 
conducting well interventions on the VM 
field, workovers and reperforations of the 
well bores. On Dobrinskoye, which is a more 
mature gas field, there are also plans to 
drill a sidetrack on well #26 to develop a 
likely undepleted portion of the reservoir.
The proven and Probable reserves and the 
revisions adopted in full for the 2017 year-end 
results are detailed in the table on page 9.
Gas/condensate sales
Historically, the Group’s gas was sold to 
Trans Nafta under contract at a fixed Ruble 
contract. However, from December 2016, gas 
sales have been made directly to Gazprom. 
This has resulted in an increase in the net 
realisations, although the Group now pays 
a transit tariff for delivery via the Gazprom 
pipeline network to the point of sale. 
In US Dollar terms, however, the stronger 
Ruble, as well as an increase in the 
Ruble selling price, led to the average 
gas sales realisations rising 36% in 2017 
to US$2.06/mcf (2016: US$1.51).
Since November 2015, we have been 
utilising export channels for condensate as 
an alternative to domestic sales in periods 
of low domestic demand. Domestic market 
conditions in 2017 were generally more 
favourable and consequently condensate 
exports declined significantly and ceased 
altogether from the end of March 2017. In 
total, approximately 15% of condensate sales 
were exported during 2017 , compared to 
48% of the total condensate sales in 2016.
During 2017 , the average condensate 
netback price (after accounting for export 
taxes and transportation costs) increased 
38% to US$34.37 per barrel (2016: US$24.83).
Average unit production costs on the gas 
condensate fields increased moderately to 
US$5.39 per boe in 2017 (2016: US$5.33).  
The recovery in the Ruble, in which effectively 
all the costs are denominated, and the lower 
throughput rates in the second half of 2017 
increased the impact of the fixed cost 
element of the operating expenses and 
offset the benefits of lower chemical costs 
associated with the switch to Redox. 08 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Gas processing plant
The Dobrinskoye gas processing plant was 
originally designed and constructed to 
utilise a Sulfanox-based gas sweetening 
process, which had the benefit of low capital 
cost but carried high chemical usage and 
generated substantial volumes of waste 
requiring careful disposal. The plant was 
designed with a maximum throughput 
capacity of one million m
3
/day (35.3 mmcf/d). 
During 2016, a number of alternatives were 
tested and, by the end of 2016, management 
decided that a switch to a Redox-based 
sweetening process would be optimal and 
required only minor modifications to the 
existing plant equipment. Between April 
and June 2017 , industrial-scale testing 
of the Redox process was undertaken 
while the modifications were carried 
out. In June, the plant was switched over 
entirely to Redox-based processing.
During the initial months of the new process, 
between June 2017 and August 2017 , the 
plant throughput was kept at relatively 
low levels as the process management was 
optimised. Throughput increased gradually 
through the remainder of 2017 , from the 
average rate of 213,000 m
3
/day (7.5 mmcf/d) 
in June 2017 to reach 533,000 m
3
/day (18.8 
mmcf/d) in December 2017 , slightly above 
management’s short-term throughput 
target. In addition, during November 2017 , 
inefficient operations of the system pumps 
had caused up to 40% of the processed gas 
being below pipeline specification. This issue 
has been dealt with and since December 2017 
all of the processed gas is available for sale.
Based on the experience of operating 
the Redox process to date, management 
identified the need to add two further 
oxidising vessels to the current plant 
configuration. Having recently completed 
this, management expects improvements in 
efficiency, reduced operational downtime 
and higher effective operating capacity.
The other key development at the gas 
plant in 2017 was the construction of a new 
unit for the capture, storage and sale of 
LPG. LPGs, primarily comprising propane 
and butane, are currently either included 
in the sales gas stream or flared. The LPG 
project will provide an additional product 
stream which is expected to increase 
total sales volumes by approximately 400 
boepd and to enhance profitability.
Although construction was largely 
accomplished before the end of 2017 
as planned, due to delays in delivery 
of certain items of equipment and to 
regulatory clearance, completion of the 
project was delayed by approximately 
three months. As of March 2018, the LPG 
project is commencing the commissioning 
process and should start production 
during the second quarter of 2018.
In spite of the delays to the project, the 
LPG project is expected to be completed 
at a total capital cost of US$5.5 million. 
Oil production and development
Since 2009, the Uzen field has been 
producing oil from a cretaceous Aptian 
reservoir at a depth of approximately 1,000 
metres. As the oil was produced, the oil-
water contact in the reservoir rose and the 
wells at the edge of the field were shut in 
as water cut increased. By the start of 2017 , 
production was derived from three active 
wells – down from a peak of five in 2010. 
With careful management, production has 
been continued, albeit at declining rates. The 
existing mature wells produced at an average 
rate of 595 bopd in 2017 (2016: 708 bopd).
The principal development activity of 
2017 on the Uzen field was on the proved 
undeveloped reserves in the shallower 
Albian reservoir, using a horizontal well. 
Drilling of the new horizontal well #101 
commenced on 27 April 2017. Although 
mainly being drilled to develop the 
proved but currently undeveloped Albian 
reservoir in the Uzen field, the well 
was initially sidetracked to investigate 
potential unproven structures. While one 
possible target was dry, a second small oil 
accumulation was encountered, providing 
only a minor increment to Group reserves.
Drilling operations on the horizontal 
section of well #101 were concluded as 
anticipated in July 2017 , having completed 
a horizontal section of total length of 627 
metres. Logging while drilling indicated 
a total productive zone in the well of 506 
metres, exhibiting average porosity of 
32% and oil saturation of 68%. Between 
October and December 2017 , well #101 was 
intermittently flow tested. Following the 
installation of a flow line from the well site 
to the main Uzen field facilities in December 
2017 , well #101 has been put on continuous 
production. Between January and March 
2018, well #101 has been producing at an 
average rate of approximately 300 bopd.
As a result of the extra sidetracks drilled 
and additional precautions taken to deliver 
a stable and secure production well, the 
costs of drilling well #101 increased to 
approximately US$7.1 million compared 
to a budget cost of US$3.8 million.
Following a revised conversion from tonnes 
to barrels, as the oil contained in the 
Albian reservoir has slightly higher density 
than the oil in the Aptian reservoir, there 
is a modest restatement in the Uzen oil 
reserves as expressed in barrels. There is 
no change in the tonnage of reserves.
Exploration
During 2017 , as a result of the decision 
to focus on income-generating 
investments, exploration activity was 
confined to internal technical studies.
Nevertheless, the Group has identified 
a number of exploration targets in the 
Karpenskiy Licence Area at shallow horizons 
of between 1,000 and 2,000 metres’ depth. 
These provide low-cost opportunities to 
add potentially material oil reserves. While 
management recognises the potential 
of these prospects, the immediate 
priority is to maximise the value and cash 
generation from proven reserves. 
The Group has fulfilled all its licence 
commitments on the Karpenskiy Licence 
Area and further drilling in the area 
is discretionary. Nevertheless, future 
development of the oil potential in the 
Group’s licences is a key element of 
management’s medium-term strategy.

Oil, gas and condensate reserves as of 1 January 2018
In February 2018, Volga Gas commissioned an updated reserve report of the Group’s oil, gas 
and condensate reserves. Management considers the new reserve estimates contained in this 
report, dated 12 April 2018, to be a reasonable reflection of the field data currently available, 
and accordingly they have been adopted by the Company as a fair statement of reserves.
The following table shows the proven and probable reserves as at 31 December 2017 and 
changes from previous estimates.

Notes:
1. Volga Gas (through its wholly owned subsidiaries PGK and GNS) is the operator and has a 100% interest in four licences to 
explore for and produce oil, gas and condensate in the Volga region.
2. The reserve estimates as at 31 December 2016 were independently assessed by OOO Geostream Assets Management. The 
estimates at 31 December 2017 are results of an updated study conducted by OOO Geostream Assets Management dated 
12 April 2018. The full reserve report is available on the Company’s website: www.volgagas.com.
3. The reserve estimates were prepared in metric units: tonnes for oil, condensate and LPG and standard cubic metres for gas. 
The conversion ratios from tonnes to barrels applied in the table above were 7.833 barrels per tonne of oil, 8.75 barrels per 
tonne of condensate and 11.75 barrels per tonne of LPG. One cubic metre equates to 35.3 cubic feet and one barrel of oil 
equivalent is given by 6,000 standard cubic feet of gas.
4. The above reserve estimates, prepared in accordance with the PMRS reserve definitions prepared by the Oil and Gas Reserves 
Committee of the SPE, have been reviewed and verified by Mr Andrey Zozulya, Director and Chief Executive Officer of Volga 
Gas plc, for the purposes of the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 
2009. Mr Zozulya holds a degree in Geophysics and Engineering from the Groznensky Oil & Gas Institute and is a member of the 
Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Financial Review
Results for the year
In 2017 , the Group generated US$37.1 
million in turnover (2016: US$39.4 million) 
from the sale of 644,506 barrels of crude 
oil and condensate (2016: 837 ,837 barrels) 
and 6,378 million cubic feet of natural 
gas (2016: 9,210 million cubic feet).
The average price realised for liquids sold 
in the domestic market was the equivalent 
of US$35.49 per barrel (2016: US$30.59 
per barrel). During 2017 , approximately 
15% of condensate sales were to export 
customers (2016: 48%). As a consequence, 
selling expenses such as export taxes and 
transportation costs fell substantially 
in 2017 to US$2.2 million (2016: US$ 4.1 
million). For domestic sales, the selling 
price for liquids is effectively a wellhead 
netback price. The average netback 
price for liquids sales, calculated by 
deducting selling expenses from revenue 
attributed to oil and condensate sales, in 
2017 was US$35.80 (2016: US$25.70).
The gas sales price during 2017 averaged 
US$2.06 per thousand cubic feet (2016: 
US$1.51 per thousand cubic feet), the 
increase being attributable to higher Ruble 
selling prices as well as the movement in the 
Ruble/US Dollar exchange rate. The average 
sales price of gas in Rubles increased in 2017 
by 10.8% compared to 2016 (no increase 
in 2016 over 2015). In December 2016, the 
Company commenced sales directly to 
Gazprom, which was partly responsible for 
the increase in realised price. Production 
activities generated a gross profit of US$8.2 
million in 2017 (2016: US$13.1 million).
In 2017 , the total cost of production 
decreased to US$9.3 million (2016: US$11.0 
million), with variable costs driven by lower 
production volumes, some Ruble inflation 
and the effect of the recovery in the Ruble 
on our predominantly Ruble-denominated 
costs. Unit field operating costs were steady 
at US$3.74 per boe (2016: US$3.95 per 
boe), partly as a result of cost efficiencies, 
offset by fixed costs shared among lower 
volumes. Production-based taxes were 
US$10.9 million (2016: US$10.3 million) 
reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and 
Ruble exchange rates on Mineral Extraction 
Tax (“MET”) rates as well as the impact of 
further formula changes that came into 
effect on 1 January 2017. This was partly 
offset by lower production volumes. MET 
paid in 2017 represented 31.4% of netback 
revenues (2016: 29.0% of netback revenues).
Operating and administrative expenses 
in 2017 were US$5.8 million (2016: US$4.5 
million), reflecting the stronger Ruble 
as well as certain one-off expenses.
The Group experienced a 9% reduction 
in EBITDA (defined in the operational 
and financial summary on page 12 
as operating profit before non-cash 
charges, including exploration expenses, 
depletion and depreciation) to US$8.8 
million (2016: US$9.6 million).
The unit rate of Depletion, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (“DD&A”) increased to 
US$5.02 per boe (2016: US$2.12 per boe) as 
a result of both the reduction in reserves in 
the VM and Dobrinskoye fields and higher 
than anticipated expenditures on the Uzen 
horizontal well as well, as the strength 
of the Ruble, in which the depletion pool 
is recorded. This was offset by the 24% 
decrease in production. The DD&A charge 
in 2017 was US$8.6 million (2016: US$5.0 
million) with consequent reductions in profit 
and net book value of the Group assets.
With no significant exploration and 
evaluation expenses in 2017 (2016: 
US$0.3 million) or other provisions (2016: 
provision of US$1.8 million for the write 
off of development assets), the Group 
recorded an operating profit for 2017 
of US$113,000 (2016: US$2.5 million).
Including net interest income of US$0.2 
million (2016: US$0.2 million) and other 
net losses of US$142,000 (2016: net loss of 
US$0.8 million) the Group recognised a profit 
before tax of US$168,000 (2016: US$1.9 
million) and reported net profit after tax 
of US$330,000 (2016: US$1.2 million) after 
a current tax charge of US$243,000 and a 
deferred tax credit of US$405,000 (2016: 
deferred tax charge of US$0.7 million).

Cash flow
Group cash flow from operating activities 
was US$6.3 million (2016: US$13.3 million). 
Net working capital movements contributed 
cash outflow of US$2.3 million in 2017 
(2016: net inflow of US$2.9 million), which 
included movements in accounts payable 
of US$2.9 million (2016: cash inflow of 
US$3.8 million from export customer 
prepayments). Included in net cash flow 
for 2017 were payments of profit tax of 
US$0.5 million (2016: US$2,000). With 
higher capital expenditures in 2017 , the 
net outflow from investing activities was 
US$12.6 million (2016: US$5.0 million). With 
dividend payments of US$5.0 million in 2017 
(2016: nil), net cash outflow from financing 
activities was US$5.2 million (2016: inflow 
of US$4.0 million from debt drawdown).
Dividend
In July 2014, the Board announced 
the adoption of a policy to distribute 
approximately 50% of consolidated net 
profit after tax as a cash dividend. In 2017 
the Company paid a dividend of US$0.007 
per ordinary share in respect of 2016 and, 
in addition, a special dividend of US$0.055 
per ordinary share. In light of the significant 
capital investment in 2017 and in the 
interests of prudence, the Board will defer 
any decision on further distribution until the 
interim results stage, when the impact of the 
new projects on financial performance will 
be clearer. However, the Board is considering 
a policy of basing future dividends on cash 
generation as well as earnings and, subject 
to the requirements of the Group, of 
distributing up to 75% of free cash flow.
Capital expenditure
During 2017 capital expenditure of US$12.4 
million was incurred (2016: US$4.2 million), 
of which US$12.3 million was incurred on 
development and producing assets (2016: 
US$3.9 million) and US$0.1 million on 
exploration and evaluation (2016: US$0.3 
million). Capital expenditure in 2017 
comprised drilling and workovers on the Uzen 
oil field, construction of the LPG plant and 
minor upgrades to the gas processing plant.
Balance sheet and financing
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group held cash 
and bank deposits of US$8.6 million (2016: 
US$19.7 million). All of the Group’s cash 
balances are held in bank accounts in the UK 
and Russia. Approximately 48% (2016: 64%) 
of the Group’s cash is held in US Dollars and 
50% (2016: 34%) held in Russian Rubles.
In December 2016, the Group drew down 
from a RUR 240 million (US$4.0 million) bank 
facility, which was utilised to fund purchases 
of equipment for the LPG project. Total debt 
as at 31 December 2017 was US$4.0 million 
(2016: US$4.0 million). Repayments of the 
loan by monthly amortisation commenced 
in December 2017. As at 31 December 2017 , 
there was a technical breach of certain loan 
covenants. Management is confident of 
receiving a waiver of this breach from the 
lender, but pending receipt of this waiver, 
the entire loan is classified as current.
As at 31 December 2017 , the Group’s 
intangible assets were US$3.8 million 
(2016: US$3.5 million). Property, plant and 
equipment increased to US$62.3 million 
(2016: US$55.9 million), reflecting capital 
investment incurred in 2017 as well as the 
impact of foreign exchange adjustments, 
offset by higher depletion. The carrying 
values of the Group’s assets relating to 
its main cash-generating units have been 
subject to impairment testing. The result of 
the impairment tests, including sensitivity 
Profitability by product
While the Group operates as a single business segment, as described in note 2.3 to the 
accounts on page 36, management estimates the relative profitability, which for this 
purpose is defined to be gross profit less selling expenses, by product to be as follows:

analysis around the central economic 
assumptions and taking into account the 
reduction in oil and gas reserves, as detailed 
in note 4(b) to the accounts, showed no 
present requirement for impairment.
For the year ending 31 December 2017 , the 
Group recorded a currency retranslation 
income of US$3.5 million (2016: income of 
US$10.5 million) in its other comprehensive 
income, relating to the movement of 
the Ruble against the US Dollar.
The Group’s committed capital expenditures 
are less than expected cash flow from 
operations and cash-on-hand and such 
expenditures can be managed in light of the 
volatility in international oil prices and the 
Ruble. The Group may consider additional 
debt facilities to fund the longer-term 
development of its existing licences and 
operational facilities as appropriate. 
The Group’s financial statements are 
presented on a going concern basis, as 
outlined in note 2.1 to the accounts.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group is subject to various risks relating to political, economic, 
legal, social, industry, business and financial conditions. The following 
risk factors, which are not exhaustive, are particularly relevant  
to the Group’s business activities:
Volatility of oil prices
The supply, demand and prices for oil are 
influenced by factors beyond the Group’s 
control. These factors include global and 
regional demand and supply, exchange 
rates, interest and inflation rates and 
political events. A significant prolonged 
decline in oil and gas prices could impact 
the profitability of the Group’s activities. 
All of the Group’s revenues and cash 
flows come from the sale of oil, gas and 
condensate. If sales prices should fall below 
and remain below the Group’s cost of 
production for any sustained period, the 
Group may experience losses and may be 
forced to curtail or suspend some or all of 
the Group’s production, at the time such 
conditions exist. In addition, the Group 
would also have to assess the economic 
impact of low oil and gas prices on its ability 
to recover any losses the Group may incur 
during that period and on the Group’s 
ability to maintain adequate reserves.
The Group does not currently hedge its 
crude oil production to reduce its exposure 
to oil price volatility as the structure 
of taxes applied to oil and condensate 
production in Russia effectively reduce the 
exposure to international market prices 
for oil. In addition, the Ruble exchange 
rate has tended to move with the oil price, 
reducing the overall volatility of oil prices 
when translated into Russian Rubles.
Market risks
The Group’s revenues generated from oil 
and condensate production have typically 
been from sales to local domestic customers. 
There have been periods when the local 
market has been unable to purchase 
condensate, causing temporary suspension 
of production and loss of revenues. Since 
November 2015, the Group has developed 
export channels for its condensate into 
regional export markets to mitigate this 
risk. Gas sales are made to Gazprom. The 
region in which the Group operates is reliant 
on external gas supplies. Consequently 
estimate to be in line with the currently 
available field data and accordingly has 
chosen to adopt the preliminary estimates 
as the statement of the Group’s oil, gas and 
condensate reserves. The Group’s reserve 
statement is shown in the Operational 
Review on page 9. The impact of the reserve 
revision has been to increase the depletion, 
depreciation and amortisation charge of 
the Group, with consequent reductions in 
the profit and net book value of the Group’s 
assets. While the reserve revisions do not 
appear to have triggered an impairment, 
subsequent reserve evaluations may lead to 
further revisions which may impair the assets. 
Furthermore, if the results of producing the 
Group’s fields are significantly different to 
expectations, there may be changes in the 
future estimates of reserves. These may 
impact both the future profitability and 
the balance sheet carrying values of the 
Group’s property, plant and equipment.
Environmental risk
The oil and gas industry is subject to 
environmental hazards, such as oil spills, 
gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of 
petroleum products and hazardous 
substances, including waste materials 
generated by the sweetening process 
formerly in use at the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant. These environmental 
hazards could expose the Group to 
material liabilities for property damages, 
personal injuries, or other environmental 
harm, including costs of investigating and 
remediating contaminated properties. 
The Group is subject to stringent 
environmental laws in Russia with regard to 
its oil and gas operations. Failure to comply 
with such laws and regulations could subject 
the Group to material administrative, civil, 
or criminal penalties or other liabilities. 
Additionally, compliance with these laws may, 
from time to time, result in increased costs to 
the Group’s operations, impact production, 
or increase the costs of potential acquisitions.
 
the risk of insufficient demand for the 
Group’s gas is considered low. Gas sales have 
generally been conducted as expected, 
subject to occasional constraints during 
pipeline maintenance operations. 
Oil and gas production taxes
The Group’s sales generated from oil and gas 
production are subject to Mineral Extraction 
Taxes (“MET”), which form a material 
proportion of the total costs of sales. The 
rates of these taxes are subject to changes by 
the Russian government, which relies heavily 
on such taxes for its revenues. Changes to 
rate formulas which came into effect during 
2015 and 2016 materially increased the 
rates on crude oil, condensate and natural 
gas. With oil prices recovering from recent 
lows, MET rates have increased in line with 
current formulas. As of 2019, the Russian 
government is planning trials of a profit-
based oil and gas taxation regime to replace 
the production-based MET. At present, the 
impact on the Group’s operations of any 
such change of tax regime is unknown. 
Exploration and reserve risks
Whilst the Group will seek to apply the 
latest technology to assess exploration 
licences, the exploration for, and 
development of, hydrocarbons involves a 
high degree of risk. These risks include the 
uncertainty that the Group will discover 
sufficient commercially exploitable oil 
or gas resources in unproven areas of its 
licences. Unsuccessful exploration efforts 
may result in impairment to the balance 
sheet value of exploration assets. However, 
the Group’s current plans involve limited 
expenditure in exploration-related activities.
In February 2018, the Group commissioned 
an updated reserve evaluation based on 
reporting standards set by the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers. The reserve report, 
delivered to and adopted by management 
on 12 April 2018, resulted in a downward 
revision by approximately 27% to the 
Group’s reserves as at 31 December 2017. 
Management considers the new reserve  14 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Group liaises closely with the Federal 
Service of Environmental, Technological 
and Nuclear Resources of the Saratov 
and Volgograd Oblasts on potential 
environmental impact of its operations 
and conducts environmental studies 
both as required by, and in addition to, its 
licence obligations to mitigate any specific 
risk. The Group’s operations are regularly 
subject to independent environmental 
audit. The Group did not incur any material 
costs relating to the compliance with 
environmental laws during the period.
Risk of operating oil and gas properties
The oil and gas business involves certain 
operating hazards, such as well blowouts, 
cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows 
of oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and 
releases of toxic substances. Any of these 
operating hazards could cause serious 
injuries, fatalities, or property damage, 
which could expose the Group to liabilities. 
The settlement of these liabilities could 
materially impact the funds available for the 
exploration and development of the Group’s 
oil and gas properties. The Group maintains 
insurance against many potential losses 
and liabilities arising from its operations 
in accordance with customary industry 
practices, but the Group’s insurance coverage 
cannot protect it against all operational risks.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s capital expenditures and 
operating costs are predominantly in 
Russian Rubles (“RUR”) while a minority of 
administrative expense are in US Dollars, 
Euros and Pounds Sterling. Revenues are 
predominantly received in RUR, so the 
operating profitability is not materially 
exposed to moderate short-term exchange 
rate movements. The functional currency 
of the Group’s operating subsidiaries is the 
RUR and the Group’s assets and liabilities 
are predominantly RUR denominated. As 
the Group’s presentational currency is the 
US Dollar, fluctuations in the exchange 
rate of the RUR against the US Dollar 
impact the Group’s financial statements.
Legal systems
Russia, and other countries in which the 
Group may transact business in the future, 
have or may have legal systems that are less 
well developed than those in the United 
Kingdom. This could result in risks such as:
— Potential difficulties in obtaining effective 
legal redress in the court of such 
jurisdictions, whether in respect of a 
breach of contract, law or regulation, 
including an ownership dispute.
— A higher degree of discretion on the part 
of governmental authorities.
— The lack of judicial or administrative 
guidance on interpreting applicable rules 
and regulations.
— Inconsistencies or conflicts between and 
within various laws, regulations, decrees, 
orders and resolutions.
— Relative inexperience of the judiciary and 
courts in such matters.
In certain jurisdictions, the commitment of 
local business people, government officials 
and agencies and the judicial system to 
abide by legal requirements and negotiated 
agreements may be more uncertain, creating 
particular concerns with respect to licences 
and agreements for business. These may 
be susceptible to revision or cancellation 
and legal redress may be uncertain or 
delayed. There can be no assurance 
that joint ventures, licences, licence 
applications or other legal arrangements 
will not be adversely affected by the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Business in Russia
Amongst the risks that face the Group in 
conducting business and operations in 
Russia are:
— Economic instability, including in other 
countries or the global economy that 
could lead to consequences such as 
hyperinflation, currency fluctuations and a 
decline in per capita income in the Russian 
economy.
— Governmental and political instability that 
could disrupt, delay or curtail economic 
and regulatory reform, increase 
centralised authority or result in 
nationalisations.
— Social instability from any ethnic, religious, 
historical or other divisions that could lead 
to a rise in nationalism, social and political 
disturbances or conflict.
— Uncertainties in the developing legal and 
regulatory environment, including, but 
not limited to, conflicting laws, decrees 
and regulations applicable to the oil and 
gas industry and foreign investment.
— Unlawful or arbitrary action against the 
Group and its interests by the regulatory 
authorities, including the suspension or 
revocation of their oil or gas contracts, 
licences or permits or preferential 
treatment of their competitors. 
— Lack of independence and experience of 
the judiciary, difficulty in enforcing court 
or arbitration decisions and governmental 
discretion in enforcing claims.
— Unexpected changes to the federal and 
local tax systems.
— Laws restricting foreign investment in the 
oil and gas industry.
— The imposition of sanctions upon certain 
entities in Russia.
The Group’s operations and financial 
management have not been impacted 
directly by any sanctions to date.

Governance
Financial 
Statements
Capital risk
The Group manages capital to ensure that it 
is able to continue as a going concern whilst 
maximising the return to shareholders. 
The Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements. The Board 
regularly monitors the future capital 
requirements of the Group, particularly 
in respect of its ongoing development 
programme. Management expects that 
the cash generated by the operating 
fields will be sufficient to sustain the 
Group’s operations and committed capital 
investment for the foreseeable future and 
has a policy of maintaining a minimum level 
of liquidity to cover forward obligations. 
Further short-term debt facilities may be 
arranged to provide financial headroom 
for future development activities.
Bribery
The Company is subject to numerous 
requirements and standards, including the 
UK Bribery Act. In addition, the Group is 
subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in 
which it operates. Failure to comply with 
regulations and requirements, such as 
failure to implement adequate systems 
to prevent bribery and corruption, could 
result in prosecution, fines or penalties 
imposed on the Company or its officers 
or suspension of operations. The Group’s 
mitigation measures include compliance-
related activities, training, monitoring, risk 
management, due diligence and regular 
review of policies and procedures. We 
prohibit bribery and corruption in any form 
by all employees and by those working for, 
or connected with, the business. Employees 
are expected to report actual, attempted or 
suspected bribery or other issues related to 
compliance to their line managers or through 
our confidential reporting process, which is 
available to all staff as well as third parties.
Fraud
The Group has been exposed to fraudulent 
transfers of funds from its bank accounts 
and is at various times at risk to attempted 
fraud. The Group has established enhanced 
protection of its information technology 
infrastructure, operational systems and 
procedures against fraudulent activities.

Liquidity risk
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had 
US$8.6 million (2016: US$19.7 million) of 
cash and cash equivalents, of which US$7.9 
million was held in bank accounts in Russia 
(2016: $6.1 million). As at 31 December 
2017 , total bank debt was US$4.0 million 
(2016: US$4.0 million). The Group has fully 
drawn on the debt facilities available as at 
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. 
The Group intends to fund its ongoing 
operations and development activities from 
its cash resources and cash generated by 
its established operations. At 31 December 
2017 , the Group had budgeted capital 
expenditures of US$5.9 million, of which 
the significant items were US$1.4 million for 
completion of the LPG project and US$3.2 
million for drilling of sidetrack wells and 
other development activities. There were 
approximately US$1.6 million of accounts 
payable relating to capital expenditures and 
other expenses incurred in the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: US$4.8 million). 
The Board considers that the Group will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. 
All current and planned capital expenditures 
are discretionary and may be deferred 
or cancelled in the light of the Group’s 
cash generation and liquidity position.
Through the ordinary course of activities, 
the Group is exposed to legal, operational 
and development risk that could delay 
growth in its cash generation from 
operations or may require additional capital 
investment that could place increased burden 
on the Group’s available financial resources. 16 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Corporate Governance Statement
The Board’s overriding objective is to ensure that 
the Group delivers long-term capital appreciation 
for its shareholders. 
Compliance
As Volga Gas plc is quoted on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange, 
it is neither required to comply with the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code that 
was published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the “Code”) nor issue a statement 
of compliance with it. Nevertheless, 
the Board fully supports the principles 
set out in the Code and seeks to follow 
these as best practice wherever this is 
appropriate having regard to the size of 
the Company, the resources available 
to it and the interpretation of the Code 
in the Quoted Companies Alliance 
Corporate Governance Code for Small 
and Mid-sized Quoted Companies. 
Details are provided below of how the 
Company applies the elements of the 
Code that are deemed appropriate.
Board of Directors
Role of the Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership to 
the Group within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls which enables risk 
to be assessed and managed. The Board 
sets the Group’s strategic aims and ensures 
that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place for the Group to meet 
its objectives, and reviews management’s 
performance in meeting these objectives. 
The Board sets and monitors the Group’s 
values and standards and ensures that the 
Group’s obligations to shareholders and 
other stakeholders are understood and met.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval, including:
— Strategic and policy considerations.
— Annual budget, including capital 
expenditure.
— Interim and final financial statements.
— Dividend policy, share buy-backs or other 
distributions.
— Management structure and 
appointments.
— Mergers, acquisitions and disposals.
— Capital raising.
— Significant changes in accounting policies.
— Appointment or removal of directors or 
the company secretary.
The Board has established the following 
committees:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee was established in 
March 2007 and comprises three directors: 
Mr Ogden – Chairman
Mr Freeman
Mr Calvey
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
selecting the Group’s independent auditors, 
pre-approving all audit and non-audit related 
services, reviewing with management 
and the independent auditors the Group’s 
financial statements, significant accounting 
and financial policies and practices, audit 
scope and adequacy of internal audit and 
control systems. The Audit Committee 
keeps the independence and objectivity 
of the auditor under review and a formal 
statement of independence is received from 
the external auditor each year. The Audit 
Committee meets at least twice each year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was 
also established in March 2007 and 
comprises three directors:
Mr Freeman – Chairman
Mr Ogden
Mr Kalinin
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the performance 
of the directors and for determining 
compensation of the Company’s key 
employees, including the chief executive 
officer, chief financial officer, and other 
key personnel as may be determined 
from time to time by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee 
meets at least twice each year.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report 
is set out on pages 23 to 24.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee was established 
in March 2007 and comprises three directors:
Mr Freeman – Chairman
Mr Ogden
Mr Calvey
Board composition
The Board currently comprises one 
executive director and six non-executive 
directors, of whom three are deemed to be 
independent and three non-independent:
— Mikhail Ivanov – Non-Executive Chairman
— Andrey Zozulya – Executive Director and 
CEO
— Michael Calvey – Non-Executive
— Ronald Freeman – Independent Non-
Executive
— Aleksey Kalinin – Non-Executive
— Vladimir Koshcheev – Independent 
Non-Executive 
— Stephen Ogden – Independent Non-
Executive
There is a clear division of 
responsibilities between the executive 
and non-executive directors.
Board balance and independence
The Board recognises that Messrs Kalinin 
and Calvey are not independent by virtue 
of their direct management responsibilities 
for the limited partnerships comprising 
Baring Vostok Private Equity Funds III and 
IV, the Company’s controlling shareholder 
(”Controlling Shareholder”). However, in 
light of the value, experience and contacts 
which they afford to the Company at this 
stage of its development and by virtue 
of the Relationship Agreement, which, 
inter alia, ensures that the Controlling 
Shareholder does not exercise undue 
influence over the Company or prevent 
it from acting independently of the 
Controlling Shareholder, the Board 
believes that the continued presence 
of Messrs Kalinin and Calvey on the 
Board is beneficial for the Company.
Notwithstanding, under the provisions of 
the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code as 
a “Smaller Company” the Company meets 
the requirements to have at least two 
independent non-executives on the Board.
All directors are permitted access 
to independent professional advice 
in the course of execution of their 
duties, at the Company’s expense.

Indemnification of directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association and to the extent permitted 
by the law of England and Wales, directors 
are granted an indemnity from the Company 
in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of 
their office. In respect of those matters for 
which the directors may not be indemnified, 
the Company maintained a directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the financial year. This policy has been 
renewed for the next financial year.
Re-election of directors
The Company requires that all directors 
stand for re-election at intervals of no 
more than three years. Accordingly, 
Messrs Freeman, Kalinin and Zozulya 
will retire at the forthcoming AGM and 
will seek re-election by shareholders.
Investor relations
The Company places considerable 
importance on communication with 
shareholders and engages them on a wide 
range of issues. The Group has an ongoing 
programme of dialogue and meetings 
between the executive directors and 
institutional investors, fund managers and 
analysts. At these meetings a wide range 
of relevant issues, including strategy, 
performance, management and governance, 
are discussed within the constraints of 
the information already made public.
The Company is equally interested in the 
views and concerns of private shareholders 
and to this end ensures that the executive 
directors represent the Company at forums 
where private investors are present.
Shareholders have the opportunity to

Internal controls
The directors acknowledge their 
responsibility for the system of 
internal controls for the Group and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Any system of internal control can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance that material financial irregularities 
will be detected or that the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives is eliminated.
The Group’s risk and controls framework 
covers all material risks and controls 
including those of an operational, financial, 
and compliance nature. Internal control 
procedures consist, inter alia, of formal 
delegations of expenditure authority by 
the Board to executive management, 
and controls relating to key stages of 
transactions including supplier approval, 
contract signature and payment release.
The directors consider that the frequency 
of Board meetings and level of detail 
presented to the Board for its consideration 
in relation to the operations of the Group 
provide an appropriate process to identify, 
evaluate and manage significant risks 
relevant to its operations on a continuous 
basis, and this process is considered 
to be in accordance with the revised 
guidance on internal control published in 
October 2005 (“Turnbull Guidance”). 
In addition to formal Board meetings, 
management prepare detailed 
financial and operational reports on a 
monthly basis which is disseminated 
and discussed within the Board. 20 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The directors present their report together with the 
Group’s audited consolidated financial statements for

28–34 and show a net profit of US$330,000 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 
net profit of US$1.2 million). The directors 
do not currently propose to pay a dividend 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2017. On 26 May 2017 , the Company paid 
a dividend of $0.007 per ordinary share in 
respect of the profits earned in the year

Principal activities, business review and 
future developments
Volga Gas is a public limited company 
registered in England and Wales with 
registered number 5886534, was 
incorporated in the United Kingdom on 
25 July 2006 and admitted to trading on the 
AIM market of the London Stock Exchange 
on 25 April 2007. Volga Gas operates 
primarily through subsidiary companies as set 
out in note 2.2 to the accounts. The principal 
activity of the Group is the exploration, 
development and production of its gas, 
condensate and oil fields in the Volga Region 
of European Russia. During the year, the 
Group owned 100% interests in four licence 
areas in the Saratov and Volgograd regions: 
Karpenskiy, Vostochny Makarovskoye, 
Dobrinskoye, and Urozhainoye-2.
The Group’s business strategy is to 
maximise the economics of production 
from the Vostochny Makarovskoye, 
Dobrinskoye and Uzenskoye fields and 
to explore the potentially prospective 
structures on the Group’s licence areas. 
The Group also evaluates acquisition 
opportunities as part of its overall strategy 
of growing value for its shareholders. 
Highlights of the Group’s activities for the 
period ended 31 December 2017 are:
— Successful implementation of the 
Redox-based gas sweetening process at 
the Dobrinskoye gas plant. 
— Reduction in variable costs consequent to 
the gas sweetening process.
— Drilling of the horizontal well #101 on the 
Uzen oil field.
The Group’s activities are described in 
greater detail in the Chief Executive’s 
Report on page 5 and in the Operational 
Review on pages 6 to 9. The principal risks 
associated with the Group’s activities 
are set out in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 13 to 15.
Key performance indicators
Given the nature of the business and that 
the Group has only three operating fields, 
the directors are of the opinion that further 
analysis using KPIs is not appropriate for 
an understanding of the development, 
performance or position of our business at 
this time. The directors are of the opinion 
that the Operational Review on pages 
6–9 provides the relevant information.
Going concern
Having made appropriate enquiries and 
having examined the major areas that could 
affect the Group’s financial position, the 
directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements as described in note 2.1.

Report of the Directors continued
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report, Strategic 
Report, Directors’ Report and the 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report and 
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and Parent Company financial 
statements for each financial year. As 
required by the AIM Rules for Companies 
of the London Stock Exchange, they are 
required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
— select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
— make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
— state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU; and 
— prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in 
business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Electronic communications
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Volga Gas plc website (www.volgagas.com) 
is the responsibility of the directors; the 
work carried out by the auditor does not 
involve consideration of these matters 
and, accordingly, the auditor accepts no 
responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since 
they were initially presented on the website.
The Company’s website is maintained 
in compliance with Rule 26 of the 
AIM Rules for Companies.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
In common with the Board’s commitment 
to compliance with the appropriate 
aspects of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Company has 
adopted the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to directors’ remuneration. The 
Company discloses certain information 
relating to directors’ remuneration in 
this report, which is not audited.
Remuneration Committee
The Company established a 
Remuneration Committee in April 
2007 , as set out in the Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 18.
The Remuneration Committee advises the 
Board on Group compensation policy as it 
relates to executive directors and other key 
members of management, and may obtain 
advice from independent remuneration 
consultants appointed by the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
Ronald Freeman (Chairman), Stephen 
Ogden and Aleksey Kalinin, who are all 
non-executive directors. Executive directors 
may be invited to attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee but do not vote 
on their own remuneration or incentives. The 
Remuneration Committee meets as required.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy is to maintain levels 
of compensation for the Group that are 
comparable and competitive with peer 
group companies, so as to attract and 
retain individuals of the highest calibre, by 
rewarding them as appropriate for their 
contribution to the Group’s performance.
Executive directors’ employment 
agreement and terms of appointment
The terms of each executive director’s 
appointment are set out in their service 
agreements. Each executive director’s 
agreement is based on similar terms, 
with no fixed duration. Each service 
agreement sets out details of basic 
salary and share options as applicable.
All executive director employment 
agreements can be terminated either by 
the director concerned or by the Company 
on giving six months’ notice during the 
first 24 months of service and thereafter 
by giving three months’ notice. 
of appointment. These engagements 
are for two years and can be terminated 
upon one month’s notice by either 
party. Reappointment is subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association, which 
provide that one-third of the directors 
shall be required to retire each year.
Fees
The fees paid to non-executive directors 
are determined by the Board and reviewed 
periodically to reflect current rates and 
practice commensurate with the size 
of the Company and their roles.
The remuneration of the non-executive 
directors is a matter for the Chairman of 
the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. 
In the event of the appointment of an 
independent non-executive chairman, his 
remuneration would be a matter for the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Chief Executive Officer.
The executive directors do not participate 
in any Group pension scheme and their 
remuneration is not pensionable. The 
executive directors are eligible for 
payment of cash bonuses and participation 
in any share-based incentive plan the 
Board implements. For the year ended 
31 December 2017 , the Chief Executive 
Officer may, on meeting certain 
specified operational and financial 
objectives agreed with the Remuneration 
Committee, be awarded a bonus payment 
of up to 100% of his basic salary.
Basic salaries
The basic salary of each executive director 
is established by reference to their 
responsibilities and individual performance.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Volga Gas plc
1 Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements 
of Volga Gas plc (“the Company”) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 , which 
comprise the Group Income statement, 
the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Group and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements, the 
Group and Parent Company Statements of 
Changes in Equity, and the related notes, 
including the accounting policies in note 2. 
In our opinion: 
— the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
— the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (“IFRSs as adopted by the EU”); 
— the Parent Company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
— the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and are independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient 
and appropriate basis for our opinion. 
2  Key audit matters: our assessment 
of risks of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest 
effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. In 
arriving at our audit opinion above, the key 
audit matters, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, as per the table on page 26. 
3  Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements 
as a whole was set at US$350k (2016: 
US$360k), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group revenues, of which it 
represents 1% (2016: 1 %). We consider Group 
revenues to be the most appropriate 
benchmark for overall levels of activity within 
the business and are measured in terms of 
revenue which is also considered one of the 
more prominent metrics in assessing overall 
Group performance.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee 
any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding US$18k (2016: 
US$18k), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
For both the current and prior year, the 
Group audit team performed the audit of 
the Group (including the Parent Company 
financial information) as if it was a single 
aggregated set of financial information. 
The Parent Company materiality was 
therefore lower than the materiality we would 
otherwise have determined with reference to 
a benchmark to the Parent Company net 
assets, and represents 5% (2016: 5%) of this 
benchmark. As such, materiality for the Parent 
Company financial statements as a whole was 
set at US$315k (2016: US$360k) to allow for 
aggregation risk on consolidation.
4  We have nothing to report on going 
concern 
We are required to report to you if we have 
concluded that the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting is inappropriate or there 
is an undisclosed material uncertainty that 
may cast significant doubt over the use of 
that basis for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. We have nothing to report in 
these respects. 
5  We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report 
together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except 
as explicitly stated below, any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider 
whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the 
other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other 
information: 
— we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report; 
— in our opinion, the information given in 
those reports for the financial year is 
consistent with the financial statements; 
and 
— in our opinion, those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.  26 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The risk Our response
Impairment of tangible and 
intangible assets
Tangible assets: US$62.3 million 
(2016: US$55.9 million)
Intangible assets: US$3.8 million
(2016: US$3.5 million)
Refer to pages 37-38 (accounting 
policy) and pages 42-43 (financial 
disclosures)
Forecast-based valuation
A sustained low oil and gas price 
environment combined with ongoing 
changes in the Group’s production 
operations could have a significant 
impact on the recoverable amount of 
the Group’s tangible and intangible 
assets. Forecasting the recoverable 
amount of the Group’s CGUs, both of 
which have had impairment 
indicators identified, is a highly 
subjective area due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting 
and discounting future cash flows, 
specifically around oil and gas prices, 
USD/RUB exchange rates, reserve 
estimates, especially taking into 
account significant decrease in gas 
and gas condensate proved reserves 
during the period, and future cost 
estimates. Moreover, there was 
significant capital expenditure during 
the reporting period towards 
implementation of Redox gas 
processing, construction of an LPG 
extraction plant and drilling of a new 
horizontal oil well, meaning there is a 
risk that such additional investments 
are not recoverable.
Our procedures included:
— Impairment triggers analysis: We assessed the directors’ 
judgements in considering if any impairment indicators were 
present by considering whether the appropriate business 
developments during the year were incorporated in that 
analysis. 
— Historical comparisons: We assessed the reasonableness of 
the budgets considering historical accuracy of previous 
forecasts.
— Evaluating assumptions: We challenged the Group’s key 
assumptions and estimates by comparing them to externally 
derived and historical data, as well as to our own assessments. 
We have consulted KPMG valuation specialists to assist us in 
the review of discount rates used in the model.
— Evaluating reserves estimation: We assessed competence 
and objectivity of the Group’s external experts to satisfy 
ourselves they were appropriately qualified to carry out 
estimation of reserves included in the model. We performed 
procedures to assess the reliability of the data provided to the 
external expert. We considered whether the updated 
reserves estimates were included appropriately in the Group’s 
impairment review forecasts.
— Sensitivity analysis: We performed sensitivity analysis on 
the key assumptions to assess whether a reasonably possible 
change in these assumptions could trigger an impairment 
charge.
— Integrity of the model: We assessed reasonableness of the 
model used, challenged whether all appropriate cash flows 
are included, as well as reviewed mathematical accuracy of 
the model.
— Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of tangible and 
intangible assets. 
Recoverability of Parent 
Company’s investment in 
subsidiaries and receivables 
due from Group companies
Investment in subsidiaries: 
US$28.3 million (2016: 
US$50.5 million)
Loans due from Group companies: 
US$25.2 million (2016: 
US$4.7 million)
Refer to pages 38-39 (accounting 
policy) and pages 52 to 54 
(financial disclosures)
Low risk, high value
The carrying amounts of the Parent 
Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries and receivables due from 
Group companies represent 99% 
(2016: 94%) of the Company’s total 
assets. Their recoverability is not at a 
high risk of significant misstatement 
or subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in 
the context of the Parent Company 
financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had 
the greatest effect on our overall 
Parent Company audit.
Our procedures included: 
— Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of all 
investments and intercompany debtors with the relevant 
subsidiaries’ financial statements to identify whether their net 
assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying amount and 
assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been 
profit-making.
— Subsidiary audits: The Group engagement team has 
performed the audit work for the trading subsidiaries of the 
Group, including the impairment review of tangible and 
intangible assets as described above, and considered the 
implication of that work on those subsidiaries’ profits and net 
assets.  27 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

6 We have nothing to report on the 
other matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
— adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or 
— the Parent Company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
— certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
— we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set 
out on page 22, the directors are responsible 
for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless they either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities 
is provided on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8 The purpose of our audit work and to 
whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members, 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 201 7 
(presented in US$ 000)
1. General information
Volga Gas plc (the “Company” or “Volga”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales with registered number 5886534. 
The Company was incorporated on 25 July 2006. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are the acquisition, 
exploration and development of hydrocarbon assets and production of hydrocarbons in the Volga Region of the Russian Federation. Its 
registered office is 6th floor, 65 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7NQ. The Company’s shares are admitted to trading on the AIM market of 
the London Stock Exchange.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 12 April 2018.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), as adopted by the European Union (“EU”), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRIC”) interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed 
in note 4.
No income statement is presented for Volga Gas plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report in pages 2 to 15; the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial Review on pages 10 and 11. In addition, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring capital, financial risk 
management objectives, details of financial instruments and exposure to credit and liquidity risks are described in note 3. Having reviewed 
the future cash flow forecasts of the Group in the light of the reductions in oil and gas reserves and in consideration of the current financial 
condition of the Group, the directors have concluded that the Group will continue to have sufficient funds in order to meet its obligations as 
they fall due for at least the foreseeable future and thus continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
2.2 Adopted IFRS not yet applied
The following adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their adoption is not 
expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
— IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective date 1 January 2018).
— IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of 
financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment of financial assets and on hedge accounting. 
— IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are 
managed and their cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 also introduced a new impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss 
(“ECL ”) model. 
Based on the assessment, the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 9 to have a significant impact on its financial statements, other 
than the disclosure impact which the Group is finalising.
— IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective date 1 January 2018).
— IFRS 15 replaces the guidance in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. IFRS 15 provides a single model for accounting for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers, focusing on the identification and satisfaction of performance obligations.
The Group does not expect the application of IFRS 15 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.
— IFRS 16 Leases (effective date 1 January 2019).
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance in IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 
Operating Leases, and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. Based on the assessment 
and lease contract review, the impact of implementation of the standard will be limited to leases of administrative buildings and 
offices. As such, the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 16 to have significant impact on its financial statements. 36 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle (date 1 January 2018):
— Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (effective date 1 January 2018).
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of these new amendments and annual improvements but does not expect them to have a material 
impact on the financial statements. 
— Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (effective date 1 January 2017).
— Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative (effective date 1 January 2017).
These amendments were adopted by the Group in the year, and do not have a material impact on its financial statements.
2.3 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the 
non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from 
contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered. 
The Company and its subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation maintain their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU. The Russian subsidiaries of the Group maintain their statutory accounting records in accordance with the Regulations on Accounting 
and Reporting of the Russian Federation. The consolidated financial statements are based on these statutory accounting records, appropriately 
adjusted and reclassified for fair presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
A list of the Company’s subsidiaries is provided in note 21.
2.4 Segment reporting
Segmental reporting follows the Group’s internal reporting structure. 
Operating segments are defined as components of the Group where separate financial information is available and reported regularly to the 
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is determined to be the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors decides 
how to allocate resources and assesses operational and financial performance using the information provided. 
The CODM receives monthly IFRS-based financial information for the Group and its development and production entities. There were two 
development and production entities during both 2016 and 2017. These entities both engage in upstream production, gathering and sale of 
hydrocarbons, with common operational management and control. Management has determined that the operations of these production and 
development entities are sufficiently homogenous (all are concerned with upstream oil and gas development and production activities) for 
these to be aggregated for the purpose of IFRS 8, “Operating Segments”. Common economic drivers for the operations are international oil 
prices, export and Mineral Extraction Taxes and the costs of drilling, completing and operating wells and production facilities. The Group has 
other entities that engage as either head office or in a corporate capacity or as holding companies. Management has concluded that due to 
application of the aggregation criteria that separate financial information for segments is not required. 
No geographic segmental information is presented as all of the companies’ operating activities are based within a localised area of the Russian 
Federation.
Management has determined, therefore, that the operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, 
development and production and the Group operates in only one geographic area – the Volga region of the Russian Federation.
The Group’s gas sales, representing a substantial proportion of revenues, are made to a single customer. Details are provided in note 3.1 (b).

2.5 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
The functional currency of the Group’s subsidiaries that are incorporated in the Russian Federation is the Russian Ruble (“RUR”). It is 
management’s view that the RUR best reflects the financial results of its Cyprus subsidiaries because they are dependent on entities based 
in Russia that operate in an RUR environment in order to recover their investments. As a result, the functional currency of the subsidiaries 
continues to be the RUR.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
presented in the income statement within “Other gains and losses”.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i)  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet item presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The major exchange rates used for the revaluation of the closing balance sheet at 31 December 2017 were:
— GBP 1.3485: US$ (2016: 1.233)
— EUR 1.1956: US$ (2016: 1.052)
— US$ 1:57.6002: RUR (2016: 60.657)
2.6 Oil and gas assets
The Company and its subsidiaries apply the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) costs, in accordance 
with IFRS 6, “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”. Costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. 
Capital expenditure is recognised as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets in the financial statements according to the nature of 
the expenditure and the stage of development of the associated field, i.e. exploration, development, production.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Costs directly associated with an exploration well, including certain geological and geophysical costs, and exploration and property leasehold 
acquisition costs, are capitalised as intangible assets until the determination of reserves is evaluated. If it is determined that a commercial 
discovery has not been achieved, these costs are charged to expense after the conclusion of appraisal activities. Exploration costs such as 
geological and geophysical that are not directly related to an exploration well are expensed as incurred.
Once commercial reserves are found, exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment and transferred to development assets. 
No depreciation or amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
(b) Development assets
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities, such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of 
development wells into commercially proven reserves, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment. When development is completed on 
a specific field, it is transferred to producing assets as part of property, plant and equipment. No depreciation or amortisation is charged during 
the development phase. 38 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(c) Oil and gas production assets
Production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered 
and bringing them into production, together with E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves and transferred from the 
intangible E&E assets as described above. 
The cost of production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs 
capitalised and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Where major and identifiable parts of the production assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment. Costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
(d) Depreciation/amortisation
Oil and gas properties are depreciated or amortised using the unit-of-production method. Unit-of-production rates are based on proved 
reserves, which are oil, gas and other mineral reserves estimated to be recovered from existing facilities using current operating methods. 
Oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points 
at the outlet valve on the field storage tank.
(e) Impairment – exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment prior to reclassification to development tangible assets, or whenever facts and 
circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the exploration and 
evaluation assets’ carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the exploration and evaluation 
assets’ fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets 
subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-generating units of production fields that are located in the same geographical region.
(f) Impairment – proved oil and gas production properties
Proven oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The cash-generating unit applied for impairment 
test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped together where the cash flows of each field are 
interdependent, for instance where surface infrastructure is used by one or more field in order to process production for sale. 
(g) Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such provision represents 
the estimated discounted liability (the discount rate used currently being at 10% per annum) for costs which are expected to be incurred in 
removing production facilities and site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field. A corresponding item of property, plant and 
equipment is also created at an amount equal to the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production 
facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current 
estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the property, plant and equipment. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
2.7 Other business and corporate assets
Property, plant and equipment not associated with exploration and production activities are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
These assets are also evaluated for impairment when circumstances dictate.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows:
Machinery and equipment 6–10 years
Office equipment in excess of US$5,000 3–4 years
Vehicles and other 2–7 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
2.8 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. This category comprises derivatives unless they are 
effective hedging instruments. The Group had no financial assets in this class as at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.

(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
This category comprises trade and other receivables, term bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents in balance sheet.
2.9 Inventories
Crude oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost of production and net realisable value. Materials and supplies inventories are recorded at 
average cost and are carried at amounts which do not exceed the expected recoverable amount from use in the normal course of business. 
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and other 
costs associated in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
2.10 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate.
2.11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, and deposits held at call with banks.
2.12 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.13 Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
2.14 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in 
the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.15 Employee benefits
(a) Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the 
number of options that are expected to vest. The option plan currently in place for certain of the directors is an equity-settled share option plan. 40 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The Company measures the equity instruments granted to employees at the fair value at grant date. The fair value of fully vested shares is 
expensed immediately. The fair value of shares with vesting requirements is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This value 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. The estimate is revised, as necessary, if subsequent information 
indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
(b) Social obligations
Wages, salaries, contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds, paid annual leave, sick leave and bonuses are 
accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
2.16 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of oil and gas in the ordinary course of the Group’s 
activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue from 
the sale of oil or gas is recognised when the oil/gas is delivered to customers and title has transferred. In 2016 and 2017 , the Group’s revenue 
related to sales of crude oil and condensate collected directly by or delivered to customers and gas sales made at the entry to the gas 
distribution system.
2.17 Prepayments
Prepayments are carried at cost less provision for impairment. A prepayment is classified as non-current when the goods or services relating 
to the prepayment are expected to be obtained after one year, or when the prepayment relates to an asset which will itself be classified as 
non-current upon initial recognition. Prepayments to acquire assets are transferred to the carrying amount of the asset once the Group 
has obtained control of the asset and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group. Other 
prepayments are written off to profit or loss when the goods or services relating to the prepayments are received. If there is an indication that 
the assets, goods or services relating to a prepayment will not be received, the carrying value of the prepayment is written down accordingly 
and a corresponding impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the year. 
2.18 Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the 
class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same 
class of obligations may be small. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
3. Financial risk management
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and cash flow interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and 
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily with respect to the RUR. Foreign exchange risk arises 
from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2017, if the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the RUR with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit 
for the year would have been US$220,000 (2016: US$476,000) higher/lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation 
of RUR-denominated trade payables and financial assets. At 31 December 2017, if the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the 
Euro (“EUR”) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been US$600 (2016: US$1,000) higher/lower, mainly 
as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of EUR-denominated interest charges and financial liabilities. At 31 December 2017, 
if the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the Pound Sterling (“GBP”) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit 
for the year would have been US$6,000 (2016: US$7,000) higher/lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of 
GBP-denominated trade payables and financial assets.

If the US Dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the RUR with all other variables held constant, shareholders’ equity would have 
been US$3.3 million (2015: US$2.9 million) higher/lower, as a result of translation of RUR-denominated assets. The sensitivity of shareholders’ 
equity to changes in the exchange rates between US Dollar against GBP or EUR is immaterial.

Financial liabilities (before provision for UK taxes) 11,389 – – – 11,389
(ii) Price risk 
The Group is not exposed to price risk as it does not hold financial instruments of which the fair values or future cash flows will be affected by 
changes in market prices. The Group is not directly exposed to the levels of international marker prices of crude oil or oil products, although 
these clearly influence the prices at which it sells its oil and condensate. Mineral Extraction Taxes (“MET”) are calculated by reference to Urals oil 
prices and are therefore directly influenced by this. Taking into account the marginal rates of export taxes and MET, management estimates 
that if international oil prices had been US$5 per barrel higher or lower and all other variables been unchanged, the Group’s profit before tax 
would have been US$1.5 million higher or lower (2016: $2.7 million).
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group currently has no significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s maximum credit risk exposure is the fair value of each class of assets, presented in note 3.1(a)(i) of US$8,617 ,000 and US$19,718,000 
at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively. 
The Group’s principal financial asset is cash and credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions. It is the Group’s policy to monitor the financial standing of these assets on an ongoing basis. Bank balances are held with reputable 
and established financial institutions. 
The Group’s oil and condensate sales are normally undertaken on a prepaid basis and accordingly the Group has no trade receivables and 
consequently no credit risk associated with the related trade receivables. Gas sales accounting for 35.4% of Group revenues in 2017 (2016: 
35.6%) were made to Gazprom (2016: to Trans Nafta). As at 31 December 2017 there were trade receivables of US$1.3 million (31 December 
2016: US$2.0 million) relating to gas sales. As at 31 December 2017 there was no provision for bad debts (2016: nil).

3. Financial risk management continued
(c) Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed by Group finance. Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure 
it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Group believes it has sufficient liquidity headroom to fund its currently planned 
exploration and development activities.
The Group expects to fund its capital investments, as well as its administrative and operating expenses, through 2018 using a combination of 
cash generated from its oil and gas production activities, existing working capital and, when appropriate, medium-term bank borrowings. If the 
Group is unsuccessful in generating enough liquidity to fund its expenditures, the Group’s ability to execute its long-term growth strategy could 
be significantly affected. The Group may need to raise additional equity or debt finance as appropriate to fund investments beyond its current 
commitments.
(d) Capital risk management
The Group manages capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to shareholders. The Group is 
not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Board regularly monitors the future capital requirements of the Group, 
particularly in respect of its ongoing development programme. Management expects that the cash generated by the operating fields will be 
sufficient to sustain the Group’s operations and future capital investment for the foreseeable future. During December 2016, one of the 
Group’s operating subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement of RUR 240 million to fund its LPG project (see note 20). This loan, which has a 
three-year amortising term, benefits from an interest rate subsidy provided by the regional government. Further short-term debt facilities may 
be arranged to provide financial headroom for future development activities.
3.2 Fair value estimation
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair 
value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
— Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
— Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
— Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The Group has no financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a) Carrying value of fixed assets, intangible assets and impairment
Fixed assets and intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may 
exist. The carrying value of fixed assets and intangible assets are evaluated by reference to their value in use and primarily looks to the present 
value of management’s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. In identifying cash flows, management firstly 
determines the cash-generating unit or group of assets that give rise to the cash flows. The cash-generating unit (“CGU”) is the lowest level of 
asset at which independent cash flows can be generated. For this purpose, the directors consider the Group to have two CGUs: the VM and 
Dobrinskoye fields with the Dobrinskoye gas processing plant are treated as a single CGU, and the Uzen oil field is a separate CGU.
The estimation of forecast cash flows involves the application of a number of significant judgements and estimates to a number of variables 
including production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, capital investment, hydrocarbon reserves estimates and discount rates. 
Key assumptions and estimates in the impairment models relate to: 
— International oil prices: flat real prices reflecting the actual levels pertaining at 31 December 2017 – Urals oil price of US$65 per barrel. 
No forward price escalation is assumed.
— Selling prices for oil, condensate and LPG that reflect international oil prices, less export taxes at the current applicable official rates and 
a price differential of $5 per barrel to reflect transportation costs. Based on commercial studies conducted during 2016 and 2017, LPG is 
expected to achieve a premium per tonne over condensate whereas the models assume price parity.
— Gas sales price of RUR 4,025 per mcm excluding VAT. 
— Production profiles based on remaining reserves in the proved category and approved field development plans. For the purposes of 
impairment testing, the level of reserves used are those recently provided to the Group by the independent consultancy Geostream.
— While it has been included in the production profile, the LPG production has not yet been established, although it is expected to commence 
in April 2018.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
— Capital expenditures required to deliver the above production profiles and to maintain the production assets throughout the field life. Total 
development capital expenditure assumed is US$5 million with future maintenance capital expenditure of up to US$2 million per annum. 
The principal items being the completion of the LPG plant and sidetracks to two gas/condensate wells.
— Cost assumptions are based on current experience and expectations and are broadly in line with unit costs experienced in the year ended 
31 December 2017 , including an annual estimated cost saving of US$4.0 million from the successful implementation of Redox-based gas 
sweetening.
— Export and mineral extraction taxes reflect rates set by current legislation.
— The model reflects real terms cash flows with no inflationary escalation of revenues or costs.
— A real discount rate of 12% per annum is utilised in the models.
— An exchange rate of RUR57 to US$1.00 is assumed.
Under the base case assumptions, the value in use of each CGU was shown to be in excess of its respective carrying value.
In addition to the base case, a number of sensitivity cases have been carried out: varying oil and gas prices by 10%, varying operating 
expenditure by 10%, varying capital expenditure by 20%, varying reserves by 10% and using a 15% real discount rate. In aggregate the 
sensitivities yielded net present values in excess of carrying values for the CGUs; in all of these cases, the net present value under the 
sensitivities remained above the carrying value of individual CGUs.
Under the base case economic assumptions as outlined above, the reserves at the VM and Dobrinskoye fields would need to drop by a further 
26% below the level as at 31 December 2017, and the Uzen oil field reserves would need to drop by 19% below current levels for the value in use 
to reach the respective carrying value.
A further sensitivity in which LPG was excluded from the production profile brought the value in use down to approximately US$1.5 million, or 
2.9% below the level of the carrying value of the VM and Dobrinskoye CGU under the base case assumptions and up to US$8.6 million or 16.6% 
below the carrying value under the various sensitivity cases outlined above. However, the impairment testing model is based on the existing 
and approved plans and forecasts in which LPG is one of the drivers of future cash flows. Presently the LPG project is commencing the 
commissioning process and there is no indication that it will not be operating as expected, though the various sensitivities affecting LPG 
streams were considered.
Accordingly, as at 31 December 2017 , based on the Group’s impairment testing of the property, plant and equipment related to each CGU, 
management concluded that no clear impairment was indicated. However, should there be material adverse changes to the assumptions used 
in future impairment tests, or should there be further reductions in reserve estimates, there may be impairment of one or both of the CGUs.
(b) Estimation of oil and gas reserves
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently subjective and subject to periodic revision. In addition, the results of drilling and other 
exploration or development or production activity will often provide additional information regarding the Group’s reserve base that may result 
in increases or decreases to reserve volumes. Such revisions to reserves can be significant and are not predictable with any degree of certainty. 
Management considers the estimation of reserves to represent a significant judgement in the context of the financial statements as reserve 
volumes are used as the basis for assessing the useful life of oil and gas assets, applying depreciation to oil and gas assets and in assessing the 
carrying value of oil and gas assets. Decreases in reserve estimates can lead to significant impairment of oil and gas assets where revisions 
(positive or negative) can have a significant effect on depreciation rates from period to period. Variation of 10% from the base level of reserves 
is among the sensitivity tests carried out in impairment testing as described in note 4(a) above.
An independent assessment of the reserves and net present value of future net revenues (“NPV”) attributable to the Group’s fields, 
Dobrinskoye, Vostochny Makarovskoye, Sobolevskoye and Uzenskoye, as at 31 December 2016, was prepared in accordance with reserve 
definitions set by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”). In February 2018, the Group 
commissioned an update to this report as, late in 2017 , the presence of increased formation water was observed during gas production from 
certain of the production wells on the VM field. The results delivered to management imply a negative revision to reserves of approximately 
27% below the level of reserves as at 31 December 2016, as adjusted for production during 2017. The catalyst for this revision was a 
recalculation of recovery factors following the recent detection of the presence of formation water in certain of the wells in the VM field. 
Management considers these revised estimates to be reasonable and is adopting them as the Group’s reserves. As outlined above, 
management considers that, for the time being, no clear impairment is indicated, although further downward revisions may necessitate 
impairment charges in the future. 44 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

All revenue is generated from the sale of oil and gas in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Production is concentrated in the Saratov 
and Volgograd regions of Russia, as are the sales, apart from the volumes exported, primarily to the Baltic States. In the year ended 
31 December 2017 , the total value of export sales was US$3,738,000 (2016: US$10,165,000).

(a)  Depreciation: Substantially all depreciation relates to oil and gas assets and is included within cost of sales. As a result of the downward 
revision to the Group’s oil and gas reserves, the unit of production rate of depletion has increased materially, leading to approximately a 
US$2.2 million (2016: nil) increase in the depreciation charge.
(b) Selling expense: Comprises pipeline transit costs and fees related to gas sales as well as export taxes and costs associated with delivering 
gas condensate sales to export customers.
(c) Field operating expenses: In the year ended 31 December 2017 , a provision for the cost of waste removal was reversed, leading to a credit 
of US$1,009,000 partly offset by other accrued expenses resulting in a net non-cash operating gain of US$646,000 (2016: nil). The amounts 
shown as field operating expenses above are net of this sum.
(d) Write-off of development assets: In the year ended 31 December 2017, the costs of a redundant water disposal well were written off. In the 
year ended 31 December 2016, the principal source of the write-off of development assets was the US$1.650 million compensation payable 
to Schlumberger for logging tools stuck in the Uzen #4 well sidetrack.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the 
future taxable profits is probable. As at 31 December 2017, deferred income tax assets of US$1,618,000 (2016: US$1,536,000) and deferred tax 
liabilities of US$3,202,000 (2016: US$3,429,000) have been recognised. Tax losses in respect of Cyprus and the UK do not expire. The Group has 
not recognised a deferred tax asset of US$985,070 in respect of tax losses and other short-term timing differences in the UK and Cyprus (2016: 
US$1,210,070).
10. Basic and diluted profit per share – Group
Profit per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
and diluted shares in issue during the year.

Net (loss)/profit per share attributable to equity shareholders 0.004 0.015

As at 31 December 2017 there were no options outstanding. As at 31 December 2016 outstanding options in amount of 1,137 ,464 shares were 
excluded from the weighted average diluted number of shares calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The average 
market value of the Company’s shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of share options was based on quoted market prices for 
the year during which the options were outstanding. 48 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

24. Contingencies and commitments 
24.1 Capital commitments
As of the balance sheet date, all material licence work obligations have been met and all of the Group’s capital expenditures and work 
programmes are discretionary. As of the balance sheet date, the Board had approved a work programme for 2018 with a total capital 
expenditure budget of US$5.9 million, of which US$1.4 million had been contracted. The remainder is expected to be incurred but had  
not been committed to or contracted as at the balance sheet date.
24.2 Operating leases 
The Group has no non-cancellable lease rental obligations.
24.3 Taxation 
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and 
federal authorities. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in 
their interpretation of the legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the 
past may be challenged. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review  
by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review, but under certain circumstances reviews may cover 
longer periods.
At 31 December 2017 , management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group’s tax, currency and 
customs positions will be sustained.
24.4 Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
The Group operates in the upstream oil industry in the Russian Federation and its activities may have an impact on the environment. The 
enforcement of environmental regulations in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is 
continually being reconsidered. The Group periodically evaluates its obligation related thereto. The outcome of environmental liabilities under 
proposed or future legislation, or as a result of stricter interpretation and enforcement of existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated 
at present, but could be material.
Under the current levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management believes there are no significant liabilities in addition to amounts 
which are already accrued and which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
24.5 Oil field licences
The Group is subject to periodic reviews of its activities by governmental authorities with respect to the requirements of its oil field licences. 
Management of the Group corresponds with governmental authorities to agree on remedial actions, if necessary, to resolve any findings 
resulting from these reviews. Failure to comply with the terms of a licence could result in fines, penalties, licence limitation, suspension or 
revocation. The Group’s management believes any issues of non-compliance would be resolved through negotiations or corrective actions 
without any materially adverse effect on the financial position or the operating results of the Group.

Notice of Meeting  57
Notes:
1. Resolutions 1-7 are ordinary resolutions. For these resolutions to be passed, a simple majority of the votes cast at the Company’s AGM must be in favour of the resolutions. Resolutions 8 and 9 are 
special resolutions. For these resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast at the AGM must be in favour of the resolution.
2. Share buy-back (Resolution 9). The purpose of Resolution 9 is to permit the Company to purchase its own shares in the market under the terms described therein. Shares so purchased would be 
cancelled and the issued share capital of the Company accordingly reduced.
3. Only those members entered on the register of members of the Company at close of business on 5 June 2018 or, in the event that this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members as at close 
of business on the day two days before the date of any adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their 
names at that time. Changes to the entries on the register of members after close of business on 5 June 2018 or, in the event that this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members after close 
of business on the day two days before the date of the adjourned meeting, shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4. A member entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting convened by the Notice set out above is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak and, on a poll, to vote in his place. To appoint 
more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in 
aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be 
returned together in the same envelope.
5. A form of proxy is enclosed. To be effective, it must be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrars (Link Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU) so as to be 
received not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the AGM. Completion of the proxy does not preclude a member from subsequently attending and voting at the meeting in 
person if he or she so wishes.
6. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out in notes 3 and 4 above. Note that the cut-off time (in note 3 above) for receipt of proxy 
appointments also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded. Where you have appointed a proxy 
using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please contact the Company’s registrars. If you submit more than one valid proxy 
appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. 
7. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company using one of the following methods:
(a) by sending a signed hard-copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment, to the Company’s registered office address. In the case of a member which is a 
company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any 
other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or duly a certificated copy of such power of authority) must be included with the revocation notice; or 
(b) by sending an email to info@volgagas.com 
In either case, the revocation notice must be received by the Company’s registrars no later than the cut-off time set out in note 3 above.
8. The register of interests of the directors and their families in the share capital of the Company and copies of contracts of service of directors with the Company or with any of its subsidiary 
undertakings will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours (Saturdays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the 
conclusion of the AGM.
9. To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously appointed proxy via the CREST system, the CREST message must be received by the issuer’s agent (ID: RA10) no later than 48 
hours before the meeting date. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the proxy by other means. 
CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST Members who have appointed voting service provider(s) should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further information on CREST procedures, limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST Manual. We may treat as 
invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. In any case your proxy form must be received by 
the Company’s registrars no later than 48 hours before the meeting date.
10. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares. 
11. Under Section 319A of the 2006 Act, the Company must cause to be answered any question relating to the business being dealt with at the Annual General Meeting put by a member attending 
the meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, or the answer has already been 
given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered. 
  
Members who have any queries about the Annual General Meeting should contact the Company Secretary by email on info@volgagas.com. Members may not use any electronic address or fax 
number provided in this Notice or in any related documents (including the Form of Proxy) to communicate with the Company for any purpose other than those expressly stated.
12. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including information required by Section 311A of the 2006 Act, and a copy of this Notice of Annual General Meeting is available from

bcf
Billion cubic feet.
bcm
Billion cubic metres.
Best estimate
The term “best estimate” is used here 
as a generic expression for the estimate 
considered to be the closest to the quantity 
that will actually be recovered from the 
accumulation between the date of the 
estimate and the time of abandonment.
boe

gas the energy equivalent of one barrel 
of oil. The usual ratio is to equate 6,000 
cubic feet to one barrel of oil equivalent.
Condensate

that, after conditioning, the gas will be of 
pipeline quality as specified by Gazprom; 
such units include dehydration, sweetening 
and separation of natural gas liquids.
Gas-water contact
Bounding surface in a reservoir above 
which predominantly gas occurs and below 
which predominantly water occurs.
Hydrocarbons
Compounds formed from the elements 
hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) and existing

which are predominantly comprised 
of hydrocarbon compounds.
Possible reserves 
Those unproven reserves that, on the 
available evidence and taking into account 
technical and economic factors, have 
a 10% chance of being produced.
Probable reserves 
Those reserves in which hydrocarbons have 
been located within the geological structure 
with a lesser degree of certainty because 
fewer wells have been drilled and/or certain 
operational tests have not been conducted. 
Probable reserves are those reserves that, 
on the available evidence and taking into 
account technical and economic factors, have 
a better than 50% chance of being produced.
Prospective resources
Those quantities of hydrocarbons 
which are estimated, on a given date, 
to be potentially recoverable from 
undiscovered accumulations.
Proved plus probable reserves
Sum of the proved reserves and the probable 
reserves calculated in accordance with SPE 
standards.
Proved reserves 
These include reserves that are confirmed 
with a high degree of certainty through 
an analysis of development history and/
or volume method analysis of the relevant 
geological and engineering data. Proved 
reserves are those that, based on the 
available evidence and taking into account 
technical and economic factors, have a 
better than 90% chance of being produced.
Reserves
Quantities of petroleum which are 
anticipated to be commercially 
recoverable from known accumulations 
from a given date forward.

Reservoir
A porous and permeable underground 
formation containing a natural 
accumulation of producible natural 
gas and/or oil that is confined by 
impermeable rock or water barriers and 
is separate from other reservoirs.
Risk factor
For contingent resources, means the 
estimated chance, or probability, that the 
volumes will be commercially extracted; for 
prospective resources, means the chance 
or probability of discovering hydrocarbons 
in sufficient quantity for them to be tested 
to the surface; this, then, is the chance or 
probability of the prospective resource 
maturing into a contingent resource.
SPE standards
Reserves definitions consistent with those 
approved in 2007 by the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers and the World 
Petroleum Congresses. 60 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
