As a result of rising premiums across the 
market, more customers are shopping around 
and switching provider. Many customers who 
switch insurance providers are doing so via price 
comparison websites (PCW), leading to an increase 
in penetration of motor new business via PCW of 2% 
in 2017 to 70%. 
Retail is also benefitting from the continued 
growth in its share of new business sales via PCW, 
combined with a profitable maturing renewal book 
and retention rates which remain strong and above 
the market average of circa 70%.

Strategy
We have a straightforward approach; 
to provide our UK car, van, bike and 
home insurance customers with great 
service and straightforward products 
at competitive prices, however they 
choose to interact with us.
Business model
Our business model has been designed 
to be successful in the dynamic 
digital distribution segment of the UK 
insurance market, and it is underpinned 
by sophisticated IT systems, which 
are driving our strong track record of 
sustainable growth. 
The Group operates across the insurance 
value chain with clear separation to 
ensure the Underwriting business 
focuses on pricing the risk whilst the 
Retail business maximises customer 
conversion and value, without impacting 
Underwriting profi tability.
Pricing capabilities are at the heart 
of the Retail business model, with a 
team of highly specialised decision 
scientists who are empowered to drive 
sophisticated pricing structures and 
assess overall customer lifetime value. 
Underwriting has a disciplined approach 
with expertise in risk selection, which 
combined with award winning counter 
fraud capabilities enables sustainable 
and profi table growth, delivering a 
strong loss ratio at or below our target 
range of 75-79%.
Delivering value and effi  ciencies
Digital interaction is expected to 
continue to grow for the foreseeable 
future, partly due to increased use of 
mobile technology. Our digital business 
model, new Guidewire platform and 
agile approach enable us to identify 
such opportunities, outperform and 
deliver value for our shareholders. 
Guidewire is a market leading software 
that supports claims, broking and billing 
in an integrated platform. We have 
also invested in additional software 
components to increase the ability of our 
customers to self-serve through digital 
engagement. Improvements for our 
customers and our colleagues include 
more effi  cient processes through activity 
management, more informed pricing, 
and enhancing our customer services by 
providing customers with a 24/7 online 
self-service portal.
We have realised signifi cant benefi ts 
following the launch of the Guidewire 
claims module, and continue to improve 
and enhance the system based on 
colleague feedback and customer 
experience. We are following a staged 
roll out of the broker platform and by 
the end of 2017 we had all major price 
comparison websites live on Guidewire 
for private car insurance. In addition, 
we have now commenced transferring 
private car insurance renewals to 
Guidewire.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Maintaining strong leadership
This is my last statement as Chairman 
as I shall be retiring at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting in May. 
I was appointed as Chairman to guide the Company through 
the IPO and its early years as a listed entity, and to establish 
a strong Board to underpin the Company’s future growth 
and development. Whilst no formal timeframe was set for 
my tenure, I feel that having successfully achieved those 
objectives, it is now the right time for me to retire as Chairman. 
As announced in January this year, Gary Hoffman who joined 
the business as Chief Executive Officer in November 2012, will 
succeed me as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. 
Succession planning has been high on the Board’s agenda as 
it seeks to sustain the Group’s growth and development. The 
Board therefore prioritised various considerations as part 
of the succession process; primarily continuity and stability, 
together with the need for strong independent governance and 
effective strategic leadership. 
The Board is aware of the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) in that a Chief Executive should not 
go on to be Chairman of the same company but, after full and 
careful consideration, the Directors agreed unanimously that 
Gary’s transition from Chief Executive Officer to Chairman would 
be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Gary has been a key individual in the Group’s success, not only 
in the years leading up to the IPO, but in the period since, which 
has seen nine successive quarters of profitable growth. The 
Board therefore regarded retaining Gary’s services as critical to 
the Group’s continued success. Gary has extensive experience of 
chairing various boards, notably having served as Vice-Chairman 
of Barclays plc, Chairman of Barclay’s UK Banking division and 
Barclaycard, and currently serves as Non-Executive Chairman 
of VISA Europe. Gary will not chair or be a member of any Board 
Committees and Tom Colraine, Senior Independent Director, 
will be appointed as Chairman of the Company’s Nomination 
Committee from 1 March 2018. 
“ The changes to the 
Board leave the Company 
in very safe hands to 
enable its continued 
success for the benefit 
of all stakeholders.”
Mike Fairey 
Chairman
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
12 | Chairman’s statement In anticipation of Gary’s appointment 
as Chairman, Toby van der Meer, who 
has been the Managing Director of 
the Company’s UK trading subsidiary, 
Hastings Insurance Services Limited 
since 2011, will be appointed to the 
Board with effect from 1 March 2018 as 
Chief Executive Officer. Toby has played 
a pivotal role in the significant growth 
and development of the Group’s retail 
business over the past six years and is a 
well respected leader within the Group. 
I congratulate both Gary and Toby on 
their appointments. 
In my statement last year, I explained 
that on 1 March 2017, Rand Merchant 
Investment Holdings Limited (RMI), 
a South African investment holding 
company acquired 29.9% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. Under 
the terms of a relationship agreement 
between RMI and the Company, as 
long as RMI holds at least 15% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, RMI is 
entitled to appoint one Director to the 
Company’s Board. Herman Bosman, 
Chief Executive Officer of RMI was 
appointed as a Director of the Company 
on 14 March 2017 and at the same time; 
Michele Titi-Cappelli (representative of 
the Goldman Sachs Shareholders) and 
Edward Fitzmaurice (representative of 
the Founder Shareholders), resigned 
as Directors.
On behalf of the Board, I welcome 
Herman as a Director who brings a 
wealth of experience in the insurance 
and banking sectors. In August this year, 
Richard Brewster, also a representative of 
the Founder Shareholders, resigned as a 
Director. He was succeeded by Founder 
Shareholder nominee, Selina Sagayam in 
August this year. I express my gratitude 
to Michele, Edward and Richard for their 
contribution as Directors of the Company 
and welcome Selina. 
The diversity of the Board was also 
reviewed by the Nomination Committee 
and a detailed explanation of the 
Board approved policy on diversity is 
set out in that Committee’s report on 
page 79. As announced on 2 February 
2018, Malcolm Le May tendered 
his resignation as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company following his 
appointment as Group Chief Executive 
Officer of Provident Financial plc. The 
date on which Malcolm’s resignation will 
become effective has yet to be decided 
and the Company is in discussions 
regarding an appropriate period 
of notice.
When the Company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in 2015, it was 
not fully compliant with the Code due to 
the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee. This non-compliance was as 
a result of the requirement of the major 
shareholders at the time of the IPO  
to be represented on this Committee;  
this stipulation was part of the 
relationship agreement between  
the Company and these shareholders. 
The Board agreed that the independence 
of the Remuneration Committee was 
not compromised as it has had an 
independent Chairman and a majority 
of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Following discussions with 
the shareholders in question, I am 
pleased to announce that they have 
no longer nominated Directors to the 
Remuneration Committee and the 
composition of this Committee is  
now fully Code compliant.
Further information on the changes 
to the composition of the Board and 
its Committees are covered within the 
Corporate Governance section later on 
in this report.
Optimising shareholder value – 
dividends 
The Board remains confident in the 
Group’s long term prospects and is 
pleased to propose a final dividend of 
8.5p per share. This dividend will be 
paid on 31 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register on 4 May 2018 with an 
ex-dividend date of 3 May 2018. This 
is the Company’s second dividend for 
the year having paid 4.1p per share in 
November, taking the full year dividend 
to 12.6p per share. This final dividend is 
subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
24 May 2018.
Farewell
It has been a pleasure to serve as 
Chairman of the Company and to 
oversee its early years as a publicly listed 
company. The changes to the Board 
will leave the Company in very safe 
hands to enable its continued success 
for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
I thank Gary, his management team 
and all of the colleagues at Hastings 
for their hard work, commitment 
and dedication contributing to the 
profitable and sustainable growth of 
the Group to date. I would also like 
to thank our shareholders for their 
support throughout my tenure. I remain 
confident that the Group will continue to 
deliver long-term value and returns for 
shareholders.

Chief Executive Officer
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
14 | Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A Q
Tell us more about how you will 
achieve your new targets? 
A
We set ourselves four targets at the time 
of the IPO and we refreshed these in 
March 2017. Our targets include a growth 
target: to have 3 million customers 
during 2019; a risk target: to deliver a 
calendar year loss ratio within the range 
of 75 - 79%; and two cash and capital 
targets: to reduce our net debt leverage 
multiple to 1.0x during 2019, and to 
continue paying a healthy dividend with 
a payout ratio of between 50% and 60%.
We’ve continued to make good progress 
in executing our growth strategy, with 
a 13% increase in policy numbers 
throughout 2017, and are very confident 
of meeting our target of 3 million 
customers during 2019.
The majority of our planned growth 
will come from our core motor book, 
with continued momentum from an 
increasing share of price comparison 
websites (PCW) sales, a profitable 
maturing book and the launch of a 
new multicar proposition in 2018 which 
will be enabled by the implementation 
of Guidewire. 
We are continuing to see more 
customers using PCW to buy their 
insurance and we have been able to 
apply our successful approach in motor 
to the home insurance market. We now 
have over 2.6 million customers and we 
started underwriting home insurance 
ourselves as a lead insurer in small 
volumes earlier this year.
Q
It’s been a year since RMI 
acquired 29.9% of the Company. 
How has the relationship 
evolved? 
A
The transaction with RMI concluded 
on 1 March 2017, and represents a 
real statement of intent and long term 
confidence in Hastings. Since then, 
Herman Bosman, the Chief Executive 
Officer of RMI has joined our Board and 
attended many board meetings and 
provided additional insights. 
When we announced RMI as our 
new major shareholder, we said that 
we might explore potential areas of 
co-operation with them and their 
subsidiary, OUTsurance, given their 
experience in the general insurance 
market and if it was the right thing to do 
for our 4Cs ways of working. To support 
our colleagues and customers in early 
2018, we started working in partnership 
with OUTsurance to take calls primarily 
over evenings and weekends. This is in 
addition to the large scale recruitment 
across our UK sites, which will allow 
us to improve shift patterns for our 
Hastings colleagues, making them more 
flexible and reducing the number of 
evenings and weekends they are asked 
to work. As you would expect when  
we shared this news internally it was  
well received.
Q
How has Hastings invested in 
colleagues to support future 
growth plans?
A
Our continued success is a testament 
to the work of our colleagues and we 
are very lucky to have some of the 
best people in the industry working 
for us. Our agile, data driven business 
model and strong reputation have 
attracted some very experienced 
colleagues this year into senior roles 
that will help us deliver ambitious 
growth plans. We continue to attract 
a growing number of full time and 
part time colleagues who deliver great 
customer and claims service at our head 
office site in Bexhill and second site in 
Leicester which is now home to over 
1,200 colleagues. We have introduced 
a new homeworking model for some of 
our frontline colleagues and plan to use 
OUTsurance more this year to support 
our colleagues and customers, primarily 
over evenings and weekends. 
We remain committed to developing the 
skills and careers of all of our colleagues 
and to provide them with the right tools 
to do their jobs. In 2017, we launched 
our new internal career portal that 
provides information about internal 
career frameworks and guidance on the 
training and development colleagues 
need to help develop their careers with 
Hastings. We also made significant 
investment in Guidewire our new 
system that will help both colleagues 
and customers.

Q
There’s been significant 
investment in Guidewire; can 
you tell us more about it and 
its implementation?
A
Guidewire is a market leading software 
that supports claims, broking and billing 
in an integrated platform. We have 
also invested in additional software 
components to increase the ability of 
our customers to self-serve through 
digital engagement. Improvements 
for our customers and our colleagues 
include reducing the claims lifecycle, 
more informed pricing, and enhancing 
our customer services by providing a 
24/7 online self-service portal.
We have realised significant benefits 
following the launch of the claims 
module, and continue to improve and 
enhance the system based on colleague 
feedback and customer experience. 
We are following a staged roll out of 
the broker platform and all major PCW 
were live on Guidewire for private 
car insurance by the end of 2017. In 
addition, we have commenced migrating 
our private car insurance renewals 
business to Guidewire. It will enable 
efficiencies that will deliver value and 
provide a platform for future growth.
Q
What is your outlook on premium 
rate increases? 
A
We began increasing premiums in the 
first half of 2014, ahead of the market 
that started raising rates in 2015, after 
a three year period of sustained price 
reductions. Premiums continued to rise 
across the market driven by continuing 
claims inflation, with additional increases 
seen following the change to the Ogden 
rate announced in February 2017, 
which increased both claims costs and 
the cost for excess of loss reinsurance. 
In the last quarter of 2017, we started 
seeing pricing fluctuations following 
the UK Government’s subsequent 
announcement regarding further 
proposed changes to the Ogden 
rate calculation. 
As you look into the future, we would 
expect premium rate changes to 
follow claims inflation, with some 
uncertainty surrounding the proposed 
changes to the Ogden rate, and also 
from the planned whiplash reforms. 
As ever, we continue to focus on the 
quality of our underwriting, and the 
agility of our pricing model means we 
can react quickly to claims, market 
or regulatory changes.
Q
What’s your view on the impact 
of autonomous cars on the 
insurance industry? 
A
We welcome any environment that 
improves road safety; however we do 
view broad adoption of fully automated 
vehicles as being many years away. 
Manufacturers will continue to introduce 
partial automation that will improve 
the safety of vehicles and in turn help 
to reduce the frequency of accidents. 
We have found that the improvements 
in technology have made it more 
expensive to repair vehicle damage, 
which is offsetting the benefits from 
lower frequency of accidents. We expect 
these trends to continue in the future 
and we use our data and analytical skills 
to build these changes into our prudent 
underwriting approach.

16 | Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A Q
Can you tell us about corporate 
responsibility at Hastings?
A
It’s important for me and my colleagues 
to see firsthand the difference we 
can make through our charitable and 
community interactions so we focus  
our attention locally rather than 
supporting national or global initiatives. 
This approach is embraced by our 
colleagues through their fundraising 
efforts and participation in  
community days.
As an example, in July, our leadership 
team took the opportunity to join forces 
to give back to the local community and 
say thank you for the past 20 years. 
The teams took part in beach cleaning, 
student career advice and providing 
afternoon tea and bingo for older people, 
and also ran charity shops with items 
donated by colleagues. It was great to 
give practical help as well as raise money 
for our local charity partners.
I am very proud of the work we do with 
local students in Bexhill and Leicester 
through our ‘Be the Change’ programme 
which aims to raise the aspirations of 
local 13 and 14 year olds by providing 
workshops, one to one sessions and 
workplace visits. It is particularly 
humbling and gratifying when students 
speak openly and honestly about their 
actions or feelings as a result of our 
business mentors sharing their own 
experiences with them. I know that my 
fellow business mentors are equally 
as proud of Be the Change and the 
difference we can make to the younger 
members of our local communities.
Q
What has been your personal 
highlight of 2017?
A
We’ve achieved a number of milestones 
including celebrating our 20th anniversary 
with our colleagues and communities. 
In the time that I have been here, live 
customer policies (LCP) have more than 
doubled – from 1.1 million in 2012 to over 
2.6 million today – and our colleague 
numbers have increased to over 3,100. 
Another key highlight is RMI’s investment 
of 29.9% in Hastings. This shows a 
real statement of intent and long term 
confidence in what we are, what we are 
doing and what we are going to do. 
I am honoured to be part of the 
Hastings 20 year history and the team 
that has achieved so much in creating 
a successful, fast growing UK general 
insurance provider.
 
Q
Looking forward, why the change 
from Chief Executive Officer to 
Chairman? 
A
With Mike Fairey’s decision to retire as 
Chairman at the AGM in May 2018 and 
the Board’s unanimous support, it felt 
as if it was the right thing to do. It allows 
me to remain part of the Hastings family 
and to draw on my experience of chairing 
boards and committees, notably as Vice-
Chairman of Barclays PLC, Chairman of 
UK Banking and Barclaycard at Barclays, 
and in my current role as Non-Executive 
Chairman of VISA Europe. 
Mike has achieved a huge amount for 
us over the past three years, including 
guiding us through the IPO and our early 
years as a listed entity, and I wish him all 
the best on his retirement.
 
Q
What do you think Toby van der 
Meer will bring to the role of Chief 
Executive Officer? 
A
Toby has an extensive background in 
direct financial services and I am delighted 
that we were able to promote internally 
after an industry wide search. 
Before joining Hastings, Toby was a 
Managing Director at MoneySupermarket, 
one of the UK’s leading PCW, where 
he was responsible for the money and 
broker led businesses and operations. 
Before that he spent nearly a decade in 
senior financial services roles including 
leading Citigroup UK’s retail bank and 
as a member of the executive team of 
online bank Egg. Toby joined us in 2011 
as Managing Director for Retail and in 
this role has been responsible for the 
development of the Company’s UK Retail 
business, which covers around two 
thirds of our Group profits. Toby also has 
considerable digital and customer service 
experience, and is currently responsible 
for product and retail pricing, brand 
and marketing, digital, and customer 
operations at our Bexhill and Leicester 
sites. In his seven years with us, Toby has 
played a pivotal role in the significant 
growth and development of the Group’s 
Retail business and he is a well respected 
leader within the Group. These credentials 
and his commitment to our 4Cs ways of 
working, make Toby a natural successor to 
take Hastings forward to the next stage of 
its journey. I wish Toby every success in his 
new role.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc What’s shaping our market
We review the trends and dynamics of our market on an ongoing basis to stay 
ahead of the curve in terms of competitive positioning. Our industry expertise 
informs how we develop products, approach industry issues and ensure 
continuing growth.
Distribution trends 
The private car, van and bike insurance 
markets in the UK are some of the 
most competitive markets in the world. 
The internet and digital age have 
enabled customers to access a large 
amount of information about their car 
insurance quickly and the growth of 
price comparison websites (PCW) has 
been instrumental in creating such 
an environment. 
The number of cars on the road has 
remained relatively stable and grew by an 
average of 1% per year between 2007 and 
2017 . However, over the same period the 
proportion of car new business sales from 
PCW has increased from 24% to 70%. 
Consumers are increasingly using digital 
devices and technology to purchase their 
insurance products. In such an intensely 
competitive market, only the most agile 
and adaptive businesses can outperform. 
At Hastings, our way of thinking, 
processes and procedures are optimised 
for the digital distribution and PCW 
market, and the implementation of our 
Guidewire platform is further enhancing 
our capability. We continually monitor all 
segments of the market and are able both 
to react quickly to changes, and to identify 
and quickly explore opportunities.
Claims trends 
In recent years we have seen continued 
claims infl ation of 5-6% per annum, 
attributable to increases in the 
average cost per claim, driven in part 
by increasingly expensive technology 
built into vehicle components as well 
as the change to the Ogden rate in 
February 2017. 
This is particularly the case for third 
party property damage, where the 
impact of the Coles Hetherton case 
continues to drive up repair bills. It is 
also true for personal injury, where 
claims management companies remain 
active and solicitors appear to be taking 
a more aggressive approach in relation 
to larger personal injury claims.
We continue to monitor the progress 
of the whiplash reforms, following the 
announcement of a cap to the amount 
people can claim for whiplash injuries 
in the Chancellor’s 2016 autumn 
statement, and a ban on the right to 
cash compensation. An increase is also 
planned to the small claims court limit 
for all personal injury claims from £1,000 
to £5,000 with the aim of reducing the 
volume of fraudulent whiplash claims 
across the industry. 
Hastings continues to benefi t from 
its risk selection techniques and use 
of technology to monitor and report 
claims in order to minimise costs and 
the impact on its customers. We also 
actively monitor fraud activity in the 
market and continue to invest in our 
counter-fraud capabilities.
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
18 | Market overview Pricing trends 
Price increases have continued across 
the market during 2017, sustaining the 
momentum of premium inflation since 
the beginning of 2015, with premium 
increases exceeding claims inflation. 
We expect future premium rate changes 
to follow claims inflation, which may be 
impacted by the proposed changes to the 
Ogden rate, and any effect this may have 
on personal injury settlement amounts 
and excess of loss reinsurance rates. 
The level of pricing sophistication in 
the car, van, bike and home insurance 
markets continues to increase through 
an improvement in both the breadth 
and quality of data being used and 
the mathematical techniques utilised 
by insurers to analyse the data. Our 
passion for data and analytics underpins 
our advanced risk selection and, 
alongside our award winning counter-
fraud capabilities, enables the Group to 
sustain strong loss ratios whilst gaining 
market share.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc A successful performance
Our key performance indicators (KPIs) outlined below are used to monitor 
our overall strategic progress and shareholder value.
Financial KPIs
Measure
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit is the Group’s 
primary profit measure used to assess 
operating performance. It is defined as 
profit before taxation expense, finance 
costs, amortisation and depreciation, 
non-trading costs and the effects of 
accounting for business combinations.
This is a non-IFRS measure which is 
used by management as it includes 
the underlying trading results of 
the Group without the impact 
of Group reorganisations and 
business combinations. 
Adjusted operating profit margin
Adjusted operating profit 
margin measures the Group’s 
operational efficiency.
It represents adjusted operating profit 
divided by net revenue.
Profit/(loss) after tax
Profit/(loss) after tax represents the 
Group’s performance under IFRS, 
including interest expense, the effects 
of accounting for business combinations 
and non-trading costs.
Calendar year loss ratio
Calendar year loss ratio is a measure of 
underwriting performance, representing 
net claims incurred divided by net 
earned premiums.
The Group’s target is a loss ratio of 
between 75% and 79%.
Performance
The Group has maintained consistent 
profitable growth in 2017, with adjusted 
operating profit growing by 39% in the 
year to £184.1m for 2017. This primarily 
reflects the 13% increase in live customer 
policies and the continuing year on year 
premium rate increases earning through, 
as well as the £20.0m impact of the 
Ogden rate reduction in 2016.
The Group’s adjusted operating profit 
margin has increased to 25.7% for 2017, 
due to the profitable growth in the 
business and impact in the prior year of 
the reduction in the Ogden rate. 
The Group’s profit after tax of £126.7m 
has improved significantly due to the 
profitable growth of the business, and 
the impact of the Ogden rate reduction 
in the prior year.
The Group’s calendar year loss ratio 
has improved to be better than the 
target range, demonstrating the Group’s 
continued focus on underwriting 
discipline and claims management, 
as well as the earn through of higher 
average premiums. 
The 31 December 2016 calendar year 
loss ratio also included the 4.0% impact 
of the Ogden rate change.

24 | Key performance indicators Measure
Expense ratio
Expense ratio is a measure of 
underwriting operational efficiency, 
representing incurred operational and 
acquisition expenses, net of certain 
reinsurance commissions, divided by 
net earned premiums. See page 157 for 
reconciliation to profit before tax.
Combined operating ratio
Combined operating ratio is a measure 
of the Group’s overall underwriting 
performance.
It is the sum of the calendar year loss 
ratio and the expense ratio, as defined 
above. See page 157 for reconciliation to 
profit before tax.
Solvency II coverage ratio
The Group’s underwriting subsidiary, 
Advantage Insurance Company Limited 
(AICL), is subject to the Solvency II (SII) 
capital adequacy regime.
The SII coverage ratio demonstrates 
AICL’s capital adequacy and represents 
its own funds, as measured under SII, 
against its Solvency Capital Requirement 
(SCR), being the capital threshold 
determined by the EIOPA Solvency II 
Directive and, as a result, required by 
its regulator, the Gibraltar Financial 
Services Commission (GFSC).
Net debt leverage multiple
Net debt leverage multiple measures 
the Group’s net debt relative to its profit 
generation and therefore reflects the 
Group’s cash generation, level of debt 
and growth in profitability.
It is calculated as the Group’s net debt 
divided by adjusted operating profit. 
Net debt is calculated as gross debt less 
Retail free cash and corporate free cash, 
as at the end of the year. 
See page 158 for reconciliation to cash 
and cash equivalents.
Performance
The Group’s expense ratio has remained 
competitive and is broadly flat for 2017 
due to costs incurred in relation to 
strong new business growth achieved 
in the year offsetting the growth in 
earned premiums.
The Group continues to deliver a 
competitive combined operating ratio 
that reflects its underwriting discipline 
and operating efficiency. 
AICL has benefitted from continued 
capital growth and the application of 
undertaking specific parameters (USPs) to 
the calculation of the SCR, as granted by 
the GFSC during the year.
These USPs allow AICL to use its own data 
and experience for premium and reserve 
risk and therefore better reflect AICL’s 
business model. 
AICL has consistently maintained a 
margin above the SCR threshold required 
throughout the year, ensuring that AICL is 
well capitalised. 
With strong operational cash inflows 
and growth in adjusted operating profit, 
the Group is on track to deliver a net 
debt leverage multiple of 1.0x during 
2019, with a reduction to 1.4x as at 
31 December 2017, from 1.9x in the 
prior year.

Measure
Share of total stock (private car)
Share of total stock (private car) 
measures the Group’s share of the total 
UK private car population as at the end 
of each year.
Live customer policies
Live customer policies is a principal 
measure of the Group’s position 
within the UK car and home 
insurance markets. 
It represents total live policies sold by 
Retail for which the customer remains 
on cover.
Live customer policies per full time 
equivalent employee (FTE)
Live customer policies per FTE measures 
the Group’s operational efficiency.
It is calculated as average live  
customer policies per average FTE.
Performance
The Group’s private car market share 
has continued to increase alongside  
the growth in its LCP, reaching 7.3%  
as at 31 December 2017.
The Group is on track to meet its target 
of 3.0 million live customer policies 
during 2019, having maintained strong 
growth of 13%, to reach 2.64 million at 
31 December 2017.
Live customer policies per FTE 
increased in 2017, as the Group realised 
efficiencies from continued investment 
in the business.

Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc
Chief Financial Officer’s statement  | 27 We have achieved another record year 
of customer numbers and premiums, as 
we work towards achieving the promises 
made last year. Live customer policies 
increased by 13% to 2.64 million as our 
refreshingly straightforward approach 
continued to attract new customers and 
helped maintain our strong retention 
rates. This increase in policies, combined 
with sustained premium rate increases 
following the Ogden rate change in 
February, has driven gross written 
premiums up 21% to £930.8m. Due to 
both the earn through of these higher 
average premiums and a rigorous focus 
on maintaining underwriting discipline, 
we have achieved a calendar year loss 
ratio of 73.0%, below our target range of 
between 75% and 79%.
Maintaining strong growth has not been 
achieved at the expense of profitability, 
as we have delivered adjusted operating 
profit of £184.1m, up 39%, generating 
retail free cash of £114.1m (2016: £98.1m). 
This has enabled us to continue to 
reduce our net debt leverage multiple 
whilst strengthening the balance sheet 
and paying dividends within our target 
range. The Board has proposed a final 
dividend of 8.5p per share, which, in 
addition to the interim dividend of 4.1p 
per share paid in November, means 
total dividends in respect of 2017 will 
be £82.8m, a payout ratio of 55.5%.
We continue to invest in the future 
and Guidewire, our state of the art 
integrated claims and broking platform, 
has successfully continued its phased 
roll out, achieving the milestone of 
handling all new business quotes for 
car insurance from price comparison 
websites. Guidewire allows us to deliver 
increased digital and self-service 
capabilities, more efficient claims 
handling and improved services for 
all our customers. 
The Group’s Underwriting business, 
Advantage Insurance Company Limited 
(AICL), remains well positioned to 
continue to expand. During the year, the 
Gibraltar Financial Services Commission 
granted AICL the right to apply 
undertaking specific parameters (USPs) 
when calculating its solvency coverage 
requirement. The use of USPs combined 
with continued capital growth of the 
business has allowed AICL to increase  
its solvency coverage ratio to 167%  
(2016: 140%).
I am proud of our achievements as 
we deliver another year of profitable 
growth whilst further strengthening the 
financial and operational performance 
of the Group. We continue to deliver on 
the promises we made and propose a 
final dividend of 8.5p per share.

Strong growth in live customer policies (LCP) combined with average written premium increases have driven growth in profit 
after tax from £78.4m to £126.7m for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
The prior year results were impacted by the reduction in the personal injury discount rate (the Ogden rate) which is used to 
settle large personal injury claims. This was reduced from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, with effect from 20 March 2017, which resulted 
in a reduction in adjusted operating profit of £20.0m and a decrease in profit after tax of £18.0m. 
On 7 September 2017, however, the UK Government announced their intention to introduce legislation that would result in the 
discount rate being calculated with reference to the yields on a portfolio of low risk investments. This would likely result in an 
increase to the discount rate but the legislation has not yet been enacted.

Total gross written premiums 930.8 769.0
Total gross earned premiums 856.1 691.8
Gross written premiums have increased by 21%, principally 
driven by private car policies as Hastings continued to grow 
market share to 7.3%. 
Through agile pricing and data enrichment, the Group 
has been able to make targeted rate increases resulting in 
average written premiums per policy increasing by 7% whilst 
maintaining its above market average retention rate.
The Group has continued to apply its digital business model 
to the home insurance market and during the year, the 
Group’s underwriting business began writing home insurance 
as lead insurer having built experience by participating in a 
co-insurance arrangement as secondary insurer. Home LCP 
of 173,000 (2016: 168,000) are 3% higher than the prior year 
as the Group ensures a disciplined approach is applied to 
its transition to underwriting the new product. The Group 
has also agreed terms with a number of additional home 
insurance underwriters to join the Group’s panel in 2018.

Net revenue has grown by 21% to £715.6m for the period

broking revenue streams.
Sustained growth in LCP and the earn through of higher 
average written premiums increased net earned premiums  
by 22% to £410.1m over the prior period (2016: £334.8m). 
The growth in policies sold has also led to increased fees 
on the sale of insurance contracts and increased ancillary 
product income. Premium finance interest income benefitted 
from the combination of higher average premiums and a 
continued increase in the number of customers paying in 
monthly instalments.
Reinsurance commissions recognised have grown as a result 
of an increase in underlying earned premiums, the reduction 
in accident year and calendar year loss ratios and the impact 
of the Ogden rate reduction in the prior year.

The calendar year loss ratio has improved significantly

of premium rate increases applied over the last 12 months 
outweighing claims inflation during the year. Average earned 
premiums have increased 7% year on year compared to claims 
inflation of 5%, reducing the Group’s accident year loss ratio 
to 73.8%. Positive prior year development of £3.1m (2016 
adverse development of £3.7m) reduced the calendar year 
loss ratio to 73.0%.
The expense ratio for the period increased slightly as 
the Group continued to invest in the business, including 
integrating Guidewire and claims management services to 
support future growth and efficiencies.
The Group’s combined operating ratio reduced as the 
reduction in the calendar year loss ratio offset the slight

The 39% increase in adjusted operating profit to £184.1m

through of higher average premiums and the increase in 
retail income as well as the £20.0m impact of the Ogden rate 
reduction recognised in 2016. 
Profit after tax increased 62% due to higher adjusted 
operating profit, lower finance costs and a reduction in  
non-trading expenses.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £22.3m (2016: £15.9m), an 
effective tax rate (ETR) of 15.0% (2016: 16.9%). The tax charge 
has increased due to higher profits before tax; however the 
ETR has decreased due to a reduction in the UK corporation 
tax rate and changes to the mix of taxable profit earned by 
Underwriting, which is taxed in Gibraltar, and Retail, which is 
taxed in the UK. The Group’s future ETR will depend upon the 
mix of profits taxable in the UK and Gibraltar.

The Group’s activities continue to be highly cash generative 
and net cash inflow from operating activities during 2017 
was £221.7m (2016: £172.5m), of which £114.1m was free 
cash generated from the Retail business (2016: £98.1m). 
This was partially offset by dividend payments, interest and 
loan repayments and capital expenditure, principally on the 
development of the Guidewire system.
During the year, the Group successfully amended its loan 
facility agreement to extend it by six months and replace the 
£290.0m Term Loan and £20.0m Revolving Credit Facility with 
a £310.0m Revolving Credit Facility, which allows the Group 
more flexibility in managing its borrowing facilities and cash

Credit Facility was drawn.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s percentage of the total 
portfolio of investments rated A or equivalent and above  
was 75% (31 December 2016: 77%). The weighted average 
credit rating of the investment portfolio continued to be A+ 
(31 December 2016: A+).
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents and investments 
portfolio primarily comprises investment grade fixed income 
debt securities, money market funds and investment funds 
managed by third parties.
Insurance contract liabilities
Total insurance contract liabilities of £1,665.6m at  
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £1,299.5m) 
comprise £472.3m (31 December 2016: £397.6m) of 
unearned premiums, which are deferred and recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss in subsequent periods, and 
outstanding claims liabilities of £1,193.3m (31 December 2016: 
£901.9m). Gross outstanding liabilities have increased due to 
the greater exposure from the increase in LCP and the impact 
of claims inflation.
The Group applies a consistent reserving methodology to 
calculate an internal actuarial best estimate and then reserves 
an additional risk margin. The margin has been maintained at 
a consistent level year on year. 
The Group’s reinsurance programme, described below, 
manages insurance risk and protects against volatile 
movements typically caused by large claims.

outstanding claims liabilities and unearned premiums, 
increased by 32% to £1,087.7m as at 31 December 2017  
(2016: £822.0m) due to the greater exposure from increasing 
policy volumes. 
The Group uses excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
arrangements to limit its exposure to claims. The excess of 
loss programme limits the Group’s exposure on any individual 
event to £1.0m and the quota share arrangement provides 
50% cover on motor claims incurred, after the excess of loss 
recoveries. The combination of these arrangements reduces 
volatility that could otherwise be caused by the accumulation 
of losses and individual large claims.
The Group has successfully renegotiated its reinsurance 
programme for 2018 to maintain the same level of coverage. 
The Group carefully manages risk within the portfolio by 
working with a range of high quality, highly regarded and 
stable reinsurers.

Our 4Cs ways of working always 
start with colleagues. We believe that 
engaged colleagues lead to happy 
customers so we are committed to 
listening to, developing and investing 
in our colleagues so they continue to 
contribute, thrive and be who they are.
Contribute 
As we grow, it’s important that 
colleagues share how they feel about life 
at Hastings. Regular conversations allow 
us to listen and respond in the best 
possible way.
We encourage two-way feedback through a number 
of channels, including:
Your Voice Our annual engagement survey is designed to understand how 
colleagues feel about life at Hastings and what we do for our 
4Cs. We then capture key themes raised by colleagues through 
companywide and local action plans that feed through to 4Cs 
objectives so we can make improvements where necessary and 
importantly, we can measure progress through the year. 
This gives us one view so we regularly ask for colleagues to 
share their thoughts, ideas and frustrations through all of our 
communication channels to make sure we that we focus on 
things that are front of mind. 
Some of the key changes we have made as a result of colleague 
feedback include wider and more frequent recognition through 
our 4Cs Awards process; more training opportunities, changes 
to shift patterns and back to the floor days for leaders to stay 
in touch with colleagues and what they do for our customers 
every day.

Our colleague elected representatives from across the 
business meet monthly to consult with the company on any key 
changes and provide invaluable feedback and insight from their 
teams.As a result of their input we have made some significant 
changes ranging from improved benefits to simplified HR 
policies and processes.
Small change Agility is key to our success and we apply focus on the big 
changes and small fixes in equal measure. To support this 
thinking, we created a ‘small change’ team in January 2017 who 
worked with our Hastings Colleague Forum to get colleague 
feedback and prioritise the small operational things that they 
would like us to fix or change such as changes to internal 
processes that help provide our customers with first call

We regularly recognise and reward 
the hard work and dedication our 
colleagues deliver providing a high 
quality service experience for customers 
– whether it’s just by saying thank you, 
awarding a voucher or by celebrating 
with them at our 4Cs Awards event in 
the summer or Christmas parties. We 
also use the 4Cs to recognise and thank 
colleagues for going the extra mile on 
a monthly and annual basis. Our 4Cs 
Awards programme offers colleagues 
the chance to nominate their team 
members for their achievements and 
the positive impressions they make on 
all our colleagues, company, customers 
and local communities. In 2017 we 
had over 2,000 nominations and the 
winners of seven categories received 
their coveted awards at the annual 4Cs 
Awards final event. 
Be who you are…
Attracting, recruiting and retaining talent 
is vitally important for us as we grow. 
Our agility, clear identity and 4Cs way of 
working is why we stand out and what 
makes us who we are. Feedback from 
colleague surveys and focus groups 
tells us that although we do need to do 
some things better, colleagues really 
like working at Hastings and feel they 
can truly be themselves and bring their 
personality to work. They feel supported 
by their colleagues, that there is a strong 
sense of team and a focus on getting it 
right for customers.

Over the last 12 months we have been 
successful in recruiting a number of 
females to senior roles. We acknowledge 
there is an imbalance in the number 
of senior females in the organisation 
and we are taking steps to address this, 
whilst ensuring shareholders’ interests 
are protected by appointing the best 
candidates into demanding senior 
leadership positions. We are realistic 
that this will take time to achieve, 
but are putting in place a number of 
internal initiatives aimed at increasing 
female representation. These are 
likely to encompass colleague lifecycle 
activities such as recruitment, induction, 
maternity, talent and succession 
planning.
We have also signed up to the 30% 
Club (www.30percentclub.org) to 
demonstrate our commitment to having 
more women in senior leadership roles. 
Our aim is for women to represent 30% 
of senior leaders in the Group by 2020.

Hastings stands out because we focus 
on getting it right for our 4Cs. We 
work with our suppliers to make sure 
that we adopt an aligned approach 
to caring for our environment where 
possible. It is our belief that ethical 
conduct is an integral component of 
running a business successfully and 
it is an expectation we have of both 
our colleagues and our suppliers. 
We continually look at ways to make 
improvements so we can continue 
to serve our communities and be a 
good neighbour.
Strong supplier relationships are vital to 
our continued success. We work closely 
with our local and national suppliers to 
communicate our standards, values, 
principles and sustainability goals to 
them. By working with our suppliers, 
we can offer the best price, product 
and service solutions to benefit our 
customers and colleagues. 
Each colleague is responsible for 
achieving the highest level of business 
conduct and for delivering our everyday 
activities in a way that reflects ethical 
principles. We play our part by:
 • inviting our customers to receive all 
their documentation electronically; 
 • supporting local businesses with a 
range of unique offers that encourage 
and incentivise our colleagues to 
buy from local retailers, suppliers 
and services;
 • promoting a Travel Green initiative 
that supports our colleagues in 
making greener journeys to work 
through car sharing, increased cycle

a good neighbour, investing in local 
education initiatives and being an  
ethical member of the financial  
services community. 
A good neighbour
Our Charity Events Committee is 
made up entirely of colleagues who 
volunteer to organise fundraising events 
throughout the year for local charities 
nominated by colleagues. The Hastings 
Community Fund provides a helping 
hand to local individuals or groups by 
providing advice, physical support or 
small grants to help with fundraising. In 
2017 we raised over £65,000 for local 
charities and organisations and spent 
over 1,000 days in our communities. As 
part of our InsurePink product offering, 
where £10 for every insurance policy 
purchased via the brand is donated to 
a breast cancer charity (Pink Ribbon

42 |  Corporate responsibility How we protect our business
The management of the business and execution of our strategy are  
subject to a number of risks. We have a system of analysis, assessment  
and mitigation planning in place to ensure that we maintain readiness for  
a range of eventualities. 
Our approach
The Board has established a culture of 
effective risk management through the 
identification, measurement mitigation, 
monitoring and reporting of risks 
throughout the Group. The Board also 
sets risk appetite, reviews risks, both 
existing and emerging, and considers 
risk when reviewing the Group’s strategy 
and in meeting its objectives.
The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s risk management 
framework and delegates the oversight 
of this to the Risk Committee. This 
Committee is a formal sub-Committee 
of the Board with its own Terms 
of Reference. 
The principal purpose of the Risk 
Committee is to advise the Board on 
risk management matters, recommend 
the Group framework of risk limits and 
risk appetite to the Board for approval 
and oversee the risk management 
arrangements of the Company and 
the Group generally. The Committee 
ensures that the material risks facing 
the Group have been identified and 
that appropriate arrangements are in 
place to manage, mitigate, monitor and 
report those risks effectively and also 
ensures that the responsibility for doing 
so in each of the regulated subsidiaries 
has been effectively delegated to the 
respective company boards.
Each regulated subsidiary has its own 
risk management committee structure 
that ensure all risks, however they 
are categorised, are reported to and 
reviewed by the appropriate committee. 
Business operational areas maintain 
risk registers and through the oversight 
functions report risk details and 
mitigation measures together with other 
relevant management information for 
the committees and ultimately Board 
consideration. Risk management data 
from the subsidiaries is consolidated 
for the Group Committees and Board 
for review.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the 
prospects and viability of the Group 
over a period longer than 12 months, 
in accordance with provision C2.2 of 
the 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Directors’ assessment has 
been made with reference to the 
Group’s current financial position and 
prospects. The period assessed of 
three years aligns with the Group’s 
medium term strategic planning 
process (the Three Year Plan) which 
the Directors review on an annual 
basis. The Three Year Plan is based 
on the Board’s strategy, risk appetite 
and assessment of the principal risks 
as detailed on page 48, as well as how 
these are managed. Three years is 
considered appropriate for assessing 
the viability of the Group as it strikes 
a good balance between the need to 
forecast over a longer period, whilst 
recognising the pace of change within 
the industry, uncertainty surrounding 
insurance market pricing cycles and 
the risks and opportunities that 
may emerge.
The Three Year Plan is constructed 
based on the commercial activities of 
the Group’s Retail and Underwriting 
businesses. This includes a detailed 
analysis of income and expenditure 
and the resulting cash generated, 
supported by explanations of material 
year on year movements, over the 
term of the Three Year Plan. There 
are regular briefings to the Board and 
senior management, which include 
the progress of new strategies being 
implemented and how these are 
incorporated into the plan.
The Three Year Plan assumes there 
will be no change to the continued 
availability of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities, which run to April 2021, 
that dividends continue to be 
paid in accordance with the target 
pay-out ratio, that a consistent 
reserving policy is applied, and that 
Advantage Insurance Company 
Limited (AICL) remains well capitalised 
by maintaining a margin above its 
Solvency Capital Requirement. 
The Three Year Plan was then robustly 
tested by applying nine challenging 
scenarios designed to threaten the 
viability of the Group. The stresses 
applied reflect the crystallisation of 
the principal risks identified, including; 
 • pricing and reserve risks that arise 
from insurance activities;
 • operational risk, including risk of 
cyber attack; 
 • commercial performance risk;
 • liquidity, solvency and capital risk; 
and 
 • a combination of these risks 
crystalising concurrently.
These were assessed independently 
at the Retail and Underwriting 
businesses before determining the 
impact at the consolidated Group 
level. The minimum requirements for 
the Group to be considered viable 
were to maintain throughout each 
modelled period, positive free cash, 
continued compliance with the Facility 
Agreement’s two financial covenants 
and a surplus over the Solvency II 
minimum capital requirements in AICL.
In certain of the most severe 
scenarios, achievable, short term 
mitigating actions within the control 
of the Company and its subsidiaries 
were required. After the application of 
these, the Group maintained positive 
free cash as well as headroom over 
the financial covenants and Solvency II 
capital requirements throughout each 
of the modelled scenarios. On this 
basis, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, 
for the next three years.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc
Managing our risks  | 43 Governance strategy and control 
The Group’s governance structure, 
combined with embedded controls, 
processes and appetite statements, 
enables the executive and senior 
management to conduct the affairs of 
the regulated subsidiaries in line with 
Board expectations. This ensures that 
the regulated subsidiaries adhere to 
approved strategies and regulatory 
requirements, continually monitor 
outcomes, and proactively identify risk 
and opportunities as well as initiating 
mitigation as required. Comprehensive 
and timely reporting to the Board and 
its Committees is undertaken on a 
regular basis. 
Strategy is implemented by suitably 
experienced and competent people in 
the regulated subsidiaries, incentivised 
appropriately and guided by strong 
corporate culture and values across 
the Group. The ability to identify and 
respond quickly to evolving or emerging 
risks and issues is supported by a 
dynamic environment that encourages 
independent and objective challenge, 
focused on escalation and resolution. 
Timely management information 
is generated to enable appropriate 
monitoring, reporting, oversight and 
decision making based on sound 
proposals and judgement. 
The controls in place need to support 
the operations of the Company in the 
management and mitigation of risk and 
are suitable and effective. These must 
remain appropriate and proportionate 
to the size, nature and complexity of the 
Company and are therefore regularly 
reviewed by the executive management, 
the Group Board and its trading entities.
The Group has established various 
functions within the business to 
ensure effective oversight and 
compliance, in accordance with the 
three lines of defence model that is 
implemented across the Group and 
its trading entities.
Risk management framework
A risk management framework is 
used at Group level and within the 
regulated subsidiaries to ensure 
there is a consistent approach to risk 
management across the Group. Risk 
can be categorised in different ways, 
for example, Strategic, Business and 
Emerging, but however categorised all 
functions within the company have their 
responsibilities in managing risks.
Broadly, Strategic Risk is reviewed and 
challenged by the Board Risk Committee 
and those of the Group’s regulated 
subsidiaries. These Committees receive 
timely, up to date reports on the 
material movement of risk, from the 
oversight functions, whether influenced 
by external or internal monitoring and 
audits or events, or by any material 
shift in Business Risk that is linked to 
the successful delivery of the Three 
Year Plan.
Business Risk is overseen by Risk 
Committees at an operational level that 
comprise of Executive Directors and 
senior management. Departmental 
risk profiles (risks, controls, key risk 
indicators and internal or external 
events) are held centrally and regularly 
provided to the risk management 
function for independent review 
and challenge.
Emerging Risks, by their very nature 
could be Strategic or at a Business 
level, and when identified are 
recorded, assessed and mitigated 
within the requirements of the Risk 
Management Framework.
A uniform approach of the Risk 
Management Frameworks assists 
in the direct link between risks in 
the trading entities and the Group. 
The standardised risk management 
methodology used is Identification, 
Measurement Management, Monitoring 
and reporting. This process results in 
a cohesive and integrated approach, 
leverages the Risk Committees at 
subsidiary level and provides effective 
and consistent assessment of the 
Group’s risks.
Internal control framework
The Group has an internal control 
framework based on a three lines of 
defence approach. The three lines are 
comprised of:
First Line: Business Operations:
 • has ownership, responsibility and 
accountability for day to day risk 
identification, assessment and 
management activity;
 • directly owns and operates risk 
mitigating policies and controls and 
remedial actions;
 • ensures compliance with all regulatory 
obligations and internal policies; and 
 • provides management assurance 
by monitoring and reporting risk, 
control and compliance matters for 
governance oversight.
How we protect our business  
continued
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
44 | Managing our risks Second Line: Oversight Functions:
 • establishes boundaries by proposing 
Group policies and frameworks for 
Board approval, and standards to  
align Group wide practices to  
defined strategy;
 • facilitates guidance and direction on 
effective risk, control and compliance 
management practices to satisfy 
Group policies and standards as well 
as regulatory requirements; and
 • applies Group wide best practice 
providing oversight, challenge, 
monitoring and assurance reporting 
directly to Board Committees.
Third Line: Independent Assurance:
 • offers independent challenge and 
assurance by auditors, both internal 
and external, and external actuaries;
 • provides independent challenge, 
objective assurance and consulting 
activities designed to add value and 
improve the Group’s operations; and 
 • bring a systematic, disciplined 
approach to evaluate and improve 
the effectiveness of risk management 
control and governance processes.
All three lines of defence have specific 
tasks within the internal control 
framework and report via the Audit 
or Risk Committee and ultimately the 
Board. The role of these Committees 
is to monitor and provide opinions and 
recommendations on the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal controls and 
management of risk.
During the year there have been a 
number of enhancements to the way 
the Group manages its risks. The most 
material has been in the strengthening 
and reorganisation of the Second Line 
function. The recruitment of additional 
technical expertise, is positioning the 
function to be able to provide the 
necessary oversight and challenge 
across the entire planning cycle.
Risk identification & assessment
Monitoring and quality control 
procedures are embedded in front 
line operations with clearly prescribed 
breach reporting and escalation 
processes in place. Second line 
oversight is provided by independent 
and appropriately resourced Risk, 
and Compliance functions. Third line 
oversight is conducted by an internal 
audit function, managed and resourced 
via a third party relationship with Grant 
Thornton UK LLP. The effectiveness 
of the Group’s control functions is 
overseen by the respective Board of 
Directors and Committees of the Group. 
This is supplemented by external audit, 
provided by KPMG LLP.

Risk management framework
There is a documented Risk 
Management Framework in use 
throughout the Group and its trading 
entities, detailing the approach to 
risk management, providing support, 
advice and communicating the risk 
management strategy. This framework 
is approved by the Board upon 
recommendation of the respective Risk 
Committees. It provides a disciplined 
and structured process to reduce the 
potential for internal or external events 
that may detrimentally affect the Group 
through proactive risk identification, 
measurement, management, monitoring 
and reporting. Through a set of 
continuous and developing processes 
applied throughout the Group, the 
functions making up the three lines of 
defence ensure all known and emerging 
risks are managed and mitigated in line 
with the appropriate risk appetites.
The Risk Management Framework 
includes documented risk and control 
frameworks for the regulated entities, as 
well as risk registers that contain details 
of risks, controls, key risk indicators, 
actions related to risk mitigation and 
ownership of each risk. The frameworks 
are continuously developed to include 
Strategic, Business and Emerging risks. 
Stress and reverse stress testing 
and scenario analysis are regularly 
undertaken and reviewed by the 
respective Committees, including the 
testing that has been carried out to 
support the Viability Statement on 
page 43. Financial performance, financial 
position and cash flows have been 
stress tested using the principal financial 
and operational risks listed on page 48, 
including reductions in premium and 
other income, retention rates and new 
business volumes, deterioration in loss 
ratio and possible failure of a reinsurer. 
Focus has been applied to ensure 
compliance with Solvency II and other 
external requirements.
Internal audit
The remit of the internal audit function 
is covered in the Audit Committee 
report on page 71.
Compliance
The Compliance functions within the 
trading entities provide regulatory risk 
oversight, and monitor compliance 
with the various regulatory and legal 
obligations of the Group, specifically 
those of the FCA in the UK and the 
GFSC in Gibraltar. This monitoring 
together with regular interaction with 
the business functions, helps to provide 
input into such areas as training, 
marketing and the way the regulated 
firms deal with customers, as part of the 
continuous improvement approach to 
regulatory obligations.
The Group continues to ensure its 
Compliance oversight function remains 
effective in monitoring and reporting 
as to whether regulatory adherence 
and customer conduct obligations are 
being met, by reviewing appropriate 
management information such a 
breach and complaint statistics. The 
Compliance function provides advisory 
guidance to the business including 
training and updates on regulatory 
developments, as well as providing 
second line monitoring of operations. 
Fraud
The Group has a market leading 
counter-fraud capability, which to 
date has generated significant cost 
savings and which supports demand 
for participation by its insurer panel 
and reinsurance partners. The Group’s 
counter-fraud operations team, 
Insight, operates as an integrated, 
comprehensive risk selection and loss 
validation division. Insight includes 
a dedicated team that includes new 
business review agents, analysts, 
intelligence operatives, claims handlers, 
former police officers and field based 
investigators. The Retail business was 
a founding member of the Insurance 
Fraud Bureau’s Application Fraud 
Steering Committee and has a very 
strong relationship with the Insurance 
Fraud Enforcement Department. 
A number of sophisticated identification 
and validation methodologies and 
databases are employed to help prevent 
potentially fraudulent activity at various 
points in the application, sale and  
claims process:
 • at the point of quotation, risk scoring 
and referencing tools including data 
enrichment are used to identify 
and reduce exposure to potentially 
fraudulent applications;
 • at the point of sale, risk scoring is 
again undertaken to identify any 
quotation irregularities which are 
potentially ‘quote manipulation’ 
frauds;
 • during the claims process, relational 
databases, external referencing and 
investigations are used to identify 
potentially fraudulent claims; 
 • the strength of the Insight team has 
been recognised in the industry and it 
has been the recipient of a number of 
industry awards.
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
46 | Managing our risks Policies and procedures
To ensure stakeholders are treated 
fairly and compliance with legislation, 
regulation and best practice is 
maintained, guidance and direction 
is provided to all colleagues through 
policies and procedures, supported by 
the Risk and Control Frameworks and 
supporting processes.
Policies that are critical to the Group’s 
overall control and governance 
structures are reserved for formal 
Board review and approval. These 
policies typically cover legal and 
regulatory requirements or culture and 
values. They also help to communicate 
and embed Board approved risk 
appetite. To ensure that a consistent 
approach to governance is maintained 
throughout the Group, a number of 
policies are approved by the Group’s 
Board and are adopted in full by the 
trading subsidiaries. Board approved 
policies are reviewed and approved at 
least once a year.
The three lines of defence model 
ensures that the standards and 
appetites, as defined by these policies, 
function as intended and provide 
expected outcomes. Under the three 
lines of defence model, independent 
assurance testing and evidence 
gathering on aspects of how the 
business is managed is undertaken by 
the Group internal auditor who reports 
to the Board via the Audit Committee.
Day to day responsibility for 
implementing policies and procedures 
is the remit of senior management, with 
the support of the oversight functions, 
who ensure operational decisions  
take into account risk, against risk 
appetite, and how this can be  
controlled effectively.
To be better placed to demonstrate and 
evidence compliance with the Solvency 
II regime, the systems of governance, 
internal controls and risk and compliance 
policies in the Underwriting subsidiary 
have been further enhanced during 
the year.
Risk assessment
The Board undertakes a regular 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, following reports 
from the oversight functions, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
The Group considers its current key 
risk categories, any of which could 
potentially give rise to significant 
reputational risk, to be as follows:
1.  commercial performance risk: 
(includes reinsurance risk, market 
risk, pricing risk and reserving 
risk): The risk of loss resulting from 
failure to meet the Group’s strategic 
objectives and deliver the Three 
Year Plan.
2.  financial risk: The risk of loss resulting 
from an inability to meet financial 
commitments as they fall due or from 
an immediate need to strengthen the 
capital position.
3.  operational risk: The risk of loss 
resulting from inadequate or failed 
policies or controls, people, systems  
and external events.
Brexit risk
The view of the implications of Brexit 
remains unchanged since the last 
annual report having been assessed 
as having a low impact on the Group. 
The UK leaving the EU is not likely to 
impact the need for UK motorists and 
households to obtain insurance and is 
therefore unlikely to significantly affect 
demand for the Group’s products. 
Volatility in the financial markets,  
which may be more likely considering 
the progress made to date in negotiating 
the Brexit terms, could impact on the 
fair value of the Group’s investments, 
but is mitigated by the conservative 
investment portfolios demonstrated 
by the portfolio’s resilience post 
referendum and through this first  
year of negotiations.
No immediate or short term regulatory 
change is anticipated in Gibraltar or the 
UK as a result of the UK leaving the EU 
and the Board therefore believes that 
the UK leaving the EU is not expected 
to significantly impact on the Group’s 
operations or results.

continued
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
48 | Managing our risks External factors affecting the Group’s risk profile 
Factor Impact Mitigation and movement in the year
Economic stress 
Failure to deliver the  
Group’s strategy due to 
unforeseen economic 
changes.
Adverse economic conditions could 
increase the risk to the strategic plans  
and/or reduce the Group’s income  
from investments.
Whilst the car insurance industry has 
been relatively unaffected by economic 
downturns, as the Group diversifies 
into home products, more of its product 
could be subject to the negative effects 
of a sustained economic downturn.
The Group and trading entity Boards regularly review the 
investment portfolios managed in the respective trading 
entities against the economic outlook and the Group’s 
risk appetite.
The strategy is to continue to grow the home product whilst 
keeping a watchful eye on the economy and the longer term 
impacts for the Group’s product strategy.
The economic horizon has been monitored and assessed 
against the strategic plan.
Regulatory  
changes
Changes to the regulatory  
environment which inhibit 
income generation in the 
general insurance industry 
or capital requirements.
A shift in the regulatory landscape 
could introduce constraints therefore 
increasing the risk to income 
from general insurance and/or an 
increase in capital requirements. 
Equally, however, changes to the 
regulatory landscape could present 
opportunities for increased income 
and reduced capital.
The Group strategy is based on 
the current regulatory horizon. 
Any negative shift in the rules and 
regulations that apply to general 
insurance could increase the risk 
to commercial plans of the Group.
The Group has an effective regulatory horizon scanning 
capability to review the potential implications for the  
Group and more importantly its regulated subsidiaries.  
In addition the trading entities continue to foster good 
working relationships with their respective regulators, and 
other local authorities, and take the opportunity to embrace 
change early and, where appropriate, adjust the strategic 
plans to accommodate that change. Retail is often engaged in 
consultations with the FCA, providing its views on regulatory 
reform which gives the Group early insight and opportunity 
to contribute towards the shape of future regulation. 
Underwriting has worked closely with the Gibraltar FSC since 
the implementation of Solvency II.
The Group continues to develop its governance, risk and control 
in Underwriting as it further embeds Solvency II. Within Retail 
and Underwriting, Risk and Compliance teams have been 
further enhanced with additional resource and capability to 
strengthen the second line of defence.
Climate change
Potential for increased 
frequency and severity 
of claims due to climate 
change that reduces the 
commercial performance 
of the Group.
The Group’s ability to meet its 
strategic plan, a key risk, could be 
damaged in the event of increased 
claims frequency and or severity.
Underwriting adopts a prudent approach to the risk accepted 
and the pricing strategies used continue to reduce this risk. In 
addition the industry wide implications of increased claims as 
a result of climate change would probably result in premium 
inflation across the market.
The exposure to this risk has increased over the year as 
the Group’s Home portfolio continues to grow however, 
maintaining the conservative underwriting approach continues 
to ensure that the Group protects its revenue generation whilst 
minimising the cost implications for claims.
Vehicle Technology 
and Innovation
Advances in vehicle 
technology, such as electric 
and autonomous vehicles, 
which may fundamentally 
change the nature of motor 
insurance.
Accelerated advances or developments 
for which the Group is not prepared 
could place the Group at a competitive 
disadvantage.
The Group constantly monitors developments to ensure that it 
remains informed, embraces innovation and change, and is well 
positioned to adapt its business model as appropriate.
Adverse market 
conditions
Increased competition 
in the insurance market 
and changes in consumer 
behaviour impact profitability.
Increased risk that the Group’s market  
share is impaired resulting in 
commercial underperformance.
The Group constantly monitors the markets in which it competes 
for pricing and other changes that could impact its commercial 
objectives. This monitoring and the ability to rapidly adjust pricing 
strategies ensure the Group remains competitive by managing 
both income generation and policy volumes with agility.

Internal risks
Factor Impact Mitigation and movement in the year
Commercial failure 
Commercial performance 
does not meet Group 
expectations or the 
Three Year Plan.
The Group either incurs additional 
expenses or is unable to generate 
sufficient income.
The Group, through its governance, Risk and Compliance 
functions, coupled with targeted Internal Audit in the respective 
trading entities, assesses the effectiveness of critical processes 
and procedures on a regular basis. These are assessed alongside 
the risk appetite at both Group and trading entity level through 
the management reporting that is provided at Risk Committees 
and Boards. This provides assurance to the Board that risks 
to commercial performance and the successful delivery of the 
Three Year Plan are adequately and effectively mitigated.
Underwriting and pricing agility enables the Group to react 
to external influences, ensuring that it is able to optimise 
commercial performance.
Embedding and realising efficiencies and benefits from new 
technology introduced processes for claims handling and policy 
administration. This will also continue to enhance and simplify 
the customer experience and drive more positive outcomes.
Cyber exposure
The Group maintains  
a digital centric business 
model that is increasingly 
exposed to business 
disruption and data loss.
A major cyber event could lead to the 
Group not being able to access external 
data critical to the operation of a modern 
insurance company and/or sales due 
to a lack of trust in the Group’s ability 
to protect customer data.
The Group continues to invest in resources and technology, 
in both the first and second lines, to ensure that it continues 
to protect itself from the various and changing cyber threats.  
The residual risk is within the Group’s appetite and is to the  
level expected of a Group such as Hastings.
Third party failure
The Group relies on  
a large number of  
external suppliers.
A supplier, delivering a key service, 
fails leading to the Group not being 
able to continue to operate and 
deliver its strategic objectives.
The Group has policies and procedures in place to manage and 
monitor the procurement process and contract management 
in the trading entities which are categorised according to their 
risk profile. The Group monitors the key risks in each trading 
entity and the processes in place to ensure that the risk is 
within appetite.
The Group has a clear view of the risks associated with suppliers, 
through the interaction that the respective trading entity Boards 
have with executive and senior leaders. Efforts continue to 
introduce additional controls and monitoring as well as develop 
the internal capabilities to drive good commercial value from 
supplier arrangements and minimise risk.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc
Strategic report  | 51 During the year, shareholders Hastings A, L.P., Hastings B, 
L.P., Goldman Sachs & Co. and the Founder Shareholders 
(collectively Significant Shareholders) had significant direct 
and indirect investment in the Company via Hastings Investco 
Limited. Pursuant to a Relationship Agreement (RA1) entered 
into by the Company, Hastings A, L.P., Hastings B, L.P. and 
Goldman Sachs & Co. (GS Shareholders) and the Founder 
Shareholders (collectively) are each able to appoint two of the 
Directors to the Board while they (or persons connected to 
them) continue to hold a direct or indirect interest in 20% or 
more of the Company’s shares and one Director while they 
(or persons connected to them) continue to hold a direct 
or indirect interest in at least 5% but less than 20% of the 
Company’s shares.
On 1 March 2017 Hastings Investco Limited, along with 
certain individual shareholders, reached an agreement 
to sell a proportion of its shareholding in the Company to 
Rand Merchant Investment Holdings Limited and its wholly 
owned subsidiary Main Street 1353 Proprietary Limited (RMI), 
whereby RMI acquired a holding of 29.9% in the Company. 
As a consequence of that transaction, and under the terms 
of RA1 with the Company, the GS Shareholders’ and Founder 
Shareholders’ respective entitlement to nominate directors 
for appointment to the Board reduced from two Directors 
each to one Director each. On 14 March 2017, Michele 
Titi-Cappelli resigned as a Director representing the GS 
Shareholders and Edward Fitzmaurice resigned as a Director 
representing the Founder Shareholders. As at the end of the 
year, the appointees are Sumit Rajpal for the GS Shareholders 
and Selina Sagayam for the Founder Shareholders.
The Company confirms that Hastings Investco Limited was 
a controlling shareholder as defined by Listing Rule 6.1.2AR 
during the year being a shareholder who exercised or 
controlled at least 30% of the voting rights in the Company. 
On 1 March 2017, Hastings Investco Limited ceased to be a 
controlling shareholder of the Company. The Company was 
notified in June 2017 that Hastings Investco Limited was to 
be dissolved and that the indirect interest in the Company’s 
shares held by GS Shareholders and certain Founder 
Shareholders were converted into direct holdings  
in the Company.
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4(14)(c) the Company 
confirms that it complied with the independence provisions 
included in RA1; that as far as the Company is aware 
independence provisions included in RA1 were complied 
with during the period under review by Hastings Investco 
Limited and the Significant Shareholders; and that the 
procurement obligations included in RA1 were complied 
with during the period under review by Hastings Investco 
Limited and the Significant Shareholders. Although Hastings 
Investco Limited ceased to be a controlling shareholder of the 
Company during the year, RA1 remains in force and all relevant 
provisions continue.
A relationship agreement (RA2) was entered into between 
the Company and RMI so that, for so long as RMI holds a 
direct or indirect interest of between 15% and 29.9% in the 
issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company, RMI is able 
to nominate a Director for appointment to the Board of the 
Company. Herman Bosman, Chief Executive Officer of RMI 
was appointed as a Director of the Company on 14 March 
2017. RA2 contains the same independence provisions as RA1, 
however the Company confirms that, as at 31 December 2017, 
RMI was not a controlling shareholder as defined by Listing 
Rule 9.2.2A.
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. In accordance with principle B.7.1 of the Code, all 
Directors will be subject to annual election by shareholders.
Resolutions to provide authorities to Directors to allot shares, 
to disapply certain pre-emption rights and to make market 
purchases of the Company’s own shares, all subject to 
appropriate limits, will be put to the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). Shareholder resolutions put to the AGM held in May 
2017 providing authority for the purchase by the Company of 
its own shares remained valid as at 31 December 2017. 
The Company confirms that during the financial year ended 
31 December 2017, no shares in the Company were purchased 
by the Company or acquired by it by forfeiture or surrender 
in lieu of forfeiture; or were acquired by a Company nominee, 
or by another with the Company’s financial assistance, the 
Company having a beneficial interest in accordance with 
section 671 of part 18 of the Companies Act 2006; or were 
made subject to a lien or other charge taken by the Company. 
The Company has not held any Ordinary Shares in treasury in 
the period under review.
Under the Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Trustees of 
an employee benefit trust (EBT) hold shares on behalf of SIP 
participants for a three year service period. The Trustees 
will vote on, and receive dividends, in accordance with a 
participants wishes. The Group satisfies matching share 
awards in the SIP as described in Note 29 to the Financial 
Statements through the acquisition by the EBT of the 
Company’s Ordinary shares in the market. During the three 
year service period these matching shares are held by the EBT. 
The EBT is consolidated within the Company’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
52 | Strategic report Change of control – significant contracts
There are several commercial agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company; 
none is considered to be significant in terms of its potential 
impact on the business of the Group as a whole. The Company 
does not have agreements with any Director or colleague that 
would provide compensation for loss of office or employment 
resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and plans may cause options and 
awards granted to colleagues under such schemes and plans 
to vest on a takeover.

Scope 1 – Direct emissions resulting from natural gas & gasoil 
consumption and refrigerant gas release. 
Scope 2 – Energy indirect emissions from purchased grid electricity.
All emission sources have reported on as required under the 
Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended. The reporting 
boundary used for collation of the above data is consistent 
with that used for consolidation purposes in the Financial 
Statements. The Group has followed the methodology  
laid out in DEFRA’s Environmental Reporting Guidelines  
and calculated the carbon emissions using the  
relevant carbon conversion factors as issued by DEFRA:  
www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/. Emissions 
have been reported in tonnes of CO 2e (carbon dioxide 
equivalent) which include CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O.
Emissions for 2017 were 15% below the tonnage seen in 2016 
and are 23% below the emissions from the base year (2013) 
total of 1,479 tonnes. Over 79% of Group emissions were 
produced from grid electricity consumption. Greenhouse 
gas emissions primarily arise from the Group’s electricity, 
gas, gasoil and refrigerant gas consumption through the 
operation of its offices. Only offices which are solely occupied 
by the Group have been included in the reporting scope and 
therefore exclude the leased offices in London, Leicester 
and Newmarket (Hyperion House), for which energy data is 
not available or accurate. Full-time colleagues based in the 
excluded offices are not counted towards the CO 2e per full 
time colleague (FTE) figure quoted above.
The reduction in reported carbon emissions was primarily a 
result of less grid electricity consumption, owing to the closure 
of Franklin House, Newmarket, coupled with the discontinued 
use of a generator in Bexhill and that carbon emissions 
resulting from grid electricity consumption in the UK were 
lower than in 2017 due to de-carbonisation, reflected in the 
emissions factors published annually by DEFRA: (0.35156 kg 
CO 2e/kWh in 2017 compared to 0.41205 kg CO 2e/kWh in 
2016). As part of the refurbishment of the Group’s office in 
Bexhill, the generator was replaced and is now only used 
for standby generation in the event of power loss from the 
national grid. Despite the total number of colleagues working 
for the Group having now exceeded 3,100, the number of FTE 
noted above has reduced compared to the prior year primarily 
due to the growth of the leased office in Leicester where 
accurate data is not available and the increase in the number 
of colleagues who now work from home. 
The Company does not own any vehicles and business travel 
through private vehicles is limited and the necessary data 
is not available. Transport emissions have therefore been 
excluded from the reporting scope.
The reporting period is in line with the Company’s financial 
year, which is the same as the calendar year.

There were no political contributions during the year

by reference.
Auditor
KPMG LLP were initially appointed as the Company’s Auditor 
in December 2015 for the financial year ended 31 December 
2015 and their re-appointment was approved by shareholders 
at the AGM in 2017 for the current financial year. KPMG have 
confirmed that they are willing to be reappointed as auditor 
for the financial year ending 31 December 2018. In accordance 
with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution 
proposing the appointment of a statutory Auditor will be 
proposed at the AGM.
The Audit Committee report on page 71 provides details on 
the length of tenure and re-appointment of the Auditor and 
when the tender was last conducted. 
Directors’ statement of responsibility for 
disclosure of information to auditor
As required by section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director serving at the date of approval of the Financial 
Statements confirms that:
 • to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of their reports of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 • he or she have taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
Words and phrases used in this confirmation should be 
interpreted in accordance with section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Our colleagues
We consider our most important asset to be our colleagues 
who are the cornerstone of our business. The ability to deliver 
straightforward insurance comes from a high performing, 
dedicated and customer focused team. We invest in our 
colleagues and provide them with an environment in which 
they feel included, valued, empowered and able to reach their 
full potential. Every colleague is expected to contribute to the 
success of the business. Accordingly, we recognise the hard 
work and dedication of our team by linking remuneration to 
personal performance in a way which does not compromise 
the impact on customer outcomes – we do not remunerate 
colleagues through sales incentives. We actively encourage 
personal development by offering a range of training options to 
build the capabilities of our teams for the future and encourage 
the behaviours needed to deliver our business strategy.
We foster a culture of freedom to contribute and make 
things happen, aiming to be a progressive insurance industry 
innovator. We promote communication and collaboration to 
harness the talent of our colleagues and reward and recognise 
both individual and team success.
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities and 
ensuring that colleagues are able to work without discrimination. 
Full and fair consideration is given to employment applications 
from all candidates with a disability. If a colleague were to 
become disabled whilst in employment, the Group would make 
every effort to enable the colleague to continue in employment 
and would make arrangements for additional equipment, 
support and training as appropriate.
The Group is also committed to providing a professional and 
safe working environment for all our colleagues, which is 
achieved through the application of our policies throughout 
the organisation.
Our colleagues have a broad range of backgrounds and 
the Group has not adopted a quota system, preferring to 
appoint the best candidate for any position. Our approach 
to recruitment is to elicit candidates from as many different 
backgrounds as possible.
As at 31 December 2017, the Company’s Board had 12 
Directors of whom nine were male and three female. Of 
the Group’s 3,188 colleagues, 1,586 were male and 1,602 
were female.

The Group has a responsibility to conduct its business in an 
ethical and transparent way. Accordingly, we adhere to a set 
of business principles which include a commitment to human 
rights principles. The Group has policies in place to support 
these principles which include non-discrimination, health 
and safety, anti-bribery, human slavery and trafficking and 
environmental issues. We maintain a zero tolerance approach 
to bribery, corruption and slavery.
Mandatory training is required for all colleagues to ensure 
that all of our colleagues are aware of Company policies, the 
Company’s values and legislative requirements and cover 
subjects ranging from data protection to whistleblowing to 
diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Training outcomes 
are monitored and remedial training is provided as 
appropriate.
Suppliers of key services to the Group are subject to a 
robust due diligence process under a Supplier Relationship 
Management Framework in order to enhance relationship and 
risk management. Critical suppliers are subject to ongoing 
reviews throughout the year at which service levels and 
adherence to processes and procedures are discussed and 
improvements made as appropriate.
Further information on colleague engagement can be found in 
the Corporate Responsibility statement on pages 36-42.
Contractual arrangements
The Group considers its co-insurance and reinsurance 
contracts as well as contracts with PCW to be essential to 
the running of the Group’s business. No other contractual 
arrangements are considered to be essential.
Financial instruments
The objectives and policies for managing risks in relation to 
financial instruments held by the Group are set out in note 25 
to the Financial Statements.
Going concern
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate financial 
resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future 
and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Financial Statements. In considering the 
appropriateness of this assumption, the Board has reviewed 
the Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, 
including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 • make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant and reliable;
 • state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS; 
 • assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and
 • use the going concern basis of accounting unless they  
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect 
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 • the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 • the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a 
fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and the Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.

Annual Report on Remuneration 87
Independent Auditor’s Report 100 Q
What were the key areas of focus for the 
Board in 2017?
A
Following on from a strong and successful first full year as a 
listed entity, the Board focused on continuing that momentum 
in 2017. It reviewed the Group’s strategy and approved a 
Three Year Plan to ensure that growth is sustainable; risks 
are considered and mitigated as much as possible and key 
strategic priorities are communicated. The Group’s vision 
continues to be to offer straightforward insurance products 
at competitive prices. By maintaining an agile, disciplined, 
focused, data driven and cost effective business model 
the Board is confident that the Group will continue to 
grow profitably and for the benefit of all stakeholders. As 
discussed in my opening statement to this Annual Report, 
Board succession planning was also of key importance with 
the appointment of Gary Hoffman as my successor as Board 
Chairman and Toby van der Meer as Chief Executive Officer.
Q
How does the Board take into account the views 
and interests of all stakeholders as well as fulfilling 
its duties when taking decisions to promote the 
long term success of the Company?
A
All of the Group’s actions are based on our 4Cs approach. 
We focus on getting things right for our colleagues, customers, 
company and community. This way of working enables 
everyone, from the colleagues in the call centres right up 
to the Board, to ensure that the interests and views of 
each of these stakeholders are at the heart of what we do 
and how we do it. The long term interests of the Company 
are underpinned by how we as a Board get it right for our 
colleagues by creating the right environment and giving them 
the right tools to do their job. Therefore they will do more 
for our customers, and the Company, enabling us to grow 
profitably and sustainably, and allowing us to invest in the 
communities we serve.

58 | Corporate governance Q
What were the main outcomes from the 
Board evaluation undertaken in 2017?
A
This year, like the last, an evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees was undertaken using an externally facilitated 
platform that was overseen by the Company Secretary who 
assessed and reported the results to the Board in November 
this year. The main areas requiring further enhancements 
related to more formality around training and development 
of Directors, the composition of the Board, compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code and shareholder 
engagement by Non-Executive Directors. Action plans for 
various improvements have been agreed by the Board and 
each of its Committees. As Chairman of the Board, Gary and 
I will oversee the progress on those plans for the Board and 
the chairs of the other committees will do likewise.
Q
How has the Board considered its composition and 
that of the Committees as well as addressing issues 
of diversity?
A
The Company’s policy is that candidates will be considered 
based on the independence, skills, knowledge and experience 
that they possess as well as the skill sets and experience of 
the whole Board. The Board is committed to ensuring that it 
represents the diversity of its workforce and candidates from 
a wide range of disciplines and experience are considered. 
As part of succession planning for the role of Chief Executive 
Officer, candidates from a wide range of backgrounds were 
considered. The Board composition currently includes 25% 
female and 17% from non-white backgrounds; the diversity 
of the Board as a whole will continue to be reviewed.
Q
Last year the Company was not fully compliant with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in terms of the 
composition of the Remuneration Committee.  
How has this been addressed over the year?
A
The Company stated its intention to be compliant in terms of 
the composition of the Remuneration Committee last year 
as its membership included two Non-Independent Directors 
representing Founder and Goldman Sachs shareholders. 
During this year the Nomination Committee and the Board 
discussed the Committee’s composition on a number 
of occasions and I am pleased to say that the Founder 
Shareholders and Goldman Sachs Shareholders have agreed 
that their nominated representative would step down from this 
Committee. As a consequence the Company now complies with 
the Code in relation to the composition of this Committee.
Q
Although the Company was fully compliant with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code at the end of 
the financial year, the appointment of the Chief 
Executive Officer as your successor is not in line 
with the principles of the Code. Why has the Board 
chosen to appoint Gary as Board Chairman?
A
The Board takes Code compliance very seriously and the 
decision was not made lightly without consideration and 
debate. Hastings has grown very successfully under Gary, 
both before and after the IPO, and he has been instrumental 
in establishing the Group’s strong stakeholder engagement 
culture. His promotion and leadership of that culture is 
considered to be of great value. Gary also has previous and 
current experience of Board chairmanship and as a Non-
Executive Director, making him the prime candidate as my 
successor. The Board strongly believes that continuity and 
stability is in the best interests for the Company and its 
stakeholders. Toby van der Meer, currently Managing Director 
of Hastings Direct, has also played a pivotal role in the 
growth and development of the Group’s Retail business. His 
appointment as the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, together 
with Gary’s as Chairman, means that there will be minimal 
disruption providing an orderly succession and transition 
period with Gary as Chairman.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Corporate governance statement
The role of the Board
The Board is the main decision making body of the Company. 
It provides leadership within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls enabling risk to be assessed and managed. 
It also carries ultimate responsibility for the effective direction 
and control of the Group and is accountable to shareholders 
for financial and operational performance. There is a clear 
Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, together with 
delegated authorities to Board Committees and management.
Executive and Non-Executive Directors have the same 
statutory duties but are subject to a clear division of 
responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the Chairman to 
lead and manage the Board and for Non-Executive Directors 
to monitor, review and challenge Executive Directors and 
senior management by acting in the interest of the Company’s 
stakeholders. The overall responsibility for the day to day 
management of the Group is delegated to the Chief Executive 
Officer. The Chief Executive Officer is supported in this role by 
senior executive management responsible for management 
oversight of the Group and its subsidiaries. The roles and 
responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
Senior Independent Director are clearly defined and allocated. 
These responsibilities are set out in writing and are available 
at www.hastingsplc.com/about-us/corporate-governance. 
All Directors receive an induction on joining the Board 
which is tailored to the individual needs of each Director; 
where a Director is joining a Board Committee the induction 
includes an overview of the operation of that committee. On 
completion of the induction programme the Director should 
have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature 
of the business, and the opportunities and challenges for the 
Hastings Group, to enable them to effectively contribute to 
strategic discussions and oversight of the Group. Directors 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and 
takes the minutes of all meetings. Working in collaboration 
with the Chairman, the Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring good governance and consults Directors to ensure 
that good information flows exist and that the Board receives 
the information it requires in order to be effective. Throughout 
the year the Board and Committees receive regular updates 
from the Executive Directors and senior executives of 
key developments in the business as part of their formal 
meetings. Directors are able to seek independent and 
professional advice at Company expense to enable Directors 
to fulfil their obligations as a member of the Board.
As part of the Board effectiveness evaluation conducted 
in October 2017, the Board as a whole was subject to an 
appraisal by all Directors. The evaluation considered the 
effectiveness of processes and procedures established by 
the Board to fulfil its duties, the Board’s composition, skills 
and experience and the performance of the Board Chairman. 
A number of actions for the coming year in relation to the 
aforementioned areas have been agreed.
The respective Boards of Directors of the Group’s regulated 
entities are responsible to the UK’s Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) and the Gibraltar Financial Services 
Commission (GFSC) for ensuring compliance with each 
entity’s regulatory obligations and that dealings with the FCA 
and GFSC are handled in a constructive, co-operative and 
transparent manner.
Board and Committee structure 
The Board delegates certain matters to various Committees, 
each with their own Board approved Terms of Reference 
which are reviewed annually. The Board has four Committees, 
Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk; all of their Terms 
of Reference were reviewed by the relevant Committee and 
approved by the Board. Reports from these Committees 
describing their principal activities during the year are set 
out in their respective reports on pages 71 to 84. Board and 
Committee meetings are structured to allow sufficient time 
for consideration of all items and each Chairman encourages 
constructive debate and challenge. Committees are authorised 
to obtain outside legal or other independent professional 
advice if required. The Chairman of each Committee reports 
to the Board on matters considered by each Committee at the 
subsequent Board meeting as appropriate. All Directors have 
access to the minutes of each Committee.
The membership of Committees is a matter for the full 
Board upon recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
Each of the Board Committees comprises solely Non-Executive 
Directors. Each Committee is chaired by an Independent Non-
Executive Director; the Nomination Committee is currently 
chaired by the Chairman of the Board. The current membership 
of each Board Committee can be found on pages 62 and 63. 
Executive Directors, members of management and professional 
advisers also attend meetings of the Committees when 
required to do so by the chair of the relevant Committee.
The Terms of Reference for the Committees can be 
found at www.hastingsplc.com/company-information/

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Code Principles Reference
A. Leadership • Every company should be headed by an effective board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the company
 • There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
company between the running of the board and the executive responsibility 
for the running of the company’s business. No one individual should have 
unfettered powers of decision
 • The chairman is responsible for leadership of the board and ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role
 • As part of their role as members of a unitary board, non-executive directors 
should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy
Discover more
60 – 67 
71 – 84
B. Effectiveness • The board and its committees should have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the company to enable them 
to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively
 • There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the board
 • All directors should be able to allocate sufficient time to the company to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively
 • All directors should receive an induction on joining the board and should 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge
 • The board should be supplied in a timely manner with information in a form

68 | Corporate governance Directors’ conflicts of interest
During the year no Director had any related party transactions 
or any beneficial interest in any contract significant to the 
Company’s business, other than a contract of employment or 
letter of appointment. The Company has procedures in place 
for managing conflicts of interest. At the start of each Board 
meeting each Director reviews and confirms his/her other 
directorships and advisory roles or trusteeships held. Should 
a Director become aware that they, or their connected parties, 
have an interest in an existing or proposed transaction with 
the Company, they are required to notify the Board in writing 
or at a Board meeting. The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest 
and impose any limits on a Director’s participation in Board 
decision making relating to that conflict. This process operated 
successfully for the year under review.
Whistle blowing
A whistle blowing policy is in force across the Group to enable 
colleagues to bring to the attention of any Director serious 
matters of misconduct which they believe would damage the 
performance or reputation of the Group.

The Company welcomes the interaction with shareholders 
at its AGM and the Chairman of the Board and each of its 
Committees will be available at the AGM. Shareholders are 
entitled to vote on all resolutions put to the AGM and votes 
cast will be counted, whether in person or by proxy, by means 
of a poll on every resolution in the Notice of AGM.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Relations with shareholders
Stakeholder engagement 
Investor engagement 
The Board is committed to promoting effective channels of 
communication with our shareholders and upholding good 
corporate governance as a means of building stronger and 
more engaged relationships with them. Our comprehensive 
Investor Relations engagement with the market helps us 
to understand investor views about Hastings, which are 
communicated regularly to the Board.
Institutional engagement 
In 2017, our Investor Relations engagement with institutional 
investors took place throughout the year, both following our 
half yearly results as well as outside of the reporting cycle. 
This allowed the opportunity for existing and potentially 
new investors to engage with Hastings regularly, promoting 
dialogue on longer-term strategic developments as well as 
on the recent financial performance of the Group.
The Directors, in conjunction with the senior executive team 
and Investor Relations, participated in various forms of 
engagement, including investor meetings and conferences 
across many geographic locations, reflecting the increasingly 
diverse nature of our institutional ownership.
The Senior Executive team also presented to investors, 
primarily through hosting site visits at our head office in Bexhill, 
which promotes greater awareness and understanding of our 
business and gives institutional investors an invaluable insight 
into what makes Hastings different.
During 2017, discussions with investors were focused on the 
continued execution of our strategy and growth trajectory, 
and updated market guidance on performance through to 
2019, which was provided with our 2016 full year results.
Investor meetings with the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director which focused on corporate governance also took 
place during the year, and we held an in-person presentation 
of our 2016 full year results in March 2017, and our 2017 half 
year results in August 2017. A webcast of each was made 
available to replay on our website shortly thereafter.
The Investor Relations section of our website is an important 
communication channel that enables the effective distribution 
of information to the market in a clear and consistent manner.
Our AGM
The Board and the senior executive team continue to consider 
our AGM as a key date in the diary. The AGM provides us 
with our main opportunity to engage with shareholders, 
particularly our private shareholders, on the key issues facing 
the Group and any questions they may have. The Directors, 
including the Board Chairman, were available for informal 
discussion either before or after the meeting.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc
Corporate governance
 | 71 At the beginning of the year and during the reporting 
preparations for the year ended 31 December 2016, the 
Group was impacted by the UK Government’s decision to 
amend the Ogden rate which determines the lump sum 
awards for personal injury claimants. Management monitored 
the situation and was well prepared for the eventual change 
that occurred on 27 February 2017 just prior to the Company’s 
results announcement on 2 March 2017. The Committee 
convened soon after the announcement and following a 
substantive review noted the impact to the Group was a 
pre-tax charge of £20m. This charge did not impact on the 
Committee’s or the Board’s deliberations regarding the final 
dividend for 2016. It is noted that whilst the UK Government 
has more recently published draft legislation that will create a 
statutory mechanism to adjust the Ogden rate, there is no set 
date as to when this may become law.
The Committee welcomed the letter dated 10 October 2017 
from the FRC addressed to all Audit Committee Chairmen and 
Finance Directors. This letter provided guidance on the FRC’s 
perspective on aspects of annual reports and how companies 
should aim to improve them and to highlight changes to 
UK reporting requirements. In light of this guidance the 
Committee reviewed the requirements and agreed with 
management proposals on how to adopt these additional best 
practice requirements for both financial and non-financial 
reporting contained in this year’s Annual Report.
As required by its Terms of Reference, the Committee has 
primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and 
performance of, the External Auditor as well as ensuring that 
the audit services contract is put out to tender at least every 
ten years. The Committee noted that the incumbent External 
Auditor, KPMG, has been the Auditor of the Company since its 
formation in 2015 and the lead audit partner, Salim Tharani, was 
appointed for the year ended 31 December 2016. Following a 
review during the year, it was agreed that the reappointment 
of KPMG be proposed at the forthcoming AGM in May 2018. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the appointment of 
KPMG as External Auditor and will review KPMG’s performance 
and external audit requirements annually.
The internal audit function is managed and resourced via 
a third-party relationship with Grant Thornton and brings 
a systematic, disciplined approach to the evaluation and 
improvement of the effectiveness of risk management control 
and governance processes. The independence of the internal 
audit function helps to ensure that accurate reports are 
provided to the Board, Audit and Risk Committees without 
undue management influence on the audit and its processes. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit 
Charter during the year which defines and explains the 
purpose, objectives and responsibility of the internal audit 
function for the Group. The internal audit function service 
provider was chosen through a tender process undertaken in 
2014 that involved reputable audit firms. The independence of 
Grant Thornton is regularly reviewed and there are no current 
proposals to tender these services for the coming year.
As part of the Board effectiveness evaluation conducted 
in October 2017, the Audit Committee was itself subject to 
an appraisal by its members. The evaluation considered 
the effectiveness of processes and procedures established 
by the Committee to fulfil its duties, and the effectiveness 
of the systems of internal control, financial and regulatory 
risk management systems and those for monitoring the 
effectiveness and objectivity of the internal and External 
Auditors. The performance of Committee members and the 
Committee Chairman were also reviewed. The Committee has 
agreed a number of actions for the coming year in relation to 
the aforementioned areas.
As part of ongoing awareness, competency and training, the 
Committee received updates from management as well as the 
External Auditor during the year in relation to amendments 
and updates to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS). The key area of focus of this has been IFRS 17: 
Insurance Contracts, which was issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board in May 2017. Management are 
reviewing the requirements of IFRS 17 and have agreed a 
plan to implement in time for the anticipated effective date 
of 1 January 2021.The Chairman of the Board and I met with 
various investors during 2017 as well as attending the AGM in 
May 2017 with the rest of the Board. As Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Senior Independent Director it is important 
that I interact with stakeholders to gain a balanced and fair 
understanding of their views and concerns. I will continue to 
be available to meet with these interested parties on a regular 
basis during the coming year.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Priorities for 2018
In the coming year the Committee will focus on:
 • continued review of the Group’s reserving process;
 • oversight of the implementation by the Group of IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers;
 • assessment of the impact on the Group of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments, IFRS 16 Leases and IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 
and review of management’s implementation plans to ensure 
the Group is ready to comply with the standards as they 
become effective; and
 • work to ensure the Group’s internal audit function continues 
its systematic and disciplined approach.
How the Committee addresses issues with  
Financial Statements and matters communicated  
to the Committee by the Auditor 
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
Provision for outstanding claims
The provision for outstanding claims is an area of significant 
judgement as it estimates the cost required to settle all unpaid 
claims, both reported and incurred but not reported, at the 
balance sheet date. 
The Group’s Underwriting business has accumulated significant 
experience of projecting future claims development and has a 
detailed understanding of how ultimate liabilities develop over 
time based on initial notifications, environmental conditions 
and changes to legislation or reporting processes. This 
experience is built into the Reserving Policy and the actuarial 
models used to calculate the year end claims reserves, which 
are overseen by Underwriting’s Reserving Committee. The 
Reserving Committee is a sub-committee of the independent 
Underwriting Board responsible for oversight of the process 
and recommending the appropriate level of claims reserves. 
There are robust controls in place surrounding the data used 
by the internal actuaries and all estimates and assumptions 
are internally peer reviewed. This approach applies rigour and 
independence to ensure there is an appropriate margin over 
the actuarial best estimate to allow for uncertainty and volatility. 
Underwriting’s external actuary prepares an independent 
projection of claims reserves.
Having been recommended by the Underwriting Reserving 
Committee and approved by the Underwriting Board, detailed 
papers were provided to the Audit Committee explaining the 
methodology used, how the Reserving Policy has been applied 
and the judgements applied in the actuarial calculations that 
support the provisions made. These papers included reports 
and calculations provided by the external actuary.  
The Committee met with management and considered 
explanations from both the internal and the external actuaries 
to deliberate over the methodology applied, the best estimate 
calculations and the external actuary’s independent report.
Extensive information on reserving levels was provided to 
support these discussions and to enable the Committee to 
assess the adequacy of the reserves and level of prudence, and 
any variances between the internal and external best estimates 
were debated and understood. 
The Audit Committee also asked the Group’s External 
Auditor to provide an update on the procedures they used 
to test the reserving process and best estimate calculations 
in accordance with the applicable accounting and auditing 
standards. The External Auditor further confirmed the 
challenges made, representations received and conclusions 
based on this. 
Having considered all the information presented and having 
satisfied itself with the enquiries made, the Committee 
confirmed it was satisfied with the Group’s approach and the 
completeness and reasonableness of the provision for claims 
outstanding held. 
Reinsurance assets
The Group uses both non-proportional excess of loss and 
quota share reinsurance arrangements to limit its exposure 
to claims. The excess of loss programme limits the Group’s 
exposure on any individual claim and the quota share 
arrangement provides 50% cover on all motor claims (after 
excess of loss recoveries). The Group would remain liable for all 
amounts due to policyholders should any reinsurer fail to pay.
An accurate calculation of reinsurance assets is vital to ensure 
an appropriate gross and net position is recognised within the 
Financial Statements. The calculation of reinsurance recovery 
assets is intrinsically linked to the calculation of outstanding 
claims liabilities, and requires the same estimations and 
judgements as considered by Underwriting’s Reserving 
Committee, and is subject to the same level of control 
and review. 
There is further judgement required in establishing the 
recoverability of the reinsurers’ share of insurance contract 
liabilities, particularly the longer term assets arising from 
larger claims. The Group manages its exposure to credit 
risk with respect to its reinsurers through diversification, 
purchasing both excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
through two panels of reinsurers to provide cover under each 
arrangement; by reviewing the financial strength of reinsurers 
prior to finalisation of any contract; by using reinsurers with 
strong credit ratings; and by reviewing the creditworthiness 
of reinsurers on an ongoing basis. The creditworthiness of 
reinsurers is considered by reviewing credit grades provided 
by rating agencies and other publicly available financial 
information on a quarterly basis as well as monitoring the 
recent payment history of reinsurers to ensure they are in 
accordance with expected settlement terms.
Audit Committee  
continued
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
74 | Corporate governance Having considered all the information presented and having 
satisfied itself with the enquiries made, the Committee 
confirmed it was satisfied with the Group’s approach and 
the accuracy and recoverability of the reinsurance assets 
held and reasonableness of the claims reserves held. 
Significant issues related to the 
Financial Statements 
Other than the areas of significant judgement described 
above, there were no other significant issues related to the 
Financial Statements considered by the Committee and 
discussed with the External Auditor during the year and in 
relation to the 31 December 2017 year end.
Adoption of Policy on the Provision of Audit and  
Non-Audit Services
Under the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Committee, as representative of the shareholders, 
is required to oversee the relationship with the External 
Auditor and keep the nature and extent of non-audit services 
under review. The Committee must satisfy itself that the 
independence and objectivity of the External Auditor 
are not compromised. 
The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board 
a fully Code compliant Group Policy on the Provision of Audit 
and Non-Audit Services, which was approved in 2015. The 
Committee does not propose any changes to this policy at this 
time. The policy requires the Committee’s approval for certain 
services such as where the service is not directly related to 
the annual audit or involves a closer working arrangement 
between a Group company and the External Auditor that may 
significantly reduce the Auditor’s independence. The policy 
also prohibits the External Auditor from performing certain 
services to the Company regardless of Committee approval. 
A non-exhaustive list of such services includes the design 
and implementation of internal control, financial, accounting 
and risk management systems, actuarial or legal services, 
secondments to management positions, talent searches 
for executives, directors and/or senior financial managers, 
tax or payroll services and due diligence for acquisitions or 
joint ventures.
Fees payable to the External Auditor for non-audit services 
in a calendar year should not exceed 70% of the average 
of the audit fees paid by the Group in the previous three 
consecutive years. Services required by law or regulation (for 
example review or audit of regulatory returns) are excluded 
from the definition of non-audit services to be included in 
the calculation of the 70% cap. Once the amount of fees 
payable for non-audit services in any calendar year exceeds 
50% of the average of the audit fees paid by the Group in the 
previous three consecutive years, this shall be reported to 
the Committee as soon as practicable and regular updates 
provided thereafter to ensure any potential breach of the  
70% cap can be effectively monitored.
In the Committee’s assessment of the effectiveness of the 
external audit process KPMG was asked to articulate the steps 
that it has taken to ensure objectivity and independence. The 
Committee monitors the Auditor’s performance, behaviour 
and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties, 
which informs the Audit Committee’s decision whether to 
recommend reappointment on an annual basis. The total 
amount paid for non-audit work during the year was £0.2m 
and was for assurance services connected to KPMG’s role as 
statutory Auditor including the review of the Interim Results 
and the audit of Advantage Insurance Company Limited’s 
Solvency and Financial Condition Report.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board sought advice from the Committee as to whether 
the information presented in this Annual Report, when 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
contains the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. The steps taken by the Committee, or 
on its behalf, to provide this advice to the Board included 
delegating to a group of senior individuals within the Group 
to draft the Annual Report, with each of these individuals 
having responsibility for the production of certain sections 
of the document. Following a detailed review of the Annual 
Report, the Committee concluded that it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and contains the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy and advised 
the Board accordingly. 
Discharge of responsibilities
During the year under review, the Committee has continued 
its detailed scrutiny of the appropriateness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls, and the robustness and integrity 
of the Group’s financial reporting, along with both the internal 
and external audit processes. The Committee has devoted 
significant time to reviewing these areas, which are integral to 
the Group’s core management and financial processes, as well 
as engaging regularly with management. The Committee has, 
where necessary, taken the initiative in requesting information 
in order to provide the constructive challenge appropriate 
for its role.

Role
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present the report 
of the Nomination Committee  
for the financial year ended  
31 December 2017.
Nomination Committee 
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
76 | Corporate governance Board changes
Towards the end of 2017, I notified the Board that I was 
contemplating retiring as Board Chairman at the AGM in 
2018. Gary Hoffman had also indicated to the Board that 
there would come a time in the not too distant future when 
he would look to step down from his role as Chief Executive 
Officer. Succession planning carried out by the Committee 
throughout 2017 ensured that plans were in place for orderly 
succession for all appointments to the Board and to senior 
management so as to maintain an appropriate balance of 
skills and experience within the Company and on the Board.
At the start of the search process, the Committee considered 
the job specification for the role of Chairman, emphasising 
the importance of the Chairman’s oversight of the Company’s 
strategy. The Committee considered who would be best 
placed to assume the role of Company Chairman and the 
Committee agreed that continuity and stability along with 
balancing the needs of strong independent governance 
and effective strategic leadership were key parameters for 
potential candidates given the current development of the 
Group. The Board wished to retain Gary’s services for the 
longer term as he, along with his management team, had 
been instrumental in the Company’s success both prior to and 
since the IPO. Gary also has significant experience as a Board 
Chairman having held similar positions at Barclaycard and 
VISA Europe. The Committee and the Board were cognisant 
that the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer as Chairman 
of the same company is not in line with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code); however for the 
reasons noted in my Chairman’s Statement, the appointment 
of Gary as Non-Executive Chairman is in the best interests of 
the Company and all of its stakeholders.
The recommendation of Gary as Chairman therefore meant 
that the Company needed to search for suitable candidates 
for the position of Chief Executive Officer. Executive search 
agents, Russell Reynolds and Sainty Hird were engaged to 
source suitable candidates for this role. The Committee 
discussed the relative merits of potential external candidates 
who were considered alongside potential internal candidates. 
The Board had informed the Committee that an external 
candidate should be viewed as significantly stronger in all 
key areas to justify consideration ahead of the strongest 
internal candidate. The Board and the Committee considered 
continuity risk and the potential compromise to the 
effective functioning of the current senior executive team 
should an external candidate be proposed. The Committee 
recommended to the Board, two external candidates 
as potential successors to Gary along with two internal 
candidates. After detailed debate the Board acknowledged 
that Toby van der Meer, Managing Director of the Group’s 
UK trading subsidiary Hastings Insurance Services Limited 
since 2011, emerged as the strongest potential candidate for 
succession to the role and referred the matter back to the 
Committee to continue and finalise its thoughts before making 
a formal recommendation to the Board. 
Recommendations for the appointment of Gary as Board 
Chairman and Toby as Chief Executive Officer were considered 
on 8 January 2018; the Board confirmed those appointments. 
Tom Colraine, Senior Independent Director, will be appointed 
as Committee Chairman from 1 March this year. The Committee 
recommended and the Board approved that Gary Hoffman will 
not become a member of any of the Board’s Committees and 
that Tom will continue to be able to allocate sufficient time to 
discharge his responsibilities effectively.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Board and Committee composition and review
As required by the Code a listed company’s board and its 
committees should have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the company 
to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. The board and its committees 
should also meet relevant independence criteria in terms of 
the number of Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee noted that the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors on the Board have not yet reached the end of their 
first term of office and that the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company by these 
Directors remains appropriate. Succession plans and talent 
development for the Executive Directors and senior executive 
management were reviewed by the Committee throughout 
the year and advice was sought from independent, external 
search agencies in relation to establishing a pipeline of 
potential successors, either externally or internally.  
The Committee also reviewed whether there is a sufficient  
and continuous supply of suitable, highly qualified  
internal candidates who will be able to be considered 
for Board membership.
At the time of the IPO in 2015, the Company entered into 
a relationship agreement between the Company and 
certain shareholders representing Founder Shareholders 
and Goldman Sachs Shareholders (GS) whereby these 
shareholders were able to appoint up to two Directors each 
to the Board as long as they maintain a certain shareholding 
in the Company. As reported in my Chairman’s Statement last 
year, on 1 March 2017 Rand Merchant Investment Holdings 
Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary Main Street 1353 
Proprietary Limited (RMI) acquired of a holding of 29.9% in 
the Company. As a result of this transaction and under the 
terms of their relationship agreement with the Company, 
the GS Shareholders’ and Founder Shareholders’ respective 
entitlement to nominate Directors for appointment to the 
Board was reduced from two Directors each to one Director 
each. Michele Titi-Cappelli resigned as a Director representing 
the GS Shareholders and Edward Fitzmaurice resigned as a 
director representing the Founder Shareholders on 14 March 
2017. A relationship agreement was entered into between the 
Company and RMI whereby RMI can appoint one Director to 
the Board as long as they maintain a certain shareholding in 
the Company. Herman Bosman was appointed to the Board 
on 14 March 2017. The Committee confirmed the appointment 
of Herman Bosman under the terms of that relationship 
agreement. Further information about these agreements 
can be found on pages 51 and 52.
During 2017, Richard Brewster stated his intention to step 
down as a Director of the Company and, under the terms 
of the relationship agreement, the Founder Shareholders 
nominated Selina Sagayam as their representative Director 
in his place. The Committee confirmed the appointment and 
Selina joined the Board in August 2017. 
The relationship agreement between the Founder 
Shareholders and GS Shareholders also permitted these 
shareholders to appoint one director respectively to the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee. As noted last year, 
the Remuneration Committee was not fully Code compliant in 
that the Committee was not wholly composed of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Whilst the composition of the 
Nomination Committee complies with the Code, the presence 
of Non-Independent Directors on this Committee was not 
deemed to be in the spirit of the Code. The Committee 
reviewed the composition of both of these Committees 
during the year and recommended to the Board that the 
membership of both should fully comply with the Code in line 
with the statement of intent made last year that the Company 
would be fully Code compliant. 
Following Edward Fitzmaurice’s resignation in March 2017 
and Richard Brewster’s resignation in August 2017, the 
Founder Shareholders no longer have a representative on the 
Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee. 
Gary Hoffman stepped down as a member of the Committee 
in November and the GS shareholders also confirmed that 
Sumit Rajpal would step down as a member of the Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. As such I am pleased to 
confirm that the Company is now Code compliant in terms 
of the composition of these Committees.
As part of the Board effectiveness evaluation conducted 
in October this year, the Committee was also subject to an 
appraisal by its members. The evaluation considered how 
it discharged its responsibilities as well as the performance 
of the Committee members. The Committee has agreed a 
number of actions for the coming year.

succession for all appointments 
to the Board and to senior 
management.” 
Board diversity 
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s values and 
standards and ensuring that obligations to its shareholders 
and others are understood and met. As such it is important 
that the Board reflects the diversity both of its workforce as 
well as the market within which it operates. The Committee 
has reviewed the composition of the Board in light of its 
diversity as a whole and recognises that it remains the 
policy of the Company that when proposing appointments 
of Directors, the Committee considers the independence, 
skills, knowledge and experience that a candidate possesses 
compared to the skill sets and experience of the Board as 
it currently stands. Selection of candidates also takes into 
consideration the breadth of knowledge that the Board has 
and the fact that it is required to provide a well-balanced 
environment which encourages scrutiny and appropriate 
challenge. The Committee is also committed to ensure 
that the Board is representative in terms of diversity and 
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, disciplines 
and experience are considered. The Committee abides by this 
policy by ensuring that the best candidate is selected to join 
the Board and the Board does not intend to adopt a quota 
system with prescriptive, quantitative targets.
Meetings
The Committee met three times during the year. The following matters were considered and challenged as appropriate by 
Committee members at these meetings:

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present the report of 
the Risk Committee for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017.
Risk Committee
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and delegates the oversight of this to 
the Risk Committee. The Committee is a formal sub-committee of 
the Board with its own specific Terms of Reference. The principal 
purpose of the Risk Committee is to advise the Board on risk 
management matters, recommend the Group framework of risk 
limits and risk appetite to the Board for approval, and oversee 
the risk management arrangements of the Company and its 
regulated trading subsidiaries. The Committee meets at least 
four times a year as a minimum and at other times as required.
Membership

 • Reviewed its Terms of Reference and confirmed the Committee’s terms of reference had been adhered to during 2017
 • Conducted an annual review of Committee effectiveness and agreed an action plan to further improve operations
During the year the Committee oversaw a number of 
improvements to the Assurance, Risk and Compliance 
(ARC) framework across the Group. The ARC framework 
helps to embed assurance practices, culture, policy and 
responsibilities, clarifies the role of the second line of defence 
functions across the Group, enhances skills and knowledge 
and provides a centre for assurance excellence. The ARC 
framework also provides the Committee with effective 
reporting to maintain effective oversight and provide 
challenge on risks across the Group, for example mapping  
and ranking risks in order of profile and likelihood. This 
framework will continue to embed in the coming year.
The Committee received updates on preparations for the 
implementation of the forthcoming General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). The UK Government has confirmed that 
the legislation will be adopted in full and will replace current 
data protection law in the UK. The Committee received an 
independent assessment of the Group’s preparedness for 
GDPR in April 2017 which identified the risks that needed 
to be addressed. Since that assessment was completed 
further guidance has been published and management 
are progressing with an implementation programme in 
preparation for the May 2018 deadline. 
In relation to Brexit, the Committee was updated on the 
implications of the departure of the UK from the EU and likely 
impacts to the Group. The Group’s customer base is solely 
within the UK and it is not expected that Brexit will significantly 
impact on its operations. A contingency plan was also 
reviewed in the event that AICL, which is based in Gibraltar, 
were unable to continue to underwrite UK motor insurance 
under current passporting rights between the UK and 
Gibraltar. It is not expected that these rights will be impacted 
by Brexit, however the plan provides contingency in the event 
this risk crystallises.
As part of the Board effectiveness evaluation conducted in 
October 2017, the Risk Committee was also subject to an 
appraisal by its members. The evaluation considered how 
it discharged its responsibilities as well as the performance 
of the Committee members. The Committee has agreed a 
number of actions for the coming year.
Meetings
The Committee met four times during the year. The following matters were considered and challenged as appropriate by 
Committee members at these meetings:
“ A number of improvements have 
been made to the Assurance, 
Risk and Compliance framework 
across the Group.”

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc As well as my role as a Director of the Company and Chairman 
of its Risk Committee, I am also an Independent Non-Executive 
Director of AICL, and Committee Chairman of that company’s 
Risk Committee. Along with my oversight of risk within AICL, I 
regularly correspond with Selina Sagayam, the Risk Committee 
Chairman of HISL. During these meetings I am updated on 
matters and concerns raised by the HISL Risk Committee 
enabling me to fully discharge my role as Group Risk Committee 
Chairman. Minutes of the AICL and HISL Risk Committees are 
contained in Group Risk Committee papers for all members.
Priorities for 2018
In the coming year the Risk Committee will focus on:
 • execution of strategies developed to deal with key Group 
Risks including Information and Cyber Security and 
Data Protection;
 • enhancing the governance over outsourcing, both intra-
Group and external, arrangements to ensure that appropriate 
levels of oversight are maintained;
 • continued oversight of capital management and 
developing pre-emptive actions to mitigate risk in context 
of regulatory obligations;
 • ensuring adequate approach and actions are being 
taken to ensure compliance with new legislation and 
regulatory requirements;
 • ongoing embedding Risk Management and Compliance to 
support the Group strategic and commercial priorities; and
 • monitoring the Group risk strategy with regard to market risk 
and liquidity.
Internal control and risk management
The Risk Committee ensures that the Group’s material risks 
have been identified and that appropriate arrangements 
are in place to assess, mitigate, monitor and report on 
those risks effectively. The Committee also ensures these 
practices are consistently applied in each of the regulated 
trading subsidiaries as delegated to the respective company 
Boards. The Risk Committees within these trading entities 
are composed of independent Non-Executive Directors 
and executive management who oversee and report on 
the effectiveness of the Assurance, Risk and Compliance 
Management Framework for their respective entities. In the 
Group’s UK regulated subsidiary, conduct risk and customer 
outcome matters are considered by the Conduct Committee 
and risk and regulatory compliance is considered by the Risk 
and Compliance Committee. This cohesive and integrated 
approach to Risk Management leverages the Risk Committees 
at subsidiary level and provides effective assessment of the 
Group’s enterprise wide risk profile.
The description of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management is covered in the Managing Our Risks report 
on page 43. The Viability Statement is provided on page 43 
in relation to the expectations that the Group will continue 
to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the next 
three years following the Committee’s review of the Group’s 
risk appetite and principal risks.

Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
84 | Corporate governance Dear Shareholders
On behalf of the Board, I am  
pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (DRR) for  
the year ended 31 December 2017. 
Last year we received a vote of 99.99% for our Annual Report 
on Remuneration (Report) by our shareholders at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in 2017. This year, we are not proposing 
to make any changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(Policy). We have included, at the end of this Report, an extract 
of our Remuneration Policy for ease of reference. A summary 
table, setting out an overview of remuneration elements and 
how these will be implemented in 2018, is also included at the 
start of the Report. The full Policy, as approved by shareholders, 
can be found in the 2015 Annual Report (www.hastingsplc.
com/investors/results-centre/annual-reports).
As required by regulation, our Report will be subject to an 
advisory vote at our AGM in May this year. As no changes are 
proposed, no resolution is proposed on our Policy at this 
year’s AGM.
Remuneration in context
2017 was the Company’s second full year as a listed company. 
During this year, the Company has continued to deliver very 
strong performance including adjusted operating profit growth 
of 21% before the impact of Ogden rate change, and continued 
momentum with increasing customer policy numbers, higher 
average premiums and growing retail income driving profitable 
growth and strong cash generation. These achievements have 
also been reflected in the value generated for our shareholders 
with an 88% increase in the share price since the IPO.
There have been a number of wider events in the year that 
provided important context to the Remuneration Committee 
when considering Directors’ remuneration. 
Firstly, during 2017, all vesting conditions attaching to interests 
under the legacy Management Incentive Plan (MIP), which was 
put in place prior to the Company’s Admission to the London 
Stock Exchange, were met and all entitlements under the MIP 
satisfied in full. The final value attributed to the MIP interests 
reflected the significant growth in the value of the business, 
from around £300m at the time the MIP was incepted in 2014, 
to around £2.1bn when the MIP interests fully vested. 
Secondly, as announced in January 2018, Mike Fairey has 
decided to retire as Chairman and will step down from the 
Board at the 2018 AGM. Succession planning has been high 
on the Board’s agenda over recent years as it seeks to sustain 
the Company’s growth and development. As described in 
this Annual Report and subject to shareholder agreement, 
Mike Fairey will be replaced as Non-Executive Chairman by 
Gary Hoffman, who has served as Chief Executive Officer 
since November 2012. Gary Hoffman will step down as Chief 
Executive Officer from 1 March 2018 and continue to serve 
as an Executive Director until Mike Fairey retires. Toby van 
der Meer, who has been Managing Director of the Company’s 
UK trading subsidiary, Hastings Insurance Services Limited 
since June 2011, will be appointed to the Company’s Board 
with effect from 1 March 2018 and take over the role of 
Chief Executive Officer as of that date. 
Remuneration decisions in the year
The commercial context described above illustrates the 
Company’s continued growth and development in the 
listed environment. As part of its deliberations on executive 
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considered it 
important to reflect this maturity as a listed company in the 
remuneration arrangements. Against that background the 
Committee determined the following:
Executive Director salary levels 
The historic salary positioning of our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer has been below market, reflecting 
in part a continuation of a pay philosophy that operated prior 
to our listing as a public company and when legacy incentive 
arrangements such as the MIP, which has now fully paid out, 
were in place. In light of the continued strong performance 
and increasing maturity of the Company, the Committee 
determined that salary levels should be set at a level to better 
reflect the role and responsibilities, as well as the experience 
and performance of the individuals. Against that background it 
is proposed that the Chief Financial Officer, who has a proven 
track record of strong performance in the role as Chief Financial 
Officer of a listed entity and who has not received an increase 
since IPO, will receive a 11% salary increase, bringing his salary 
to £350,000. In recognition of this increase, it is proposed that 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award to the Chief Financial 
Officer in 2018 be reduced by 25% of salary.
Similarly, the Remuneration Committee determined that 
the salary for the new Chief Executive Officer be £500,000, 
reflecting a c.5% increase on that of the previous incumbent. 
In both cases, the salaries still remain conservatively 
positioned against market.
Annual statement from the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman

Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Wider Executive Directors remuneration arrangements
The Remuneration Committee annually reviews the executive 
remuneration arrangements. As part of this review it was 
determined that the current arrangements remain fit for 
purpose, subject to the adjusted salary levels and decreased 
Chief Financial Officer LTIP award as described above. Upon 
the appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer, it followed 
that the wider remuneration arrangements be wholly aligned 
to the existing Policy, as summarised on page 97 of this report. 
The Remuneration Committee is due to undertake a detailed 
review of the Policy over the year ahead, in advance of putting 
a revised Policy to shareholder vote at the 2019 AGM. The 
Committee closely follows the emerging corporate governance 
and best practice guidance on executive remuneration and these 
will be carefully considered as part of the forthcoming review. 
Non-Executive Chairman fee
In line with best practice, the Non-Executive Chairman will 
not participate in any variable incentive plans or receive 
any wider benefits (e.g. pension) previously provided to him 
in the role of Chief Executive Officer. Upon review of the 
anticipated role and responsibilities of the Chairman, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that the Chairman fee 
be set at £250,000 per annum. This represents an increase 
on the previous Chairman’s fee of £150,000; something that 
is considered appropriate in the context of the increased 
anticipated time commitment of the role in light of the recent 
leadership changes. It is also consistent with typical market 
levels for a FTSE 250 Chairman. 
Other decisions in the year: 2017 annual bonus payments 
As in prior years, the annual bonus awards are determined 
by reference to predetermined targets, primarily adjusted 
operating profit, as well as overall corporate and individual 
performance within our 4Cs framework including objectives 
aligned to colleagues, customers, company and community. 
This ensures a balanced overall assessment of performance, 
in line with best practice. Further information on the 4Cs

pages 36-42.
This bonus framework applies to all colleagues on a consistent 
basis. When considering remuneration outcomes, the 
Committee carefully considers the distribution of bonuses 
across the entire business to ensure it is fair and equitable. 
In recognition of the significant value created for shareholders 
in the year, the Committee determined a bonus of £292,250 
be made to the Chief Executive Officer, representing 62% of 
salary, and £187,050 be made to the Chief Financial Officer, 
representing 59% of salary. 25% of these bonuses will be 
deferred into shares for three years.
Conclusion
We hope you find that this report clearly explains our 
remuneration approach and that it enables you to appreciate 
how it links to our strategy. 
We value the views of our shareholders and we actively welcome 
any feedback on our Policy and its implementation. We hope 
you find this report helpful and informative and we hope to 
receive your support for the DRR at our AGM in May 2018.

Compliance statement
This is the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR)
which has been produced pursuant to, and in accordance 
with, the Listing Rules, section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 
and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended 2013).

Corporate Governance Code (the Code). This report contains 
both auditable and non-auditable information.
Overview of Executive Directors policy and 
approach for 2018
An overview of the key remuneration elements in place for 
Executive Directors and details of the implementation of the 
Policy for 2018 are set out below. There are no structural 
changes from 2017.
Annual report on remuneration
This section sets out how the Policy of the Company has been applied during  
the year and details how the Committee intends to apply the Policy going forward. 
Executive Directors Remuneration
Key element Summary of Policy Details of approach for 2018
Base salary Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any 
increase usually taking effect from January.
Chief Executive Officer salary of £500,000 (new incumbent 
from 1 March 2018). 
Chief Financial Officer salary of £350,000, representing an 11% 
increase. This reflects sustained strong performance in the role 
and remains conservatively positioned against the market.
Pension The Company operates a defined contribution 
scheme. The maximum annual contribution is  
10% of salary.
Executive Directors will receive a contribution  
of 10% of salary and both will receive cash in lieu of pension.
Benefits Benefits include a car allowance of £8,000p.a., private medical cover for the Executive and family, life assurance, 
long term disability insurance and costs associated with rental property.
Share Incentive  
Plan (SIP)
Executive Directors may participate in the SIP on the same terms as other employees.
Annual  
bonus
Awards are based on financial, operational and 
individual goals during the year. 
At least 50% of the award will be assessed 
against the Company’s financial performance. The 
remainder of the award will be based on personal 
performance against individual objectives.
50% of salary awarded for on target performance 
with an absolute maximum opportunity of 100% 
of salary.
A proportion earned is deferred into Company 
shares, which vest over three years.
For 2018, the level of the award will be based primarily on 
adjusted operating profit. In determining individual payouts, 
the Committee will also consider performance against 
pre-determined 4Cs objectives, aligned to our strategy. 
This includes financial and non-financial metrics relating to 
colleagues, customers, company and community, in line with 
our bonus approach across the organisation. 
The details of the performance targets for 2018 are 
commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed in 
next year’s report. 
25% of any award made will be deferred into shares for 
three years.
Long-Term  
Incentive  
Plan (LTIP)
Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions measured 
over a three year period.
The normal maximum level of awards that may 
be made in respect of any financial year is 225% 
of salary. In exceptional circumstances the 
Committee may grant awards of up to 300% 
of salary. 
Awards of 225% of salary to the new Chief Executive Officer 
and 200% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, representing 
a 25% of salary decrease on prior year. 
Vesting will be determined on the basis of:
 • 50% on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 250, 
with 25% of this element vesting for achievement of median 
performance, rising to 100% for upper quartile performance;
 • 50% on earnings per share (EPS), with 25% of this element 
vesting for achievement of cumulative adjusted EPS of 68.2p 
per share, rising to 100% for 79.1p per share.
Shareholding  
guidelines
The Executive Directors are expected to build up and maintain a value holding equivalent to twice their base salary.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Board changes in 2018
As described in the introductory letter to the DRR, there will 
be a number of Board changes in 2018. The key remuneration 
implications of these changes are summarised below: 
(i)  Toby van der Meer: appointment to Chief Executive 
Officer from 1 March 2018
Remuneration arrangements as Chief Executive Officer are 
aligned to the current Executive Director Policy. All legacy 
awards granted to him in respect of his prior role as Managing 
Director of Hastings Insurance Services Limited will continue 
on the previous terms. 
(ii)  Gary Hoffman: transition to Non-Executive Chairman
Gary will continue as an Executive Director until appointment as 
Non-Executive Chairman at the 2018 AGM. In the period prior 
to appointment as Chairman he will continue to receive salary 
and benefit payments. He has agreed to waive entitlement of 
payments due from not serving his full notice period as Chief 
Executive Officer.
In accordance with the plan rules (the full terms of which can 
be found in the Company’s listing prospectus), outstanding 
deferred bonus and LTIP awards will continue on the same 
terms, reflecting Gary’s continued services to the Company. He 
will not receive a 2018 LTIP award. As Non-Executive Chairman, 
he will receive a fee of £250,000. This fee level reflects the 
increased scope, responsibilities and time commitment 
required of the new Chairman role in the context of the recent 
leadership changes. The revised fee is also consistent with 
typical market levels for a FTSE 250 Chairman. 
(iii)  Mike Fairey: stepping down as Non-Executive 
Chairman
Mike Fairey received fees in respect of the services performed 
as Non-Executive Chairman up to the 2018 AGM. No additional 
payments will be made.

Benefits
The benefits consist of private medical insurance (for the 
Executive Directors and their families), long term sickness 
cover, health screening, life assurance and a car allowance. 
The Company meets the cost of a rental property in the 
Bexhill area and the cost of travel to and from the Bexhill and 
Leicester offices and any consequent tax liability for the Chief 
Executive Officer. The cost of these benefits is included based 
on the latest completed returns to HMRC for the year ended 
5 April 2017. The costs incurred since that return are not 
believed to be substantially different to those reported.
Retirement benefits
The amount set out in the table represents the Company 
contribution to the Directors’ retirement planning at a rate of 
10% of base salary. Gary Hoffman and Richard Hoskins receive 
cash in lieu of pension.
Legacy incentives
As disclosed in previous reports, a Management Incentive 
Plan (MIP) was established at the time of the Goldman Sachs 
investment in the business in January 2014, prior to our 
listing as a public company. The interests were subject to the 
following vesting conditions: 50% of the interests on a time 
basis and 50% on a performance basis. The time vesting 
element vested over a five year period, or sooner upon full 
redemption of all preference share capital in the issuing 
entity, with no performance conditions. The performance 
element vested in whole or in part when Goldman Sachs and 
Founder Shareholder interests in the Group fell below 35% in 
aggregate or 8 July 2018, and subject to certain valuation and 
investment return targets being met. 
Performance range

Growth on 2016 achievement  
on a like for like basis +8% +18% +23% +26% +21%
In 2017, all conditions were met in full, leading to full vesting 
of the MIP interests. As required by regulation, the value of 
MIP shown in the single total figure of remuneration table 
above comprises the 50% of interests that were based on 
performance. For completeness, the total value delivered to 
Gary Hoffman was £8,077,175 in cash and 4,358,118 ordinary 
shares of the Company valued at £13,870,582. Richard 
Hoskins received £2,255,352 in cash and 1,216,878 ordinary 
shares of the Company valued at £3,872,958. 
The interests were satisfied partly in cash, from the 
proceeds of dividends and sale of shares in the Company 
held by Hastings Investco Limited, and partly in shares in 
the Company, via distribution of assets of Hastings Holdco 
Limited, the parent entity of Hastings Investco Limited, upon 
dissolution. Satisfaction of the MIP interests was made solely 
from the assets of Hastings Holdco Limited and Hastings 
Investco Limited, and not settled by the Company. The final 
value attributed to the MIP interests reflected the significant 
growth in the value of the business, from around £300m at 
the time the MIP was incepted, to around £2.1bn when the 
MIP interests fully vested. 
Annual bonus
Annual bonus awards are determined based on the 
Company’s performance against pre-determined adjusted 
operating profit targets and an assessment of overall 
corporate and individual performance against Hastings’ 4Cs 
framework. This approach ensures that annual bonus awards 
for all colleagues are assessed on a consistent basis and 
include a balanced assessment of financial and non-financial 
performance, in line with regulatory best practice.
2017 Annual bonus outturn

targets set at the start of the year and how the performance

were granted conditional share awards at the time of 
the Company’s admission to the London Stock Exchange

awards, half of these awards vested at the end of 2017, 
representing a value of £750,000 for Gary Hoffman and

office / employment with the Company.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc The LTIP and Deferred Bonus awards were granted on 6 April 
2017. The face values have been calculated using the average 
share price over the five dealing days 2 March to 8 March 2017 
of £2.3636.
The Committee considered the key long term objectives over 
the performance period and determined that the awards 
should be linked to the value created for shareholders over 
the period. As a consequence the awards are equally weighted 
against relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS) performance targets. The EPS 
target is a cumulative pence per share target over each of 
the three years. The targets for the LTIP granted in 2017 are 
summarised below:

Vesting is based on the

as set out in the table above; 
 • 50% on cumulative adjusted EPS, with threshold target  
set at 68.2p per share and stretch at 79.1p per share.
External appointments
Executive Directors may hold external directorships if the 
Chairman determines that such appointments do not cause 
any conflict of interest. Where such appointments are 
approved and held, it is a matter for the Chairman to agree 
whether fees paid in respect of the appointment are retained 
by the individual or paid to the Company.
Gary Hoffman currently holds three external appointments. 
He is Non-Executive Director of Visa Inc., Non-Executive 
Chairman of Visa Europe and Chairman of The Football 
Foundation. He received £252,544 in respect of his roles at 
Visa Inc. and Visa Europe. The appointment with The Football 
Foundation is unpaid. 
Richard Hoskins currently holds one external appointment, as 
Non-Executive Director of Aztec Group Limited, for which he

independent remuneration consultants at the expense of the 
Company. Total fees in 2017 for advice and support provided 
to the Remuneration Committee were £117,600. Deloitte has 
voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code 
of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consultancy 
during the year. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte 
engagement partner and team that provides remuneration 
advice to the Committee do not have connections with the 
Company that may impair their independence. During the 
year, Deloitte also provided unrelated tax, mobility and share 
schemes services to the Group. The Chief Executive Officer, HR 
Director and Head of Reward attended Committee meetings 
by invitation in order to support the discussion of the agenda 
items as appropriate. No individual participates in discussions 
regarding their own remuneration.

Base salary 
Fixed remuneration  
that is appropriate  
for the role and to 
secure and retain  
the talent required  
by the Company.
The Committee takes into account a number 
of factors when setting and reviewing salaries, 
including:
 • scope and responsibility of the role;
 • any changes to the scope or size  
of the role;
 • the skills and experience of the individual;
 • salary levels for similar roles within 
appropriate comparators; and
 • value of the remuneration package  
as a whole.
There is no set maximum to salary levels 
or salary increases. Account will be taken 
of increases applied to colleagues as a 
whole when determining salary increases 
for the Executive Directors, however the 
Committee retains the discretion to award 
higher increases where it considers it 
appropriate.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, 
with any increase usually taking effect 
from January. 
None
Pension 
Fixed remuneration  
that assists in  
providing income  
in retirement.
The Company operates defined contribution 
group personal pension schemes.
Executive Directors may elect to opt out of the 
pension scheme and receive the equivalent 
Company contribution as a cash allowance.
The maximum annual Company 
contribution is currently 10% of salary. 
The Committee retains the discretion to 
increase the Company contribution in line 
with levels in the wider market.

of audited results or an error in the calculation 
of the bonus; (b) the Executive Director 
commits gross misconduct; or (c) events or the 
Executive Director’s behaviour has a significant 
detrimental impact on Hastings’ reputation 
and the Committee determines the Executive 
Director is responsible or directly accountable 
for that damage during a period beginning at 
the start of the bonus year and ending three

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the Financial Statements of Hastings Group 
Holdings plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
Parent Company Balance Sheet, Parent Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, Parent Company Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related Notes, including the accounting policies 
in Note 2.
In our opinion:
 • the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 • the Group Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;
 • the Parent Company Financial Statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 • the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our 
report to the audit committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 
23 September 2015. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is for the three financial years ended 
31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of 
risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
Financial Statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters 
which are unchanged from 2016, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together 
with our key audit procedures to address those matters 
and, as required for public interest entities, our results from 
those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our 
results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context 
of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter
Outstanding claims liabilities (£1,193.3m, 2016: £901.9m) 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), Note 2 
(Accounting policies) and pages 121 to 123 and 136 to 138 
(financial disclosures).
The risk
Subjective valuation:
Reserving for outstanding claims liabilities is the area requiring 
the most significant judgement in the Financial Statements. 
The Group maintains reserves to cover the estimated cost of 
settling all expected future claims with respect to losses or 
injuries, whether or not those losses or injuries have been 
reported to the Group.
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Hastings Group Holdings plc
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
100 | Corporate governance Estimating the reserves required for claims incurred but not 
reported (IBNR) to the Group involves significant judgement 
and the use of actuarial and statistical projections. This 
includes whether any of the larger bodily injury claims will 
result in any periodical payment orders (PPOs) which are 
payments made periodically over several years or even the 
lifetime of a policyholder. PPOs and potential PPOs increase 
the complexity and uncertainty of the estimation of reserves 
due to the increased range of assumptions required. 
Our response
Our procedures included:
 • Control observation: including whether the Group had 
followed their documented reserving policy in setting claims 
reserves.
 • Control re-performance: We tested controls over the 
completeness and accuracy of claims data underlying the 
actuarial projections used by the internal and external 
actuaries to set the incurred but not reported (IBNR) 
reserves.
 • Our actuarial experience: Using our actuarial specialists 
we considered the findings of the Group’s internal actuary 
and the independent actuary report. Through critical 
assessment of these actuarial reports and supporting 
documentation, and through discussion with both 
actuaries, we analysed and challenged the differences in 
reserving methodology applied by both actuaries as well as 
the key assumptions being used including claims inflation, 
discount rates, subrogation and the impact of legislative and 
process developments. 
 • Benchmarking assumptions: We assessed the 
assumptions through the assessment of claims 
development trends and benchmarking to market data.
 • Historical comparisons: We have compared prior year 
reserves to actual outcomes to assess whether the Group 
has historically set adequate reserves. We assessed 
the extent to which the margin between the reserves 
booked and the actuarial best estimate was determined 
consistently with prior periods and in line with the reserving 
methodology.
Benchmarking: 
 • Large bodily injury claims – we challenged the Group’s 
estimate of the effect of potential changes in the “Ogden” 
discount rate applied to bodily injury claims and whether 
the frequency assumption, sensitivity and development 
patterns were comparable to our actuarial benchmarks, 
market data and the group’s historical experience.
 • Assessing transparency: We considered the adequacy of 
the Group’s disclosures regarding the degree of estimation 
uncertainty and the sensitivity of recognised amounts to 
changes in assumptions.
Our result
We found the valuation of the outstanding claims 
liabilities to be acceptable.
Key audit matter
Reinsurance assets (£1,087.7m, 2016: £822.0m) 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), Note 2 (Accounting 
policies) and pages 121 to 123 and 136 to 138 (financial 
disclosures).
The risk
Subjective valuation:
As part of the Group’s overall risk mitigation, the Group 
purchases quota share and non-proportional excess of loss 
reinsurance. The valuation of outstanding claims liabilities 
recoverable from reinsurers is dependent on, but not directly 
correlated to, the valuation of outstanding claims liabilities. 
The amount of reinsurance asset to recognise against the 
IBNR claims reserves is particularly judgmental as this is 
inherently linked to the judgements and estimates involved 
in the reserving process. The risk of default by a reinsurer is a 
significant inherent risk. If any reinsurer fails to pay the Group, 
or fails to pay on a timely basis, the Group could experience 
significant losses or liquidity difficulties. Though the Group 
spreads its reinsurance cover across a panel of different 
reinsurers, the Group bears credit risk to each counterparty 
especially to longer-term assets arising as a result of 
recoveries from IBNR and PPO claims reserves.

Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Our response
Our procedures included:
 • Control re-performance: We tested the process and 
controls over the approval of new reinsurance contracts 
in order to support the recognition of a reinsurance asset.
 • Our actuarial experience and benchmarking: We used 
our own actuarial specialists to assess the accuracy and 
recoverability of the reinsurance assets over IBNR claims 
by considering the historical reinsurance recovery ratios 
whilst taking into consideration changes in the underlying 
reinsurance programme. 
 • Methodology choice: Using our own actuaries we 
assessed the methodology for establishing reinsurers’ share 
of IBNR claims reserves against current market practices 
and for consistency with prior periods.
 • Control observation: We tested the monitoring of controls 
over the credit ratings of the panel of reinsurers to assess 
the risk of default. 
 • Benchmarking assumptions: We assessed the credit 
ratings of the panel of reinsurers against rating agencies. We 
assessed the reasonableness of the reinsurance bad debt 
assumptions and checked the post period end receipts 
of reinsurance receivables to provide evidence over the 
recoverability of the year end reinsurance assets.
 • Test of detail: We obtained third party confirmation of the 
contractual arrangements in place and reported claims 
amounts with the reinsurance broker.
Our result
We found the valuation of the Group’s reinsurance assets 
to be acceptable.
Key audit matter
Recoverability of the cost of investment in subsidiaries 
(£1,274.3 m; 2016: £1,271.0 m). Refer to page 71 
(Audit committee report), Note 2 (Accounting policies) 
and page 155 (financial disclosures).
The risk
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the Parent Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries represents 99.91% of the Company’s total assets 
as at 31 December 2017.
Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, 
due to their materiality in the context of its Parent Company 
Financial Statements, this is considered to be the area that 
had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.
Our response
 Our procedures included:
 • Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of 100% 
of investments with the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance 
sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were 
in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether 
those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.
 • Our sector experience: For the investments where the 
carrying amount exceeded the net asset value, comparing 
the carrying amount of the investment with the expected 
value of the business based on the recoverable amount.
 • Assessing subsidiary audits: Assessing the work 
performed by the subsidiary audit teams on all of those 
subsidiaries and considering the results of that work, on 
those subsidiaries’ profits and net assets.
Our result
We found the Company’s assessment of the recoverability 
of the investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
3. Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole was 
set at £6.5m (2016: £5.4m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax, of which it represents 
4.6% (2016: 1.0% of total revenue).
We consider profit before tax to be the most appropriate 
benchmark for Hastings Group Holdings plc this year as the 
Group continues to seek to maximise shareholder value 
through maximising its profits. In the prior years, we had 
used total revenue as the benchmark due to increased profit 
volatility as a result of one off costs including those arising 
from the IPO transaction and debt restructuring. These 
one-off costs reduced profit before tax to a level that was not 
reflective of the size of the overall business
Materiality for the Parent Company Financial Statements as 
a whole was set at £3.1m which represents 4.6% of profit 
before tax.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.3m 
(2016: £0.3m), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 10 (2017: 10) reporting components, we 
subjected 10 (2017: 10) to full scope audits for group purposes.
These audits were undertaken by the Group audit team with 
the exception of Advantage Insurance Company Limited (AICL) 
where the audit was undertaken by overseas component 
auditors who reported back to the Group audit team.

The Group team agreed the AICL component performance 
materiality of £4.8m (2016: £3.7m), which was also applied by 
all components for the audit for group reporting purposes.
The Group team visited KPMG Gibraltar during 2018 to discuss 
the significant audit risks, findings and also to complete a file 
review. Telephone conference meetings were also held with 
KPMG Gibraltar throughout the year.

4. We have nothing to report on 
going concern
We are required to report to you if:
 • we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement in Note 1 to the 
Financial Statements on the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or
 • if the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on 
page 55 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the Financial 
Statements. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is materially misstated 
or inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
 • we have not identified material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report;
 • in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the Financial Statements; 
and
 • in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
Disclosures of principal risks and  
longer-term viability
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our Financial 
Statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 • the Directors’ confirmation within the Viability Statement 
on page 43, that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;
 • the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and
 • the Directors’ explanation in the Viability Statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what

Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability 
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
 • we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider that 
the annual report and Financial Statements taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
 • the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee;
 • we are required to report to you if the Corporate 
Governance Statement does not properly disclose a 
departure from the eleven provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our 
review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
Based solely on our work on the other information described 
above:
 • with respect to the Corporate Governance Statement 
disclosures about internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and 
about share capital structures:
 –  we have not identified material misstatements therein; 
and
 –  the information therein is consistent with the financial 
statements;
 • in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement 
has been prepared in accordance with relevant rules of 
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority.
6. We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 • the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 
56, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
Financial Statements including being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud, other 
irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists.
Independent auditor’s report
continued
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
104 | Corporate governance Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation 
not just those directly affecting the Financial Statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws 
and regulations (irregularities) that could have a material 
effect on the Financial Statements. We identified relevant 
areas of laws and regulations from our sector experience, 
through discussion with the directors and other management 
(as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the 
Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the Financial Statements including financial reporting 
and taxation legislation. We considered the extent of 
compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our 
procedures on the related Financial Statements.
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations 
in the specific areas of regulatory capital and conduct, 
recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s 
activities. With the exception of any known or possible 
non-compliance, and as required by auditing standards, 
our work in respect of these was limited to enquiry of the 
directors and other management and inspection of regulatory 
correspondence. We considered the effect of any known 
or possible non-compliance in these areas as part of our 
procedures on the related Financial Statement items.
We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any indications 
of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included 
communication from the group to component audit teams of 
relevant laws and regulations identified at group level, with a 
request to report on any indications of potential existence of 
irregularities in these areas, or other areas directly identified 
by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non- 
detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls.
The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we 
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
Hastings	Group	Holdings	plc	(the	Company,	Hastings,	HGH)	has	its	registered	office	and	principal	place	of	business	at	Conquest	
House,	Collington	Avenue,	Bexhill-on-Sea,	TN39	3LW,	United	Kingdom.	The	Company’s	registered	number	is	09635183.
The	principal	activities	of	the	Group	are	the	broking	and	underwriting	of	UK	private	car,	van,	bike	and	home	insurance.	
The	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	comprise	the	consolidated	results	of	the	Company	and	its	subsidiaries	(the	Group)	
for the	year	ended	31	December	2017	and	comparative	figures	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2016.	
The	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	have	been	prepared	and	approved	by	the	Directors	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	
Act	2006	and	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	as	adopted	by	the	EU	(IFRS)	that	are	in	effect	at	31	December	2017.	
IFRS	comprise	standards	and	interpretations	approved	by	the	International	Accounting	Standards	Board	(IASB)	and	the	
International	Financial	Reporting	Interpretations	Committee.
Going concern
The	financial	performance	and	position	of	the	Group,	its	cash	flows,	liquidity	position	and	borrowing	facilities	are	set	out	in	the	
primary	statements	and	the	subsequent	notes.	Further	analysis	of	the	Group’s	operations,	capital	management	strategy,	risk	
management	practices	and	growth	strategy	may	be	found	in	the	Strategic	Report.	
Having	considered	the	foregoing	items,	the	Group’s	approved	budget	and	cash	flow	forecasts	for	the	next	12	months	and	
beyond,	and	after	making	enquiries,	the	Directors	have	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group	has	adequate	resources	to	
continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future.	Accordingly,	they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	in	
preparing	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements.
Basis of measurement
The	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	are	presented	in	Pounds	Sterling.	Amounts	are	rounded	to	the	nearest	million	with	one	
decimal	place	(e.g.	£0.1m)	except	where	otherwise	indicated.
The	preparation	of	consolidated	financial	statements	requires	the	use	of	estimates	and	assumptions	that	affect	the	reported	
amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	at	the	date	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements	and	the	reported	amounts	of	revenues	and	
expenses	during	the	reporting	period.	Although	these	estimates	are	based	on	management’s	best	knowledge	of	the	amounts,	
events	and	actions,	actual	results	ultimately	may	differ	from	those	estimates.	The	areas	involving	a	higher	degree	of	judgement	
or	complexity,	or	areas	where	assumptions	and	estimates	are	significant	to	these	Consolidated	Financial	Statements,	are	
disclosed	in	Note	3.
The	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	are	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	basis,	except	for	certain	financial	assets	and	property	
which	are	measured	at	their	fair	value	or	revalued	amounts.	
Adoption of new IFRS
The	Group	has	adopted	the	following	amendments	to	IFRS	which	were	effective	from	1	January	2017.	Except	where	stated,	
these	did	not	have	an	impact	upon	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements:
 • Amendments	to	IAS	7	Disclosure	Initiative	-	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	6	November	2017.	The	amendments	require	additional	
disclosure	in	relation	to	changes	in	the	value	of	liabilities	arising	from	financing	activities.	This	has	resulted	in	additional	
disclosure	in	Note	26	of	movements	in	liabilities	arising	from	financing	activities.
 • Amendments	to	IAS	12	Recognition	of	Deferred	Tax	Assets	for	Unrealised	Losses	–	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	6	November	
2017. The amendments clarify that unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value can give rise to deductible 
temporary	differences.
The	following	amendment	to	IFRS	was	endorsed	by	the	EU	during	the	year	but	is	not	yet	effective:
 • Amendments	to	IFRS	4	Applying	IFRS	9	Financial	Instruments	with	IFRS	4	Insurance	Contracts	–	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	
3 November	2017.	The	amendments	permit	an	entity	to	defer	the	application	of	IFRS	9	Financial	Instruments	subject	to	the	
predominance	of	insurance	activities.	The	Group	currently	expects	to	defer	the	application	of	IFRS	9	Financial	Instruments.

Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 1. Basis of preparation continued
Adoption of new IFRS continued
The	following	accounting	standards	and	amendments	to	IFRS	have	been	issued	by	the	IASB	but	are	not	yet	effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS	9	sets	out	comprehensive	requirements	relating	to	the	classification	and	measurement	of	financial	instruments.	 
The	standard	was	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	22	November	2016	and	is	effective	from	1	January	2018	unless	the	amendments	to	
IFRS	4	that	are	discussed	above	are	applied.	The	Group	currently	expects	to	apply	these	amendments	and	defer	application	 
of	IFRS	9	until	1	January	2021.
The	Group	is	currently	assessing	the	impact	of	IFRS	9	alongside	IFRS	17	Insurance	Contracts.	
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS	15	provides	a	five	step	framework	for	the	recognition	of	revenue	from	contracts	with	customers	and	requires	increased	
levels	of	quantitative	and	qualitative	disclosures.	The	standard	was	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	22	September	2016	and	is	effective	
from	1	January	2018.
The	standard	will	result	in	broking	income	being	allocated	amongst	performance	obligations	as	defined	by	the	standard.	The	
adoption	of	IFRS	15	is	currently	expected	to	result	in	an	immaterial	amount	of	revenue	and	certain	acquisition	costs	being	
reallocated	amongst	broker	services,	which	will	have	a	net	impact	of	less	than	£2.0m	on	the	opening	balance	sheet.	The	
application	of	the	standard	will	also	require	additional	disclosure	within	the	Financial	Statements.
The	Group	intends	to	use	a	modified	retrospective	approach	whereby	comparatives	are	not	restated	and	the	cumulative	impact	
of	adjustments	is	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	at	the	date	of	initial	application,	which	will	be	1	January	2018.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS	16	implements	a	single,	comprehensive	lease	accounting	model	for	lessees	whereby	lessees	will	be	required	to	recognise	
leases	on	balance	sheet	through	a	right	of	use	asset	and	a	financial	liability.	The	standard	was	endorsed	by	the	EU	on	31	October	
2017	and	is	effective	from	1	January	2019.	Management	are	in	the	process	of	evaluating	the	impact	of	IFRS	16	on	the	Consolidated	
Financial	Statements	as	well	as	the	appropriate	transition	option,	but	it	is	anticipated	that	IFRS	16	will	result	in	higher	depreciation	
and	finance	charges	and	lower	operating	expenses	as	well	as	increase	the	amount	of	fixed	assets	and	financial	liabilities	on	the	
Consolidated	Balance	Sheet.	
The	undiscounted	value	of	the	Group’s	operating	lease	obligations	is	disclosed	in	Note	30.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
The	IASB	issued	IFRS	17	Insurance	Contracts	on	18	May	2017.	IFRS	17	provides	a	comprehensive	framework	for	accounting	for	
insurance	contracts	and	it	is	anticipated	to	impact	the	treatment	and	measurement	of	income,	expenses,	assets	and	liabilities	
arising	from	insurance	contracts.	The	standard	is	expected	to	be	effective	from	1	January	2021,	subject	to	endorsement.
Management	are	currently	in	the	process	of	assessing	the	impact	of	IFRS	17	upon	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	incorporate	the	financial	statements	of	the	Company	and	all	of	its	subsidiary	
undertakings	for	the	years	ended	31	December	2017	and	31	December	2016.	
Accounting	policies	have	been	consistently	applied	throughout	the	Group.
Subsidiaries	are	investees	controlled	by	the	Group.	The	Group	controls	an	investee	if	it	is	exposed	to,	or	has	rights	to,	variable	
returns	from	its	involvement	with	the	investee	and	has	the	ability	to	affect	those	returns	through	its	power	over	the	investee.	
The	Group	reassesses	whether	it	has	control	if	there	are	changes	to	one	or	more	of	the	elements	of	control.	Subsidiaries	are	
consolidated	from	the	date	on	which	control	commences	until	the	date	when	control	ceases.	
Intercompany	balances	and	transactions	are	eliminated	in	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements.

Revenue recognition
Insurance premiums, reinsurance and profit commission
Premiums related to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue proportionally over the period of cover provided. Premiums 
with	an	inception	date	after	the	period	end	are	held	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet	in	deferred	income.	Outstanding	
premiums	from	customers	at	the	year	end	are	recognised	within	insurance	receivables.	
Premiums	ceded	to	reinsurers	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	same	period	as	the	related	direct	insurance	business.	
Under	certain	reinsurance	contracts,	profit	commission	may	become	receivable	or	payable	in	respect	of	a	particular	
underwriting	year	dependent	on	the	difference	between	the	ultimate	loss	ratio	and	the	loss	ratio	threshold	set	out	in	the	
contract.	Profit	commission	receivable	or	payable	at	each	reporting	date	is	recognised	based	on	the	estimated	ultimate	loss	
ratio	for	that	underwriting	year	at	the	reporting	date.	Any	movement	on	the	profit	commission	receivable	or	payable	in	the	
period	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	within	reinsurance	commissions.	
Other	reinsurance	commissions	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	within	reinsurance	commissions	in	the	period	to	which	 
they relate.
Revenue from insurance broking activities
Revenue	from	insurance	broking	activities	consists	principally	of	fees	and	commissions	relating	to	the	arrangement	of	insurance	
contracts,	ancillary	product	income	and	other	income.	Revenue	is	measured	at	the	fair	value	of	the	income	receivable	with	an	
allowance	for	expected	future	refunds	to	customers	in	the	event	of	cancellation	before	the	expiry	of	the	policy.
Revenue	from	commissions	is	recognised	when	the	insurance	policy	is	placed	and	incepted.	Revenue	from	fees	and	ancillary	
products	is	recognised	at	the	point	of	sale	to	the	customer	on	an	agency	basis	as	the	Group	has	no	further	obligations	in	
respect of the services provided. 
Premium finance interest
Premium	finance	interest,	earned	on	sales	where	customers	choose	to	pay	in	monthly	instalments	instead	of	one	single,	upfront	
payment,	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	over	the	term	of	the	related	agreement	using	the	effective	interest	method.	
Investment and interest income
Investment	and	interest	income	from	financial	assets	comprises	interest	income	and	net	gains	and	losses	on	certain	financial	
assets	held	at	fair	value.	Interest	income	for	all	interest-bearing	financial	assets,	including	available	for	sale	financial	assets,	is	
recognised	in	profit	or	loss	within	investment	and	interest	income	using	the	effective	interest	rate	method.	
Discounts
Premium	discounts	on	policies	underwritten	by	parties	external	to	the	Group	are	deducted	from	fees	and	commission	within	
other	revenue.	Premium	discounts	for	policies	underwritten	by	the	Group	are	deducted	from	gross	written	premiums	and	are	
recognised proportionally over the period of cover provided.
Other	discounts	on	revenue	are	deducted	from	the	revenue	streams	to	which	they	relate.	
Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets
Claims liabilities
Gross	outstanding	claims	liabilities	are	recognised	at	the	value	of	expected	future	payments	relating	to	claims	incurred	at	the	
reporting	date.	The	expected	future	payments	include	those	in	relation	to	claims	reported	but	not	yet	paid	or	not	yet	paid	in	
full,	and	claims	incurred	but	not	reported	(IBNR).	The	liabilities	are	not	discounted	to	present	value,	except	for	periodic	payment	
orders	(PPOs).	PPOs	are	awarded	as	a	result	of	certain	large	bodily	injury	claims	made	under	insurance	contracts.	Such	awards	
are	generally	for	a	fixed	instalment	over	an	indeterminate	time	period.	Claims	settled,	or	expected	to	be	settled,	by	means	of	
a	PPO	are	recognised	at	the	present	value	of	expected	future	cash	flows	of	the	award	granted	over	the	expected	term	of	the	
PPO,	and	are	recognised	immediately	when	the	award	is	considered	probable.	Discounting	is	implicit	within	these	reserving	
calculations	at	each	period	end	for	each	expected	PPO.	
While	the	Directors	consider	that	the	gross	outstanding	claims	liabilities	and	the	related	reinsurance	assets	are	fairly	stated	on	
the	basis	of	the	information	currently	available	to	them,	the	amount	that	claims	liabilities	ultimately	settle	at	will	vary	as	a	result	
of	subsequent	information	and	events	and	may	result	in	significant	adjustments	to	the	amounts	recognised.
Adjustments	to	the	amounts	of	outstanding	claims	liabilities	established	in	prior	years	are	reflected	in	profit	or	loss	for	the	
period	in	which	the	adjustments	are	made.	The	methods	used,	and	the	estimates	made,	are	reviewed	regularly.

Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets continued
Reinsurance contracts
Contracts	entered	into	under	which	the	Group	is	compensated	for	losses	on	insurance	contracts	are	classified	as	reinsurance	
contracts held.
The	benefits	to	which	the	Group	is	entitled	under	its	reinsurance	contracts	consist	of	short	term	balances	due	from	reinsurers,	
recognised	as	reinsurance	receivables;	and	longer	term	receivables	that	are	dependent	on	the	expected	claims	and	benefits	
arising	under	the	related	reinsured	insurance	contracts,	recognised	as	reinsurance	assets.	
Reinsurance	assets	are	measured	consistently	with	the	amounts	recognised	for	the	associated	reinsured	insurance	contracts	
and	in	accordance	with	the	terms	of	each	reinsurance	contract.	Reinsurance	assets	are	not	discounted	to	present	value,	except	
those	relating	to	PPOs,	in	line	with	the	underlying	liabilities.
Reinsurance	liabilities	are	primarily	premiums	payable	to	reinsurers	under	reinsurance	contracts	held	and	are	recognised	
when	due.	Amounts	recoverable	from	or	payable	to	reinsurers	are	measured	in	a	manner	that	is	consistent	with	the	amounts	
recognised	for	the	associated	provision	for	insurance	contract	liabilities	and	in	accordance	with	the	terms	of	each	reinsurance	
contract held.
The	Group	assesses	its	reinsurance	assets	for	impairment	on	an	annual	basis.	If	there	is	objective	evidence	that	the	reinsurance	
asset	is	impaired,	the	Group	reduces	the	carrying	amount	of	the	reinsurance	asset	to	its	recoverable	amount	and	recognises	
that	impairment	loss	in	profit	or	loss.	
Where	obligations	with	reinsurers	are	commuted,	the	related	reinsurance	assets	and	liabilities	are	settled	in	the	period	in	which	
the	commutation	agreement	is	signed,	on	the	basis	that	the	reinsurer	is	discharged	from	all	obligations	relating	to	the	contract.	
Any	gain	or	loss	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	same	period.
Co-insurance contracts
Contracts	entered	into	under	which	the	Group	shares	the	risk	with	a	co-insurance	partner	at	inception	of	the	policy	are	
classified	as	co-insurance	contracts	held.	
Where	the	Group	is	the	secondary	co-insurer,	the	Group	only	recognises	its	share	of	the	premium	as	an	insurance	receivable	
and	related	claims	liability.	Where	the	Group	acts	as	the	lead	co-insurer,	the	gross	premium	is	recognised	as	an	insurance	
receivable,	with	a	related	co-insurance	payable	to	the	co-insurer.
The	Group	recognises	co-insurance	premiums	and	claims	liabilities	in	the	profit	or	loss	in	the	period	to	which	they	relate.
Unearned premiums reserve
Premiums	on	policies	with	an	inception	date	before	the	period	end	but	with	unexpired	risks	after	the	period	end	are	held	in	
the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet	in	the	unearned	premiums	reserve	within	insurance	contract	liabilities.	The	gross	unearned	
premiums reserve and the reserve for unearned premiums ceded to reinsurers are presented separately.
A	review	of	the	carrying	amount	of	the	unearned	premiums	reserve	is	conducted	at	each	reporting	date.	If	current	estimates	
of	the	present	value	of	the	expected	future	cash	flows	relating	to	future	claims	arising	from	the	rights	and	obligations	under	
current	insurance	contracts	exceed	the	unearned	premiums	reserve	less	related	costs	including	deferred	acquisition	costs,	
then	the	unearned	premiums	reserve	is	deemed	to	be	deficient.
The	test	is	performed	at	the	level	of	a	portfolio	of	contracts	that	are	subject	to	broadly	similar	risks	and	that	are	managed	
together	as	a	single	portfolio.	If	any	deficiency	arises	from	the	test,	first	an	impairment	of	deferred	acquisition	costs	is	
recognised	in	profit	or	loss,	and	then	if	necessary	an	unexpired	risks	reserve	is	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet,	
through	profit	or	loss.	Any	movement	on	that	reserve	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.	
Salvage and subrogation recoveries
Certain	insurance	contracts	permit	the	Group	to	salvage	recoveries	through	the	sale	of	property	acquired	in	settling	a	claim.	
The	Group	may	also	have	the	right	to	subrogation	recoveries,	where	third	parties	are	pursued	for	the	payment	of	costs.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 2. Accounting policies continued
Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets continued
Salvage and subrogation recoveries continued
Salvage	and	subrogation	recoveries,	gross	of	any	amounts	which	fall	under	reinsurance	contracts	held,	are	included	in	
insurance and other receivables and the corresponding reinsurance amounts arising from reinsurance contracts are included 
in	insurance	and	other	payables.	Salvage	recoveries	are	recognised	at	the	amount	that	can	be	reasonably	recovered	from	the	
disposal	of	the	property.	Subrogation	reimbursements	are	recognised	at	the	amount	that	can	be	reasonably	expected	to	be	
recovered from action against the liable third party.
Deferred acquisition costs
Costs	that	are	directly	related	to	the	acquisition	of	new	insurance	contracts	are	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet	as	
deferred acquisition costs.
They	are	subsequently	charged	to	the	profit	or	loss	evenly	over	the	12	month	coverage	period	of	the	related	insurance	contract,	
in	line	with	recognition	of	the	corresponding	premiums.	
Claims handling expenses
The	Group	accrues	for	claims	handling	expenses	incurred	in	processing	and	settling	all	incurred	claims	that	remain	outstanding	
at	the	reporting	date,	including	those	not	yet	reported.	The	liability,	which	is	not	discounted	for	the	time	value	of	money,	is	
determined	based	on	past	claims	handling	experience	and	is	reported	within	insurance	and	other	payables	in	the	Consolidated	
Balance	Sheet.	Claims	handling	expenses	are	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	or	Loss	within	other	expenses	
as the claims are incurred.
Employee benefits
Pension contributions
The	Group	operates	a	defined	contribution	pension	scheme.	The	amount	charged	to	profit	or	loss	in	respect	of	pension	costs	
is	the	amount	of	contributions	payable	in	the	year.	Differences	between	contributions	payable	in	the	year	and	contributions	
actually	paid	are	shown	as	either	accruals	or	prepayments	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet.	The	Group	has	no	obligation	to	
make	any	further	payments	to	the	plans	other	than	the	contributions	due.	Scheme	assets	are	held	separately	from	the	Group	in	
an independently administered fund.
Share based payments
The	Group	operates	equity	settled	share	based	payment	schemes	under	which	participants	may	receive	free	share	awards	or	
nil	cost	options,	depending	on	the	scheme.	Awards	may	have	service	and	performance	conditions	attached.
The	fair	value	of	a	share	based	payment	award	is	determined	at	grant	date	and	expensed	on	a	straight	line	basis	over	the	
vesting	period,	with	a	corresponding	increase	recognised	directly	in	equity.	Expected	vesting	in	respect	of	both	service	
conditions	and	non-market	performance	conditions	is	reviewed	annually	and	adjustments	are	made	retrospectively	to	the	
cumulative	expense	recognised.
Non-trading items and material items
Non-trading	items	are	expenses	or	earnings,	and	the	related	tax	impacts	thereof,	which	the	Directors	believe	are	not	
representative	of	the	underlying	activities	of	the	Group	and	have	therefore	been	presented	separately	in	the	Consolidated	
Statement	of	Profit	or	Loss.	These	include	expenses	incurred	in	the	course	of	the	Group	reorganisation	and	IPO	in	2015,	as	well	
as	the	ongoing	impact	of	the	Goldman	Sachs	investment	on	8	January	2014.
Material	items	are	expenses	or	earnings	that	arise	due	to	one-off,	external	events	that,	in	the	judgement	of	the	Directors,	
warrant	separate	disclosure	due	to	the	significance	of	the	impact	or	nature	of	the	event.	The	impact	of	such	items	is	included	
within	the	classification	line	to	which	they	relate,	and	separate	analysis	of	the	impact	is	provided	with	full	disclosure	of	the	event	
and	impact	within	the	Notes	to	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements.
Finance costs
The	Group’s	finance	costs	comprise	interest	payable	on	financial	liabilities	held	by	the	Group.	Interest	payable	on	financial	
liabilities	is	recognised	using	the	effective	interest	method	and	includes	amortisation	of	directly	attributable	transaction	costs.	
Taxation
Income	tax	on	the	result	for	the	year	comprises	current	and	deferred	tax.	Income	tax	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	except	to	the	
extent	that	it	relates	to	a	business	combination,	items	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	or	items	recognised	directly	
in equity. 
116 | Financial statements
Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2. Accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Current	taxation	expense	is	the	expected	income	tax	payable	on	the	taxable	profit	for	the	period,	using	tax	rates	applicable	
and	any	adjustment	to	income	tax	payable	in	respect	of	previous	financial	periods.	Deferred	taxation	expense	is	the	change	in	
deferred	income	tax	assets	and	liabilities	between	the	reporting	periods.	
Deferred	income	tax	assets	and	liabilities	are	recognised	using	the	balance	sheet	method	for	temporary	differences	between	
the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	for	financial	reporting	purposes	and	the	amounts	used	for	taxation	purposes.	
A	deferred	income	tax	liability	is	recognised	for	all	taxable	temporary	differences	except	when	they	arise	from	the	initial	
recognition	of	goodwill.	Deferred	income	tax	is	also	not	accounted	for	if	it	arises	from	initial	recognition	of	an	asset	or	liability	
in	a	transaction	other	than	a	business	combination	that,	at	the	time	of	the	transaction,	affects	neither	accounting	nor	taxable	
profit	or	loss.
Deferred	income	tax	is	determined	using	tax	rates	and	tax	laws	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	by	the	
reporting	date	and	are	expected	to	apply	when	the	related	deferred	income	tax	asset	is	realised	or	the	deferred	income	tax	
liability is settled.
Deferred	income	tax	assets	are	recognised	to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	that	future	taxable	profit	will	be	available	against	
which	the	temporary	differences	and	unused	tax	losses	can	be	utilised.
Goodwill
Goodwill	is	the	difference	between	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	transferred	in	a	business	combination	and	the	fair	value	
of	the	identifiable	assets	and	liabilities	of	the	acquired	entity	at	the	date	of	the	business	combination.	Any	acquisition	costs	are	
expensed	as	incurred.
Goodwill	acquired	in	a	business	combination	is	allocated	to	cash	generating	units	(CGUs).	Goodwill	is	considered	to	have	an	
indefinite	useful	economic	life	and	is	tested	for	impairment	annually.	
Intangible assets
Software
Computer	software	is	stated	at	cost	less	accumulated	amortisation	and	accumulated	impairment	losses.
Purchased	computer	software	is	initially	recognised	at	cost,	being	the	fair	value	of	consideration	transferred	plus	directly	
attributable costs incurred in order to prepare the asset for its intended use.
Internally	developed	computer	software	is	only	recognised	as	an	asset	when	the	costs	can	be	measured	reliably,	completion	is	
technically	and	financially	feasible,	future	economic	benefits	are	probable	and	there	is	intention	to	use	or	sell	the	asset.	Other	
research	and	development	expenditure	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	as	incurred.
Software	is	derecognised	on	disposal	or	when	no	future	economic	benefits	are	expected	to	arise	from	the	continued	use	of	
the	asset.	On	derecognition,	any	gain	or	loss	arising	is	calculated	as	the	difference	between	the	net	disposal	proceeds	and	the	
carrying	amount	of	the	item.	This	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	period	of	derecognition.
Brands and customer relationships
Brands and customer relationships are recognised on acquisition at fair value and are subsequently measured using the 
historical	cost	method	(their	fair	value	on	acquisition	less	accumulated	amortisation	and	impairment	losses).
Amortisation
Amortisation	is	provided	on	intangible	assets	at	rates	calculated	to	write	off	the	cost	of	the	assets	less	their	estimated	 
residual	value	over	their	expected	useful	lives.	Amortisation	is	calculated	using	the	straight	line	method	and	is	recognised	 
in	profit	or	loss.
Expected	useful	economic	lives	and	residual	values	are	reviewed	at	each	period	end	and,	where	necessary,	changes	are	
accounted	for	prospectively.	The	expected	useful	economic	lives	of	intangible	assets	are	as	follows:
 • Software	 3-7	years
 • Brands	 8	years
 • Customer	relationships	 5	years
 | 117
Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 2. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
Work in progress
Work	in	progress	includes	intangible	assets	in	the	course	of	development	which	are	considered	to	be	eligible	for	capitalisation	
but	which	have	not	yet	reached	the	state	where	they	are	ready	for	their	intended	use.	As	such	no	amortisation	has	yet	been	
charged on these assets.
Property and equipment
The	Group	has	chosen	to	value	property	using	the	revaluation	model.	Properties	are	initially	recognised	at	cost	and	subsequent	
to	initial	recognition	properties	are	carried	at	their	revalued	amount,	which	is	the	fair	value	at	the	date	of	revaluation	less	
subsequent	depreciation	and	impairment	losses.	Property	is	revalued	annually	using	level	3	inputs	as	defined	in	Note	2	Fair	
values,	with	independent	expert	valuations	being	performed	every	three	years.	
Revaluation	surpluses	are	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income.	Upon	disposal	of	a	property,	any	revaluation	surplus	 
is	recognised	directly	in	retained	earnings	and	is	not	reclassified	to	profit	or	loss.	Revaluations	resulting	in	a	reduction	to	
fair	value	are	initially	offset	against	the	revaluation	surplus	and	any	excess	is	immediately	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	as	an	
impairment loss. 
Equipment,	consisting	of	fixtures,	fittings,	office	equipment,	computer	equipment	and	leasehold	improvements,	is	stated	at	
historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost is the fair value of consideration provided plus 
incremental costs incurred to bring an asset to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. 
Costs	incurred	subsequent	to	the	initial	production	of	the	asset	are	capitalised	where	they	are	deemed	to	have	improved	 
the original.
Depreciation	is	provided	on	all	property	and	equipment,	at	rates	calculated	to	write	off	the	cost,	or	fair	value	in	the	case	of	
property,	of	the	assets	less	their	estimated	residual	value	over	their	expected	useful	lives.	Depreciation	is	calculated	using	the	
straight	line	method	and	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.	
The	expected	useful	economic	lives	of	property	and	equipment	are	as	follows:
 • Property	 50	years
 • Property	and	leasehold	improvements	 4-10	years
 • Computer	equipment	 2-5	years
 • Fixtures,	fittings	and	equipment	 3-5	years
Expected	useful	economic	lives	and	residual	values	are	reviewed	at	each	reporting	date	and,	where	necessary,	changes	are	
accounted for prospectively.
Property	and	equipment	is	derecognised	on	disposal	or	when	no	future	economic	benefits	are	expected	to	arise	from	the	
continued	use	of	the	asset.	On	derecognition,	any	gain	or	loss	arising	is	calculated	as	the	difference	between	the	net	disposal	
proceeds	and	the	carrying	amount	of	the	item.	This	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	period	of	derecognition.
Impairment 
Carrying	amounts	of	intangible	assets	and	property	and	equipment	are	reviewed	at	each	reporting	date	to	determine	if	there	
are	indicators	of	impairment.	Where	these	exist,	the	asset’s	recoverable	amount	is	estimated	and	compared	to	the	carrying	
amount.	The	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	the	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	the	asset’s	value	in	use.	
Goodwill	has	an	indefinite	life	and	is	tested	annually	for	impairment.	Impairment	exists	where	the	recoverable	amount	of	the	
CGU	is	lower	than	the	combined	carrying	amount	of	net	assets	and	goodwill	allocated	to	the	CGU.	The	recoverable	amount	of	
the	CGU	is	the	higher	of	the	fair	value	of	the	CGU	less	costs	to	sell	and	the	CGU’s	value	in	use.	
Fair	value	is	the	price	that	would	be	received	in	an	arm’s	length	transaction	between	knowledgeable	market	participants.	Value	
in	use	is	the	present	value	of	expected	future	pre-tax	cashflows	attributable	to	the	asset	or	group	of	assets.
Where	an	asset’s	or	a	group	of	assets’	recoverable	amount	is	exceeded	by	its	carrying	amount,	the	difference	is	recognised	as	
an	impairment	loss	in	profit	or	loss.

Leased assets
Payments	made	under	operating	leases	are	charged	in	profit	or	loss	on	a	straight	line	basis	over	the	lease	term.	Any	incentives	
provided	by	the	lessor	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	on	a	straight	line	basis	over	the	full	lease	term.
Financial assets
The	Group’s	financial	assets	comprise	cash	and	cash	equivalents,	financial	assets	held	at	fair	value	and	insurance	and	other	
receivables.	For	measurement	purposes	the	Group	classifies	its	financial	assets	into	the	following	categories:	financial	assets	at	
fair	value	through	profit	or	loss;	financial	assets	classified	as	available	for	sale;	and	loans	and	receivables.	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial	assets	are	classified	as	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	if	they	are	classified	as	held	for	trading	or	if	the	Group	manages	
such	investments	and	makes	purchase	and	sale	decisions	based	on	their	fair	value	in	accordance	with	the	Group’s	documented	
risk	management	or	investment	strategy.	Financial	assets	held	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value	
(being	the	cost	of	acquisition	excluding	transaction	costs)	and	are	subsequently	remeasured	to	fair	value	at	each	reporting	date.
Gains	or	losses	arising	from	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	these	financial	assets	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	period	in	
which	they	arise.	
Purchases	and	sales	of	financial	assets	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss	are	recognised	on	a	trade	date	basis,	being	the	date	on	
which	a	commitment	is	made	to	purchase	or	sell	the	asset.	Transaction	costs	for	purchases	and	sales	are	expensed	as	incurred	
in	profit	or	loss.	
Available for sale financial assets
Non-derivative	financial	assets	are	classified	as	available	for	sale	when	they	are	not	classified	as	either	loans	and	receivables,	
held	to	maturity	investments	or	financial	assets	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss.	
Available	for	sale	financial	assets	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value	plus	any	directly	attributable	transaction	costs	and	
are	subsequently	remeasured	to	fair	value	at	each	reporting	date,	with	unrealised	gains	or	losses	recognised	in	other	
comprehensive	income	and	accumulated	in	other	reserves	until	the	point	of	disposal,	when	accumulated	gains	and	losses	are	
recognised	in	profit	or	loss.
Interest	income	or	expense	calculated	using	the	effective	interest	rate	on	available	for	sale	financial	assets	is	recognised	in	the	
profit	or	loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans	and	receivables	are	financial	assets	with	fixed	or	determinable	payments	that	are	not	quoted	in	an	active	market.	Such	
assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at 
amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method,	less	accumulated	impairment	losses.	
Insurance	and	other	receivables	are	classed	as	loans	and	receivables.	Insurance	receivables	include	amounts	not	yet	due	in	
respect	of	insurance	premiums	where	the	policyholder	has	elected	to	pay	in	instalments	over	the	term	of	the	policy.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial	assets	are	derecognised	when	the	rights	to	receive	future	cash	flows	from	the	assets	have	expired,	or	have	been	
transferred,	and	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	have	been	transferred.	Any	residual	gains	or	losses	
resulting	from	the	derecognition	of	the	asset	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	in	the	period	of	derecognition.	
Any	unrealised	gains	or	losses	on	available	for	sale	financial	assets	previously	accumulated	in	other	reserves	are	reclassified	to	
profit	or	loss	in	the	period	of	derecognition.

Impairment of financial assets
At	each	reporting	date,	the	Group	assesses	whether	there	is	objective	evidence	that	a	financial	asset	is	impaired.	A	financial	
asset	is	impaired	if	there	is	objective	evidence	of	impairment	as	a	result	of	one	or	more	events	that	have	occurred	after	the	
initial	recognition	of	the	asset	(a	loss	event)	and	that	loss	event	(or	events)	has	had	an	impact	on	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	
of	the	financial	asset.	Objective	evidence	that	a	financial	asset	is	impaired	includes	observable	data	that	comes	to	the	attention	
of	the	Group	about	events	such	as:
 • significant	financial	difficulty	of	the	issuer	or	debtor;
 • a	breach	of	contract,	such	as	a	default	or	delinquency	in	payments;	or
 • the	probability	that	the	issuer	or	debtor	will	enter	bankruptcy	or	other	financial	reorganisation.
If	there	is	objective	evidence	that	an	impairment	loss	has	occurred,	the	amount	of	the	loss	is	measured	as	the	difference	between	
the	asset’s	carrying	amount	and	the	present	value	of	estimated	future	cash	flows	discounted	at	the	financial	asset’s	effective	
interest	rate.	The	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	is	reduced	and	an	impairment	loss	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	for	the	period.	
When	reductions	in	the	fair	value	of	available	for	sale	financial	assets	are	considered	to	be	impairment	losses,	losses	
accumulated	in	other	reserves	are	reclassified	to	profit	or	loss.	The	amount	reclassified	is	the	difference	between	the	value	on	
initial	recognition,	net	of	any	principal	repayment	and	amortisation,	and	the	current	fair	value	of	the	asset,	less	any	impairment	
loss	previously	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.	
If	in	a	subsequent	period	the	amount	of	the	impairment	loss	on	financial	assets,	other	than	available	for	sale	financial	assets,	
reverses,	and	the	reverse	can	be	related	objectively	to	an	event	occurring	after	the	impairment	was	recognised	(such	as	
improved	profitability	of	the	debtor),	the	previously	recognised	impairment	loss	is	reversed	through	profit	or	loss	in	the	period.
If	the	fair	value	of	an	impaired	available	for	sale	financial	asset	subsequently	increases,	the	loss	is	reversed	through	profit	or	loss	
to	the	extent	that	it	offsets	impairment	losses	previously	recognised;	otherwise,	it	is	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income.
Financial liabilities
The	Group’s	financial	liabilities	comprise	loans	and	borrowings	and	insurance	and	other	payables.	
Financial	liabilities	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value	less	any	directly	attributable	transaction	costs.	Subsequently,	financial	
liabilities	are	measured	at	amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method	with	interest	accrued	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	
Sheet	in	insurance	and	other	payables.
Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
Financial	assets	and	liabilities	are	offset	and	the	net	amount	reported	in	the	Consolidated	Balance	Sheet	only	when	there	is	a	
current	unconditional	and	legally	enforceable	right	to	offset	the	recognised	amounts	in	all	circumstances	(including	the	default	
by,	insolvency	or	bankruptcy	of	the	Group	and	all	counterparties),	and	there	is	an	intention	to	settle	on	a	net	basis	or	to	realise	
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The	Group’s	cash	and	cash	equivalents	consist	of	cash	in	hand	and	in	bank,	investments	in	highly	liquid	money	market	funds	
and	other	short	term	deposits	that	are	redeemable	within	90	days.
Insurance intermediary assets and liabilities
Receivables	and	payables	arising	from	insurance	broking	transactions	are	shown	as	assets	and	liabilities	in	recognition	of	the	
fact	that	the	insurance	broker	has	contractual	rights	to	economic	inflows	from	customers	and	obligations	to	third	party	insurers	
upon	placement	of	insurance	products	with	customers.	Receivables	are	recognised	when	the	Group	provides	financing	to	
customers	for	instalment	premiums	payable	to	third	party	insurers.	Payables	arise	where	the	Group	has	an	obligation	to	remit	
premiums received to third party insurers.

Share capital
Shares	are	classified	as	equity	when	there	is	no	obligation	to	transfer	cash	or	other	financial	assets,	or	to	exchange	financial	
assets	or	liabilities	under	potentially	unfavourable	conditions.	Where	such	an	obligation	exists,	the	share	capital	is	recognised	as	
a	liability	notwithstanding	the	legal	form.	
Incremental	costs	directly	attributable	to	the	issue	of	equity	instruments	are	recognised,	net	of	tax	effect,	as	a	deduction	from	
share	premium	to	the	extent	that	there	is	sufficient	share	premium	to	do	so.
Dividends 
Dividends	are	recognised	directly	in	equity	when	approved	and	payable.
Fair values
Property	and	financial	assets	carried	at	fair	value	are	analysed	by	their	level	within	the	fair	value	hierarchy	based	on	the	
observability	of	inputs	into	the	valuation.	Such	assets	are	categorised	as	follows:
 • Level	1:	quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities;
 • Level	2:	inputs	other	than	quoted	prices	included	within	level	1,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability	either	directly	 
(i.e.	as	prices)	or	indirectly	(i.e.	derived	from	prices);	and
 • Level	3:	inputs	for	the	asset	or	liability	that	are	not	based	on	observable	market	data	(unobservable	inputs).
The	level	in	which	financial	assets	carried	at	fair	value	have	been	classified	in	their	entirety	is	determined	on	the	basis	of	the	
lowest	level	input	that	is	significant	to	the	fair	value	measurement	in	its	entirety.
Where	assets	are	not	traded	sufficiently	regularly	for	the	sales	to	be	classified	as	occurring	on	active	market,	or	are	based	on	
observable	market	data	rather	than	on	actual	transactions,	they	are	classified	as	level	2.	Assets	are	valued	by	reference	to	the	
most	recent	observable	market	trade	unless	there	is	evidence	of	impairment.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
The	preparation	of	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	IFRS	requires	the	Directors	to	make	judgements	and	assumptions	
that	affect	the	assets	and	liabilities	recognised	as	at	the	reporting	date	and	the	income	and	expense	recognised	during	the	
reporting	period,	as	well	as	the	content	of	any	disclosures.	Although	these	judgements	and	assumptions	are	based	 
on	the	Directors’	best	knowledge	of	the	amounts,	events	and	actions,	actual	results	may	differ	from	these	judgements	 
and assumptions.
The	judgements	that	the	Directors	have	made	in	applying	the	Group’s	accounting	policies	that	have	the	most	significant	effect	
on	the	amounts	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	and	the	major	sources	of	estimation	uncertainty	that	have	
a	significant	risk	of	resulting	in	a	material	adjustment	to	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	within	the	next	financial	
year	are	as	follows:
Claims liabilities 
The estimation of liabilities arising from claims made under insurance contracts and the related reinsurance recoveries are the 
Group’s	most	critical	accounting	estimates.	Estimates,	and	the	resulting	loss	ratios,	are	informed	by	detailed	actuarial	analysis	
and	reflect	a	balanced	assessment	of	risk	and	probability,	resulting	in	a	sufficiently	prudent	liability	to	give	the	Directors	of	the	
Group	confidence	that	the	Group	is	adequately	provisioned	to	meet	its	future	liabilities.
The	actuarial	best	estimate	of	outstanding	claims	includes	the	estimate	of	expenses	to	be	incurred	in	settling	claims	and	
a	deduction	for	the	expected	value	of	salvage	and	other	recoveries.	The	Group	takes	all	reasonable	steps	to	ensure	that	it	
has	appropriate	information	regarding	claims	exposure.	However,	given	the	uncertainty	in	establishing	claims	provisions,	
it	is	likely	that	the	final	outcome	will	prove	to	be	different	from	the	original	estimated	liability.	In	order	to	reduce	the	risk	of	
underestimation	of	these	liabilities,	a	margin	is	maintained	over	and	above	the	Group’s	internal	actuarial	best	estimate	of	
outstanding claims liabilities. 
In	calculating	the	estimated	cost	of	unpaid	claims,	the	Group	uses	a	variety	of	estimation	techniques,	including	statistical	
analysis	of	historic	experience,	which	assumes	that	the	development	pattern	of	the	current	claims	will	be	consistent	with	 
past	experience.

Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
Claims liabilities continued
A	component	of	these	estimation	techniques	is	the	estimation	of	the	cost	of	notified	but	not	paid	claims.	In	estimating	the	
cost	of	these,	the	Group	has	regard	to	the	claim	circumstances	as	reported,	information	available	from	loss	adjusters	and	
information	on	the	cost	of	settling	claims	with	similar	characteristics	in	previous	years.
The	estimation	of	claims	incurred	but	not	reported	(IBNR)	is	generally	subject	to	a	greater	degree	of	uncertainty	than	the	
estimation	of	the	cost	of	settling	claims	already	notified	to	the	Group,	where	information	about	the	claim	event	is	available.	
Classes	of	business	where	the	IBNR	proportion	of	the	total	outstanding	claims	liabilities	is	high	will	typically	display	greater	
variations	between	the	initial	estimates	and	the	final	outcomes	because	of	the	greater	degree	of	difficulty	of	estimating	those	
reserves.	Classes	of	business	where	claims	are	typically	reported	relatively	quickly	after	the	claim	event	will	tend	to	display	lower	
levels of volatility.
Where	possible	the	Group	adopts	multiple	techniques	to	estimate	the	required	level	of	claims	liabilities.	This	provides	greater	
understanding	of	the	trends	inherent	in	the	data	being	projected.	The	projections	given	by	the	various	methodologies	also	
assist	in	setting	the	range	of	possible	outcomes.	The	most	appropriate	estimation	technique	is	selected,	taking	into	account	the	
characteristics	of	the	business	class	and	the	extent	of	the	development	of	each	accident	year.	
Allowance	is	made	for	changes	or	uncertainties	which	may	create	distortions	in	the	underlying	statistics	or	which	might	cause	
the	cost	of	unsettled	claims	to	increase	or	reduce	when	compared	with	the	cost	of	previously	settled	claims,	including:
 • changes	in	Group	processes	which	might	accelerate	the	development	and/or	recording	of	paid	or	incurred	claims	compared	
with	the	statistics	from	previous	years;
 • changes in the legal environment;
 • the	effect	of	inflation;
 • changes	in	the	mix	of	business;
 • the impact of large losses; and
 • movements	in	industry	benchmarks.
Large	third	party	injury	claims	typically	involve	costs	that	relate	to	future	periods,	such	as	covering	the	loss	of	future	earnings	or	
the	ongoing	cost	of	care,	and	will	either	be	settled	through	a	lump	sum	settlement	or	through	a	periodic	payment	order	(PPO).	
Such	claims,	including	PPOs,	are	generally	assessed	individually,	either	being	measured	on	a	case	by	case	basis	or	projected	
separately	in	order	to	reduce	the	possible	distortive	effect	of	the	development	and	incidence.	
Where	a	claim	has	been	settled	through	a	PPO	or	it	is	expected	that	a	PPO	will	be	awarded,	the	liability	is	calculated	using	
discounted	cash	flows.	Where	management	assesses	that	a	claim	will	be	settled	through	a	lump	sum	payment,	the	liability	is	
calculated	with	reference	to	the	Ogden	rate	which	is	used	by	the	courts	when	calculating	lump	sum	settlements.	The	rate,	as	
currently	effective,	is	minus	0.75%,	which	has	been	used	to	calculate	the	Group’s	claims	liabilities.
The	following	table	sets	out	the	impact	on	profit	after	tax	and	total	equity	that	would	result	from	an	increase	in	the	Ogden	rate	
to	0.0%,	or	a	reduction	down	to	minus	1.5%:
Impact	of	Ogden	rate	being	revised	to: 0.0% (1.5%)
Impact	on	profit	after	tax	and	total	equity	(£m) 4.5 (7.2)
Short	tail	claims	are	normally	reported	soon	after	the	incident	and	are	generally	settled	within	the	months	following	the	
reported	incident.	Hence	any	development	on	short	tail	claims	is	normally	limited	to	the	period	in	which	the	incident	occurred	
and	the	following	period.	For	long	tail	claims	it	can	be	more	than	one	period	before	a	claim	is	reported	and	several	periods	
before	it	is	settled,	hence	the	original	estimation	involves	greater	uncertainty	and	it	is	inherently	more	likely	that	there	will	
be	a	greater	disparity	between	the	original	and	current	estimates.	It	is	for	these	long	tail	claims	that	the	development	of	the	
outstanding claims liability generally occurs over a number of periods.
The	development	of	claims	from	prior	periods	is	set	out	in	Note	21.	Given	the	uncertainty	in	establishing	the	outstanding	claims	
liabilities,	it	is	likely	that	the	final	outcome	will	be	different	from	the	original	liability	established.

Reinsurance assets
The	Group	uses	both	non	proportional	excess	of	loss	reinsurance	and	quota	share	reinsurance	arrangements.	The	calculation	
of	reinsurance	recoveries	is	intrinsically	linked	to	the	calculation	of	outstanding	claims	liabilities,	and	requires	the	same	estimations	
and	judgements,	as	reinsurance	assets	are	recognised	to	the	extent	that	the	Group	can	recover	the	cost	of	a	claim.
Further	judgement	is	required	in	respect	of	the	recoverability	of	such	assets,	particularly	the	longer	term	assets	arising	from	
larger	claims	and	PPOs.	Management	review	the	recoverability	of	reinsurance	assets	on	a	regular	basis	to	determine	whether	
any provision is required.
When	recognising	a	reinsurance	asset,	the	Group	reviews	the	level	of	coverage	provided	by	the	reinsurer,	to	ensure	that	the	
recognition	is	appropriate,	as	well	as	the	credit	rating	of	the	counterparty.
4. Insurance contracts risk management
A	key	risk	from	operating	in	the	general	insurance	industry	is	the	exposure	to	insurance	risk	arising	from	underwriting	insurance	
contracts.	Insurance	contracts	transfer	risk	to	the	insurer	by	indemnifying	the	customers	against	adverse	effects	arising	
from	the	occurrence	of	specified	uncertain	future	events.	The	risk	is	that	the	actual	amount	of	claims	to	be	paid	in	relation	to	
contracts	will	be	different	from	the	amount	estimated	at	the	time	the	contract	was	designed	and	priced,	which	is	before	the	
losses	relating	to	it	are	known.	Hence	the	insurance	business	involves	inherent	uncertainty.	
A	fundamental	part	of	the	Group’s	overall	risk	management	strategy	is	the	effective	governance	and	management	of	risks	that	
impact	the	amount,	timing	and	uncertainty	of	cash	flows	arising	from	insurance	contracts.
Risk management objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk
A	disciplined	approach	to	risk	management	is	adopted	in	accordance	with	strict	protocols.	It	is	believed	that	this	approach	
provides	the	greatest	long	term	likelihood	of	being	able	to	meet	the	objectives	of	all	stakeholders,	including	customers,	lenders	
and	shareholders.	The	risk	management	activities	can	be	broadly	separated	into	underwriting	(acceptance	and	pricing	of	risk),	
reinsurance,	claims	management	and	investment	management.	The	objective	of	these	risk	management	functions	is	to	enhance	
the	longer	term	financial	performance	of	the	overall	insurance	operations.
Acceptance of risk
The	Board	of	Directors	of	the	Group’s	Underwriting	subsidiary,	Advantage	Insurance	Company	Limited	(AICL)	approves	the	
underwriting	and	pricing	policy,	and	reviews	and	monitors	the	underwriting	and	pricing	standards	and	strategies.	The	Group’s	
underwriting	strategy	is	focused	on	a	sophisticated	data	driven	approach	to	pricing	and	underwriting	through:
 • collating and analysing comprehensive data from customers;
 • tight	control	over	the	pricing	guidelines	in	order	to	target	profitable	business	lines;	and
 • fast	and	flexible	response	to	market	trends.
The	underwriting	of	large	numbers	of	uncorrelated	individual	risks	reduces	the	variability	in	overall	claims	experience.	
Management	information	systems	are	maintained	that	provide	up	to	date,	reliable	data	on	the	risks	to	which	the	business	
is	exposed	at	any	point	in	time.	Efforts	are	made,	including	by	the	use	of	plain	language	policy	terms,	to	ensure	there	is	no	
misalignment	between	what	customers	perceive	will	be	paid	when	a	policy	is	initially	entered	and	what	is	actually	paid	when	
a claim	is	made.

Risk management objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk continued
Pricing
Statistical	models	are	used	which	combine	historical	and	projected	data	to	calculate	premiums	and	monitor	claims	patterns.	
The	data	used	includes	historical	pricing	and	claims	analysis	as	well	as	current	conditions	and	developments	in	the	market.
All	data	used	is	subject	to	rigorous	verification	and	reconciliation	processes.
Claims management
Initial	claim	determination	is	managed	by	claims	handlers	with	the	requisite	degree	of	experience	and	competence	with	the	
assistance	of,	where	appropriate,	a	loss	adjuster	or	other	party	with	specialist	knowledge.	
It	is	the	Group’s	policy	to	respond	to	and	settle	claims	quickly	whenever	possible	and	to	pay	claims	fairly,	based	on	customers’	
full	entitlement	in	line	with	consumer	and	regulator	expectations.	
When	PPOs	are	awarded	as	a	result	of	claims	made	under	insurance	contracts,	there	is	a	risk	that	these	may	be	of	a	high	value	
and	for	a	long	term.	As	such,	management	performs	detailed	reviews	of	expected	PPOs	throughout	the	claims	process	to	
identify	the	expected	ultimate	value	of	such	claims	as	early	as	possible	and	reserve	appropriately.	
Reinsurance contracts
Reinsurance	contracts	are	used	both	to	limit	exposure	to	claims	pervasively	across	the	business,	and	specifically	to	limit	
exposure	to	large	single	claims	and	the	accumulation	of	claims	that	arise	from	the	same	event	or	the	accumulation	of	
similar events.	
The	Group	uses	excess	of	loss	reinsurance	arrangements	and	the	effect	of	such	arrangements	is	that	the	Group	should	not	
suffer	net	motor	insurance	losses	(before	quota	share	arrangements)	in	excess	of	£0.5m	on	any	individual	loss	event	between	
1	January	2003	and	31	December	2014	(subject	to	an	aggregate	deductible	of	£5.0m	in	2014),	and	in	excess	of	£1.0m	on	any	
individual	loss	event	from	1	January	2015	onwards.
Additionally,	the	Group	has	a	50%	quota	share	arrangement	in	place,	applicable	on	all	motor	insurance	policies	incepted	by	AICL	
since	1	January	2011.	
The	Group	also	uses	excess	of	loss	reinsurance	arrangements	for	home	insurance	policies,	the	effect	of	which	is	that	the	Group	
does	not	suffer	total	net	home	insurance	losses	of	more	than	£0.5m	on	any	individual	event	as	of	1	January	2016	(2016:	£0.5m)	
up	to	a	cap	of	£9.3m	liability	per	event	(2016:	£9.3m).
The	use	of	reinsurance	contracts	does	not	discharge	the	AICL’s	liability	as	primary	insurer.	If	a	reinsurer	fails	to	pay	a	claim,	AICL	
remains	liable	for	the	payment	to	the	policyholder.	As	part	of	managing	reinsurance	contract	risk	and	controlling	exposure	
to	reinsurance	counterparty	default,	the	creditworthiness	of	reinsurers	is	considered	on	a	quarterly	basis	by	reviewing	their	
financial	strength.	In	addition,	management	assesses	the	creditworthiness	of	all	reinsurers	and	intermediaries	by	reviewing	
credit	grades	provided	by	rating	agencies	and	other	publicly	available	financial	information.	The	recent	payment	history	of	
reinsurers	is	also	used	to	update	the	reinsurance	purchasing	strategy.	The	credit	ratings	of	the	Group’s	reinsurers	are	disclosed	
in	Note	25.
Investment management
Assets	and	liabilities	are	managed	so	as	to	effectively	match	the	expected	pattern	of	claims	payments	with	the	assets	that	are	
held	to	back	outstanding	claims	liabilities.	The	mix	of	investment	between	cash	and	cash	equivalents	and	marketable	securities	
is	managed	to	ensure	that	the	Group	has	the	ability	to	meet	expected	and	unexpected	requirements	for	cash.	See	Note	25	for	
further details.
Terms and conditions of insurance contracts
The	terms	and	conditions	attached	to	insurance	contracts	affect	the	level	of	insurance	risk	accepted.	Insurance	contracts	
written	are	entered	into	on	a	standard	form	basis.	Insurance	contracts	are	entered	into	on	an	annual	basis	and	at	the	time	
of	entering	into	a	contract	certain	terms	and	conditions	are	negotiable	or,	in	the	case	of	renewals,	renegotiable.	There	are	no	
embedded derivatives that are separately recognised from a host insurance contract. 
Concentrations of insurance risk
The	exposure	to	concentrations	of	insurance	risk	is	mitigated	by	a	portfolio	which	is	diversified	across	many	different	individual	
customers	living	in	different	parts	of	the	UK.	Therefore,	the	Directors	do	not	believe	there	are	significant	concentrations	of	
insurance	risk.

Segments
The	Group	has	two	reportable	trading	segments	and	a	corporate	head	office,	as	described	below.	These	segments	represent	
the	principal	split	of	business	that	is	regularly	reported	to	the	Group’s	Board.	
Underwriting
The	Underwriting	segment	comprises	the	Underwriting	business	which	is	based	in	Gibraltar.	It	includes	AICL	and	its	investment	
in	Conquest	House	Limited.	The	principal	activity	of	AICL	is	the	underwriting	of	general	insurance,	predominantly	private	car	
insurance	in	the	UK.	Since	2015,	AICL	has	underwritten	UK	home	policies	under	a	co-insurance	arrangement	both	as	secondary	
insurer,	and	from	2017	as	lead	insurer.	Conquest	House	Limited	owns	property	which	is	utilised	by	the	Group.	
Retail
The	principal	activity	of	the	Retail	segment	is	the	provision	of	insurance	intermediary	services	to	the	private	car,	van,	bike	
and	home	markets	in	the	UK	through	the	UK	trading	subsidiary	Hastings	Insurance	Services	Limited	(HISL),	much	of	which	
is	underwritten	by	the	Underwriting	segment.	Intermediary	services	are	also	provided	on	behalf	of	a	panel	of	external	third	
party insurers.	
Corporate
The	Corporate	segment	comprises	the	combined	results	of	the	Group’s	head	office	companies,	whose	primary	activities	are	 
as	holding	and	finance	companies.
Consolidation adjustments

elimination	of	intercompany	balances,	revenue	between	operating	segments	and	investments	in	subsidiaries.	Transactions	
between	the	Group’s	two	reportable	segments	and	corporate	head	office	are	recognised	in	accordance	with	the	Group’s	
accounting	policies	and	are	carried	out	at	arm’s	length.
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted	operating	profit,	is	a	non-IFRS	measure	used	by	management	and	represents	profit	before	taxation	expense,	finance	
costs,	amortisation	and	depreciation	and	non-trading	costs.

The	Gibraltar	rate	of	tax	has	remained	at	10%	and	is	expected	to	remain	at	this	level	for	the	foreseeable	future.

For	the	year	ended	31	December	2017	the	UK	Corporation	tax	rate	applicable	to	the	Company	was	19.25%	(2016:	20%).
Within	the	tax	reconciliation,	the	impact	of	the	different	tax	rate	in	Gibraltar	is	the	difference	between	the	UK	tax	rate	and	the	
Gibraltar	tax	rate	applied	to	the	Underwriting	business’	profits.	
Non-taxable	income	comprises	investment	income	arising	within	the	Underwriting	business	in	Gibraltar.
Expenses	and	provisions	not	deductible	for	tax	purposes	comprises	disallowed	expenditure	such	as	business	entertainment	
expenses	and	certain	expenditure	deemed	capital	under	tax	legislation.
On	19	January	2018,	the	Group	received	the	outcome	of	the	First-tier	Tribunal	proceedings	held	in	November	2016,	which	
were	brought	by	HISL	as	to	whether	insurance	intermediary	supplies	provided	by	HISL	and	received	by	AICL	should	be	treated	
as	outside	the	scope	of	VAT.	The	First-tier	Tribunal	has	found	in	favour	of	HISL	and	concluded	that	the	VAT	incurred	by	HISL	in	
relation	to	insurance	intermediary	supplies	provided	to	AICL	can	be	recovered.		As	the	contested	amount	of	VAT	had	already	
been	paid,	this	has	resulted	in	a	VAT	refund	becoming	due	to	HISL	from	HMRC	of	£10.3m	in	respect	of	the	seven	years	ended	
31	December	2015.	HISL	is	also	in	the	process	of	submitting	a	revision	to	the	VAT	returns	submitted	for	the	years	ended	31	
December	2016	and	31	December	2017	in	line	with	this	ruling,	which	is	expected	to	result	in	an	additional	refund	becoming	due.	
HMRC	have	56	days	from	19	January	2018	within	which	they	may	lodge	an	appeal	at	the	Upper	Tribunal	and	raise	protective	
assessments	in	respect	of	the	VAT	to	be	refunded.	The	timing	and	quantum	of	the	final	amount	of	VAT	recoverable	is	therefore	
subject	to	the	result	of	any	appeal	lodged	at	the	Upper	Tribunal	and	HMRC	review	of	any	VAT	protective	assessments	that	have	
been	raised.	No	amount	recoverable	has	been	recognised	in	the	Group’s	results	as	at	31	December	2017.

of	any	ongoing	enquiries	or	reviews	and	based	on	guidance	from	professional	firms.	The	final	amounts	paid	may	differ	from	the	
amounts	provided	depending	on	the	ultimate	resolution	of	such	matters,	and	any	changes	to	estimates	or	amounts	payable	in	
respect	of	prior	periods	are	reported	through	adjustments	relating	to	prior	periods.
16. Earnings per share
Basic	earnings	per	share	is	calculated	by	dividing	the	profit	attributable	to	the	equity	holders	of	the	parent	by	the	weighted	
average	number	of	Ordinary	Shares	in	issue	during	the	period.
Adjusted	earnings	per	share	is	a	non-IFRS	measure	calculated	by	dividing	net	income	attributable	to	the	equity	holders	of	the	
parent	by	the	weighted	average	number	of	Ordinary	Shares	in	issue	during	the	period.	Net	income	is	profit	after	tax	adjusted	for	
non-trading	items	including	reorganisation	and	transaction	costs,	the	impact	of	accounting	for	business	combinations	and	the	
related	tax	effect.	The	Directors	believe	this	figure	provides	a	better	indication	of	the	Group’s	trading	performance.
Diluted	earnings	per	share	and	adjusted	diluted	earnings	per	share	are	calculated	respectively	by	dividing	the	profit	attributable	
to	the	equity	holders	of	the	parent,	and	the	net	income	attributable	to	the	equity	holders	of	the	parent,	by	the	weighted	average	
number	of	Ordinary	Shares	in	issue	during	the	year	adjusted	for	the	dilutive	impact	of	unvested	shares	and	contingently	
issuable shares arising from the share based payment arrangements.

The	goodwill	of	£470.0m	arose	from	the	acquisition	of	Hastings	Insurance	Group	Limited	(HIG)	by	Hastings	Insurance	Group	
(Holdings)	plc	(HIG(H))	on	8	January	2014	and	was	allocated	between	the	Group’s	two	CGUs,	Underwriting	and	Retail,	as	follows:

Total

As	at	31	December	2016	and	31	December	2017 374.8 95.2 470.0
The	recoverable	amount	of	the	two	CGUs	has	been	determined	based	on	value	in	use	calculations.	These	calculations	use	
pre-tax	cash	flow	projections	based	on	the	most	recent	three	year	financial	plans	approved	by	the	Directors,	discounted	by	the	
Group’s	pre-tax	discount	rate	of	6.9%	(2016:	8.0%).	The	Directors	determine	financial	budgets	based	on	past	performance	and	
their	expectations	of	market	and	business	development.
Cash	flows	beyond	the	three	year	plan	period	are	extrapolated	using	growth	rates	declining	to	a	terminal	rate	of	2.0%.	As	the	
recoverable	amount	of	each	CGU	is	significantly	higher	than	the	cumulative	total	of	allocated	goodwill	and	the	carrying	value	of	
the	CGU’s	assets,	the	allocated	goodwill	is	not	deemed	to	be	impaired.

and	more	up	to	date	information	that	has	become	available	and	to	reflect	changes	in	inflation.	
The development is presented for each of the most recent seven accident periods and all historic periods prior to these from 
incorporation	of	the	Group’s	underwriter	in	2002	as	estimated	at	each	reporting	date.	The	table	also	shows	a	reconciliation	of

The	information	is	presented	on	an	accident	period	basis.	The	fair	value	acquisition	adjustment	relates	to	business	combination	
accounting	as	a	result	of	the	Goldman	Sachs	investment	(described	in	Note	11).

Investment	funds	comprise	funds	with	investments	in	debt	securities,	equities,	derivatives	and	cash	and	cash	equivalents.	 
The	Group’s	investment	in	available	for	sale	financial	assets	mainly	comprises	of	fixed	income	debt	securities.
Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial risks
The	Group	is	exposed	to	financial	risk	through	its	financial	assets	and	liabilities.	The	most	important	components	of	financial	
risk	for	the	Group	are	credit	risk,	market	risk	and	liquidity	risk.	
Credit risk
Credit	risk	is	the	risk	that	a	counterparty	will	be	unable	to	pay	amounts	in	full	as	they	fall	due.	The	Group	is	exposed	to	credit	risk	
through	reinsurance	assets,	financial	assets	and	cash	and	cash	equivalents.
The	Group	manages	its	exposure	to	credit	risk	on	high	liquidity	investments	by	pursuing	a	strategy	whereby	all	investments	
in	money	market	funds	have	credit	ratings	of	AA	or	above.	The	credit	ratings	of	the	Group’s	banks	are	monitored	on	a	regular	
basis	and,	where	there	is	adverse	movement,	appropriate	action	would	be	determined	by	the	Board’s	Risk	Committee.
Investment	funds	and	debt	securities	are	assessed	by	management	to	ensure	that	the	level	of	credit	risk	is	acceptable,	credit	
ratings	are	sufficiently	strong	and	the	investment	is	in	line	with	the	Group’s	investment	policy.	
The	Standard	&	Poor’s	or	equivalent	credit	ratings	of	the	underlying	assets	within	investment	funds,	debt	security	counterparty	
and	banks	with	which	the	Group	has	significant	credit	risk,	in	relation	to	its	investments	in	cash	and	cash	equivalents	and

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 25. Financial instruments, capital management and related disclosures continued
Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial risks continued
Credit risk continued
The	Group	has	investment	guidelines	that	restrict	the	amount	of	the	investment	portfolio	that	can	be	placed	with	a	single	
counterparty.
The	Group’s	maximum	exposure	to	credit	risk	at	31	December	2017	is	the	carrying	value	of	financial	assets	at	fair	value	and	at	
amortised	cost,	reinsurance	assets	and	cash	and	cash	equivalents.	
The	Group’s	insurance	receivables	are	an	aggregation	of	small	receivables	and	the	Group	uses	multiple	reinsurance	providers	
to	ensure	that	there	are	no	significant	concentrations	of	credit	risk.	Insurance	receivables	are	monitored	closely	with	a	view	to	
minimising	the	collection	period	of	those	items.	Since	other	assets	such	as	cash	and	cash	equivalents	and	financial	assets	at	fair	
value	are	well	diversified,	the	Directors	believe	that	the	Group	does	not	hold	any	significant	concentrations	of	risk.
Market risk
The	only	significant	market	risk	to	which	the	Group	is	exposed	to	is	interest	rate	risk.
Interest	rate	risk	is	defined	by	the	Group	as	the	impact	of	unfavourable	movements	in	market	interest	rates	which	could	
adversely	affect	the	values	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities,	or	reduce	future	cash	flows	arising	from	them.	
Cash	and	cash	equivalents	are	held	in	current	accounts	or	in	short	term	money	market	instruments.	These	are	generally	less	
than	60	days	in	duration,	considerably	reducing	sensitivity	to	significant	movements	in	interest	rates	compared	to	longer	
duration	assets.	The	Directors	consider	that	the	exposure	to	interest	rate	risk	of	cash	and	cash	equivalents	balances	is	
immaterial for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.
The	carrying	values	of	the	Group’s	financial	assets	at	fair	value	are	more	susceptible	to	movements	in	interest	rates.	Loans	and	
borrowings	are	also	exposed	to	movements	in	interest	rates,	incurring	interest	at	rates	pegged	to	LIBOR.	The	Group	does	not	
use	derivatives	or	similar	instruments	to	mitigate	exposure.
A	1%	increase	in	interest	rates	would	have	the	below	impact	on	profit	after	tax	and	equity:
As	at
31 December
2017
£m
31	December
2016
£m
Equity (12.4) (9.1)
Profit	after	tax (1.6) (1.8)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity	risk	is	the	risk	that	cash	may	not	be	available	to	meet	obligations	as	they	fall	due.	The	Group	maintains	significant	
holdings	in	liquid	funds	to	mitigate	this	risk.	The	Group	makes	use	of	regular	forecasts	to	monitor	and	control	its	cash	flow	and	
working	capital	requirements.
Financial	liabilities	are	settled	in	line	with	agreed	payment	terms	and	managed	in	accordance	with	cash	availability	and	inflow	
expectations.	All	financial	liabilities	except	loans	and	borrowings	and	an	amount	due	to	a	reinsurer	within	insurance	and	other	
payables	(see	Note	27)	are	due	within	12	months.	Loans	and	borrowings	are	due	for	repayment	in	2021.
The	assets	backing	insurance	contracts	and	other	short-term	liabilities	held	by	the	Group	are	considered	to	be	more	liquid	than	
the	related	liabilities,	and	the	Group	is	in	a	net	current	asset	position.

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital
The	Group’s	capital	is	made	up	of	total	equity	of	£612.9m	(2016:	£553.6m)	and	loans	and	borrowings	of	£272.0m	(2016:	
£286.6m).	The	Group’s	dividend	policy	seeks	to	redistribute	excess	capital	to	shareholders,	where	such	capital	is	surplus	and	
not	being	used	for	growth,	to	meet	regulatory	requirements,	or	to	reduce	borrowing.	The	Group	monitors	and	reviews	the	
capital	position	of	its	two	regulated	trading	subsidiaries,	HISL	and	AICL,	which	are	independently	managed	and	required	to	
comply	with	their	respective	external	regulatory	capital	requirements.
AICL’s	objectives	for	managing	capital	are	to	comply	with	the	Solvency	II	capital	requirements;	to	safeguard	its	ability	to	continue	
as	a	going	concern;	and	to	provide	an	adequate	return	by	pricing	insurance	contracts	commensurately	with	the	level	of	risk.	
AICL,	as	an	insurance	company,	is	subject	to	the	provisions	of	the	Solvency	II	regulations	set	by	the	European	Insurance	and	
Occupational	Pensions	Authority	and	implemented	by	the	Gibraltar	Financial	Services	Commission.	AICL	seeks	to	maintain	a	
prudent	threshold	above	the	Solvency	II	minimum	capital	requirement	at	all	times	and	has	maintained	its	capital	above	the	
minimum capital requirement throughout the year. 
HISL,	as	an	insurance	intermediary	in	the	UK,	is	also	subject	to	a	minimum	capital	requirement	under	Financial	Conduct	
Authority	rules;	it	exceeded	that	minimum	capital	requirement	at	all	times	during	the	year.	HISL	regularly	reviews	and	monitors	
its	capital	position	and	seeks	to	maintain	a	prudent	threshold	above	the	minimum	capital	requirement	at	all	times.

Merger reserve
During	2015,	the	Company	acquired	the	entire	issued	share	capital	of	Hastings	Insurance	Group	(Holdings)	plc	(HIG(H)),	the	
ultimate	parent	company	of	AICL	and	HISL.	Both	the	Company	and	HIG(H)	were	under	common	control	before	and	after	the	
reorganisation	and,	as	a	consequence,	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	have	been	prepared	under	the	principles	of	
predecessor	accounting.	Under	this	method,	the	difference	on	consolidation	between	consideration	paid	and	the	book	value	of	
the	underlying	net	assets	acquired	on	the	date	of	the	reorganisation	is	included	within	the	merger	reserve	in	the	Consolidated	
Financial	Statements.	
Other reserves
Unrealised	fair	value	movements	on	available	for	sale	financial	assets	(Note	25)	and	property	held	at	revalued	amounts	
(Note 19)	are	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	and	accumulated	within	other	reserves.	
Company	shares	acquired	for	the	purposes	of	funding	the	Share	Incentive	Plan	(SIP)	are	recorded	within	other	reserves.	
The	Group	satisfies	the	share	awards	in	the	SIP	as	described	in	Note	29	through	the	acquisition	of	the	Company’s	Ordinary	
Shares	in	the	market.	During	the	three	year	service	period	these	matching	shares	are	held	by	an	employee	benefit	trust	that	
is consolidated	within	these	Consolidated	Financial	Statements.
At	31	December	2017,	the	employee	benefit	trust	held	216,740	shares	(2016:	103,801)	acquired	at	a	cost	of	£0.3m	(2016:	£0.2m).
29. Share based payments  
The	total	charge	for	the	share	based	payments	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	during	2017	was	£4.8m	(2016:	£2.4m)	with	
no impact	on	the	balance	sheet	(2016:	£nil).
Admission awards
On	15	October	2015,	certain	key	management	personnel	were	granted	share	awards	conditional	upon	the	Company	listing	on	
the	London	Stock	Exchange.	The	awards	were	for	a	fixed	value	of	£5.9m,	payable	in	Ordinary	Shares	in	two	tranches,	the	first	
on	31	December	2017	and	the	second	on	31	December	2018.	The	awards	were	subject	to	a	service	condition	that	the	members	
remain	in	employment	by	the	Group	until	vesting	date.
The	awards	are	classified	as	equity	settled	share	based	payments	and	had	a	fair	value	of	£4.9m	at	grant	date.	On	31	December	2017,	
the	first	tranche	of	£	3.0m	vested	and	was	net	settled	by	issue	of	468,469	Ordinary	Shares	of	the	Company	on	16	January	2018.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
Certain	management	personnel	are	eligible	to	participate	in	the	Hastings	Long	Term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP)	giving	them	an	
option	to	acquire	shares	in	the	Company	at	an	exercise	price	of	£nil.	Vesting	is	subject	to	a	three	year	service	period	and	the	
achievement	of	certain	performance	conditions	in	respect	of	total	shareholder	return	and	adjusted	earnings	per	share	over	
a three	year	period.	
During	2017,	4.3m	options	were	granted,	with	a	fair	value	of	£9.8m	(2016:	2.4m	options	with	a	fair	value	of	£3.4m).

Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 1. Basis of preparation
Hastings	Group	Holdings	plc	(the	Company,	HGH),	was	incorporated	on	11	June	2015.	The	principal	activity	of	the	Company	
is that	of	a	holding	company	and	its	registered	office	and	principal	place	of	business	is	at	Conquest	House,	Collington	Avenue,	
Bexhill-on-Sea,	TN39	3LW,	United	Kingdom.	The	Company’s	registered	number	is	09635183.
The	Financial	Statements	comprise	the	results	of	the	Company	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2017	and	comparative	
figures	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2016.	The	Company	made	a	profit	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2017	of	£68.5m	
(2016: £31.8m)	and	has	elected	not	to	present	a	Parent	Company	Statement	of	Profit	or	Loss	as	permitted	by	section	408	of	
the Companies	Act	2006.	
The	Parent	Company	Financial	Statements	have	been	prepared	and	approved	by	the	Directors	in	accordance	with	the	
Companies	Act	2006	and	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	as	adopted	by	the	EU	(IFRS)	that	are	in	effect	as	at	31	
December	2017.	IFRS	comprise	standards	and	interpretations	approved	by	the	International	Accounting	Standards	Board	and	
the	International	Financial	Reporting	Interpretations	Committee.
The	accounting	policies	used	in	the	preparation	of	these	separate	Financial	Statements	are	consistent	with	the	accounting	
policies	used	in	the	preparation	of	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	of	Hastings	Group	Holdings	plc.
Going concern
Having	considered	the	financial	performance	and	financial	position	of	the	Company,	its	cash	flows	and	the	dividend	capacity	of	
its	trading	subsidiaries	over	the	next	12	months,	the	Directors	have	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Company	has	adequate	
resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future.	Accordingly,	they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	
basis	in	preparing	the	Parent	Company	Financial	Statements.
Basis of measurement
The	functional	currency	is	Pounds	Sterling	and	the	Financial	Statements	are	presented	in	Pounds	Sterling.	Amounts	are	
rounded	to	the	nearest	million	with	one	decimal	place	(e.g.	£0.1m)	except	where	otherwise	indicated.
The	Financial	Statements	are	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	basis.
Application of IFRS
The	accounting	policies	developed	in	accordance	with	the	standards	effective	under	IFRS	as	at	31	December	2017,	have	been	
applied	consistently	to	these	Financial	Statements.	
2. Accounting policies
Employee benefits
The	Company	operates	a	defined	contribution	pension	scheme.	The	amount	charged	to	profit	or	loss	in	respect	of	pension	
costs	is	the	amount	of	contributions	payable	in	the	year.	Differences	between	contributions	payable	in	the	year	and	
contributions	actually	paid	are	shown	as	either	accruals	or	prepayments	in	the	Parent	Company	Balance	Sheet.	The	Company	
has	no	legal	or	constructive	obligation	to	make	any	payments	to	the	scheme	other	than	the	contributions	due.
Share based payments
The	Company	operates	share	based	payment	schemes	under	which	participants	may	receive	free	share	awards	or	nil	cost	
options,	depending	on	the	scheme.	Awards	may	have	service	and	performance	conditions	attached.
The	fair	value	of	a	share	based	payment	award	is	determined	at	grant	date	and	expensed	on	a	straight	line	basis	over	the	
vesting	period.	Expected	vesting	in	respect	of	service	and	non-market	performance	conditions	is	reviewed	annually	and	
adjustments	are	made	retrospectively	to	the	cumulative	expense.	
The	expense	for	employees	of	the	Company	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	with	a	corresponding	amount	recognised	within	
equity.	Where	shares	are	awarded	to	subsidiary	employees,	this	results	in	an	increase	in	the	cost	of	investment	in	the	subsidiary,	
with	a	corresponding	amount	recognised	within	equity.

Annual Report 2017 Hastings Group Holdings plc 2. Accounting policies continued
Investment in subsidiary
The	investment	in	subsidiary	is	reported	in	the	Parent	Company	Balance	Sheet	at	cost	less	any	impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
The	Company’s	cash	and	cash	equivalents	consist	of	cash	at	bank	and	in	hand,	investments	in	highly	liquid	money	market	funds	
and	other	short	term	deposits	that	are	redeemable	within	90	days.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities comprise intercompany payables and other payables. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value 
less	any	directly	attributable	transaction	costs.	Subsequently,	financial	liabilities	are	measured	at	amortised	cost	using	the	
effective	interest	method.
Share capital
Shares	are	classified	as	equity	when	there	is	no	obligation	to	transfer	cash	or	other	financial	assets,	or	to	exchange	financial	
assets	or	liabilities	under	potentially	unfavourable	conditions.	Incremental	costs	directly	attributable	to	the	issue	of	equity	
instruments	are	recognised	as	a	deduction	from	share	premium	to	the	extent	that	there	is	sufficient	share	premium	to	do	so,	
net	of	tax	effects.
Dividends
Dividends	are	recognised	directly	in	equity	when	approved	and	payable.

Combined operating ratio reconciliation
The	following	tables	reconcile	the	Group’s	profit	before	tax	to	the	net	underwriting	margin	used	to	calculate	the	combined	
operating	ratio	and	its	two	component	measures:	expense	ratio	and	loss	ratio.	The	combined	operating	ratio	is	the	primary	
indicator	used	to	measure	overall	performance	of	the	Underwriting	business	and	shows	the	amount	of	each	premium	spent	on	
either	indemnity	costs	(the	loss	ratio)	or	underwriting	operating	expenses	(the	expense	ratio).	The	combined	operating	ratio	is
