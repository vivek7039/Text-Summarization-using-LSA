We delivered a strong set  
of results this year and took 
important steps towards 
achieving our strategic objectives. 
We reached record production 
levels across several of our 
businesses and I am confident of 
continued successful ramp ups 
from our world-class assets.  
An important milestone for us this 
year was the completion of the 
merger of Vedanta Limited and 
Cairn India, and our simplified 
group structure will support 
strong shareholder returns. We 
remain committed to a consistent 
strategy and de-levering the 
balance sheet, and look ahead to 
FY2018 in a stronger financial 
position and with more 
confidence than ever .

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
ANIL AGARWAL
PRICES IN COPPER, ALUMINIUM, ZINC, IRON ORE, OIL 
AND GAS HA VE ALL SHOWN A STRONG RECOVERY 
LAST YEAR, SO WE APPROACH FY2018 WITH A 
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AND A CONTINUING DISCIPLINE 
IN OUR CAPIT AL ALLOCA TION.
TRUST
We actively foster a culture of mutual trust 
in our interactions with our stakeholders 
and encourage an open dialogue which 
ensures mutual respect.
INTEGRITY
We place utmost importance on engaging 
ethically and transparently with all our 
stakeholders, taking accountability of our 
actions to maintain the highest standards 
of professionalism and complying with 
international policies and procedures.
EXCELLENCE
Our primary focus is delivering value of the 
highest standard to our stakeholders. We 
are constantly motivated by improving our 
costs and our quality of production in each 
of our business through a culture of best 
practice benchmarking.
CARE
As we continue to grow, we are  
committed to the triple bottom line of 
People, Planet and Prosperity, to create 
a sustainable future in a zero harm 
environment for our communities.
RESPECT
We lay consistent emphasis on human 
rights, respect the principle of free,  
prior, informed consent, while our 
engagements with stakeholders give  
local communities the opportunity to  
voice their opinions and concerns.
INNOVATION
We embrace a conducive environment for 
encouraging innovation that leads to a zero 
harm environment and exemplifying optimal 
utilsation of natural resources, improved 
efficiencies and recoveries of by-products.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
At Vedanta, our people are our most 
important assets. We actively encourage 
their development and support them in 
pursuing their goals.
OUR CORE VALUES
For more information 
see pages 60-61
After FY2016, where we showed our 
resilience in the face of a challenging 
economic climate, it is a pleasure to 
report that FY2017 was about price 
recovery and exciting potential. 
Three key characteristics of Vedanta 
emerged from the year. 
First, we are stronger. Having weathered 
the prior year’s market downturn, we 
have continued to build on our status 
as a low-cost, diversified producer. 
During FY2017 we also delivered our 
promised merger of Cairn India Limited 
(Cairn India) and Vedanta Limited, 
simplifying the Group structure. This 
is a significant step forward towards 
achieving our stated long-term vision 
of alignment of interests between all 
shareholders for the creation of long-
term sustainable value. We continued 
to strengthen our financial position, 
through our focus on deleveraging 
our balance sheet and extending 
maturity commitments. We have also 
enjoyed the upturn in the market, with 
the strong zinc and aluminium prices 
playing to our particular strengths.
Second, we are working smarter. 
In a country focused on technology 
and digitalisation we are acquiring 
best-in-class technology for our 
assets, and focusing on creating our 
own. During the year, we initiated a 
US$30 million investment fund for 
in-house R&D, supporting our wealth 
of knowledge and spirit of innovation 
with meaningful resources. We are 
also actively incentivising our people 
to contribute their own ideas. 
Third, we continue to operate 
sustainably, focusing on creating value 
and opportunity for all our stakeholders: 
employees, communities, investors 
and the countries we operate in. This is 
coupled with a firm aim to achieve ‘zero 
harm, zero waste and zero discharge’. 
We are determined to mine safely and 
sensitively, minimising our environmental 
impact and being receptive to 
the needs of the local people.  07
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We are in the business of producing 
commodities and supplying energy that 
make lives and economies better, from 
the essentials for creating infrastructure, 
to the basic needs of transportation and 
power and the material requirements 
of manufacturing consumer goods. 
We are also excellently located: 
Vedanta operates primarily in India and 
Africa, countries that are endowed 
with an abundant supply of natural 
resources, and have growing economies 
waiting to make good use of them. 
As an efficient and experienced natural 
resources player, we offer investors an 
opportunity to take part in the 
extraordinary growth story of India as it 
seeks to improve its infrastructure, 
house its growing population and 
develop its manufacturing base. 
HOW WE PERFORMED 
With a strong operational performance 
and a supportive market environment, 
we were able to deliver encouraging 
numbers for FY2017 . 
Revenues rose to US$11 .5 billion with 
EBITDA at US$3.2 billion. EBITDA margin
 
(excluding custom smelting at Zinc India 
and Copper) was 36% and we delivered 
strong free cash flow of US$1 .5 billion. 
This led the Board to recommend a final 
dividend of 35 US cents per share. 
I was pleased that we were able to 
ramp up our production, despite some 
operational issues at the Aluminium 
and Power businesses and the Konkola 
Copper Mines (KCM). We were also 
successful in controlling costs at 
the majority of our businesses. 
I also deeply regret that the year saw 
seven fatalities in the course of our 
operations. There are no circumstances 
in which this is acceptable, and I am 
personally committed to eradicating 
such incidents.
INDIA 
Vedanta sits at the heart of the fastest-
growing economy in the world, and 
around 58% of our revenues are derived 
from our operations in the country. 
India is an exciting place to be. 
Prime Minister Modi’s government 
is spearheading huge changes in the 
business environment, and in turn this 
is making India a prime destination 
for investment. India attracted record 
foreign direct investment of more 
than US$45 billion
1
 in CY2016, and the 
country looks increasingly attractive to 
manufacturers and digital industries. 
The 'Make in India' government 
campaign to encourage national and 
multi-national companies to manufacture 
their products in India, is driving an 
exciting agenda of domestic growth. 
We expect to see the GDP growth of 
the nation translating into meaningful 
increases in metals and energy demand. 
1  Source: Department of Industry Policy and Promotion 
February 2017 .
Currently, India only produces 20% of its 
oil and mineral requirements and mining 
represents just 2.4% of GDP and the 
country is spending US$500 billion on 
imports. Y et we have a similar geology to 
Africa and Australia with highly attractive 
prospects for oil, base and precious 
metals, and other minerals. 
We remain a proud corporate citizen 
of India, and in FY2017 we contributed 
US$6 billion to the exchequer and 
supported, directly or indirectly, at 
least 70,000 jobs.

Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
AFRICA
Vedanta enjoys a productive and 
long-standing relationship with 
Africa, and during the year I was 
pleased to accompany India’s Prime 
Minister on a visit to South Africa, 
as part of his business delegation. 
We continue to invest in projects and 
assets in both India and Africa. Our 
zinc project in Gamsberg, South Africa 
is under active construction as we 
prepare to mine one of the world’s 
largest deposits of zinc. Given strong 
zinc market fundamentals, this venture 
looks increasingly well-timed and 
we look forward to production going 
live in 2018. We are also looking at 
extending the life of the successful 
Black Mountain and Skorpion zinc 
mines. This is in sharp contrast to a 
few years ago, when Skorpion was 
being considered for closure. 
In Zambia, although we experienced 
some operational challenges during 
the year, we continue to focus on 
being a leading player in copper. 
We have exciting technical projects 
planned, and are looking at initiatives 
both to ramp up volumes and 
develop captive power generation 
sources over the coming years. 
A COMPANY FOR COMMUNITIES 
For two decades now, Vedanta has 
maintained that financial returns alone 
are not the mark of a good business.  
We also care passionately about 
the well-being of our employees 
and, equally, the local communities 
in which we operate.
I am therefore proud to say that during 
the year, we backed our commitment to 
the communities we operate in with an 
investment of US$18 million towards 
community initiatives. 
A key part of our work in this area is to 
empower women and to give children 
the best possible start in life. As an 
example, Vedanta is participating in 
India’s ‘Nand Ghars’ (also known as 
Anganwadi) programme, helping to 
transform 4,000 state-run child welfare 
centres across the country to support 
women and children by providing the 
education, skills development and 
healthcare they need. 
In total, we support projects 
focused on constructive welfare 
and sustainability, impacting the 
lives of around 2.2 million people.
OUR PEOPLE
Following the difficult market 
environment of the prior year, I want 
to thank all of our employees whose 
energy, talents and commitment 
came to fruition in FY2017 . 
I would also like to thank my fellow 
Directors for their wise counsel and, in 
particular, our CEO Tom Albanese, who 
has been instrumental to Vedanta’s 
performance in his three years in the 
organisation. Tom’s contract came to its 
scheduled end in March, and he decided 
it was an appropriate juncture to make 
the personal decision to re-join his family 
in the US. 
He leaves the Company having made 
a strong impact with his ideas and 
efficiencies starting to show positive 
results. I thank him warmly for the 
successful part he has played in 
our story and we wish him well. 
Tom remains in his position until 
August 2017 and the search for his 
successor is well underway.
As announced earlier in the year, Euan 
Macdonald, Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Sustainability 
Committee, retired from the Board. I 
would like to thank Euan for his huge 
contribution to sustainability at Vedanta, 
including improved safety standards and 
best practices in site closures. Katya 
Zotova, a member of our Sustainability 
Committee, will be leading its priorities 
in the coming year. Further, Edward 
Story has been appointed as a Non-
Executive Director of the Company 
with effect from 1 June 2017 . He will 
also be appointed as a member of 
the Company’s Audit Committee with 
effect from 1 June 2017 . I am delighted 
to welcome him to our Board. His 
background and domain experience in 
the oil & gas industry will significantly 
enhance our ability to grow and 
develop Vedanta’s oil & gas business.
I also welcome Ravi Rajagopal to his 
new roles, both as a Non-Executive 
Director of Vedanta Resources and to 
the Audit and Sustainability Committees. 
He comes with a wealth of experience 
across finance and operational 
roles in a FTSE 100 company.
In line with regulatory guidance, 
Mr Aman Mehta will retire at the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. 
Meanwhile, he has overseen the 
Company’s transition to a new auditor 
for the Group and I would like to 
thank him for his sound guidance 
and commitment over the years. 
On behalf of the entire Board, I would 
also like to thank all our investors, 
communities and the governments 
of the countries in which we operate, 
for their constant support. 
FY2018: OPTIMISM AND DISCIPLINE
I am optimistic that the improvement 
in commodity markets we have 
experienced this year may be with 
us for the foreseeable future. 
Prices in copper, aluminium, 
zinc, iron ore, oil and gas have all 
shown a strong recovery last year, 
so we approach FY2018 with a 
cautious optimism and a continuing 
discipline in our capital allocation.
Meanwhile, we will continue to 
contribute to India’s exciting growth 
trajectory, working with the Indian 
Government, our employees and 
communities to make a difference.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH RATES 
INVESTMENT CASE
Our strategy is focused on delivering sustainable long-term returns to our shareholders. This is demonstrated by our strong 
shareholder returns. We have returned c. $2 billion to shareholders since the IPO in 2003.
LARGE, LOW COST AND  
DIVERSIFIED ASSET BASE
ATTRACTIVE  
COMMODITY MIX
IDEALLY POSITIONED TO 
CAPITALISE ON INDIA’S 
GROWTH POTENTIAL  
A low cost production profile, in the lowest 
quartile at our major assets, enables the 
Company to generate positive free cash flow 
even at low commodity prices.
Our competitive cost base combined with  
our portfolio of large, high quality, diversified 
assets enables us to deliver value throughout 
the commodity cycle. 
Vedanta’s operations cover a range of attractive 
commodities with strong fundamentals and 
this has enabled the Company to deliver strong 
margins through the commodity cycle. This 
year, markets have seen an upturn driven by 
improved demand and supply side constraints, 
which has benefited the commodities sector, 
particularly zinc, and we expect to see a 
continuing upward trend going forward. 
India is Vedanta’s main market and one which  
has huge growth potential. Urbanisation and 
industrialisation supported by government 
initiatives on infrastructure and housing are 
driving economic growth and demand for

STRONG FINANCIAL 
PROFILE
PROVEN TRACK 
RECORD
With a significant amount of our capital 
investment programme completed, we are 
now ramping up and have commenced reaping 
benefits of those investments. We will be able 
to reach our full capacities with only limited 
capex spend and consequently, our cash flows 
are poised for a significant increase. 
Our strong operational and cost performance 
coupled with a strong focus on proactive balance 
sheet management has helped strengthen  
the financial profile. The financial profile is 
supported by:
 ❯ Solid revenues (US$11.5 billion in FY2017) and 
EBITDA performance (US$3.2 billion in FY2017).
 ❯ Strong and growing free cash flow post growth 
capex of US$1.5 billion in FY2017.
 ❯ Our cost saving programme which is currently 
underway, achieving US$814 million to date, 
ahead of our plan to deliver US$1.3 billion by 
FY2019. 
 ❯ Deleveraging and extending debt maturities.
 ❯ Cash and liquid investments of $9.7 billion.
We have a proven management team with a 
diverse and extensive range of sector and 
global experience who ensure that operations 
are run efficiently and responsibly. We have 
taken a disciplined approach to development, 
growing our production steadily with an 
ongoing focus on operational efficiency and 
cost savings. 
Since our listing in 2003, our assets have

This bond issue was well received by 
investors, and attracted strong demand 
from a range of high quality institutional 
shareholders across the US, Asia, 
Europe and the Middle East. 
A simultaneous tender offer enabled 
us to refinance all of our existing 2018

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PRODUCTION GROWTH
As commodity prices improved in FY2017 
and continue to be favourable, we are reaping 
the benefits of the steps we have taken over 
the past few years to increase our resilience 
through the cycle: during the year, we achieved 
record production at Zinc India, Aluminium and 
Copper India, as well as significant ramp up of 
volumes at Aluminium, Power and Iron Ore.
Our focus on optimising costs across our business 
through operational efficiencies has delivered 
savings of US$814 million over two years.
Our successful US$1 billion bond issuance in 
January 2017 was a step towards proactive balance 
sheet management that has reduced our cost 
of debt and extended our debt maturities. Our 
international credit rating has improved to B+ with a 
stable outlook by S&P and B1 with a stable outlook 
by Moody’s from B2 with a negative outlook.
The completion of the Vedanta Limited – Cairn India 
merger at the end of the financial year has helped 
us to simplify our Group structure and will enable 
more flexibility in capital allocation, for the creation 
of long-term sustainable value.
As a result, we are now a stronger company and 
well positioned to benefit from the improving 
market environment across our portfolio of 
diversified low-cost, long-life assets. A disciplined 
ramp up of production across our Zinc, Aluminium, 
Iron Ore and Power businesses is delivering 
significant growth.

INNOVATION AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY
Digitalisation of the mining industry is gaining 
traction and Vedanta is capitalising on India’s leading 
position and expertise in information technology. 
Building on two of our core values of entrepreneurship 
and innovation, during the year we have stepped  
up our efforts to discover and implement new, 
innovative and disruptive technologies through the 
introduction of new systems and incentive 
programmes. 
One example is Eureka, our new digital platform 
to nurture and incubate in-house innovation and 
technology, which is currently being embedded 
throughout the business. It encourages our 
employees to come up with innovative ideas 
focusing on using technology to support mining in 
a sustainable way by reducing waste and improving 
energy efficiency. To date, around 1,000 ideas 
have been submitted and 200 were selected for 
implementation, and these will be rolled out across 
our operations. Quarterly innovation awards reward 
those employees who produce the most innovative 
ideas, providing employees with a further incentive. 
The top three ideas were awarded after evaluation 
by an expert committee comprising of business 
CEOs and senior cross-functional managers.
Our aim is to work smarter, improving the 
sustainability of our operations and optimising 
our costs.

SMARTER: DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS
CASE STUDY
Last year we ran a contest with the 
theme ‘Waste to Value’ on Eureka, 
our new digital platform to create 
and incubate in-house innovation and 
technology. The competition, which 
looked at ways to reduce wastage, 
received over 200 ideas from across 
our businesses, and the top three 
were selected to be further developed 
by an expert committee consisting 
of business CEOs and senior 
management. These are now being 
fast-tracked through the business.  
Eureka is now hosting two new 
contests: ‘Ease of Doing Business 
and Reduce Cycle Time’ which is 
looking at ways of optimising and 
improving processes and technology, 
and ‘Finance 2.0’ targeted at 
crowdsourcing ideas to improve and 
enhance the Finance function. Future 
contests will continue our focus on 
developing innovative technological 
solutions.  Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017

The Gamsberg mine is located in 
the Succulent Karoo Biodiversity 
hotspot area – one of four hotspots 
in South Africa and 35 around the 
world. This area is home to more 
than 6,000 species of plants (40% of 
which are only found here) and also 
hosts 250 birds, 80 mammals and 
32 reptile and amphibian species. 
Throughout the development of the 
mine, we will be taking multiple steps 
to reduce our environmental footprint 
and preserve the biodiversity of the 
area. We are currently implementing 
an Environmental Management 
Programme (EMP) and a Biodiversity 
Management Plan (BMP) to monitor 
and guide the construction phase. These 
programmes are based on the following 
four principles: 
 ❯ avoid sensitive areas; 
 ❯ minimise impacts; 
 ❯ remedy impacts through 
rehabilitation;
 ❯ offset areas to be identified to 
relocate current plant species. 
An International Union for Conservation 
of Nature review panel will monitor our 
progress throughout the process.

CONTRIBUTION TO COMMUNITIES,
EMPLOYEES AND THE ENVIRONMENT
We operate as a responsible business, minimising 
our impacts and promoting social inclusion across 
our operations through our focus on safety, 
environmental protection and community 
engagement. 
Employee safety and achieving zero harm remains 
our number one priority. We deeply regret to report 
seven fatalities at our operations this year. We have 
learnt from these incidents and continue to work 
towards our zero harm strategy. 
We continue to focus on reducing our environmental 
footprint, improving our resource efficiency through 
higher waste water recycling rates, implementing 
biodiversity plans across our operations, including 
the new Gamsberg project, and successfully 
rehabilitating the Lisheen mine in Ireland following 
its closure in 2015. We have also introduced a 
long-term carbon strategy which supports India’s 
approach to managing climate change.
Our aim is to create sustainable value for all our 
stakeholders. To this end, we empower local 
communities and proactively engage them in 
resolving any concerns they have. Where we plan 
new operations we ensure free, prior and informed 
consent of the local communities. We also 
undertake focused CSR activities which create 
positive social impacts.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
TOM ALBANESE
IN FY2017 , VEDANT A DELIVERED A
STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS EACH OF THE
KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND THIS HAS GIVEN
US A GOOD SPRINGBOARD INTO FY2018.
Let me open this report on FY2017 by 
reverting to my statement for the 
previous year. 
In May 2016, we were looking at two 
central themes. First, that Vedanta’s 
low-cost production ethos and focus on 
cash flows positioned us to be highly 
resilient in the face of any prolonged 
downturn in the commodity market. In 
addition, Vedanta was well positioned 
to benefit from any upturn, and that 
we were cautiously optimistic that an 
improvement might come soon. Back to 
today, and I’m pleased to report that the 
market did indeed see a marked upturn, 
and that we made sure we maximised 
the opportunities that came with that 
recovery. In FY2017 , Vedanta delivered a 
strong performance across each of the 
key financial metrics and this has given 
us a good springboard into FY2018. 
THE MARKET: RETURNING TO BALANCE 
We saw an altogether better 
environment for our business in FY2017 . 
The commodities sector benefited 
from a combination of positive global 
economic activity, coupled with a 
progressive tightening of commodity 
supply. This resulted in the World Bank 
Commodities Prices Index for minerals 
and metals showing a healthy increase 
of almost 11%
1
 over the year. But the 
news was better still for Vedanta: the 
commodities that performed best 
were also the ones in which we’re 
particularly strong (zinc and oil). This 
meant that Vedanta outperformed the 
sector generally, registering a significant 
increase. Of these commodities, the 
best performer was zinc. Vedanta is 
particularly well placed here, through 
Zinc India’s low costs, its output as 
the world’s second largest producer, 
and through our ramp up of projects at 
Zinc India and at the Gamsberg mine 
at Zinc International. The net result is 
that Vedanta represents one of the 
best opportunities for investors looking 
to participate in the zinc market. 
When we look at the key demand 
drivers, there was much concern a year 
ago about China. Despite a continuing 
growth rate that was the envy of most 
economies, the debate was whether 
China would go through a hard or soft 
landing. Since then, financial reform and 
fiscal stimulus have made analysts more 
confident of a soft landing trajectory, and 
this has certainly been our view in the 
specific area of metals. 
Equally significant is that the strong 
improvement in the US economy has 
given the sense that, for the first time 
in a long period, there is a positive 
economic outlook globally. This was 
shown by how the market absorbed 
the considerable political and economic 
shocks that came from the elections 
and the markets during the year. 
This augurs well for commodities which, 
for the first time in five years, closed 
the year higher than they were at the 
outset. In addition to the more benign 
global environment, this was due to 
supply-side expansions of the last 10 
years having run their course. This led 
to the emergence of supply pressures 
not seen since 2011 and, in the case of 
zinc, absolute shortages. Indeed, we are 
under no illusions: volatility is a given in 
our sector, and our focus never wavers 
from exerting tight fiscal discipline and 
maintaining a robust balance sheet. 
HIGHLIGHTS
I’m pleased to report progress on a 
range of areas across the business, 
together with various challenges and 
tasks addressed and resolved.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT 
Vedanta is committed to protecting the 
health and safety of our employees 
and stakeholders who might be 
impacted by our operations. We operate 
a policy of ‘zero harm’, so it is with 
deep regret that we recorded seven 
fatalities during the year. Four occurred 
in a single tragic crane accident at 
our zinc operations in Rajasthan.
No injury of any kind is ever acceptable, 
and our non-negotiable principle is that 
everyone who works with us – direct 
employees or visiting contractors – 
should go home safe.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
We continue to analyse every incident, 
and through acting on what we learn, our 
safety KPIs have showed measurable 
improvements, with LTIFR down to 0.39 
(FY2016: 0.51). However, it is clear that 
more is needed.
Our sustainable development agenda  
is at the core of Vedanta’s strategic 
priorities and governs every business 
decision. During the year, our social 
investment stood at US$18 million and 
our efforts benefited 2.2 million people 
across 576 villages and 1,142 peripheral 
villages where we operate.
Vedanta is a strong advocate of child 
development and women empowerment. 
In India, we are transforming 4,000 
state-run child welfare centres into 
pre-fabricated units with the latest 
technology and modern amenities 
known as ‘Nand Ghars’ (also known as 
Anganwadi). These centres will be the 
convergence point for a number of 
government programmes such as clean 
water, sanitation facilities and electricity, 
with additional services such as primary 
healthcare, women empowerment and 
entrepreneurship training. 
In South Africa, we are supporting Pink 
Drive, a non-profit organisation to create 
awareness on breast cancer. Vedanta  
is also promoting skill development 
amongst youth in addition to agriculture, 
livestock and livelihood development 
programmes in India and Africa. In 
FY2017 , for example, we assisted  
90,000 farmers.
We are a signatory to the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development 
‘WASH’ (Water and Sanitation Hygiene) 
pledge. Under this we provide access  
to safe drinking water and promote best 
hygiene practices among employees and 
the community. 
Our focus on sustainable development, 
inclusive growth and greater value 
creation for all our internal and external 
stakeholders is critical to ensure the 
future of our operations and helps us 
earn our social licence to operate.
Vedanta is also determined to minimise 
the impact of our operations on the 
environment. As a resources company,  
we appreciate the vital importance of 
using resources wisely, and one example 
is our water recycling programme that  
is now delivering water recycling rates  
of 24%. 
We will maintain our focus on 
those factors that are in our 
control. This includes the safe 
expansion of our production, 
optimising costs, leveraging 
technology to run our business 
even more productively, and 
continuing our disciplined 
approach to capex.

We are also operating waste-to-revenue 
retrieval programmes, and during the 
year we will send about 50% of our fly 
ash waste for re-use in construction 
materials. 
Our operations are mostly located in 
developing countries where growth of 
the country and human indices are 
dependent on reliable and affordable 
coal-based power. We are committed  
to the climate change agenda and set  
up a Carbon Forum anchored by our 
CEO, Power with representation from 
the businesses to guide the Group 
Executive Committee on our climate 
change mitigation programme. Practical 
examples of this include an investment 
in a 16MW solar power project by our 
Zinc business in India.
CAIRN INDIA AND VEDANTA LIMITED  
MERGER COMPLETED
I am pleased that we closed the year 
by completing the merger of Cairn 
India Limited into Vedanta Limited. 
The objective here is to simplify 
our Group structure, and the move 
followed the strong approval from 
all sets of shareholders and the 
necessary regulatory permissions. 
We see synergies ahead, principally 
through a more efficient balance sheet 
and through being able to allocate capital 
with more flexibility. We continue to be 
committed to expand energy production 
through Cairn, one of the largest oil & gas 
private producers in India, focusing on the 
major discoveries at the Rajasthan block. 
VOLUME RAMP UP
We achieved increased production 
across key commodities within our 
business. 
 ❯ Aluminium. We began ramping up 
on 1 April 2016. At that point our run 
rate was approximately 900ktpa and 
by the close of the year we saw over 
30% increase to 1.2 million tonnes. 
This improvement was not as fast 
as we had hoped, stalled by a few 
operational outages. However, 
the ramp up in Q4 FY2017 saw 
production at a record level, up 56% 
year-on-year and marking strong 
progress towards our total production 
capacity of 2.3 million tonnes for 
aluminium.
 ❯ Power. The full 1,980MW Talwandi 
Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) in Punjab 
became operational this year, enabling 
the business to contribute improved 
earnings. 
 ❯ Iron Ore. It is good to report that the 
mining ban in Goa is now in the past, 
and during the year we ramped up 
production within the mining cap 
limits. We have also been able to 
control costs, producing iron ore at a 
cash cost comparable with some of 
the world’s largest operations. India’s 
geology is similar to that of Western 
Australia, the world leader in iron ore 
mining, and a lot needs to be done to 
realise the resource potential of the 
country.
 ❯ Copper Zambia. We remained 
focused on improving volumes and 
cost at this asset but this was 
impacted by lower production due  
to low equipment availability. The 
custom production, however, was 
strong post the biennial shutdown at 
the smelter.
CONTINUING COST SAVINGS
We complemented the benefits of better 
market conditions by maintaining tight 
financial discipline. Despite many 
analysts saying that the industry appears 
to have reached ‘peak savings’, our 
programme continues to drive down 
costs intelligently and safely, through 
optimising our plant and through 
achieving material efficiencies across the 
supply chain. We have achieved US$814 
million cost savings over the last two 
years since this cost savings programme 
was launched over the base of FY2015.
STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET
These successes play to our fiscal ethos: 
that we should be able to generate 
positive cash flows even in the most 
difficult passages of the market cycle. 
With this in mind, I also want to highlight 
the achievements on the balance sheet. 
Through tight cash flow control and 
capital discipline we have delivered on 
our promise to strengthen the balance 
sheet and extended our average debt 
maturities. This was also complemented 
by the success of our recent US$1  
billion bond issuance, which was 
oversubscribed by three times. This  
bond issuance extended our 2018 and 
2019 debt maturities to 2022. We also 
undertook several other liability 
management initiatives such as the  
bond buybacks and continue work in  
this direction to further strengthen the 
balance sheet. 
FY2018 AND BEYOND
We approach the new financial year  
with optimism. I believe the progressive 
improvements in the markets that we 
saw last year will continue, driven largely 
by supply-side constraints. 
At the same time, we bring a strong 
sense of realism and experience to  
our decision-making: our plans and 
investments do not rely on further help 
from market conditions, and we are 
prepared for volatility at any time. 
We will maintain our focus on those 
factors that are in our control. This 
includes the safe expansion of our 
production, optimising costs, leveraging 
technology to run our business even 
more productively, and continuing our 
disciplined approach to capex. 
On a personal note, I have elected to 
step down as CEO at the end of August 
2017 . I have spent a wonderful three-plus 
years in the role and leave the business 
in a strong position to contribute to, and 
benefit from, the future of India. I have 
always seen this extraordinary country 
as the next great growth vector, and my 
experiences here have only reinforced 
that view. I believe Vedanta will continue 
to be the premier opportunity for those 
investing in India, and I look forward to 
watching the Company’s progress in  
the exciting years ahead.

MARKET REVIEW
INDIA IS A KEY MARKET FOR VEDANT A AND ONE 
WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS HUGE GROWTH POTENTIAL. 
SUST AINED ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL LEAD TO 
DEVELOPMENT , GREA TER PROSPERITY AND AN 
OVERALL INCREASE IN PER-CAPIT A SPENDING.
GLOBAL ECONOMY AND COMMODITY MARKETS
Despite a series of economic and 
political shocks during the year which 
resulted in volatility in global markets, 
the commodities index ended the fiscal 
year 25% higher as a result of a more 
positive macroeconomic environment. 
The global economy was boosted by an 
improvement in the US economy and a 
commitment to infrastructure spending 
by the new administration, financial 
reforms and the introduction of stimulus 
measures in China aimed at keeping its 
economy on track. This uplift in global 
economic activity has increased demand 
for commodities, in particular Iron Ore, 
Aluminium, Copper and Oil & Gas, 
leading to higher prices.
In addition, as a result of the negative 
environment over the past few years and 
limited investment by mining companies, 
a lack of new mining projects coming on 
stream is leading to supply pressures for 
some commodities, particularly zinc. 
We therefore expect to see continued 
tightening in the markets over the next 
few years as demand starts to exceed 
supply.
OUTLOOK
While there will be some volatility, we 
expect commodity markets to remain 
robust following last year’s rally and the 
recovery in the global economy in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 to continue to gain 
momentum, leading to higher levels of 
employment and rising incomes.
According to the IMF’s World Economic 
Outlook (WEO), global growth is 
projected to increase from an estimated 
3.1% in 2016 to 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% 
in 2018. This is an upward revision of 0.1 
percentage point for 2017 relative to 
WEO October 2016.
In advanced economies this pick-up 
will largely be driven by the United 
States. Post the United States election, 
expectations of higher spending on 
critical infrastructure (US$1 trillion 
infrastructure plan over 10 years) 
and relaxed fiscal policy are fuelling 
expectations of higher growth. 
Emerging market and developing 
economies are also set to experience 
a pick-up in activity on the back of the 
partial recovery in commodity prices 
and this will be a key factor in global 
growth. According to the IMF , emerging 
and developing economies now account 
for more than 75% of global growth in 
output and consumption, almost double 
the share of just two decades ago. 
China’s growth trajectory, as has been 
the case for many years, also plays 
an important role. Chinese growth 
forecasts were revised upwards 
in October 2016 and the Chinese 
economy is now projected to grow 
at 6.6% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018. 
This growth will support commodity 
prices in the short-term. Vedanta’s 
diversified low-cost portfolio and 
attractive basket of commodities 
positions us well to take advantage 
of the recent economic uplift.

ALUMINIUM
Global aluminium demand, excluding 
China, grew by 3% year-on-year in 
2016 while Chinese demand grew 
by 7% last year, driven by stronger 
primary demand supported by stimulus 
measures. Global aluminium production 
grew by 3% year-on-year with Chinese 
production continuing to account 
for more than 50% of global supply. 
Supply-side rationalisation themes have 
emerged from China since the start of 
2017 , with the announcements related 
to winter production cuts to control 
air pollution. Aluminium LME prices 
moved up 20% compared to 2016 lows 
and premiums gained further as global 
aluminium markets fell into deficit. 
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS

market with 40% market share. Our 
aluminium supply is used to produce 
rods, billets, primary foundry alloys and 
rolled products for use in products 
including cables, conductors, and 
in houses. 
In FY2017 50% of our sales were to the 
Indian market, specifically for use in the 
infrastructure, transportation, packaging, 
construction and electrical sectors, 
where there is strong demand as a 
result of government initiatives. 
Overseas demand for our products is 
strong and our international customer 
base recorded sales growth of 33% 
over FY2017 to 610kt with increased 
footprints in Europe, North and South 
America and other key Asian markets. 
INDIAN ECONOMY
India is a key market for Vedanta and 
one which we believe has huge growth 
potential. According to the IMF WEO 
April 2017 , India is expected to grow by 
7 .2% in FY2017 and 7 .7% in FY2018. 
It remains the fastest-growing major 
economy in the world and is now ranked 
the world’s top investment destination 
by EY . Confidence in its growth story 
is increasing as the Government 
continues to drive reforms such as the 
introduction of Goods and Services Tax 
(GST) that encourage development. 
In addition, enhanced transparency, 
accountability, an auction-based forward-
looking framework and liberalisation 
of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
policy will help unlock India’s economic 
potential. As a result, India’s medium-
term growth prospects are favourable. 
Sustained economic growth will lead to 
development, greater prosperity and an 
overall increase in per-capita spending. 
Positive demographic factors including 
an increase in the Indian workforce 
are leading to higher demand for 
urban development from infrastructure 
and housing to consumer goods and 
appliances. It is estimated that India 
has a huge unmet need for investment 
in infrastructure, estimated at around 
US$650 billion over the next five 
years. Investment in the sector has 
been boosted by government support 
through a range of initiatives including 
the Smart City Initiative, Digital India 
Campaign, construction of highways 
and a high speed rail network. 
The manufacturing sector also continues 
to expand. The Indian automotive sector, 
one of the most vibrant in the world, is 
currently ranked sixth in global vehicle 
production and continues to show 
strong growth. 
As a result, the Indian economy has 
enjoyed progressive growth during the 
past year which has led to real increases 
in metals demand. 
OUTLOOK
Looking ahead, we expect to see 
continued investment in infrastructure 
and increasing metals demand and we 
are anticipating changes in government 
policy to incentivise home-grown metal 
and energy production and reduce import 
levels. We believe Vedanta is well placed 
to leverage India’s growth potential and 
contribute to its economic development, 
given our proven track record in India.
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
World demand for aluminium is expected 
to increase by 4% next year. In India, 
initiatives to develop the country’s 
infrastructure continue to drive demand 
and we expect this trend to continue. 
Additionally, the Power Grid Corporation 
of India (PGCIL) has recently approved 
investments worth US$4.5 billion to 
expand and modernise the national 
power grid over the next 36-48 months 
which will drive demand in the wire 
and cable segment. We expect Indian 
aluminium demand to grow by 7 .7% 
next year and we are ramping up our 
production at Jharsuguda II to take 
advantage of these opportunities. 
We also see significant opportunities 
to grow our international customer base 
as overseas demand for our products 
continues to grow strongly and we are 
targeting a doubling of our sales to 
international customers in FY2018.
On the supply side, market views 
are mixed with respect to China 
implementing measures to control 
production growth. According to CRU, 
global primary aluminium production is 
forecasted to increase by 6.2% in 2017 
to 62.5 million tonnes. Indian production 
is expected to grow by 18% in 2017 
and contribute 72% of the production 
increase globally (ex-China), mainly on 
the back of Vedanta’s Jharsuguda II 
ramp  up.

MARKET REVIEW
CONTINUED
ZINC
COPPER
World refined copper consumption grew 
by 2.2% in 2016 while consumption 
in China, the largest consumer of 
copper, grew by 4.9%. Copper prices 
also firmed up on the prospects of 
the US’s infrastructure plans and 
increased demand in China due to a 
greater government stimulus impact 
on the power grid investments and 
higher end-use demand, particularly 
for appliances and consumer goods.
In India, the refined copper market 
experienced 8% growth in H1 FY2017 
but saw a slowdown in Q3 owing to 
demonetisation; however it started 
picking up in Q4 and is expected to 
continue growing on par with growth 
in the Indian economy. 
On the supply side, after the fifth 
consecutive year of mine supply 
growth in 2016 (5%), 2017 started with 
production disruptions at some of the 
largest global copper mines such as 
Escondida, Grasberg and Cerro Verde, 
which supported copper prices.
The 2017 annual benchmark settlements 
for concentrate showed a 5% reduction 
over the previous year, mainly due 
to disruptions resulting in a decline in 
concentrate availability. 
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Refined copper is predominantly used in 
manufacturing cables, transformers and 
motors as well as making castings and 
alloy-based products.
Vedanta, with its 400ktpa custom smelter 
in Southern India, is the market leader 
in India with a market share for refined 
copper of approximately 35%, and 
our major customers in India are cable 
manufacturers, winding wire units and 
transformer manufacturers. Our exports 
are mainly to China and South East Asia 
and these customers are largely served 
from India as well as our KCM business 
in Africa. 
Exports contributed 41% of overall sales 
for FY2017 .
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR VEDANTA
Globally, higher end-use demand in 
China, particularly for appliances and 
consumer goods, is driving demand 
and we expect this trend to continue as 
Chinese stimulus measures continue. 
In India, growth drivers include a range 
of infrastructure initiatives, including 
the Smart Cities project, ‘Housing 
for all Indians by 2022’ programme, 
industrial corridors, National Highways 
Development Project and a focus on 
building renewable energy projects 
under the National Electricity Policy.
We therefore expect to see demand 
growth in India and China in the coming 
years. We see opportunities to take 
advantage of this growth in demand to 
further grow our market share in India 
and potentially to expand our smelter 
capacity and to increase export sales. 
ZINC
Zinc markets rallied in 2016 fuelled by 
improving market fundamentals. The zinc 
LME increased by c.50% fiscal year-on-
year to end the year above US$2,700/t. 
Zinc consumption grew by 2.7% to  
14.3 million tonnes, primarily due to rising 
demand from India and China, while a 
global zinc concentrate deficit supported 
zinc prices. Production cuts and mine 
closures led to a fall in the supply of 
concentrate by almost 700kt in 2016, 
the largest contribution coming from 
Glencore’s output curtailments of 500kt. 
Since there is no indication yet that this 
capacity will be restarted in the coming 
months, the concentrate market is 
expected to remain tight for most of 
2017 . This concentrate tightness has yet 
to translate into refined market tightness 
due to the presence of refined zinc 
inventory. But as warehouse stocks are 
drawn down we will see a steady rise in 
premiums.
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Vedanta’s zinc production primarily caters 
to Indian demand. Hence around 68-75% 
of the refined zinc produced is sold in the 
Indian market and the rest is exported.
Vedanta is the largest zinc producer in 
India, with 72% market share in FY2017 . 
70% of Indian zinc consumption is used 
in the galvanising sector, predominantly 
in the construction and infrastructure 
sectors. We also produce zinc for use in 
die-casting alloys, brass and oxides and

chemicals. Indian steel companies are our 
main customers in the domestic market. 
Globally about half of the zinc that is 
produced is used in galvanising iron and 
steel. Key export geographies include 
Nepal, Bangladesh, Taiwan, China, New 
Zealand, Sri Lanka, Korea, South East 
Asia and the Middle East. 
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Urbanisation and industrialisation, 
especially in the developing world, are 
expected to remain the driving forces 
behind zinc consumption globally. China, 
accounting for 47% of global demand, 
and India are the main markets, due to 
government efforts in both countries to 
boost investment in construction and 
infrastructure. 
In India, zinc consumption per capita 
currently stands at 0.5kg, significantly 
below the global average of 1 .9kg. India 
represents a significant opportunity for 
zinc sales going forward as we expect 
the Indian market to continue to 
grow strongly towards global levels 
of consumption, underpinned by the 
government’s initiatives to boost housing 
and infrastructure. As a result, we expect 
India to become the leading consumer 
of zinc in the future and Vedanta’s 
market-leading position and ramp up in 
production places the Company well to 
take advantage of this growth. 
Global consumption is also expected to 
grow steadily, at a rate of approximately 
2% per annum, and our plans to bring 
production online at our Gamsberg 
growth project this year will benefit from 
the current favourable market conditions. 
OIL & GAS
Crude oil prices ended 2016 above 
US$50 per barrel at US$53, an increase 
of US$16 per barrel year-on-year, 
supported by the OPEC agreement 
reached late-2016 which took some oil 
off the market. However, this in turn led 
to a higher rig count which has exerted 
downward pressure on prices. 
During the next year, global production 
and consumption are both expected to 
increase, but consumption is expected 
to grow at a faster rate resulting in 
tightening supply. 
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Our operations produce crude oil which 
is sold to hydrocarbon refineries and 
natural gas which is used by the fertiliser 
sector. 
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Due to sustained low levels of oil prices 
internationally, approvals of new 
conventional crude oil projects in 2015-16 
fell to the lowest level seen since the 
1950s and the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) believes that if approvals 
remains low, an unprecedented effort 
will be needed to avoid a supply-demand 
gap in future. 
The Indian oil & gas market is very 
dependent on imports. 82% of 
oil consumption and 44% of gas 
consumption is met by imports. During 
2016-17 gas imports were at their 
highest level for four years as domestic 
production has fallen steadily. 
The Government recognises the need 
to increase investments and boost 
domestic production to achieve greater 
energy security. To this end they are 
targeting a 10% reduction in India’s 
imports of oil & gas by 2022 and have 
introduced a number of reforms and new 
policies aimed at attracting investment 
and boosting production. 
India is underexplored, with only seven 
of the 26 sedimentary basins currently 
producing oil & gas, which offers 
significant opportunities. As the largest 
private sector producer of crude oil in 
India with a strong track record and 
growth pipeline in exploration and 
development, Vedanta is well positioned 
to benefit from the Government’s 
desire to boost domestic production 
and to leverage India’s oil & gas 
resource potential.

POWER
Vedanta operates a 9GW diversified 
power portfolio in India consisting of 
96% thermal power and 4% from 
renewable energy sources. 
India has the fifth largest power 
generation capacity in the world and 
demand for power continues to rise 
steadily in line with economic growth.
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
40% of our Power portfolio is used for 
commercial power while 60% is for 
captive use. 
Nearly 95% of the power generated 
for commercial purposes is backed by 
long-term Power Purchase Agreements 
with local Indian distribution companies. 
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Government has been supportive 
of growth in the power sector. It has 
de-licensed the electrical machinery 
industry and allowed 100% Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI) in the sector. 
India currently has a power deficit and is 
targeting a total of 88.5GW of additional 
power capacity by 2017 , of which 
72.3GW constitutes thermal power, 
10.8GW hydro and 5.3GW nuclear. 
The proportion of power generated 
by renewable energy sources is also 
growing. Wind energy is currently the 
largest source of renewable energy, 
accounting for an estimated 60% of 
total installed capacity (21 .1GW). 
There are plans to double wind power 
generation capacity to 20GW by 2022. 
India has also raised the solar power 
generation capacity target to 100GW, 
five times the current capacity, by 2022. 
The Government is supportive of 
growth, in the power sector to achieve 
their vision of ‘Power for All. ’ It has 
already implemented a number of 
power development schemes for rural 
and urban areas and the Ujwal Discom 
Assurance Y ojna (UDAY) scheme 
to offer support to the distribution 
companies, which has been well 
received. Regulatory and policy 
initiatives to develop energy storage 
are also being considered to facilitate 
the expansion of renewable energy 
generation as part of India’s energy mix.
Vedanta is one of the largest power 
generators in India and continues to 
increase power capacity to capitalise 
on India’s economic growth and power 
deficit. Additionally, domestic coal prices 
have fallen during 2016 while seaborne 
prices have risen and we expect this 
trend to continue in 2017 , providing 
domestic producers with an additional 
source of competitive advantage.
POWER IRON ORE 27
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
IRON ORE
Iron ore prices rose in 2016, mainly due 
to the rebounding of the futures market, 
which helped push the spot benchmark 
above US$90/dmt for the first time  
since 2014. The Chinese Government 
announced a deadline to halt substandard 
steel production of electric arc furnaces 
in June 2017 , as a result of which iron ore 
and steel futures rose.
Global steel demand in 2017 is expected 
to increase marginally. Chinese demand 
is expected to decline marginally as the 
Government’s promotion of infrastructure 
spending is offset by reduced residential 
construction activity due to falling 
housing prices. However, US steel 
demand could surprise on the upside, 
driven by a rise in the energy and 
machinery markets and an increase in 
construction projects. 
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Vedanta is India’s largest producer 
and private sector exporter of iron ore. 
Approximately 35% of our production, 
primarily from Karnataka, is sold in India 
and 65%, comprising low grade ore 
from Goa, is exported, mainly to China. 
Iron ore is a key ingredient in steel 
production and steel products in India 
are mainly used in the construction, 
infrastructure and automotive sectors. 
Production is sold domestically to Indian 
steel producers and exported to Chinese 
steel mills.
MARKET DRIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
In the longer-term, we expect continued 
demand from both the Indian and 
Chinese markets due to ongoing 
investment in construction and 
infrastructure. In the short-term, the 
World Steel Association has projected 
growth in Indian steel demand by 6.1% 
in 2017 while globally, steel demand has 
been projected to grow by 1 .3%. 
In India, as a result of the liberalisation  
of industrial policy and initiatives to  
boost infrastructure investment, existing 
steel plants are being modernised or 
expanded and a large number of new 
steel plants based on cost effective, 
state-of-the-art technologies have also 
been set up. The rapid and stable growth 
in demand has also prompted domestic 
entrepreneurs to look at greenfield 
projects in a number of states. The 
Government’s target is to increase steel 
production to 300 million tonnes by 2025 
to match India’s growing infrastructure 
needs. This growth in steel production 
represents an opportunity for Vedanta  
to grow its domestic iron ore sales.
While the focus on environmental issues 
and productivity in China could create 
challenges and affect demand for low 
grade iron ore from Chinese steel 
producers, increased margin pressure 
due to falling steel prices and volatile 
coking coal prices could drive Chinese 
mills to revert to the use of lower grade 
iron ore to reduce costs. 28

OUR KEY STAKEHOLDERS
EMPLOYEES
We invest significantly in developing and 
retaining key talent to drive innovation 
and efficiency within the business and 
develop potential future leaders. Our 
number one priority remains achieving 
the goal of zero harm and we are 
committed to enhancing a culture of 
safety across the Company. We delivered 
1 .1 million hours of safety training to 
employees and contractors in 2017 
and our attrition rate remained at 5%.
COMMUNITIES
We make a positive and important 
contribution to the communities in which 
we operate through job creation and 
the development of local economies 
and communities. Our community 
investment strategy focuses on health, 
education, skills development and 
the environment, and we contributed 
US$18 million to communities in 
India and Africa in FY2017 , benefiting 
approximately 2.2 million people.
GOVERNMENTS
We build enduring and collaborative 
relationships with governments in 
countries we operate in. We created 
direct economic value for our host 
governments through the payment of 
US$6 billion in taxes, royalties and 
dividends in 2017 . We also work in 
partnership with governments to help 
them achieve local and regional 
development goals through investment 
and employment opportunities. 
NATURAL
India and Africa are endowed with 
favourable geology and extensive 
reserve and resource potential. 
Operating our mines requires a 
range of resources including water 
and energy and we aim to use 
these resources prudently and 
sustainably. We recycled 24% of our 
water this year and implemented 
a long-term carbon strategy to 
improve our energy efficiency. 
SUPPLY CHAIN AND CUSTOMERS
Our operations rely on a broad range 
of suppliers, and we enable the 
growth of existing businesses and the 
development of new supplier businesses 
along with the corresponding local 
economic and social benefits.
For our customers, who are 
predominantly large industrial 
downstream producers, our resources 
are crucial to their success and growth; 
we work closely with them on product 
development and provide additional 
technical support to ensure they are 
achieving maximum value from our 
products.
SHAREHOLDERS
We regularly engage with our 
shareholders so they understand our 
approach and strategy. We are 
committed to delivering strong and 
sustainable returns for our shareholders 
and exposure to an attractive basket of 
commodities.

ASSETS
We invest in best-in-class assets to 
ensure we operate as efficiently and 
safely as possible both at our current 
operations and in our expansion 
projects. While capex budgets have 
been reduced in recent years, in the 
sector as whole, we have maintained 
minimal investment in the property, 
plant and equipment required for 
our expansion and improvement 
projects. We invested US$668 
million in FY2017 in project capex.
RELATIONSHIPS
Building strong relationships with 
our key stakeholder groups is a key 
pillar in our approach to sustainable 
development. We deploy a range of 
engagement channels across the project 
life cycle including public hearings, one-
on-one discussions and surveys, with 
a view to understanding stakeholder 
expectations, aligning our interests 
and updating them on our intentions 
and actions. First and foremost, our 
approach is based on the principle of

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST A  
RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL KEY 
PERFORMANCE INDICA TORS ALIGNED TO OUR 
STRA TEGY , WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING 
GROWTH, LONG- TERM V ALUE AND SUST AINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT.
GROWTH
DESCRIPTION
Revenue represents the value of goods 
and services provided to third parties 
during the year.
COMMENTARY
In FY2017 , overall revenue was up by  
7% to US$11 .5 billion compared with 
US$10.7 billion in FY2016. The increase 
was primarily driven by firmer prices  
and volume ramp up.
DESCRIPTION
Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 
is a factor of volume, prices and 
cost of production. This measure 
is calculated by adjusting operating 
profit for special items, and adding 
depreciation and amortisation.
COMMENTARY
EBITDA for FY2017 was up by 
37% at US$3.2 billion. This was 
primarily due to increase in LME 
and Brent prices, strong operating 
performance, cost savings initiatives 
and local currency depreciation. 
DESCRIPTION
This is calculated on the basis of 
operating profit before special items and 
net of tax, as a ratio of capital invested 
in operations as at the balance sheet 
date, and excludes investment in project 
capital work in progress and exploration 
assets. The objective is to earn a post-tax 
return above the weighted average cost 
of capital consistently. T o have consistency 
of comparison, the effects of one-time 
non-cash impairment charges have 
been taken out in calculating ROCE.
COMMENTARY
ROCE in FY2017 (without project work 
in progress and exploration assets) 
was 15.6% compared to 6.2% in the 
previous year.
DESCRIPTION
This represents net cash flow from 
operations after investing in expansion 
projects. This measure ensures that 
profit generated by our assets is 
reflected by cash flow in order to 
de-lever or maintain future growth.
COMMENTARY
We generated free cash flow of US$1 .5 
billion, driven by operational performance 
and optimisation of operational and 
capital expenditures.

DESCRIPTION
This represents the net profit 
attributable to equity shareholders 
and is stated before special items 
and their attributable tax (including 
taxes classified as special items) 
and minority interest impacts.
COMMENTARY
In FY2017 , underlying EPS was at 1 .1 US 
cents per share, higher than the previous 
year loss per share of 131 .9 US cents. 
This reflects increased commodity 
prices, resulting in higher EBITDA.
DESCRIPTION
The percentage of women in the total 
permanent employee workforce.
COMMENTARY
We provide equal opportunities and safe 
workplaces to men and women. During 
the year, the ratio of female employees 
remained 9.4% of total employees. 
DESCRIPTION
Dividend per share is the total of the 
final dividend recommended by the 
Board in relation to the year, and the 
interim dividend paid out during the year.
COMMENTARY
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 35 US cents per share this 
year compared with 30 US cents per 
share in the previous year.
DESCRIPTION
Total number of beneficiaries through 
our community development 
programmes across all our operations.
COMMENTARY
We benefited around 2.2 million people 
this year through our community 
development projects comprising 
community health, nutrition, education, 
water and sanitation, sustainable 
livelihood, women empowerment and 
bio-investment.
DESCRIPTION
This represents the amount invested in 
our organic growth programme during 
the year.
COMMENTARY
Our strategy was one of disciplined 
capital allocation on high-return, low-risk 
projects. Expansion capital expenditure 
during the year was at US$0.7 billion, 
with most of this invested in ramping up 
our Aluminium and Power businesses, 
expansion of Zinc India, the Mangala 
EOR programme at Oil & Gas, and the 
Gamsberg project at our Zinc 
International business.
DESCRIPTION
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) is the number of lost time injuries 
per million man hours worked. This 
includes our employees and contractors 
working in our operations and projects. 
COMMENTARY
We have been able to reduce the LTIFR 
to 0.39 this year. The continuous fall in 
LTIFR can be attributed to our efforts in 
training and coaching our employees on 
workplace safety practices.
1 As per revised ICMM definition, LTIFR stands at 0.50. 36

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
MANAGING OUR RISKS
GOVERNANCE
As a global natural resources 
organisation, our businesses are 
exposed to a variety of risks. We 
recognise the importance of identifying 
and actively managing the risks facing 
the Group. It is therefore essential to 
have in place the necessary systems 
and a robust governance framework 
to manage associated risks, while 
OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SUPPORTS 
THE ORGANISA TION TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES BY 
ALIGNING OPERA TING CONTROLS WITH THE MISSION 
AND VISION OF THE GROUP .
balancing the relative risk reward 
equation demanded by stakeholders.
Our risk management framework 
serves to identify, assess and respond 
to the principal and emerging risks 
facing the Group’s businesses. It is 
designed to be simple and consistent 
and provide clarity on managing and 
reporting risks to the Board. Our 
management systems, organisational 
structures, processes, standards and 
Code of Conduct and Ethics together 
form the system of internal control that 
governs how the Group conducts its 
business and manages the associated 
risks. The Board regularly reviews 
the internal control system to ensure 
that it remains effective. The Board’s 
review includes the Audit Committee’s 
report on the risk matrix, significant 
risks and actions put in place to 
mitigate these risks. Any weaknesses 
identified by the review are addressed 
by enhanced procedures to strengthen 
the relevant controls and these are in 
turn reviewed at regular intervals. 
The effective management of risk is 
critical to support the delivery of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. Risk 
management is therefore embedded 
in critical business activities, functions 
and processes. The risk management 
framework helps the organisation meet 
its objectives by aligning operating 
controls with the mission and vision 
of the Group set by the Board. 
Materiality and risk tolerance are key 
considerations in our decision-making. 
The responsibility for identifying 
and managing risk lies with all the 
managers and business leaders.
The Board has the ultimate responsibility 
for management of risks and for 
ensuring the effectiveness of internal 
control systems. The risk management 
framework is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and 
provides reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Audit Committee 
aids the Board in this process by 
identification and assessment of any 
changes in risk exposure, review of 
risk control measures and remedial 
actions, where appropriate.
The Audit Committee is in turn 
supported by the Group-level Risk 
Management Committee which assists 
the Audit Committee in evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness 
of the risk mitigation programme and 
the control systems. The Group Risk 
Management Committee (GRMC) 
comprises the Group Chief Executive 
Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
Director of Finance and Director – 
Management Assurance and meets 
every quarter. The Group Head of HSE 
is invited to attend these meetings.

the risk profile, emerging risks and 
progress against planned actions.
In addition to the above structure, other 
key risk governance and oversight 
committees include the following:
 ❯ CFO Committee which has an 
oversight of the treasury related risks. 
This committee comprises the Group 
CFO, business CFOs, Group Treasury 
Head and Treasury Heads at 
respective businesses;
 ❯ Group Capex Sub-Committee which 
evaluates the risks associated with 
any capital investment decisions and 
institutes a risk management 
framework in expansion projects; and
 ❯ Vedanta Sustainability Committee 
which looks at sustainability-related 
risks. The Sustainability Committee is 
chaired by a Non-Executive Director 
and the Group Chief Executive Officer 
is a member.
Vedanta’s risk management and 
internal control system is aligned to 
the recommendations in the FRC’s 
revised guidance ‘Risk management, 
internal control and related financial and 
business reporting’ (the Risk Guidance). 
The Group has a consistently applied 
methodology for identifying risks at the 
individual business level for existing 
operations and for ongoing projects.
The Group’s risk appetite is set by 
the Board. It has been defined taking 
into consideration the Group’s risk 
tolerance level and is clearly linked 
to its strategic priorities. The risk 
appetite forms the basis of the Board’s 
assessment and prioritisation of each 
risk based on its likely impact on the 
business operations. A risk scale aligned 
to the Board’s overall risk appetite 
and consisting of qualitative and 
quantitative factors has been defined 
to facilitate a consistent assessment of 
the risk exposure across the Group. 
At a business level, formal discussions 
on risk management occur at review 
meetings held at least once a quarter. 
The respective businesses review their 
major risks, and changes in their nature 
and extent since the last assessment, 
and discuss the control measures which 
are in place and further action plans. 
The control measures stated in the risk 
matrix are also periodically reviewed 
by the business management teams 
to verify their effectiveness. These 
meetings are chaired by business 
chief executive officers and attended 
by CXOs, senior management and 
appropriate functional heads. Risk 
officers have been formally nominated 
at each of the operating businesses 
as well as at Vedanta level, whose 
role is to create awareness of risks 
at senior management level and to 
develop and nurture a risk management 
culture within the businesses. Risk 
mitigation plans form an integral part 
of the performance management 
process. Structured discussions on risk 
management also happen at business 
level with regard to their respective 
risk matrix and mitigation plans. The 
leadership team in the businesses 
is accountable for governance of the 
risk management framework and they 
provide regular updates to the GRMC.
Each of the businesses have developed 
its own risk matrix of Top 20 risks 
which is reviewed by their respective 
management committee/executive 
committee, chaired by their respective 
chief executive officers. In addition, 
each business has developed its 
own risk register depending on the 
size of its operations and number of 
SBUs/locations. Risks across these 
risk registers are aggregated and 
evaluated and the Group’s principal 
risks are identified based on the 
frequency, potential magnitude and 
potential impact of the risks identified. 
Employees are also encouraged to 
take advantage of smart opportunities 
within the parameters of the risk 
appetite set by the Board.
This element has been an important 
component of the overall internal 
control process by which the Board 
obtains assurance. The scope of work, 
authority and resources of Management 
Assurance Services (MAS) are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
The responsibilities of MAS include 
recommending improvements in the 
control environment and reviewing 
compliance with our philosophy, 
policies and procedures. The planning 
of internal audit is approached from 
a risk perspective. In preparing the 
internal audit plan, reference is made 
to the risk matrix, inputs are sought 
from senior management, business 
teams and members of the Audit 
Committee. In addition, reference 
is made to past audit experience, 
financial analysis and the current 
economic and business environment.
Each of the principal subsidiaries 
has in place procedures to ensure 
that sufficient internal controls are 
maintained. These procedures include 
a monthly meeting of the relevant 
management committee and quarterly 
meeting of the audit committee of 
that subsidiary. Any adverse findings 
are reported to the Audit Committee. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
may request MAS and/or the external 
auditor to focus their audit work and 
report to him on specific areas of risk 
identified by the risk management and 
internal control framework. The findings 
by MAS are presented monthly to the 
Executive Committee and to the Audit 
Committee periodically. Due to the 
limitations inherent in any system of 
internal control, this system is designed 
to meet the Group’s particular needs 
and the risks to which it is exposed 
rather than eliminate risk altogether. 
Consequently it can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Vedanta’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out below may impact the following 
areas of the Group’s business: 
Area Impact

Access to capital 
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
The Group may not be able to 
meet its payment obligations 
when due or may be unable to 
borrow funds in the market at an 
acceptable price to fund actual 
or proposed commitments. 
A sustained adverse economic 
downturn and/or suspension 
of its operation in any business, 
effecting revenue and free 
cash flow generation, may 
cause stress on the Company’s 
financing and covenant 
compliance and its ability to 
raise financing at competitive 
terms. Any constraints on 
upstreaming of funds from the 
subsidiaries to the Group may 
affect the liquidity position at 
the Group level.

 ❯ Vedanta Limited and Cairn India merger has become effective. The 
merger with Vedanta Limited will de-risk Cairn India by providing 
access to a portfolio of diversified Tier-I, low-cost, long-life assets, to 
deliver significant near-term growth, while retaining the substantial 
upside from our Oil & Gas business.
 ❯ Early redemption of 2018 bonds in line with the stated strategy to 
deleverage at plc level and extend average debt maturity.
 ❯ Group generates healthy cash flows from its current operations 
which, together with the available cash and cash equivalents and 
liquid financial asset investments, provide liquidity both in the 
short-term as well as in the long-term.
 ❯ Continued compliance with the Group’s treasury policies which 
govern our financial risk management practices.
Extension of production sharing contract of Cairn beyond 2020 
or extension at less favourable terms
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
Cairn India has 70% participating 
interest in Rajasthan Block. The 
production sharing contract 
(PSC) of Rajasthan Block runs 
until 2020. Challenges in 
extension of the production 
sharing contract of Cairn (beyond 
2020) or extension at less 
favourable terms may have 
implications.

 ❯ The Indian Government has a notified PSC extension policy for 
pre-NELP exploration blocks. This policy is applicable to 10 pre-NELP 
exploration blocks which includes Rajasthan (RJ-ON-90/1). This is 
being studied.
MANAGING OUR RISKS
CONTINUED
The order in which these risks appear in the section below does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the 
relative magnitude of their impact on our business. The risk direction of each risk was reviewed based on events, economic 
conditions, changes in business environment and regulatory changes during the year. While Vedanta’s risk management framework 
is designed to help the organisation meet its objectives, there can be no guarantee that the Group’s risk management activities 
will mitigate or prevent these or other risks from occurring. Our approach is not intended to eliminate risk entirely, but rather to 
provide the structural means to identify, prioritise and manage the risks involved in our activities in order to support our value 
creation objectives.
The Board, with the assistance of management, carries out periodic and robust assessments of the principal risks and uncertainties 
of the Group (including those that threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity) and tested the financial 
plans for the Group for each of the principal risks and uncertainties mentioned below.

RISK
Discovery risk 
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
Increased production rates from 
our growth-oriented operations 
place demand on exploration 
and prospecting initiatives to 
replace reserves and resources 
at a pace faster than depletion. 
A failure in our ability to discover 
new reserves, enhance existing 
reserves or develop new 
operations in sufficient 
quantities to maintain or grow 
the current level of our reserves 
could negatively affect our 
prospects. There are numerous 
uncertainties inherent in 
estimating ore and oil & gas 
reserves, and geological, 
technical and economic 
assumptions that are valid at the 
time of estimation. These may 
change significantly when new 
information becomes available.
 ❯ Business model
 ❯ Future performance
 ❯ Strategic priority is to add to our reserves and resources by 
extending resources at a faster rate than we deplete them, through 
continuous focus on drilling and exploration programmes.
 ❯ Appropriate organisation and adequate financial allocation in place 
for exploration. 
 ❯ Dedicated exploration cell with continuous focus to enhance 
exploration capabilities. 
 ❯ Exploration-related systems being strengthened and new 
technologies being utilised wherever appropriate.

RISK
Fluctuation in commodity prices (including oil) 
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
Prices and demand for the 
Group’s products are expected 
to remain volatile/uncertain and 
strongly influenced by global 
economic conditions. Volatility in 
commodity prices and demand 
may adversely affect our

an integral part of the Group’s business and its usual policy is to sell 
its products at prevailing market prices and not to enter into price 
hedging arrangements other than for businesses of custom 
smelting and purchased alumina, where back-to-back hedging is 
used to mitigate pricing risks. 
 ❯ The Group monitors the commodity markets closely to determine 
the effect of price fluctuations on earnings, capital expenditure and 
cash flows. The CFO Committee reviews all commodity-related 
risks and suggests necessary courses of action as needed by 
business divisions. 
 ❯ Continued compliance with the Group’s treasury policies which 
govern our financial risk management practices.
 ❯ Continuous focus on cost control and cost reduction.

IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
We have operations in many 
countries around the globe, 
which have varying degrees of 
political and commercial stability.

operating costs, restrictions 
such as the imposition or 
increase in royalties or taxation 
rates, export duty, impact on 
mining rights/ban and change 
in legislation pertaining to

RISK
Breaches in information/IT security 
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
Like many other global 
organisations, our reliance 
on computers and network 
technology is increasing. These 
systems could be subject to 
security breaches resulting in 
theft, disclosure or corruption 
of key/strategic information. 
Security breaches could also 
result in misappropriation of

Emissions and climate change 
IMPACT IMPACT CRITERIA MITIGATION
Our global presence exposes us 
to a number of jurisdictions in 
which regulations or laws have 
been or are being considered to 
limit or reduce emissions. The 
likely effect of these changes 
will be to increase the cost for 
fossil fuels, impose levies for 
emissions in excess of certain 
permitted levels and increased 
administrative costs for 
monitoring and reporting. 
Increasing regulation of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, including the 
progressive introduction of 
carbon emissions trading 
mechanisms and tighter 
emission reduction targets, is 
likely to raise costs and reduce 
demand growth.

RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP
Safeguarding resources – Our stewardship 
approach to resources as against an 
ownership approach has translated 
into a culture of ‘zero harm’ which has 
been actively propagated across the 
organisation.
BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS
Aligning interests – We actively engage 
with our stakeholders using systematic 
engagement plans to integrate their 
priorities in our growth strategy.
ADDING AND SHARING VALUE
Nurturing interdependencies – Along 
with being significant contributors to the 
national economy, we make it a point to 
be prime-movers of local economy and 
investors in priority areas of the nation. 
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS
Reinforcing trust – The trust that local 
communities and national governments 
repose in us is essentially our licence 
to operate. We continue to reinforce 
this trust through strategic and timely 
communication.
OUR STRATEGY
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS AT THE CORE OF 
OUR BUSINESS
As a diversified natural resources 
company, sustainable development is 
at the heart of our business and a key 
element of our strategy to grow the 
business. To ensure that sustainability is 
embedded into our day-to-day business, 
protecting and preserving our licence 
to operate across our value chain is 
one of our strategic priorities. We are 
committed to programmes that ensure 
the health and safety of our people, 
enhance the economic and social value 
of the communities and regions in which 
we operate and effectively monitor, 
manage and reduce our environmental 
footprint and measure our progress 
each year against a range of focus 
areas. We also aim to create a culture 
based on our values which ensures 
the professional growth and personal 
well-being of our entire workforce. 
OUR APPROACH 
We have developed a unifying sustainable 
development framework, which assists in 
implementing our commitments across 
all our operations. Our approach is 
centred on four strategic pillars:
RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP 
Sustainability for us is all about 
stewardship and we aim to carefully 
monitor, responsibly manage and 
consistently improve the Group’s health, 
safety and environmental performance. 
Our vision for a ‘Zero Harm, Zero Waste 
and Zero Discharge’ culture across  
all our businesses is an outcome of  
this approach.
Focus areas: Code of Conduct and 
Ethics, health & safety, environmental 
management
BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS 
Open, ongoing and systematic dialogue 
is the key to successful relationships 
with our stakeholders. We ensure their 
varied priorities and differing interests 
are aligned with our growth strategy 
through an inclusive stakeholder 
engagement framework that both 
nurtures and induces advancement. 
Focus areas: stakeholder engagement 
and management, human rights 
ADDING AND SHARING VALUE 
We believe driving economic 
empowerment and social equality 
through significant and relevant 
investment in local communities and 
national economies is the best approach 
to shared value creation. 
Focus areas: employees, communities.
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS 
Transparent and timely communication 
reinforces trust. We endeavour to gain 
the trust of local bodies and national 
governments and strengthen our social 
licence to operate through a series of 
clear and regular dialogues and initiatives. 
Our framework is aligned to global best 
practice standards, including the United 
Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) Ten 
Principles, the International Finance 
Corporation, Sustainable Development 
Goals, the International Council on 
Mining and Metals and the Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development Guidelines for

materiality process has helped us to 
develop a materiality matrix which 
identifies the most important areas for 
both internal and external stakeholders

SUST AINABILITY FOR  
US IS ALL ABOUT 
STEWARDSHIP AND  
WE AIM TO CAREFULLY 
MONITOR, RESPONSIBLY 
MANAGE AND 
CONSISTENTLY IMPROVE 
THE GROUP’S HEALTH, 
SAFETY AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
PERFORMANCE.  
OUR APPROACH
We manage our business in a 
sustainable manner, ensuring 
we have effective and appropriate 
business processes and behaviours 
in place, focusing on health and 
safety management and responsibly 
managing our environmental impacts 
and preserving biodiversity. 
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Our Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics (CBCE) provides a set of principles 
which ensure compliance with the 
law of the land and sets out expected 
standards of behaviour. Our reporting 
requirements in the UK raise the bar on 
various governance aspects which are 
applied in our businesses, including:
❯ ❯ Human rights
❯ ❯ Insider training
❯ ❯ Political contributions
❯ ❯ Conflicts of interests
❯ ❯ Confidentiality
❯ ❯ Fraud, bribery and corruption
Mandatory training on the Code is 
provided to our new recruits, and 
refresher workshops on anti-corruption 
policies and procedures are conducted 
for relevant employees. 
Under our Whistleblowing Policy, 
employees and external stakeholders 
have access to a mechanism to report 
inappropriate behaviour in strict 
confidence and ensure a free and fair 
investigation without any fear of 
repercussion.
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
OVERVIEW
We work in adverse locations and 
conditions and are aware of the many 
occupational risks inherent to our 
industry. Nonetheless, we remain 
committed to an injury-free, illness-free 
and healthy workplace and are working 
towards achieving zero harm across our 
operations and businesses.
We have a comprehensive Group-level 
HSE policy. The goal is to embed safety 
as a value across our operations. Our 
senior management team is passionate 
about embedding a culture of zero harm 
and takes responsibility for leading our 
safety strategy and communicating it 
across the workforce, engaging with 
employees and setting out the safety 
improvement opportunities. 
PERFORMANCE
Strengthening the safety culture 
throughout our businesses through strict 
adherence to our safety performance 
standards and an adoption of zero 
tolerance towards safety lapses has 
been our prime focus during the year. 
This year we tragically lost seven lives, 
including four in one major crane incident 
at a construction site. This has deeply 
saddened us as any fatality is 
unacceptable to us. We investigated all 
four incidents fully and introduced new 
crane and lifting standards and initiated 
training across our Group as a direct 
result of those investigations. We remain 
absolutely committed to zero harm 
across our operations.

Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
This year we achieved our best ever 
safety performance across all our 
measures, including a 20% drop in the 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) 
to 0.39. 
We continued to enthuse, educate 
and encourage every member of 
our workforce to embrace safety 
wholeheartedly and make line managers 
accountable for safety performance. 
INSTILLING A CULTURE OF ZERO HARM
As Vedanta operates in a dynamic work 
environment, safety improvement is a 
continuous process. Throughout the 
year, across business units and through 
a diversity of interventions, we have 
implemented a range of measures to 
further strengthen our performance. 
UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS
Identifying critical risks is imperative to 
strengthen risk-based decision making 
and to initiate remedial actions. Several 
risk identification exercises were carried 
out to have an in-depth understanding of 
the real challenges on the ground. 
DYNAMIC LEADERSHIP IN SAFETY ROLES 
Our HSE team comprises 365 
professionals. During the reporting year, 
in order to leverage our professional 
strengths, we identified 11 work 
streams focusing on leapfrogging our 
HSE performance. Each work stream 
has a Leader and Anchor to deliver the 
objectives. The work streams will build 
capacity within our team of professionals 
and will enable improvement in HSE 
performance across the Group.
MAKING BETTER RISK DECISIONS (MBRD) 
PROGRAMME 
Last year, we launched the MBRD 
programme – a combination of classroom 
and practical on-the-ground sessions, to 
empower line leaders to make better risk 
decisions. This programme is designed to 
help line leaders foresee risks relevant to 
their routine and non-routine work, and 
understanding the consequences 
associated with these risks. During the 
reporting period, 320 frontline leaders 
from the business were trained under the 
MBRD programme. We aim to extend 
MBRD training to 50% of Group 
employees across all businesses by 2020.
This year we conducted MBRD training 
in five of our businesses mentioned 
below:

GEARING UP FOR ZERO HARM
Once identified, we mitigate risks 
through stronger processes, effective 
training and better safety mechanisms. 
Additionally, employees are incentivised 
through awards for recognition of best 
practices on a weekly basis, and longer- 
term awards such as ‘Best employee of 
the month’ and ‘best kaizen initiative’.

We also engage our operations in critical 
risk evaluation and control through 
Experience Based Quantification (EBQ) 
and Bowtie Assessment (BTA) 
workshops to identify critical control 
measures and improve safety 
performance.
MAKING THE CHANGE HOLISTIC
To achieve a culture of zero harm, safety 
has to be holistic. Our safety protocols 
are cascaded through all our verticals 
through regular training initiatives. A 
series of comprehensive and long-term 
safety and health drives were conducted 
to further foster a culture of safety 
ownership.

ENVIRONMENT
OVERVIEW
Natural resources are a core element 
of many of the amenities cherished by 
the human civilization. Extraction of 
these resources is therefore necessary 
to sustain our quality of life. But 
the extraction, though of economic 
importance to developing nations, 
often comes with environmental costs. 
As a diversified natural resources 
company, we are focused on reducing 
the environmental impact of our 
operations wherever possible. 
Our sustainable development framework 
comprises comprehensive policies, 
standards and guidance notes that helps 
us manage our environmental impacts. 
Our focus areas during the year  
have included: decreasing water 
consumption; enhancing energy 
efficiency; safeguarding biodiversity; 
maintaining air quality; and recycling  
and upcycling waste. 
Our production of aluminium and power 
generation have increased significantly, 
hence energy consumption during the 
period has also increased. Despite this, 
we continued to improve our water and 
waste recycling rates and implemented 
biodiversity management plans across 
our operations. 
Environmental management was 
identified as one of the material issues 
for the FY2017 . Among them, water  
and waste management were our  
top priorities. 
WATER
Water management is a material issue 
for our businesses, which we address by 
using our resources carefully, recycling 
and reusing water wherever possible.
Our Group-level water policy and a water 
management standard integrates water 
management into the decision-making 
processes for all our new and existing 
projects, thereby ensuring that 
necessary measures are in place to 
avoid or minimise the impacts of our 
projects. Since we are located in 
geographies with varying water stress, 
our water management plans take this 
into consideration. At our Oil & Gas 
business, 97% of water is recycled, 
thereby significantly reducing the 
amount of saline ground water that we 
extract for our operations. At Bhagyam 
we have implemented water recycling 
through usage of reed bed wastewater 
treatment systems. 
Effluent and sewage treatment plants 
are in place across our operations to 
treat waste water generated, and the 
treated water is then used for cooling 
and other applications in the unit itself. 
 This reporting period we have 
strengthened implementation of the a 
Reduce – Recycle – Replenish model for 
water conservation. resulting in saving 
3.93 million m

ENERGY AND CARBON
We recognise that climate change  
poses a real threat to our way of life and 
managing it requires collective efforts. 
We are committed to optimize our 
energy consumption and investing in 
newer technologies and developing 
processes to enhance our energy 
efficiency.
Our energy management approach 
hinges on a two-pronged strategy: 
improving energy and process efficiency, 
while diversifying our energy portfolio to 
the extent possible.
To support our focus on improving 
energy efficiency, all our functional 
operations are now ISO 14001 certified. 
Additionally, 16 of our operations have 
received ISO 50001 certification. 
We have also introduced a long-term 
carbon strategy which is in line with the 
approach of our host country in 
managing climate change. A business-
wide Carbon Forum has been set up to 
deliberate upon and develop the carbon 
strategy, determine the short-term and 
long-term carbon intensity reduction 
goals, and develop and implement the 
carbon reduction pipeline. This Carbon 
Forum is led by the CEO of our Power 
division, and comprises business COOs 
and representatives from Corporate HSE 
and Sustainability.
To diversify our energy portfolio, we are 
evaluating the use of renewable energy 
sources including solar and wind.

We also calculate and report the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory i.e. Scope 1 
(process emissions and other direct emissions) and Scope 2 (purchased electricity)  
as defined under the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
and World Resource Institute (WRI) GHG protocols.  54
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
BIODIVERSITY
Our biodiversity management programme is developed to avoid, minimise or compensate the loss of biodiversity as a result  
of new projects or major expansions. We undertake an Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for any new project or  
major expansion to help us understand the presence of critical biodiversity areas in the proposed area of the project and develop 
biodiversity action plans to mitigate the impact of our operations. 
We have a dedicated Biodiversity Policy and Management Standard developed in line with international standards and guidelines 
such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Our businesses seek consultation from experts in identifying and managing 
biodiversity-related business risks. 
During the year we continued to implement our Biodiversity Action Plans across our operations. Some examples of biodiversity 
initiatives taken at our businesses are mentioned below:
TSPL
Under the Biodiversity Management Plan, we have developed a proper green belt all around the project boundary to check the air 
pollution, as well as provide a suitable place for other faunal groups to take shelter and contribute to enhancing the biodiversity.
HZL
In Rampura Agucha mine, we have taken up the initiative of plantation at the project site. This initiative is implemented every 
year and in FY2017 we planted around 25,000 trees.
BALCO
Under the Biodiversity Action Plan, we have initiated bird nest provision in and around the township of our operation.
The targeted date to achieve the plan is March 2018.
We have also initiated the Medicinal Garden development in Manipat. The targeted year to achieve the plan is March 2018.
RESPONDING PROACTIVELY TO THE BIODIVERSITY RISK
The Gamsberg mine is located in the Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot area – one of the four hotspots in South Africa and 
one of the 35 hotspots in the world. This area is home to more than 6,000 species of plants (40% of which are only found 
here) and also hosts 250 birds, 80 mammals and 32 reptile and amphibian species. Although the Gamsberg mine promises to 
reap rich economic returns, we have taken multiple steps to ensure that this doesn’t come at the cost of biodiversity:
❯ ❯ EMP (Environmental Management Programme) and BMP (Biodiversity Management Plan) are used to monitor and to 
guide the construction phase, so that we adhere to the environmental footprint.
❯ ❯ The plant species will be used during the rehabilitation of the mine as it demonstrates vast species from the Succulent 
Karoo biodiversity hotspot.
STERLITE COPPER
We have conducted a baseline assessment study using IBAT and we have drawn out plans and initiated/implemented the
following for the FY2016-17 .
❯ ❯ Ex-situ and in-situ conservation of medicinal plants
❯ ❯ Ex-situ and in-situ conservation of rare and threatened species of plants
❯ ❯ Conservation of indigenous agricultural gene pools
❯ ❯ Promotion of public health through control of malaria
❯ ❯ Encouragement of fisheries in reservoirs and other water bodies.

AIR QUALITY
We are committed to identifying and 
managing our emissions to air. As part 
of our ambient air quality monitoring 
process, we monitor Particulate 
Matter (PM) and SOx. We also monitor 
lead, fluoride and Polycyclic Aromatic 
Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions from 
our operations as applicable. There 
was an increase in stack emissions 
due to the increase in production in our 
Aluminium businesses and power plants. 
WASTE
According to our Resource Use and 
Waste Management Technical Standard, 
we follow the principle of first reducing 
the waste, quantitatively as well as 
qualitatively (reducing the toxicity), and 
then recovering and recycling where 
possible (either ourselves or through 
authorised recyclers). The last stage is 
disposal in landfill or by incineration, 
using authorised, licenced and secured 
landfills. We aim to remain 
environmentally friendly across all  
the stages.
Major waste generation from our 
operations are Non-Hazardous,  
High Volume and Low Effect waste. 
Hazardous waste includes used/spent 
oil, waste refractories, aluminium dross, 
spent pot lining and residual sludge from 
smelters, while the High Volume and 
Low Effect waste includes fly ash, red 
mud and phospho gypsum.

Lisheen mine - Closure, restoration  
and aftercare management plan 
Mining activity at the Lisheen Mine in 
Ireland was concluded in November 
2015, with mining ceasing in December 
2015 after 17 years of operation. 
Focusing on physical closure of the 
mine and aftercare of the site, a best 
practice mine closure plan has been 
implemented to fully address regulatory 
authority permit requirements. The 
cessation of mining at Lisheen was not 
the end of the story, as the mine is now 
in an ‘active closure’ phase. The closure 
programme is among the world’s finest 
examples of environmentally sensitive 
mine closure and rehabilitation. Socio-
economic and environmental initiatives 
taken by the company to ensure 
well-being of the community and the 
environment. Some of the key focus 
areas the of closure plan are:
❯ ❯ Ensuring that the underground 
workings cannot collapse, leading to 
surface subsidence.
❯ ❯ Removing all surface and 
underground plant and equipment.
❯ ❯ Allowing the mine workings to refill 
with clean water.
❯ ❯ Blocking and sealing all access to 
the underground workings.
❯ ❯ Fully engineered covering of the 
tailings deposition facility to provide 
a multiple of possible after-uses 
from, animal grazing to solar power 
or energy crops.
❯ ❯ Creating a space that will be 
attractive to other industries.
❯ ❯ Supporting Lisheen staff during the 
closure, from upskilling and training 
grants to redeployment at other 
Vedanta operations.

HUMAN RIGHTS
For us, upholding human rights is a 
fundamental responsibility and of 
particular importance since the majority 
of our operations are in developing 
countries. It is a material consideration 
across all our business decisions.
Our Human Rights Policy is aligned to 
the UN Guiding Principles on business 
and human rights, and includes strict 
prohibition of child or forced labour – 
either directly or through contract labour.
Additionally, our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics underpins our 
approach to protect the fundamental 
rights of all our direct and indirect 
employees, communities and immediate 
supply chain. 
We uphold our workers’ right to freedom 
of association at all our operations. The 
collective bargaining agreements are 
formed based on transparent and fair 
discussions between the management 
and union representatives. Our  
Suppliers Code of Conduct is 
implemented as part of the terms and 
conditions of supplier contracts across 
the Group and all new suppliers are 
required to sign, endorse and practice 
this Code. We also have in place a 
Supplier & Contractor Sustainability 
Management Policy. Both the Code  
and the Policy clearly communicate  
our expectations from our suppliers: to 
operate in compliance with all relevant 
legislation and follow our policies while 
executing work for or on our behalf.
Child, forced or compulsory labour is a 
non-negotiable offence at Vedanta – be it 
direct or through a contractor. We have 
systems in place to strictly enforce this 
policy at all our operations. Further, we 
carry out periodic inspections of our 
remote mine locations and require proof 
of age for all contract workers. 
MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015
The UK Parliament constituted the Modern Slavery Act (MSA) to tackle the issues 
of slavery and human trafficking. The law helps to enhance investor, employee 
and consumer confidence and trust in an organisation by building a foundation of 
strong ethical standards. 
Last year, we had proposed a number of steps through which we would be 
incorporating the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in our operations. Implementation of 
the compliance framework for MSA has been a prime focus area for our 
Sustainability Committee this reporting period. 
Under the current framework implementation, we have put in place a system of 
training of vendors/suppliers, due diligence and self-declaration. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Contract Conditions was also updated with a 
provision on compliance to MSA. 
Based on our assessment, we identified close to 145 suppliers under the Very 
High and High risk categories with regard to. MSA compliance. Out of these 145, 
we terminated our association with 17 suppliers with immediate effect. 
Of the remaining 128 suppliers, 117 were identified for audit in the audit cycle  
of the current financial year. They were subjected to an independent MSA audit 
by PwC. The site visit for the audit team involved initial awareness sessions  
for relevant people on key MSA provisions, verification of documents/records, 
and interviews. 
Audit findings have been shared with the individual businesses’ commercial 
departments for incorporating the recommendations and initiating the vendors 
towards improvement of standards and strict adherence to the law. Commercial 
process and procedures of vendor selection and engagement will be reviewed 
going forward in view of the findings of the audit to resolve systemic.

ADDING AND SHARING VALUE
AS OUR OPERA TIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY 
IN THE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES OF INDIA 
AND AFRICA, WE BELIEVE WE HA VE AN 
IMPORT ANT ROLE TO PLAY IN DEVELOPING 
THE SOCIETIES AND COMMUNITIES WHERE 
WE OPERATE
OUR APPROACH
We remain committed to giving back 
to our stakeholders who play a vital 
role in powering our growth. As our 
operations are predominantly in the 
developing economies of India and 
Africa, we believe we have an important 
role to play in developing the societies 
and communities where we operate. 
Reducing the social and economic 
divide through generating economic 
value, distributing wealth, investing 
in employees and enhancing the 
standard of living are key elements of 
our sustainability framework. We not 
only drive economic growth through 
taxes, royalties, wages and supplier 
contracts, but our operations also 
process natural resources which help 
provide the products these communities 
need to further their development. 
COMMUNITIES
We proactively engage with indigenous 
communities to resolve any concerns they 
have to ensure free, prior and informed 
consent prior to commencing operations. 
Once we have developed our operations, 
we undertake focused CSR activities 
which create positive social impacts. 
We strongly advocate social 
development that is underpinned by 
collaborative efforts. A majority of our 
initiatives are identified, developed and 
carried out in collaboration with local 
government bodies and community 
organisations. This ‘Public-Private-People-
Partnership’ (4Ps) model has inspired us 
to participate in ambitious long-term 
projects such as Project Nand Ghar.
PROJECT NAND GHAR 
This is our flagship intervention in the 
space of children’s learning and health. 
In FY2016, Vedanta signed an MoU 
with the Ministry of Women & Child 
Development to construct 4,000 new-
age Nand Ghars (Anganwadis) across 
India. Over and above quality pre-
school education, we have envisioned 
these Nand Ghars as a convergence 
point for a number of Government 
programmes such as clean water, 
sanitation facilities and electricity, with 
additional services such as primary 
healthcare and entrepreneurship training. 
TAKING NAND GHARS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Education: We have developed a 
40-week intensive course curriculum 
incorporating interactive e-learning, 
learning kits, critical thinking and wall 
designs for pre-school education 
at our Nand Ghars. This is the 
first time such a massive effort 
has been undertaken in India.
Health: Each cluster of 25-30 
Anganwadis will have access to a fully 
functional Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) 
which provides essential primary 
healthcare services. During the reporting 
period, two such MMUs were 
operationalised. 
Entrepreneurship: Modelled on the 
lines of Nobel Peace Prize-winning 
microfinance organisation Grameen 
Bank, women will be provided 
end-to-end support for promoting 
entrepreneurship at each Nand Ghar 
through the following steps:
❯ ❯ Mobilisation of women for training.
❯ ❯ Providing basic orientation on 
entrepreneurship, including 
identification of business 
opportunities and basics of marketing. 
❯ ❯ Handholding in identification of local 
business opportunities, creating a 
business plan. 
❯ ❯ Mobilising credit without seeking 
collaterals. 
❯ ❯ Handholding the women through the 
ventures through support in 
marketing.
❯ ❯ More than 1,600 women benefited 
from the training programme and 158 
have started their micro enterprises

OUR KEY AREAS OF FOCUS INCLUDE: 
EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
Under several CSR activities undertaken, 
such as Vedanta Bal Chetna Anganwadi 
(VBCA) Programme and Beti Bachao, 
Beti Padhao Abhiyan, we impacted the 
lives of almost 260,000 children through 
our school programmes. Another 
100,000 children under six years old 
were reached through our pre-school 
initiatives. We provided support to 
students and colleges to increase 
access to technical education. We 
recognise that education is the single 
most important factor in advancing 
gender equality and empowerment and 
our businesses have also introduced 
a number of short and long-term 
programmes to provide education 
for girls. These programmes have 
significantly improved the percentage 
of girls passing their final exams. 
We are also working on developing the 
skills of rural women to be able to find 
employment opportunities.
DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION
Our business-wide needs assessment 
conducted two years ago identified the 
lack of access to medical and sanitation 
facilities and personal hygiene in rural 
India. In addition to providing support 
to local governments for ensuring 
access to health and sanitation facilities 
in remote locations, we continue to 
support the WASH pledge initiative 
of the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
by providing adequate access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation facilities 
to our workforce across all sites.

CAIRN INDIA PROJECT TO PROVIDE  
DRINKING WATER
Barmer, Rajasthan (Cairn): Our Oil 
& Gas business (Cairn), under a 
Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with Public Health and 
Engineering Department (PHED) of 
Rajasthan, is establishing 331 RO 
plants across Barmer District. These 
plants have varying capacities from 
1,000 to 3,000 litres per hour and will 
be installed over the next three years 
to provide safe drinking water to a 
large number of people (estimated 
in excess of 1 million) living in 800 
villages. One of India’s leading water 
treatment solution providers, Fontus 
Water, is the implementing partner for 
the project.

PEOPLE AND CULTURE
We have employees from across 
the world and we are committed to 
providing all our employees with a 
safe and healthy work environment. In 
addition, by creating a culture which 
embodies our core values and nurtures 
innovation, creativity and diversity, 
we enable them to grow personally 
and professionally while also helping 
us to meet our business goals. 
We are committed to providing equal 
opportunities to our employees 
irrespective of their race, nationality, 
religion, gender or age. We are leading 
amongst the natural resource industries 
with regard to gender diversity. 13% of 
our senior management are women. 
Since most of our operations are in 
remote and poorer areas, we also 
focus on recruiting our employees 
from among the local population. A 
significant percentage of the senior 
management and our employees 
are recruited from the country in 
which our operations are located. 
RECRUITMENT 
We have focused our activities during 
the year on recruiting skilled 
professionals. 
We launched a ‘Global Internship 
Programme’ (GIP). Through this 
programme, the idea is to bring on board 
professionals who can share a fresh 
perspective and in the process gain 
exposure to the business by working 
on live projects under the mentorship 
of the leadership team. Through this 
programme we engaged with the Ivy 
League Business Schools, including 
Harvard Business School, Wharton and 
London Business School, and hired 
10 students from London Business 
School with different nationalities 
and diverse experience in consulting, 
defense, mining and technology.
TALENT MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
We have put a range of internal 
processes and innovative programmes 
in place to aid all-round professional 
development and personal 
well-being and provide career 
opportunities. These include a wide 
range of job rotation, mentoring, 
coaching and training initiatives. 
During the year we have particularly 
focused our activities on giving greater 
visibility to and developing the leadership 
potential of our younger professionals 
through career development 
programmes. 
We organised Internal Growth 
Workshops across the businesses 
to identify, develop and promote 
‘New Leaders’ both in ‘Technical’ 
and ‘Enabling’ core functions. Our 
senior management team anchored 
the initiative, identifying the new 
leaders through a structured process. 
Once identified, these individuals 
were then given accelerated growth 
opportunities by way of transformational 
roles for delivering business goals. 
Finally, we have implemented an 
incentive programme to encourage 
entrepreneurship by rewarding 
employees who develop new and 
innovative technologies for the business.
FOCUS AREA: FUTURE LEADERSHIP
Vedanta attracts the best talent given 
its core strengths of high-quality 
performance, governance and value-
based architecture. The challenge is 
to train this talent to become highly 
competent professionals capable 
of taking up leadership roles in the 
organisation. We believe that the 
dynamism, agility and passion of young 
professionals will take us into the next 
growth orbit. This led to the inception 
of Internal Growth Workshops. 
Objectives of Internal Growth  
Workshops:
❯ ❯ Identifying young leaders through 
a structured process and engaging 
stakeholders and business heads 
❯ ❯ Developing highly competent 
leaders and motivating them to 
perform exceptionally 
❯ ❯ Evaluating corrective actions, 
providing growth and recognition 
wherever required
Internal Growth Workshops –  
the story so far:
❯ ❯ 1,200 high performers covered in 
over 50 workshops held so far 300 
new leaders already in place, 
including technical and enabling 
functions across Vedanta
❯ ❯ 20% of positions taken up by 
women professionals, fulfilling the 
gender diversity as a key point 
with the purpose to provide 
growth
DEVELOPING FUTURE 
LEADERS   
CASE STUDY
Communication is vital for 
good human resource 
management. Engaging with 
the employees makes them 
more productive, better 
aligned and more committed. 
It also manifests in smooth 
and effective functioning of 
the organisation.

FINANCE REVIEW
KEY FINANCIAL PRIORITIES 
INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS’ RETURNS WHILE 
CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN THE BALANCE 
SHEET 
DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION: FOCUSING ON 
FREE CASH FLOW
During the year, there has been a 
significant ramp up of production at 
our Aluminium, Power and Iron Ore 
businesses, in line with guidance. 
With a significant amount of the capital 
investment programme completed, 
our operations have been generating 
positive cash flow over the years. We 
will be able to reach our full capacities 
with only limited capex requirement 
and, consequently, our cash flows 
are poised for a further improvement 
in the current price environment. 
The Company is pursuing value-
accretive organic growth, in line with 
our approach towards prudent capital 
allocation, through activities such as 
our Gamsberg zinc project and the 
next set of oil & gas opportunities 
at the Rajasthan Block. Both zinc 
and oil are commodities that have a 
particularly favourable outlook, which 
we expect to deliver strong results.
The Company has a Group-level 
Executive Committee that evaluates 
potential capital expenditure based on 
its risk and returns profile, and sets 
the priorities while considering the 
dynamics of the macro environment. 
We only invest in high return projects 
in businesses that pass the test of 
achieving the hurdle rate criteria. 
Cash outflow on capex, excluding capital 
creditors was US$668 million during 
FY2017 compared with US$566 million 
in FY2016.
DELEVERAGING: STRENGTHENING THE  
BALANCE SHEET
In line with our stated financial strategy 
to extend maturities and strengthen the 
balance sheet, we have been successful 
in extending our maturing debt 
through rollovers/refinancing of debt, 
new debt issuances and repayments 
from internal cash generation during 
the year, both at Vedanta plc and its 
subsidiaries. During the year, we 
successfully issued a US$1 .0 billion 
bond in January 2017 , proactively 
refinancing and extending part of our 
2018 and 2019 bond maturities. Post 
31 March 2017 we have already reduced 
another US$1 .4 billion of gross debt.
The Company continues to have strong 
liquidity with cash and liquid investments 
of US$9.7 billion and undrawn 
committed facilities of US$0.9 billion.
During the year, the rating agency 
Moody’s upgraded the Company’s 
Corporate Family Rating (CFR) by 
one notch from B2/Negative Outlook 
to B1/ Stable Outlook. The rating 
agency Standard & Poor’s upgraded 
the Company’s rating by one notch 
from B/Stable Outlook to B+/Stable 
Outlook. We are focused on further 
strengthening our credit profile to 
target to attain investment grade.
CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON COST AND MAXIMISING 
OPERATIONAL POTENTIAL
We maintain a relentless focus on cost 
optimisation and aspire to be one of 
the lowest cost producers across our 
operations. In 2015, we set a target 
to deliver cost and marketing savings 
of US$1 .3 billion, and we have already 
delivered cumulative savings of US$814 
million over the past 24 months and 
are also keeping the programme 
fresh. We believe that digitisation of 
mining processes will lead to improved 
efficiencies and costs. We also have 
a renewed programme on vendor 
optimisation and quality score carding 
which will help us improve our vendor 
interaction in terms of the quality of 
partnerships leading to efficiency and 
cost benefits. Furthermore, we are 
looking at various mutually beneficial 
outsourcing models where service 
providers with technology can help 
improve volumes, recoveries and 
exploration efforts. The Group will 
continue to stay contemporary in terms 
of trends, ideas and best practices 
to keep this cost bucket fresh. 
LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE 
During the year, total shareholders’ 
return was c.150%. We believe in the 
philosophy of working and growing with 
our investors. We recently announced a 
new dividend policy at Vedanta Limited 
and earlier in the year at Zinc India. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: OPERATIONAL 
PERFORMANCE AND THE COMMODITY UPTURN
During FY2017 , a combination of ramp 
up of operations, cost and marketing 
savings and improved commodity prices 
over the lows of FY2016, all resulted 
in a strong EBITDA of US$3.2 billion 
with robust margin of 36% (FY2016: 
EBITDA US$2.3 billion, margins 28%). 
The upturn in commodity prices 
resulted in increased EBITDA by 
US$552 million. Most of the operating 
currencies depreciated against the 
US dollar during FY2017 , resulting in 
a favourable foreign exchange impact 
on EBITDA of US$105 million. 
Stable mined metal volumes at our Zinc 
business (as per guidance) were 
supported by the higher volume from 
Iron Ore and Aluminium business with 
the full operations of our Power portfolio. 
Overall, this resulted in an EBITDA 
impact of US$151 million. 
Depreciation and amortisation expenses 
were lower given the impairment in 
FY2016, primarily at our Oil & Gas 
business and the Lisheen mine closure 
in November 2015. As a result, operating 
profit (before special items) increased by 
US$1 .3 billion to US$2.2 billion, during 
the year.
FCF

 was US$1 .5 billion, which 
represented 48% EBITDA conversion. 
Gross debt increased by c.US$2.0 billion 
to US$18.2 billion (FY2016: US$16.3 
billion), primarily due to temporary 
borrowings at Zinc India to finance the 
special dividend outflow requirements of 
US$1 .2 billion and preference shares of 
US$0.5 billion to be issued on account of 
the Cairn merger. Gross debt reduced by 
US$1 .4 billion post March 2017 until 
24 May 2017 . 
CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT 
Operating profit increased by US$6.5 
billion to US$2.1 billion in FY2017 
(FY2016: Operating loss: US$4.3 billion) 
driven by prior year impairment charges 
of US$5.2 billion, predominantly related 
to Cairn India. 
In FY2017 , operating profit before special 
items increased by US$1 .3 billion to 
US$2.2 billion (FY2016: US$0.9 billion) 
driven by stronger operational 
performance and improved price 
environment.

1  The variance is driven by impairment charges in prior year.
a) Prices 
Our operating profit before special 
items benefited significantly from our 
strong operational performance on 
volumes and cost as well as the upturn 
and positive sentiment in commodity 
prices. Commodity price fluctuations 
significantly impact the Group’s 
business. Our usual policy is to sell 
products at prevailing market prices 
and not to enter into price hedging 
arrangements. The only exception 
is custom smelting and purchased 
alumina, where back-to-back hedging 
is used to mitigate pricing risks.
Oil & gas: The average Brent price 
for the year was US$48.6 per barrel, 
higher by 2% compared with US$47 .5 
per barrel during FY2016, and was 
also supported by a lower discount 
to Brent during the year (FY2017: 
10.8%; FY2016: 13.6%), increasing 
operating profit by US$48 million.
Zinc, lead and silver: Average zinc LME 
prices during FY2017 were up by 29% to 
US$2,368 per tonne. Lead LME prices 
were up by 13% to US$2,005 per tonne, 
and silver was up by 17% to US$17 .8 
per ounce. Together, these increased 
operating profits by $478 million.
Aluminium: Average aluminium LME 
prices were up by 6% to US$1,688 
per tonne in FY2017 , increasing 
operating profit by US$85 million.
Copper: Average copper LME prices 
were down by 1% to US$5,152 per 
tonne in FY2017 , adversely affecting 
Zambian operating profit by US$5 million.
Iron ore: Iron Ore Karnataka prices 
realisation increased by 31% to 
US$18.1 per tonne (FY2016: US$13.8 
per tonne) primarily on account 
of an increase in National Mineral 
Development Corporation (NMDC) 
prices. This resulted in an increase in 
operating profit of US$17 million. 
Others: Lower energy prices on the 
back of a weaker power market had 
an adverse effect of US$27 million.
These impacts totalled US$596 million, 
with a US$43 million decrease targets 
due to lower premiums in aluminium and 
copper, partly offset by higher premiums 
in zinc. The combined increase in prices 
and premiums resulted in a positive 
movement of US$552 million.
b) Direct raw material inflation
Key input commodity prices increased 
during FY2017 , including alumina, coal, 
coking coal, fuel, petroleum products 
and iron ore, impacting operating profit 
marginally by US$2 million.
c) Foreign exchange fluctuation
Most of our operating currencies 
depreciated against the US dollar during 
FY2017 compared with FY2016. Weaker 
currencies are favourable to Vedanta, 
given the local cost base and 
predominantly US dollar-linked pricing. 
During FY2017 , the US dollar 
strengthened against the Indian rupee to 
an average of 67 .09 Indian rupees/US$, 
compared to 65.46 Indian rupees/US$ in 
FY2016. At Zinc International, the South 
African rand depreciated by 2.1% to 
14.07 (FY2016: 13.78). The Zambian 
kwacha (ZMW) depreciated by 2.5% to 
9.95 (FY2016: 9.71).  64

Zambian kwacha 9.95 9.71 2.5% 9.66 11.24
During FY2017 , the USD dollar 
depreciated against the Zambian kwacha 
(ZMW) to ZMW 9.66/US$ on 31 March 
2017 (31 March 2016: ZMW 11 .24/US$). 
This favourable foreign exchange 
movement positively impacted operating 
profit by US$81 million in the year, driven 
by the gain on the kwacha-denominated 
VAT receivable from the Government of 
the Republic of Zambia. During the 
comparable prior period, the sharp 
appreciation of the US dollar against the 
ZMW adversely impacted operating 
profits by US$31 million. 
All currency movement against the US 
dollar net of translation increased 
operating profits by US$105 million 
compared to the prior year. 
d) Profit petroleum to GOI at Cairn 
The profit petroleum outflow to the 
Government of India (GOI), as per the 
production sharing contract (PSC), 
increased by US$52 million. The increase 
was driven by lower capex and opex 
during the year, and was partially offset 
by a lower provision for past costs 
compared to the previous year. 
e) Regulatory
During FY2017 , regulatory headwinds 
impacted operating profit by US$47 
million. 
Regulatory levies such as the increase in 
the Clean Energy Cess on coal (US$67 
million), electricity duty (US$15 million), 
District Mineral Foundation (DMF) 
(US$11 million), and others such as the 
increase in RPO and IPP coal rates 
(US$4 million), were partially offset by a 
lower oil energy cess (US$50 million). 
f) V olumes
In line with the ramp up in capacities 
during FY2017 , we achieved record 
production at our Aluminium, Power, Iron 
Ore and Copper businesses. These 
contributed to the increased operating 
profit of US$151 million, which was 
partially offset by lower volumes at Oil & 
Gas, Zinc India and Zinc International. 
Zinc India (negative US$37 million): 
Integrated zinc metal production was 
lower by 12% year-on-year and 
integrated lead metal production was 
lower by 1% year-on-year. This was 
driven by a lower availability of mined 
metal in H1 due to the cyclical pattern of 
the yearly plan for the Rampura Agucha 
open cast mine. We had a record level of 
integrated silver production of 14.55 
million ounces, 7% higher year-on-year, 
driven by higher volumes from the 
Sindesar Khurd and Zawar mines.
Zinc International (negative US$24 
million): Production was affected by the 
planned closure of the Lisheen mine in 
November 2015. 
Cairn India (negative US$51 million): 
Production was lower, primarily through 
volume loss due to natural decline, but 
this was partly offset by the successful 
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) project at 
Mangala.
Iron Ore (positive US$90 million): 
During FY2017 , mining limits were 
achieved at Goa (5.5 million tonnes per 
annum) and Karnataka (2.3 million 
tonnes per annum) with additional 
approved mining production of 2.6 
million tonnes in Goa.
Power (positive US$105 million): 
Record volumes were achieved with the 
commissioning of the remaining units at 
Talwandi Sabo and BALCO during 
FY2017 . 
Aluminium (positive US$45 million): 
Ramp up of capacities resulted in strong 
production during the year.
Together, the above factors and marginal 
increase in Copper and other businesses 
(US$23 million) resulted in an increase in 
operating profit before special items of 
US$151 million.
g) Cost-saving and marketing 
initiatives
We launched Company-wide cost saving 
initiatives and price realisation 
improvements during FY2016. 
Our cost-saving and marketing initiatives 
have already yielded positive results, 
contributing US$194 million to operating 
profit during FY2017 over FY2016; and 
we expect them to yield further benefits 
going forward. We have achieved a 
cumulative saving of over US$814 million 
under this programme in last 24 months 
compared with the FY2015 baseline. This 
programme is progressing ahead of the 
original plan, announced in FY2015 to 
deliver US$1 .3 billion of cumulative 
savings by H1 of FY2019. 
The reported savings are on a total cost 
of ownership (TCO) methodology and do 
not include benefits or extra spend due 
to input commodity inflation/deflation, 
nor regulatory or technology changes. 
Over FY2017 we widened our coverage 
for cost-saving initiatives into areas 
including operations improvement, 
effective utilisation of mining equipment, 
improvised methods of mining, metal 
recovery improvement, logistics, quality 
control and operation planning across all 
our businesses with the following set of 
initiatives: 
 ❯ sourcing and logistics by leveraging 
technology and quality controls in 
fuels and commodities, haulage 
capacities and third party logistics 
management;
 ❯ low-cost country sourcing or sourcing 
of spares from original part 
manufacturers; 
 ❯ renegotiations of service/supply 
contracts based on vendor clean sheet 
costing/vendor profit and loss analysis;
 ❯ improvement in metal recovery 
through multiple technical initiatives;
 ❯ enhanced use of geo-technical tools 
for better mine planning, drilling and 
blasting, in order to reduce dilution in 
ore grade (external stope) at mines;
 ❯ outsourcing of mine operations 
resulting in consolidation of multiple 
contracts, improved efficiencies and 
productivity;
 ❯ alternative fuels/input raw materials;
 ❯ improvement in the truck fill-factor at 
mines, and an increase in haulage 
capacity through better monitoring 
and education of operators, resulting 
in a reduction in ore handling cost and 
enhanced production; 
 ❯ renegotiations, reverse auctions, 
deployment of higher capacity trucks, 
and backhauling and improvement in 
trucks’ turnaround time, resulting in a 
10-15% reduction in logistics cost; and 65

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 ❯ deploying innovative technologies, 
and establishing better supplier 
relationship management and sales 
and operations planning.
h) Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation reduced 
by US$425 million during FY2017 
compared with FY2016. Of the total 
reduction, US$282 million was due to 
lower amortisation on account of 
impairment in Oil & Gas in FY2016. 
Depreciation at Oil & Gas was down by 
US$134 million due to lower entitlement 
interest volume. Depreciation at KCM 
decreased by US$66 million as a major 
portion of Nchanga underground assets 
were fully depreciated in FY2016 post 
reaching its mine life. A lower 
depreciation charge of US$27 million at 
Lisheen in Zinc International was due to 
the closure of the mine in November 
2015. The decrease in depreciation and 
amortisation was partly offset by the 
commissioning of new capacities at 
Aluminium and Power businesses. 
i) Others
These items are primarily driven by 
one-off adjustments, provisions or 
reversals and lower profitability at other 
allied businesses, together adversely 
impacting operating profit by US$46 
million over the base year.
REVENUE
Revenue was up by 7% at US$11,520 
million compared with US$10,738 million 
in FY2016. The table on the right 
indicates the movement by segment. 
The increase was primarily driven by 
improved zinc and aluminium metal 
prices, improved volumes on account of 
our aluminium ramp up, full year 
operations at Iron Ore post resumption 
in August 2015, and all three units being 
operational at Talwandi Saboo. This was 
partially offset by lower volumes at Zinc 
India (in accordance with the mine plan), 
Cairn India due to natural decline, KCM 
largely due to issues pertaining to lower 
equipment availability, and the mine 
closure at Lisheen. 
The combined impact of LME, premium 
and currency movements of 4.2% and 
improved volume performance of 3.1% 
resulted in an overall revenue increase of 
7 .3% compared to prior year.

EBITDA AND EBITDA MARGIN
EBITDA for FY2017 improved by 37% to 
US$3,191 million. This was primarily 
driven by firmer prices, the ramp up at 
our Aluminium and Power businesses, 
restarting of operations at Iron Ore and 
cost efficiencies across the business, 
partially offset by lower volumes at Zinc, 
Cairn India and KCM (see ‘Operating 
profit variance’ for more details).
In FY2017 , EBITDA margin was 28%, 
compared with 22% in FY2016. Adjusted 
EBITDA margin was 36% compared with 
28% in FY2016. 
The main margin contributors across the 
individual businesses were:
 ❯ Oil & Gas (43% to 49%) – lower opex, 
lower quality discount to Brent and 
cess reduction, partially offset by 
lower volumes;
 ❯ Zinc International (17% to 42%) – 
improved LME prices, a one-off 
royalty refund at BMM and an 
insurance receipt at Skorpion against 
the fire incident in early 2015, partially 
offset by lower volumes;
 ❯ Copper Zambia (-2% to 1%) – local 
currency appreciation on VAT 
receivable and lower costs, partially 
offset by lower integrated volumes;
 ❯ Aluminium (6% to 17%) – improved 
LME prices, cost efficiencies and 
volume ramp up;
 ❯ Power (28% to 29%) – 
commissioning of new power units, 
mainly at Talwandi Saboo;
 ❯ Zinc India (47% to 56%) – improved 
LME prices and a one-off provision 
provided in previous year, offset by 
lower volumes; and
 ❯ Copper India (11% to 8%) – lower 
treatment charges and refining 
charges (TC/RC), by-product credits, 
acid volumes and margin, and a 
one-off Target Plus Scheme (TPS) 
benefit in FY2016.
SPECIAL ITEMS
Special items was US$17 million in 
FY2017 (FY2016: US$5,210 million) 
primarily on account of impairment of 
aged assets under construction in 
Aluminium partial offset by an 
impairment reversal at Cairn India. In the 
previous year, impairment charges were 
primarily related to the Oil & Gas 
business. 
NET INTEREST
Finance costs increased by 8% to 
US$1,382 million in FY2017 (FY2016: 
US$1,280 million). This was due to 
commissioning of new capacities in the 
Aluminium and Power businesses, an 
increase in Indian rupee-denominated 
borrowings in the borrowing mix, and a 
one-off impact of c.US$40 million for 
bond buy-back activity in line with our 
strategy of extending the near-term 
maturities. This was partially offset by 
the accounting treatment of interest at 
the Jharsuguda-II smelter, which was 
earlier expensed when the project 
start-up was temporarily on hold, and is 
now being capitalised as and when 
aluminium capacities are ramped up. The 
average borrowing cost of the Group 
was 7 .5% (7 .3% in FY2016).
Investment revenue in FY2017 
decreased to US$643 million (FY2016: 
US$698 million). This was primarily 
driven by lower cash and liquid 
investments at Zinc India due to a 
special dividend payout in April 2016, 
partially offset by mark-to-market (MTM) 
gains accruing in a falling interest rate 
environment in India, where most of the 
Group’s cash and investments reside. 
The average post-tax return on 
investment of the Group was 7 .55% 
(7 .2% in FY2016).
The combination of higher finance costs 
and lower investment revenues led to an 
increase of US$157 million in net interest 
expense during FY2017 .
OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES
Other gains and losses include the 
impact of MTM on foreign currency 
borrowings, primarily at Vedanta’s Indian 
businesses, and the restatement of 
Indian rupee assets in dollar ledger at the 
Oil & Gas business. The Indian rupee 
appreciated against the US dollar during 
FY2017 by 2% (66.33 to 64.84), 
compared with a 6% fall in FY2016 
(62.59 to 66.33). 
As a result, the MTM cost in FY2017 
was US$24 million (FY2016: US$73 
million).
TAXATION
The Effective Tax Rate (ETR) (excluding 
tax impact on special items and dividend 
distribution tax) in FY2017 was 18% 
(FY2016: 3%). The higher tax rate was 
primarily on account of phasing out of 
the tax holiday benefits from 100% to 
30% at Zinc India and expiry of tax 
holiday benefit in the Oil & Gas business 
from FY2016. 
FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED 67
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The tax impact on special items was 
US$5 million in FY2017 (FY2016: 
US$1,737 million). Dividend distribution 
tax for FY2017 was US$245 million 
(FY2016: US$249 million).
ATTRIBUTABLE (LOSS)/PROFIT
The attributable loss before special items 
was US$7 million, compared with an 
attributable loss of US$393 million in the 
previous year, mainly driven by higher 
EBITDA due to better commodity prices 
and improved volumes, and lower 
depreciation and amortisation costs 
following impairment, primarily in the Oil 
& Gas division. These were partially 
offset by higher tax and net interest 
expenses. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share for the period was 
8.2 US cents (FY2016: loss of 665.8 US 
cents). Excluding the impact of special 
items and other gains and losses, the 
underlying EPS was 1 .1 US cents per 
share (FY2016: loss of 131 .9 US cents).
FUND FLOW
The Group generated free cash flow 
(FCF) of US$1 .5 billion, representing 
48% EBITDA conversion into FCF . This 
was driven by strong operating 
performance, continued focus on the 
cost saving programme and disciplined 
capex outflow.
Even after substantial growth in EBITDA, 
FCF was lower during FY2017 compared 
to FY2016. The key drivers were:
a)  Working capital movements: During 
FY2017 , working capital movement 
was lower by c.US$870 million 
compared with FY2016, primarily due 
to one-time special initiatives taken 
during FY2016. Against the 
expectation of unwinding some of the 
one-time initiatives taken last year, we 
successfully maintained the initiatives 
at similar levels during FY2017 . The 
positives were partly offset by a 
temporary increase of mined metal 
inventory at our Zinc India and Iron 
Ore businesses. 
b)  Tax outflow: A higher Minimum 
Alternate Tax (MAT), primarily at the 
Zinc India business, was due to a 
reduction in the tax holiday.
c)  Net interest: Net interest cost 
increased, due mainly to a reduction 
in the invested amount. This followed 
the special dividend outflow by the 
Zinc India business to minorities in 
April 2016.

from operations more appropriately, and previous year amounts have been reclassified to ensure consistency. 
2 Includes foreign exchange movements and preference shares of US$464 million to be issued in relation to Cairn merger.
The negative effects were partially offset 
by improved EBITDA and efficient capital 
allocation by prioritising capital on 
high-return, low-risk projects: primarily, 
mining capex at the Zinc India and Zinc 
International businesses, EOR and 
gas-related projects in the Oil & Gas 
business, and a ramp up at the 
Aluminium and Power businesses.
NET DEBT
We remain focused on optimising our 
opex and capex, increasing FCF and 
improving the maturity profile of the debt 
portfolio. The FCF , as explained above, 
helped to reduce the net debt by US$1 .5 
billion. However, overall net debt 
increased by US$1 .2 billion during the 
year (FY2017: US$8.5 billion; FY2016 
US$7 .3 billion) due to payment of a 
special dividend to minorities and the 
associated dividend distribution tax by 
Zinc India and preference shares to be 
issued under the scheme of 
arrangement for the merger between 
the Company and Cairn India. 
Zinc India, an independent Group 
subsidiary, declared a special dividend of 
US$2.1 billion including DDT at its Board 
meeting in March 2017 . This is the 
second year in succession that a Zinc 
India board has considered a special 
interim dividend.
DEBT MATURITY PROFILE AND REFINANCING
Gross debt as at 31 March 2017 was 
US$18.2 billion (31 March 2016: US$16.3 
billion). The increase in borrowings was 
primarily to fund the special dividend 
payment at Zinc India with temporary 
short-term borrowings, and the effect of 
the appreciating Indian rupee and 
preference shares to be issued on 
account of the Cairn merger.
Of our total gross debt of US$14.3 billion 
(excluding US$1 .6 billion working capital 
loans and temporary borrowing at Zinc 
India to fund the dividend and US$2.3 
billion short-term borrowings), term debt 
at our subsidiaries was US$8.1 billion, 
with the balance in the holding company. 
The total undrawn fund based credit limit 
was c.US$0.9 billion as at 31 March 2017 .

We have been successful in extending 
our maturing debt through rollovers,  
new debt and repayments from internal 
accruals during the year, both at Vedanta 
plc and its subsidiaries. In line with our 
stated financial strategy to proactively 
refinance the debt and extend the 
near-term maturities, we successfully 
issued a US$1 .0 billion bond in January 
2017 to refinance proactively part of our 
2018 and 2019 bond maturities.
Vedanta plc: The upcoming US$1 .0 billion 
debt maturing at Vedanta plc comprises 
term loans out of which US$7 4 million 
has been repaid in April 2017 and the 
balance will be repaid or refinanced.  
Of the FY2019 term maturities, US$379 
million has already been paid in April 
2017 through an early redemption of  
the bond maturing in July 2018. 
Subsidiary: Of the US$1 .9 billion debt 
maturing during FY2018 (excluding 
US$1 .6 billion working capital loans and 
the temporary borrowing at Zinc India  
to fund the dividend and US$2.3 billion 
short-term borrowings which, as 
previously, will be rolled over in the 
normal way), we have already repaid 
c.US$1 .0 billion after 31 March, 2017 .  
The balance will either be repaid from 
opening cash and liquid investment and 
cash generation from operations, or 
refinanced through other sources such 
as NCDs and term loans.
Cash and liquid investments stood at 
US$9,725 million at 31 March 2017 
(31 March 2016: US$8,937 million). The 
portfolio continues to be conservatively 
invested in debt mutual funds, and in 
cash and fixed deposits with banks.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have considered the 
Group’s cash flow forecasts for the next 
12-month period, from the date of signing 
the financial statements ending 31 March 
2017 . Net debt has increased by US$1 .2 
billion in the financial year to US$8.5 
billion, with US$0.9 billion of undrawn 
facilities at the balance sheet date. 
Further analysis of net debt is set out in 
Note 26 of the financial statements and 
details of borrowings and facilities are set 
out on page 203. The Board is satisfied 
that the Group’s forecasts and projections 
show that the Group will be able to 
operate within the level of its current 
facilities for the foreseeable future. This 
takes into account reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance on cash 
flows and forecast covenant compliance; 
the transferability of cash within the 
Group; the flexibility that the Group has 
over the timings of its capital expenditure; 
and other uncertainties. For these 
reasons, the Group continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
LONGER-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.1 of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact 
of the principal risks which could threaten 
the business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity of the Group.
PERIOD OF VIABILITY STATEMENT
As per provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have 
reviewed the length of time to be covered 
by the viability statement, particularly given 
its primary purpose of providing investors 
with a view of financial viability that goes 
beyond the period of the going concern 
statement. 
The Board of Directors have considered 
a three-year period appropriate for the 
longer-term viability testing on account 
of following key reasons:
 ❯ Commodity prices which are key to 
the Group’s viability are difficult to 
forecast beyond three years.
 ❯ Capital allocation and refinancing plans 
are prepared for a period of three years.
 ❯ Conversion of exploration projects to 
mining typically requires three to five 
years.
 ❯ Internal financial modelling is 
performed over a three-year period.
In assessing the Group’s longer-term 
viability, the going concern assumptions 
and financial model were used as the 
starting position. Severe but plausible 
risks were subsequently quantified both 
individually and in combination, to apply 
additional stress testing into the viability 
model.
Details of the Group’s principal risks are 
documented in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties part of this report. The 
Directors have considered the following 
risks as particularly relevant for 
assessing the longer-term viability:
 ❯ Decline in commodity prices.
 ❯ Delays in ramping up of aluminium 
production. 
 ❯ Operational turnaround at KCM 
operations. 
 ❯ Adverse outcomes of material legal 
and tax cases.
The Group remains viable under these 
severe but plausible scenarios taking into 
consideration the specific mitigations 
highlighted above and the Group’s 
financing optionality. These include capital 
allocation and dividend policy flexibility 
and readily available access to lines of 
credit and alternative sources of finance.
CONCLUSION
While it is impossible to foresee all risks, 
and the combinations in which they 
could manifest, based on the results of 
this assessment and taking into account 
the Group’s current position and principal 
risks, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over the next 
three years, and have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over a period  
of three years from 1 April 2017 .
COVENANTS
The lending banks of Vedanta Resources 
plc have consented to certain changes to 
its covenants requested by the Company 
under the terms of the relevant debt 
facilities effective from 31 March 2017 
until the period ending 30 September 
2018. With this, the Company is in 
compliance with its covenants relating to 
all facilities for the testing period ending 
31 March 2017 .
CREDIT RATING
During FY2017 , our Group simplification 
with the Cairn merger, upward 
movement on metal and oil prices, 
successful ramp up and volume growth 
have supported the Company’s improved 
credit rating.
FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED 69
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
During the year, the rating agency 
Moody’s upgraded the Company’s 
Corporate Family Rating (CFR) by one 
notch from B2/Outlook Negative to B1/ 
Stable Outlook. The rating agency 
Standard & Poor’s upgraded the 
Company’s rating by one notch from  
B/Stable Outlook to B+/Stable Outlook. 
We are focused on further strengthening 
our credit profile to attain investment 
grade ratings through ramp ups in our 
businesses which will deliver accelerated 
cash flows. 
Shareholders’ (deficit)/equity was 
US$(409) million at 31 March 2017 
compared with US$(713) million at 
31 March 2016. This largely reflected the 
impact of the Cairn merger of US$817 
million, currency appreciation US$87 
million partly offset by preference share 
issuance of US$464 million, dividend 
payment of US$138 million by Vedanta plc 
and attributable loss of US$23 million.
Non-controlling interests decreased to 
US$6,423 million at 31 March 2017 (from 
US$7 ,565 million at 31 March 2016), 
mainly due to dividend payments to 
minorities of US$1,340 million, the 
impact of the Cairn merger of US$817 
million partly offset by the attributable 
profit to minority shareholders during the 
year of US$902 million and the impact of 
rupee appreciation of US$129 million.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
During the year, we invested US$814 
million in property, plant and equipment, 
comprising US$668 million on our 
expansion and improvement projects 
and US$145 million on sustaining capital 
expenditure. Expansion project expenses 
were US$56 million in our Oil & Gas 
business; US$238 million at Zinc India; 
US$60 million in the Power business 
(mainly at Talwandi Saboo); US$263 
million in our Aluminium business; 
US$45 million at Zinc International and 
US$7 million at Copper India. 
CONTRIBUTION TO EXCHEQUER: 
We contributed c.US$6.0 billion to  
the exchequer in FY2017 compared to 
US$3.2 billion in FY2016 through direct 
and indirect taxes, levies, royalties  
and dividend.

The year in summary:
During FY2017 , with a recovery in prices, 
we have started moving ahead with our 
growth opportunities, specifically at the 
prolific Rajasthan assets. The production 
volumes were maintained with 
operating cost at the lower end among 
global peers and strong free cash flows. 
The low crude oil price environment  
was channelised to rebase costs for key 
projects in the portfolio. These constant 
efforts to optimise costs across the 
value chain have enabled healthy project 
economics even at US$40 per barrel.  
The recent rise and expected sustained 
stability in the Brent prices will enhance 
the returns further.
In FY2018 we intend to restart our capex 
cycle which shall enable us to unlock  
the full potential of the Barmer Basin  
in Rajasthan.

OPERATIONS
Average gross production for FY2017 
was 189,926 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day (boepd), which was 6.8% lower than 
the previous year. Cairn India operates 
approximately 26% of India’s crude oil 
production. Rajasthan block production 
was 4.7% lower at 161,571boepd. 
The production was lower due to the 
reservoir underperformance at Bhagyam 
and Aishwariya fields and the planned 
maintenance shutdown at Mangala 
Processing Terminal in November 2016. 
However, the decline was partially offset 
by the successful execution of the 
polymer Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) 
project at Mangala, which enhanced 
production from the Mangala Field. 
Production from the Ravva and Cambay 
blocks was down by 22% and 5% 
respectively, due to natural decline.
The Mangala EOR, the world’s largest 
polymer flood project, continued to 
show its exemplary performance. 
The polymer injection was maintained 
at target levels of 400,000 barrels of 
liquid per day and resulted in a positive 
production impact of ~52,000 barrels 
of oil per day (bopd) in FY2017 . The 
Rajasthan block recorded an excellent 
plant uptime of over 99% for the year.
In the Ravva block, the coil tubing 
and acid stimulation campaign was 
executed in Q4 FY2017 and this has 
helped to offset the natural decline. 
Well stimulation in a few of the water 
injector wells has also had a positive 
effect, helping to sustain the required 
water injection rates to support 
production from the oil wells. The 
Ravva block recorded an excellent 
uptime of over 99% for the year.
In the Cambay block, natural decline 
was restricted to 5%, supported by 
production optimisation activities. The 
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) 
Olpad gas tolling commenced to utilise 
surplus facilities at the onshore terminal. 
The Cambay block recorded an excellent 
uptime of over 99% for the year.
Gas production from Raageshwari 
Deep Gas (RDG) in Rajasthan was 
maintained at an average of 26mmscfd 
in FY2017 , with average sales at 
10mmscfd. The technical issue between 
the transporter and the gas buyers, 
which resulted in the temporary 
suspension of sales from October to 
mid-February, has now been resolved.
FY2017 saw a substantial recovery in 
crude oil prices compared with the 
record lows at the beginning of the 
calendar year (CY) 2016. The Brent crude 
oil price averaged US$48.6 per barrel, 
with a closing rate of US$51 .9 per barrel 
on 31 March 2017 . The year marked the 
landmark deal wherein the Organisation 
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) surprised the market by 
announcing a production cut agreement 
of 1 .2 million barrels per day (mbpd), 
for the first time since 2008. The deal 
also called for an additional 0.6mbpd 
reduction from non-OPEC suppliers. This 
action by OPEC signalled a return to its 
focus on active market management 
in order to stabilise crude oil prices.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Market reports have indicated an 
impressive level of compliance by 
the producers from the effective date 
of January 2017 , as well as growing 
support for an extension of the pact 
beyond the agreed six-month period to 
tackle the global supply glut. However, 
a sustained and rapid growth in the US 
oil rig count, indicating an increase in 
shale drilling activities, kept the price 
within the US$45 – US$55 range per 
barrel. Prices were also burdened by US 
Government data showing a sustained 
build-up of supplies to record levels 
since the beginning of the 2017 calendar 
year. The U.S. Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) reported that US 
crude oil inventories rose to 535.5 
million barrels – the highest level ever. 
In CY2017 , global production and 
consumption are both expected to 
increase, with consumption expected 
to grow at a faster rate. However, 
due to the sustained low levels of 
oil prices internationally, approvals of 
new conventional crude oil projects in 
2015-16 fell to the lowest level seen 
since the 1950s. The International 
Energy Agency (IEA) believes that if 
approvals continue to remain low, an 
unprecedented effort will be needed to 
avoid a supply-demand gap in the future.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue for the year was lower at 
US$1,223 million (after profit and royalty 
sharing with the Government of India), 
impacted by lower production volumes. 
However, EBITDA for FY2017 was higher 
by 5% at US$597 million, due to cost 
optimisation initiatives and reduced cess 
on an ad-valorem basis. The Rajasthan 
water flood operating cost was further 
reduced by 17% to US$4.3 per barrel 
compared with US$5.2 per barrel in the 
previous year, through the continuous 
improvement in crude processing and 
well maintenance costs. Despite a ramp 
up of polymer injection volumes to 
400,000 barrels of liquid per day, blended 
operating cost decreased to US$6.2 
per barrel during FY2017 compared 
with US$6.5 per barrel in FY2016. 
In FY2017 capital expenditure was 
US$62 million, which was primarily 
focused on the Mangala Polymer Project, 
the Raageshwari Deep Gas Project and 
the Palar drilling campaign. 
RESERVES
In FY2017 , the Oil & Gas division started 
the year with working interest (WI) 2P 
reserves of 175mmboe, and ended the 
period with 124mmboe. Excluding 
production, our working interest 2P 
reserves for the year declined by 
approximately 4.6mmboe, driven by the 
polymer flood project’s deferral in the 
Bhagyam field. However, reserves were 
added from certain new projects – 
Mangala Infill, Nagayalanka, Aishwariya 
BH Stage 1 – and from some satellite 
fields and better reservoir performance 
in offshore fields, mainly at Cambay.  
The 2P reserves would increase by 
approximately 175mmboe (WI) on the 
extension of Rajasthan production 
sharing contract (PSC) beyond 2020. 74

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
DEVELOPMENT
RAAGESHWARI DEEP GAS DEVELOPMENT
Gas development in the Raageshwari 
Deep Gas (RDG) field in Rajasthan 
continues to be a strategic priority. 
Capex investment in the phased 
development of the project is 
progressing well, with the aim 
of achieving a gradual ramp up in 
production. In FY2018, the completion 
of a low-cost expansion of the existing 
facility and the enhancement of 
current pipeline capacity are expected 
to lead to a ramp up of production 
to 40-45mmscfd. The team is also 
working to enhance the recovery 
estimates from the field by maintaining 
a technology-focused approach and 
gaining a better understanding of 
the reservoir, based on geological 
and geophysical studies carried out 
in FY2017 . The capex investment 
programme in the project includes 
plans for a new well drilling programme 
in FY2018. A new gas processing 
infrastructure is also progressing well. 
ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY IN BHAGYAM AND 
AISHWARIYA
We look to leverage the learnings 
from the excellent performance of 
Mangala EOR to enhance production 
from Bhagyam and Aishwariya 
through polymer injection. A multi-well 
polymer injectivity test for Bhagyam 
was successfully completed during 
the quarter and the results have 
been encouraging. The revised field 
development plan has been submitted 
to the JV partner. The injectivity test in 
Aishwariya has started in three polymer 
injector wells. The field development plan 
has been submitted to the JV partner.
AISHWARIYA BARMER HILL
The large hydrocarbons initially in 
place (HIIP) of 1 .4 billion barrels 
of oil equivalent of Barmer Hill 
offers significant growth potential. 
Development cost for Aishwariya 
Barmer Hill has been reduced by 
over 30% to US$195 million from an 
initial estimate of US$300 million, for 
an estimated recovery of 32 million 
barrels. We have achieved commercial 
and technical alignment with our JV 
partner for Stage 1 and production 
from appraised wells would start in 
Q1 FY2018. Execution of Stage 2 is 
expected to begin in fiscal year 2018.
MANGALA INFILL
Mangala has been the most prolific field 
over the years. We are commencing 
a 15 -well infill drilling programme at 
Mangala to monetise the reserves early. 
The field development plan for this 
project has been approved and drilling 
of the wells is planned for Q2 FY2018.
SURFACE FACILITY UPGRADE
In order to maximise production, we 
are focusing on creating ullage at the 
Mangala Processing Plan (MPT) and 
debottlenecking surface network. 
A series of measures are being 
planned to increase the liquid handling 
and water injection capacities
KRISHNA-GODAVARI BASIN ONSHORE – (BLOCK 
KG-ONN-2003/1)
Our joint venture partner and operator 
ONGC has submitted the field 
development plan (FDP), which has 
been approved by the Management 
Committee.
EXPLORATION
RAJASTHAN – (BLOCK RJ-ON-90/1)
During FY2017 , our focus was on 
identifying new plays, appraising new 
discoveries, and processing and 
interpreting the new 3D seismic data 
over high-priority areas. We have made 
significant progress in revamping the 
portfolio of prospects in the block to 
achieve an overall prospective resource 
base of more than 1 billion barrels of oil 
& gas by FY2018. New prospects based 
on both new-play concepts and proven-
play extensions have added 436mmboe 
of prospective resources in FY2017 . 
Exploration prospects have been firmed 
up for drilling in FY2018, based on the 
interpretations of newly acquired 3D 
seismic data.
KRISHNA-GODAVARI BASIN OFFSHORE – (BLOCK 
KG-OSN-2009/3)
The initial exploration period in the 
block expired on 8 March 2016. We 
continue to engage with the Ministry 
of Petroleum & Natural Gas for an 
extension of the initial exploration 
period and defence clearance for 
drilling exploration wells. Interpretation 
of the new seismic volumes has 
resulted in the identification of robust 
drillable prospects and a number 
of leads over different play types. 
Prospects are now being firmed up for 
exploration drilling in fiscal year 2018. 
PALAR-PENNAR BASIN OFFSHORE – (BLOCK PR-
OSN-2004/1)
An exploratory drilling campaign in the 
frontier block started on 10 February 
2017 . Three well-drilling campaigns were 
completed by April 2017 and the wells 
were subsequently abandoned.
ORANGE BASIN OFFSHORE, SOUTH AFRICA – (BLOCK-1, 
SOUTH AFRICA)
The prospect inventory matured in the 
outboard plays. The assessment of 
exploration potential of inboard plays is 
ongoing, to provide other drilling options. 
Cairn, along with the Joint Venture (JV) 
partner Petro SA, have deferred entry 
into the second renewal phase (February 
2015 – February 2017) in Block-1, South 
Africa, awaiting clarity on the changes in 
fiscal terms as proposed in the Mineral 
and Petroleum Resources Development 
(MPRD) Amendment Bill. 
OUTLOOK
We remain committed to maintaining a 
healthy free cash flow post-capex from 
the Oil & Gas business. We expect 
Rajasthan production volumes to remain 
steady at 165,000boepd with potential 
upside from execution of growth 
projects in FY2018. The net capex is 
estimated at US$250 million with further 
optionality for growth projects. The key 
development projects being pursued in 
FY2018 are Mangala Infill, surface facility 
upgrade, Aishwariya EOR, Bhagyam 
EOR, RDG and Barmer Hill, with 
expected capex investment of US$250 
million. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
 ❯ Generate free cash flow post growth 
capex from the Oil & Gas business; 
 ❯ Continue managing base production 
with a focus on opex optimisation and 
efficient reservoir management;
 ❯ Activate growth capex plans to unlock 
the potential of the Barmer Basin. Key 
projects being planned are Mangala 
Infill, Surface facility upgrade, 
Aishwariya EOR, Bhagyam EOR, 
RDG and Barmer Hill; and
 ❯ Pursue an alternative strategy of 
executing projects through an 
integrated project development model 
in partnership with consortiums led 
by global oil field services majors. 
This shall help us drive incremental 
efficiencies and execute projects 
faster with the aim of increasing the 
production to 300,000boepd in 
foreseeable future.

ZINC INDIA
FY2017 WAS A YEAR 
OF ACHIEVEMENT AT 
ZINC INDIA; ONE IN 
WHICH WE BROKE 
OUR PRODUCTION 
RECORDS FOR MINED 
METAL AND SILVER.
The year in summary:
FY2017 was a year of achievement at 
Zinc India; one in which we broke our 
production records for mined metal and 
silver. Significantly, we also delivered 
these volumes at marginally higher cost 
compared to FY2016. However, Zinc 
India’s zinc composite cost of production 
remains in the first decile on the global 
cost curves position. 
During the year, we continued our 
transition programme away from open 
cast and into underground mining, from 
where 52% of our production is now 
derived. We also made good progress 
towards our growth objectives: our plans 
to expand capacity are well underway, 
and our initiatives to extend existing 
mines have been successful. We are 
targeting another record year of 
production in FY2018, in line with our 
expectation of delivering 1 .2 million 
tonnes a year in FY2020.

SAFETY
During the reporting year, we had a 
tragic crane accident at a Zinc India 
project site where four of our contractual 
workers lost their lives in a rare crane 
collapse. This tragedy triggered the 
development of a Group-wide safety 
standard on cranes and lifting. 
We saw an improving picture in lost time 
injuries. Incidents were reduced from 23 
in FY2016 to 15 in FY2017 , and the lost 
time injury frequency rate was 0.3 
compared to 0.5 in the previous year.
Since 2013, we have adopted various 
world-class safety management 
practices, such as the DuPont safety 
programme, to improve our safety 
culture. 
ENVIRONMENT
The business continued to improve its 
performance in conservation and 
recycling. During the reporting year, the 
water recycling rate was 33% (FY2016: 
35%) and waste recycling rose to 93% 
compared to 95% in FY2016. 
Further, the business took the initiative 
to replenish the groundwater by: 
 ❯ Creating a 1,200 m
2
 groundwater 
recharge structure, developed at the 
Township Hospital of the Chanderiya 
lead zinc smelter. In a typical year, this 
has the capacity to conserve 900 m

of rainwater. 
 ❯ The deepening of nine water ponds in 
the neighbouring villages of the 
Sindesar Khurd Mine, resulting in 
increasing the water storage capacity 
by 2,77,575 m

.
During the year , we continued our transition 
programme away from open cast and into

OPERATIONS
In FY2017 , mined metal production stood 
at a record level of 907 ,000 tonnes, in 
line with the mine plan. 
Overall ore production rose slightly by 
14%, to 11 .9 million tonnes compared to 
10.5 million tonnes during FY2016. 
Production from the underground mines 
ramped up significantly during the year, 
with ore production and metal in 
concentrate (MIC) production from 
underground sources up by 44% and 
32% respectively compared to previous 
year. 
The increase was primarily due to higher 
production from the underground mines; 
in particular, from the Rampura Agucha 
underground and Sindesar Khurd mines.
Cumulative MIC production from the 
underground mines increased by 32% 
compared with the previous year. The 
share of mined metal production from 
underground mines increased to 52%. 
We achieved mined metal production in 
line with full year guidance, with second 
half production substantially higher than 
H1 FY2017 . 
Integrated zinc metal production was 
lower by 12% y-o-y and integrated lead 
metal production was down by 1% y-o-y. 
This was due to lower availability of 
mined metal in H1, caused by the 
cyclical pattern of the Rampura Agucha 
open cast mine plan for the year. 
Substantially higher mined metal 
production in H2 resulted in an increase 
in mined metal inventory, despite MIC 
sales of 26,000 tonnes during Q4. The 
closing stock of MIC was approx. 80,000 
tonnes, which will be converted into 
refined metal in FY2018. 
We achieved a record level of integrated 
silver production of 14.55 million ounces, 
7% higher y-o-y, driven by higher grades 
and greater volumes from Sindesar 
Khurd mine.
We closed the fourth quarter of the year 
with the highest-ever quarterly 
production performance, Mined metal 
stood at a record 312,000 tonnes, 
integrated zinc-lead metal production 
was at an all-time high of 260,000 
tonnes and integrated silver production 
set a record of 4.47 million ounces. 
These increases were in line with the 
availability of mined metal, also 
supported by enhanced smelter 
efficiencies.
In CY2016, zinc prices rallied with zinc 
LME prices reaching a nine-year high of 
US$2900 per tonne. Supply of zinc ore 
drastically reduced as a result of the 
mine cutbacks that gathered pace last 
year, following a sustained period of low 
prices. Zinc’s improving fundamentals, a 
weaker dollar and a low concentrate 
inventory all combined to propel the zinc 
rally and make it the most sought-after 
base metal. The zinc price averaged 
US$2,368 per tonne compared with 
US$1,829 per tonne last year; an 
increase of 30%. 
Lead averaged US$2,005 per tonne 
compared with US$1,768 per tonne the 
previous year, which was an increase of 
13%. This was primarily due to 
concentrate market supply constraints, 
owing to mine production cuts in 2015 
and 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Silver averaged US$17 .8 per ounce 
compared with US$15.2 per ounce the 
previous year, rising by 17% y-o-y. 
According to the Silver Institute, silver 
will continue to benefit predominantly 
from higher industrial demand, notably in 
the solar sector. 
The unit cost of zinc production 
increased by 11% to US$1,154 per tonne 
in FY2017 compared with US$1,045 per 
tonne in FY2016, due mainly to higher 
royalties driven by higher LME prices and 
Indian rupee depreciation. 
Excluding royalties, the cost of zinc 
production increased from US$804 per 
tonne to US$830 per tonne. The increase 
was primarily driven by higher power 
costs, due to increased coal prices, 
metallurgical coke & commodity prices, 
mine development expenses and lower 
integrated production. This was partly 
offset by cost reduction initiatives for 
operational and commercial efficiencies. 
According to the Wood Mackenzie report 
for CY2017 , Zinc India’s zinc composite 
cost of production remains in the first 
decile on the global cost curves position. 
Out of the total cost of production of 
US$1,154 per tonne, total government 
levies were US$339 per tonne (FY2016: 
US$277 per tonne), comprised mainly of 
royalty payments, the District Mineral 
Fund (DMF), the Clean Energy Cess, 
electricity duty and other taxes.
PROJECTS
The mining projects we have announced 
are progressing in line with the 
expectation of reaching 1 .2 million 
tonnes per annum in FY2020. 
Zinc India’s successful transition from 
open cast to underground mining 
continues. When the mining expansion 
projects were announced in early 2013, 
share of mined metal from underground 
mines was 15%. This increased to 52% 
in FY2017 and is expected to reach 80% 
in FY2018 and 100% in FY2019. 
Total mine development during the year 
reached 66,545 metres, an increase of 
15% on a year ago.
Mine development at the Rampura 
Agucha underground mine ranked at an 
all-time high of 5,309 metres in Q4, after 
consistently exceeding the 4,000 metres 
benchmark for the previous four 
quarters. During the year, it produced 1 .4 
million tonnes of ore, compared with 0.2 
million tonnes a year ago. 
The sinking of the south ventilation shaft 
was completed during the year, following 
the sinking of the main shaft that 
reached the ultimate depth of 955 
metres. Further commissioning of both 
production and service winders was 
completed during the year as shaft 
equipping work continued to progress 
satisfactorily. The underground mine 
achieved a record ore production run-rate 
of over 2 million tonnes per annum 
(mtpa) at the end of the fourth quarter.
At the Sindesar Khurd mine, 
environmental clearance was received in 
December 2016 for the expansion from 
3.75 to 4.5mtpa in ore production and 
beneficiation from 4.5mtpa to 5mtpa. 
The current mining run-rate is above 
4mtpa and is ahead of schedule. The 
winder foundation work for the shaft 
was completed during the year and head 
gear erection is nearing completion. The 
new mill of 1 .5mtpa capacity was 
completed in a record 14 months and 
was commissioned in January 2017 .
At Zawar, environmental clearance of the 
4mtpa ore production and beneficiation 
was received in January 2017 , and this 
was followed by consent to establish 
and operate. The mill expansion to 2.5mtpa 
and the associated power upgrade 
project are at an advanced stage, with 
completion targeted at August 2017 .
The Kayad project is now complete and 
the mine has attained its rated capacity 
of 1 .0mtpa.
In addition to the ongoing mining 
expansion projects, we started the 
Fumer project during the second half of 
the year, with duration of 18-20 months. 
This project will further improve cost and 
metal recoveries from the Company’s 
hydro plant and could be replicated in 
other hydro plants in the coming years. 
The work is progressing well and 
anticipated to be completed in mid-
FY2019. 
In keeping with the Company’s 
commitment to green energy, we have 
successfully commissioned 16MW of 
captive solar farms during the year, 
adding to the existing 273MW Wind 
Power Plant (WPP). A unique feature of 
this project was that, it was set up on 
un-utilisable land such as tailing dam and 
jarofix pond.
EXPLORATION
During the year, gross additions of 26.4 
million tonnes were made to reserves 
and resources (R&R), prior to depletion 
of 11 .9 million tonnes. As at 31 March 
2017 , Zinc India’s combined mineral 
resources and ore reserves were 
estimated to be 404.4 million tonnes, 
containing 36.09 million tonnes of 
zinc-lead metal and 1,032 million ounces 
of silver. Overall mine life continues to be 
more than 25 years. 
OUTLOOK
In FY2018, mined metal production is 
expected to be higher than in FY2017 . 
Refined zinc-lead metal production will 
be around 950kt, which will be evenly 
spread through the year. Silver 
production will be over ~15.0 million 
ounces (or 500 metric tonnes). Both the 
Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd 
shafts are on track for completion in 
FY2019. 
Share of mined metal from underground 
mining, which was 52% of total 
production in FY2017 , is expected to 
reach 80% in FY2018 and 100% by 
FY2019. 
The cost of production excluding 
royalties is expected to be marginally 
higher based on current levels of coal 
and input commodity prices. 
The capex on the ongoing mine 
expansion projects, the Fumer project 
and smelter debottlenecking will be 
around US$350 million in FY2018. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
 ❯ To progress the brownfield expansion 
of underground mines to achieve 
1.2mpta of mined zinc-lead, with 
mining projects completed in FY2020;
 ❯ Ramp up underground mining in 
Rampura Agucha, Zawar and SK mine 
cluster;
 ❯ Remain in the top cost decile with the 
focus on operational and commercial 
efficiencies;
 ❯ Ramp up production volumes of 
silver; and
 ❯ Continue our focus on adding more 
reserves and resources than we 
deplete, through exploration. 80

ZINC INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS
Production for FY2017 was 31% lower 
than in FY2016, due mainly to the 
closure of the Lisheen mine in Ireland  
in November 2015 after 17 years in 
operation. Excluding Lisheen, total 
production was 7% higher than FY2016, 
primarily due to better performances 
from the Skorpion and Black Mountain 
Mines (BMM). 
Skorpion production was 4% higher 
compared with FY2016, driven by better 
grades and recoveries. This was partially 
impacted by material handling challenges 
due to ore being wetter than anticipated, 
and breakdowns at the acid plant which 
will undergo a 30-day maintenance 
shutdown in May 2017 to return it to its 
original capacity. This work will partially 
impact production from the refinery. In 
FY2016, Skorpion’s production was 
impacted by the extended planned 
30-day maintenance shutdown and by 
temporary industrial action. 
At BMM, production was 11% higher 
than the previous year. Higher grades 
and improved recoveries were mainly 
driven by efficiency improvements on 
backfill, long-hole blasting and better 
availability of ore hoisting. During the 
year, we made significant progress in 
shifting the mining methodology from 
cut-and-fill to the more cost effective 
long-hole massive mining. March 2017 
marked the highest metal production  
in five years, with Q4 FY2017 delivering 
record quarterly production of  
20,000 tonnes. 
The unit cost of production decreased  
by 1% to US$1,417 per tonne from the 
previous year’s US$1,431 per tonne. 
Excluding Lisheen, the unit cost of 
production was lower by 7% at 
US$1,417 per tonne from US$1,521 per 
tonne last year. This was driven by higher 
production, lower treatment and refining 
charges (TC/RCs), commercial cost 
saving initiatives and local currency 
depreciation. 
During the year, revenue was reduced to 
US$332 million, due principally to lower 
volumes following the closure of the 
Lisheen mine and delays in concentrate 
shipments, partially offset by higher 
realised prices. In FY2017 , EBITDA 
doubled to US$138 million from US$68 
million in FY2016, driven mainly by higher 
zinc and lead prices, lower TC/RCs, a 
one-off insurance claim refund at 
Scorpion Skorpion Zinc and a royalty 
refund at BMM. 
PROJECTS
As part of our strategic growth priorities, 
the Gamsberg project is of the utmost 
importance. As we communicated last 
year, pre-start activities and waste-
stripping at the project have progressed 
well. To date, we have excavated over 
15.5 million tonnes of waste rock. All 
major orders for the integrated process 
plant, water and power, mining and other 
prestart activities have already been 
placed. Major contractors have been 
mobilised to the site. 
Skorpion mine 83
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The first phase of the project is expected 
to have a mine life of 13 years, replacing 
the production lost by the closure of the 
Lisheen mine and restoring volumes to 
over 300,000 tonnes per annum (tpa). 
There is also significant potential for 
further expansion at the Gamsberg 
North deposit. 
First production is on track for mid-
CY2018, with 9-12 months for ramp up 
to full production of 250ktpa. 
At Skorpion, the Pit 112 project is 
progressing well and all equipment will 
be in place by Q1 FY2018. This project, 
which involves high wall push back of 
the existing pit, will increase the mine 
life from 0.5 years to 3 years and 
increase current reserves from 0.9 
million tonnes (at 6.5% grade) to 4.2 
million tonnes (at 9.9% grade). 
OUTLOOK
In FY2018, production volumes are 
expected to be around 160ktpa. Mine life 
expansion at Skorpion is being evaluated. 
The cost of production is expected to be 
around US$1,500 per tonne, higher due 
to appreciating local currency, higher 
throughput and significant investment in 
exploration. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
 ❯ To deliver the Gamsberg project with 
targeted first production by mid-
CY2018;
 ❯ To extend the mine life at Skorpion by 
investing into Pit 112 lay-back with 
high wall push back;
 ❯ Carrying out a project study for

SAFETY
We are deeply saddened to report a 
fatality at our Karnataka mining operation 
wherein a vehicle collided with an 
employee, resulting in a fatal accident. 
This led us to review and strengthen our 
overall systems; some of the initiatives 
are as follows.
1 . Design and implementation of Heavy 
Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) 
parking yard across all mines.
2. Institutionalisation of ‘Take 5’ and 
safety pause.
3. Strengthening ‘one day safety officer’ 
and ‘Monthly theme based safety’ 
drive.
4. Introducing ‘Simulator’ for enhancing 
safe driving skills.
5. Training on ‘defensive driving’ by 
‘Institute of road traffic education’.
6. Checking the CAPA compliance for 
the last five years’ major incidents / 
HIPOs/safety alerts.
We continue to invest time, effort and 
resources to make our business and 
behaviours safer. 
ENVIRONMENT
It is our endeavour to make our 
operations zero discharge. At this point, 
the entire processed water from mines, 
plant and value-added business is 
recycled and reused as a part of the 
process, except for blow down of the 
cooling tower of the power plant which 
is treated and discharged as per a 
consent condition. Some of the initiatives 
during the reporting period are as follows:
 ❯ Biodiversity studies across all our 
mines in Goa, with the aim of 
integrating biodiversity conservation 
during the operational phase, and at 
closure.
 ❯ Installation of wheel wash systems at 
all mine exits.
 ❯ Truck-mounted road sweeping 
machines across major transport 
routes.
 ❯ Fixed dust suppression systems on 
identified stretches.
 ❯ Additional bag houses to capture 
graphite dust at VAB.
 ❯ Development of green belt across 
VAG.
 ❯ Creation of rainwater harvesting 
ponds in the nearby villages at our 
Karnataka mines which will help 
recharging of ground water.
Against this positive backdrop, 
we continue to engage with both 
State and Central Government 
and the Supreme Court with the 
objective of securing increased

IRON ORE
OPERATIONS
At Goa, production was 8.8 million 
tonnes and sales were 7 .4 million tonnes 
during FY2017 . We achieved our annual 
mining allocation of 5.5 million tonnes in 
January 2017 . The Goa Government 
granted an additional allocation of 2.6 
million tonnes in Q4 FY2017 . Production 
in FY2016 was significantly lower as we 
were ramping up after the lifting of the 
mining ban in August 2015.
At Karnataka, production was 2.1 million 
tonnes with sales of 2.7 million tonnes 
during FY2017 . Sales included 0.7 million 
tonnes of opening ore inventory. 
Environmental Clearance (EC) annual 
capacity of 2.29 million tonnes was 
achieved during the year and we 
continue to engage with the 
Government to enhance the mining 
capacity in Karnataka. 
During the year, production of pig iron 
ramped up from the previous year’s 
654,000 tonnes to a record 708,000 
tonnes, with higher plant availability. 
PRICES
Prices for 62Fe grade averaged US$67 .8 
per tonne CFR basis, up by 30% in 
FY2017 compared to prior year. The net 
realisation after freight for 56Fe grade 
was around US$39 per tonne for FY2017 . 
The realisation for Goa ore was also 
lower due to the 10% Goa Permanent 
Fund. 
In FY2017 , the price recovered, following 
lower production forecasts compared to 
the earlier guidance from the major iron 
ore mining companies, and an uptick in 
Chinese demand. The main driver of this 
price increase was a rebounding of the 
billet and futures market. Also, the 
Chinese Government announced 
deadlines to halt substandard steel 
production of induction furnaces; this 
resulted in incentives for blast furnaces 
to increase steel production to 
compensate for this loss. This resulted in  
an increase in demand for iron ore 
demand and a rise in iron ore and steel 
futures market. 
Currently, the realisation for 56Fe has 
softened due to the surge in steel 
inventory and inventory of IO at steel 
mills and ports in China.
Because of its logistical proximity to the 
port and inland waterways, Vedanta’s 
iron ore business in Goa caters primarily 
for the global seaborne trade. Goa 
low-grade exports are primarily destined 
for Chinese steel mills that are able to 
blend the low grades with other 
high-grade expensive ores from Brazil, 
Australia or within China. 
In contrast, the iron ore business in 
Karnataka caters primarily for the 
domestic steel industry in the state of 
Karnataka, within a 200km radius of the 
mine. 
Karnataka ex-works realisation was 
US$18.1 per tonne for FY2017 , as 
domestic prices are largely determined 
by government mining companies and 
local supply and demand factors.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The value-added business (pig iron) 
margin reduced from US$72 per tonne 
in FY2016 to US$51 per tonne, primarily 
due to higher coking coal prices.
In FY2017 , EBITDA increased to US$194 
million compared with US$73 million in 
FY2016. The increase was due mainly to 
volume ramp up and better price 
realisations, partly offset by higher met 
coke prices. 
OUTLOOK
The Company has been engaging with 
the respective State governments to 
increase the mining cap in Goa and 
Karnataka. 
The State of Goa is seeking the 
intervention of the Honourable Supreme 
Court to accept the recommendation of 
the Expert Committee for a higher limit 
of 37 million tonnes per annum for the 
state. The Government of Goa has asked 
mining companies to aim for cumulative 
production of 8 million tonnes during Q1 
FY2018.
Iron ore production in Karnataka has 
reached close to 30 million tonnes. We 
are continuously engaging with 
government for our EC enhancement 
from 2.29 million tonnes per annum to 6 
million tonnes per annum. 
To be ready for future production growth, 
we will debottleneck the capacity at pig 
iron plant furnaces from 785kt to 890kt. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
 ❯ To enhance environmental clearance 
limits in both Goa and Karnataka, and 
ramp up to full capacity;
 ❯ To achieve focused cost reduction 
through various operational and 
commercial initiatives; and
 ❯ To increase our footprint in iron ore by

The water recycling rate recorded 
for the reporting year was 13%, 
compared with 18% in the previous 
year. The waste recycling rate stood 
at 101 .18%, due to the additional 
recycling of historic as well as current 
operational waste stored at the site.
SAFETY
Consistent with the previous year, our 
lost time injuries again numbered four, 
with the frequency rate standing at 0.37 
(FY2016: 0.49). 
During the year we launched a number 
of safety programmes, including one 
focusing on the basic and essential area 
of knowing how to treat tools properly 
and safely. One example was the 
‘Centralisation of Lifting Tools and 
Tackles’, with the emphasis on the pre- 
and post-use of all relevant lifting tools 
In FY2017, copper cathode 
production achieved a record 
level of 402,000 tonnes through 
in-house technological  
upgrades at the refinery.

OPERATIONS
In FY2017 , copper cathode production 
achieved a record level of 402,000 
tonnes through in-house technological 
upgrades at the refinery that raised 
the previous design level density of 
310Amp/m2 to 350Amp/m2. This was 
offset by lower copper grades and a 
few unplanned outages spread over 
the year. Our plant utilisation touched 
a record level of 94% with overall 
equipment effectiveness (OEE) of 86%. 
Sulphuric acid availability was at record 
levels of 100% throughout the year. 
In FY2017 , phosphoric acid production 
was at 200,000 tonnes, its highest ever. 
Additionally, as a process enhancement 
and with the objective of reducing 
environmental waste, scrubber 
cakes generated at the smelter were 
transformed from a hazardous to 
a non-hazardous state through the 
installation of bag houses before the 
scrubbers. This has led to a significant 
reduction of hazardous cake generation, 
enhancing secured land fill (SLF) life. 
We continued to focus on safety 
and environmental performance. 
There were zero liquid discharges, and 
we recorded our lowest ever lost time 
injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and total 
injuries were down by almost 50%.
The 160MW power plant at Tuticorin 
operated at a plant load factor (PLF) of 
56% in FY2017 compared with 71% in 
FY2016. This was primarily due to a lower 
offtake from the Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Board (TNEB) and the Telangana State 
Electricity Board (TSEB), owing to 
weaker power demand in the region. 
The Company entered into a contract 
with TSEB for power supply from 
June 2016 to May 2017 , following 
the completion of the sales contract 
with TNEB. The Company is entitled 
to compensation at 20% of the 
contracted rate for offtake below 
85% of the contracted quantity. 
Our copper mine in Australia has 
remained under extended care and 
maintenance since 2013. We continue to 
evaluate various options for its profitable 
restart given the current favourable 
government support and prices. 
In CY2016, world mined production of 
copper is estimated to have risen by 
5.2% to 20.18 million tonnes, while 
refinery production is estimated to 
have increased by 4.3% to 22.855 
million tonnes. World refined copper 
consumption grew by 2.5% in 2016 
while that of China, the largest consumer 
of copper, grew by 4.9%. Also, the 
materially stronger fundamental 
developments that contributed to 
this surge have increased demand 
in China, due to a greater impact of 
government stimulus on the power grid 
investments, as well as higher end-use 
demand, particularly for appliances 
and consumer goods. Copper prices 
have also firmed up on the prospects 
of infrastructure plans in the US.
Average LME copper prices decreased 
by 1 .1% and treatment and refining 
charges (TC/RCs) reduced by 
7 .2% compared with FY2016. 
In concentrates, annual benchmark 
settlements for CY2017 concluded at 
92.5/9.25 TC/RCs of payable copper.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
This is approximately a 5% reduction 
over the previous year, mainly due to 
mine disruptions resulting in a decline 
in concentrate availability. Mine supply 
of copper concentrate has been 
significantly affected by disruptions such 
as the suspension of exports from PT 
Freeport Indonesia and a strike at the 
Escondida mine during Q4 2016–17 . 
Conventional disruptions in concentrate 
production for CY2016 was 925kt. 
Additions to the global mine supply of 
concentrate, such as through new mine 
projects and expansions, outpaced the 
increase in smelter capacity in 2016. This 
situation is set to reverse from 2017 as 
the current wave of mine construction 
comes to an end, while Chinese primary 
smelter capacity continues to grow.
At the Tuticorin smelter, the cost of 
production increased from 3.2 US 
cents per lb to 5.0 US cents per 
lb, due mainly to lower by-product 
credits, higher petro prices and an 
increased Clean Energy Cess on coal. 
According to the Wood Mackenzie 
Report CY2017 , we are positioned in 
the first quartile of the cost curve. 
Sulphuric acid realisation was 
impacted significantly with Abu Dhabi 
National Oil Company (ADNOC) prices 
reduced from US$142 per tonne to 
US$84 per tonne year-on-year. 
During the year, EBITDA was US$252 
million, a decrease of 25% on the 
previous year’s US$337 million. 
The reduction was mainly due to 
lower TCs/RCs and lower by-product 
credits, the Clean Energy Cess on 
coal consumed in the Thermal Power 
Plant (TPP), and one-off benefits 
of the Target Plus export incentive 
scheme. These were partially offset 
by improved operational efficiencies.
OUTLOOK
Production is expected to remain at 
around 400,000 tonnes.

DIVISIONAL REVIEW
COPPER ZAMBIA
FY2017 WAS A 
CHALLENGING 
YEAR FOR
PRODUCTION AT 
COPPER ZAMBIA. 
The year in summary:
FY2017 was a challenging year for 
production at Copper Zambia. The focus 
was on accelerated dewatering and 
development initiatives to improve 
long-term production from Konkola mine, 
smelter throughput improvements, 
technology interventions to improve 
reliability of the Tailings Leach Plant and 
resumption of Nchanga underground 
mine in FY2017 . 
More positively, custom smelting 
delivered increased volumes. Spend 
bases are also well controlled, and we 
are achieving an overall reduction in the 
operational cost base. The turnaround 
actions required are understood and 
underway, and although there is much to 
be done, it remains a world-class asset 
with a 50-year mine life. It remains an 
integral part of our vision for the future.

SAFETY
With deep regret we reported two 
fatalities during the year. One person 
died as a result of a blasting incident, 
and the other due to an accident 
leading to heart failure in the Konkola 
underground mine. While blasting-
related safety risks are known in the 
mining industries, the second incident 
is very rare but has happened in other 
mines in the past. Both incidents 
were thoroughly investigated, and as 
a result, learnings have been shared 
and implemented across the business 
to avoid such incidents in future. 
Separately, we were pleased to see 
an encouraging decline in lost time 
injuries, down from 20 in FY2016 to 
eight in FY2017 . The lost time frequency 
rate improved from 0.54 to 0.32. 
With preventative safety in mind, 
KCM conducted a risk assessment 
on the structural integrity of tailing 
dams. A third party consultant 
reviewed three dams and found no 
major deviation from the standard 
design or management practices. 
KCM initiated the Chingilila programme, 
training mine captains to become safety 
champions who regularly visit every 
working area to improve the safety 
awareness in the field and in the 
workplace. In total, 112 leaders were 
trained in Company safety procedures 
and practices. 
ENVIRONMENT
Improvement in water management 
remains the priority. Our water recycling 
rate recorded in FY2017 was 6%, 
compared to 8% in the previous year. 
We are committing more resources 
to this challenge and have targeted a 
recycling rate of 10% for FY2018. 
We also take seriously the safe 
disposal of hazardous chemicals. 
In December 2016, we completed 
a project that enables expired 
materials to be processed through 
neutralisation and solidification at 
the Nkana Smelter Complex.
The turnaround actions required 
are understood and underway, 
and it remains a world-class 
asset with a 50-year mine life.

COPPER ZAMBIA
OPERATIONS
In FY2017 , mined metal production 
of 94,000 tonnes was 23.5% lower 
than in FY2016. The decrease was 
primarily due to lower production 
from the Nchanga underground mine, 
which was placed under care and 
maintenance in Q3 FY2016, as well 
as a lower availability of trackless 
equipment at the Konkola deep mine. 
At Nchanga, open pit mine equipment 
availability and throughput constraints at 
the mills resulted in lower production. 
At the Tailings Leach Plant, production 
was 46,000 tonnes, down by 16% year-
on-year due to maintenance breakdowns 
at the tailing trails and lower feeds.
Improvement actions were put in 
place and stabilisation is underway. 
During Q3, trial mining began at the 
Nchanga underground mine and 
initial results for recovery and mining 
productivity were promising. Average 
ore production of 100kt per month 
was achieved in Q4 FY2017 and 
continued to improve in Q1 FY2018. 
Custom volumes at 84,000 tonnes 
were 31% higher year-on-year due 
to improved third party concentrate 
availability and our ability to handle 
feed rates greater than 70 tonnes 
per hour at the smelter, following the 
biennial shutdown during Q3 FY2017 . 
We are working on the engineering 
design for accelerated dewatering 
and development to increase 
production from the Konkola mine. 
The elevated temperature leach project, 
which will improve recoveries at the 
Tailings Leach Plant, was commissioned 
in Q3 FY2017 and is currently under 
stabilisation. Planning and engineering 
for phase II of the project has started.
The unit cost of production (excluding 
royalty) was higher by 5.4% at 209 
US cents per lb. This was mainly due 
to lower volumes, higher power costs 
and lower credits, partly offset by cost 
initiatives to optimise stores, spares 
and consumables and the impact of 
kwacha appreciation on VAT receivables. 
Excluding the impacts of an increased 
power tariff and the unrealised 
gain of kwacha appreciation on VAT 
receivables, the unit cost of production 
(excluding royalty) rose by 7 .5% at 201 
US cents per lb compared with 187 
US cents per lb in the previous year. 
The power tariff increase in January 
2016 resulted in an adverse impact of 
US$3 million per month on the cost 
of production. During FY2017 , this 
increased our costs by 13 US cents 
per lb. Effective from 1 January 2017 , 
Copperbelt Energy Corporation Plc 
has announced revised power tariffs 
that are ~15% lower than those 
launched in January 2016. Necessary 
amendments have been incorporated 
in the power supply agreement (PSA).
Water levels at Kariba Dam are improving 
and are currently at 50% compared 
with 23% at the end of FY2016. 
In January 2017 , KCM had successfully 
signed off a consent order with ZCCM-
IH to settle its price participation liability. 
This outlined an amended schedule of 
repayment in three parts: US$20 million 
by 31 January 2017 , US$22 million by 
28 February 2017 and the balance in 
24 equal monthly instalments. We 
see this as a positive step towards an 
amicable settlement of the case.
Revenue in FY2017 was lower at 
US$87 4 million compared with US$973 
million in the previous year, mainly 
due to lower sales volumes, metal 
prices and lower credits. The EBITDA 
for the year was US$6 million, an 
improvement of US$24 million on the 
previous year’s loss of US$18 million, 
mainly due to the impact of kwacha 
appreciation on VAT receivable. 
OUTLOOK
KONKOLA UNDERGROUND MINE
The Konkola underground mine remains 
the focused priority for KCM. 
Prioritisation strategies are underway to 
improve operating productivity levels, 
mobile fleet utilisation and to progress a 
deeper horizontal development level. A 
feasibility study is underway on the dry 
mine initiative and process re-engineering 
options to find opportunities for cost and

AND EBITDA WITH RAMP UP 
OF CAPACITIES.
The year in summary:
We can look back on FY2017 with 
satisfaction: we achieved record 
production of aluminium and alumina, 
leading to a strong growth in revenues 
and EBITDA with ramp up of capacities. 
This was despite pot outages at 
Jharsuguda and BALCO. However, many 
were returned to production during the 
reporting year and we anticipate all being 
back in service by Q3 this year. 
Indeed, we are now well on the way to 
achieving our target aluminium volume 
of 1 .5 to 1 .6mtpa (excluding trial run) 
in FY2018, with lower costs aided by 
improving supplies of local bauxite 
and coal. The higher volumes will also 
deliver valuable economies of scale.

OPERATIONS
ALUMINA REFINERY: LANJIGARH
At Lanjigarh, production ramped up with 
the restarting of the second stream of 
the refinery during Q1 FY2017 . In FY2017 , 
the alumina refinery produced 1,208,000 
tonnes, up 24% on FY2016. We ended 
March 2017 at a run rate of 1 .4 million 
tonnes. The refinery currently has a 
debottlenecked capacity of 1 .7-2.0 million 
tonnes per annum. Approval was 
received to expand to 4 million tonnes 
per annum, and this will be considered 
when we have further visibility on 
bauxite sources.
ALUMINIUM SMELTERS
We achieved record annual production 
of 1 .2 million tonnes of aluminium in 
FY2017 , with an exit run-rate of 1 .4 
million tonnes per annum (excluding 
trial run production) in March 2017 . 
JHARSUGUDA I & II SMELTERS
The Jharsuguda-I smelter was stable 
at 525,000 tonnes during FY2017 . 
However, it suffered an unfortunate 
pot outage incident in April 2017 . 228 
pots out of the total 608 pots were 
taken out of production. There were no 
injuries in the incident. The impacted 
pots will be repaired over the next few 
months, and put back into production. 
The commissioning of pots at the first 
line of the 1 .25 mtpa Jharsuguda-II 
aluminium smelter was completed at 
the end of July 2016. However, this 
line was impacted by pot outages 
during the year. The impacted pots are 
currently being rectified, with 80 of 
336 pots restarted in May 2017 , and we 
expect to be fully ramped up during 
Q3 FY2018. The second line is fully 
completed with 336 pots operational 
and the ramp up of the third line began 
at the end of December 2016. Currently 
139 pots are operational, and full 
ramp up is expected by Q3 FY2018. 
BALCO I & II SMELTERS
Production was stable at 256,000 tonnes 
in BALCO-I during the year. The BALCO-
II smelter was fully commissioned, with 
all 336 pots operational in August 2016. 
However, this was impacted by a pot 
failure incident in September 2016 and 
168 pots were taken out of production. 
All 336 pots are fully operational by the 
end of March 2017 and expected to be 
capitalised in Q1 FY2018, upon 
stabilisation.
The rolled product facility at BALCO, 
which was temporarily shut down in Q2 
FY2016, restarted operations during Q2 
FY2017 following optimisation of its cost 
structure. Production was 18,000 tonnes 
during the year. 
CAPTIVE POWER PLANT
JHARSUGUDA – 1,800MW
Power sales from the Jharsuguda 
2,400MW (4x600MW) power plant 
were historically reported in the Power 
segment until Q4 FY2016. However, 
effective from 1 April 2016, the 
surplus power sales from 1,800MW 
of the capacity has been reported in 
the Aluminium segment, since the 
plant has been converted to a captive 
power plant (CPP) for the Jharsuguda-
II smelter. One unit of 600MW, 
which has been tied up for power to 
sales to GRIDCO, will continue to be 
reported in the Power segment. 
During FY2017 , there were lower external 
sales of 511 million units from the 
1,800MW Jharsuguda power plant due 
to a weak short-term power market. 
However, the plant loading factor (PLF) 
will continue to increase as we ramp up 
the Jharsuguda-II smelter.
BALCO 270MW
Similarly, the 270MW CPP at BALCO 
was moved to the Aluminium segment 
from 1 April 2016. This power unit will be 
used as a backup power source for the 
smelters, and will remain on standby. 
Sales were therefore nil during the year.
COAL LINKAGES
The Company has secured coal linkages 
of 6mtpa through auctions in Q2 FY2017 
for the CPPs at BALCO and Jharsuguda. 
Supply from these linkages started in 
November 2016, and 2.0 million tonnes 
of coal were received during the year.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Average LME prices for aluminium 
for the year stood at US$1,688 per 
tonne, up 6.2% on the previous year’s 
US$1,590 per tonne. During the year, 
aluminium traded at a two-year high of 
US$1,900 per tonne. Support was driven 
by the Chinese Government’s pledge in 
late 2016 to clamp down on pollution, 
as well as expectations of a significant 
increase in infrastructure spending 
following the US presidential election. 
During FY2017 , the alumina cost of 
production (CoP) was US$282 per tonne, 
compared with US$315 per tonne in 
FY2016. The decrease was mainly due to 
double-stream operations leading to cost 
optimisation, a lower bauxite cost driven 
by higher quality bauxite, lower caustic 
cost with better silica and operating 
efficiencies, and rupee depreciation. 
In FY2017 , the total bauxite requirement 
of about 3.4 million tonnes was met 
from three sources: captive mines 
(31%), domestic sources (23%) and 
imports (46%). In the previous year, each 
made an equal, one-third contribution. 
The other key raw material – coal – was 
secured from a combination of secured 
coal linkages, e-auctions, ad-hoc 
allocation and imports. 
The hot metal CoP at Jharsuguda 
was US$1,440 per tonne, down 
from US$1,519 in FY2016. The 
decrease was primarily due to lower 
alumina cost, volume ramp up, rupee 
depreciation and the implementation 
of various cost-saving initiatives. These 
were partially offset by regulatory 
headwinds of the Clean Energy Cess, 
electricity duty and power imports 
required during power outages. 
The cost of production at BALCO 
reduced to US$1,506 per tonne from 
US$1,659 in FY2016. This decrease was 
due to lower power costs driven by 
secured coal linkages; the shifting of 
power generation to the more efficient, 
newly constructed 600MW CPP; input 
commodity deflation; currency 
depreciation; and various cost saving 
initiatives.
EBITDA was higher at US$344 million 
compared with US$107 million in 
FY2016, driven mainly by volume ramp 
up, increased LME, input commodity 
deflation, improved product mix, Indian 
rupee depreciation and cost savings 
initiatives. FY2016 EBITDA was impacted 
by an additional one-off charge of US$36 
million relating to renewable power 
obligations, incurred in the previous 
financial years.
OUTLOOK
VOLUME AND COST
In FY2018, aluminium volume is 
expected to be in the range of 1 .5 to 
1 .6 million tonnes (excluding trial run) 
with the fully ramped-up BALCO II 
smelter and the progressive ramp 
up of balance lines at the 1 .25 million 
tonnes Jharsuguda-II smelter. With 
continued focus on cost reduction, a 
hot metal cost is expected to be in the 
range of US$1,475-1,500 per tonne 
with Q1 FY2018 likely to be higher. 
ALUMINA 
During FY2018, the Company will 
continue to double-stream operations to 
support the aluminium pot ramp ups 
with debottlenecked capacity of 1 .7-2.0 
million tonnes per annum. The main 
sources of bauxite will be a mix of mines 
at BALCO, and the balance will be met 
from laterite mines, other domestic 
sources and imports.
COAL 
Multiple initiatives are being taken to 
meet our coal requirements. We will 
source our overall coal mix from the 
secured 6 million tonnes of coal linkages, 
low-cost imports and auctioned coal to 
optimise the cost in FY2018. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
❯ › Full capacity ramp up at the 
Jharsuguda-II and BALCO-II smelters 
to 2.3mtpa;
❯ › Bauxite sourcing and supply chain;
❯ › Expanding the Lanjigarh refinery to 4 
million tonnes; and
❯ › Reducing hot metal cost by 
optimising raw material sourcing, and 
through various cost reduction 
initiatives.

SAFETY
A broadly consistent year in terms of lost 
time injuries: one took place during the 
year, compared to two in FY2016. The 
frequency rate was decreased to 0.09 
compared to 0.18 previously. 
At MALCO energy we implemented the 
SAP EHS Module, to provide us with 
tighter control and better data on safety 
observations, the Risk Register, Work 
Clearance Management (WCM) and 
incident investigations. 
We also conducted workshops on 
Experience Based Quantification (EBQ), 
and on high PM emissions and pot line 
FTP stack emissions with participants 
from TSPL and other power plants.
ENVIRONMENT
One of the main environmental 
challenges for power plants is the 
management and recycling of fly 
ash. We were pleased to record an 
improvement in our overall waste 
recycling rate, from 44.34% in FY2016 
to 54.84% in this reporting year. 
We also saw an improvement in the way 
we collect, recycle and reuse water. The 
rate rose to 11% in FY2017 compared to 
6% in the previous year. 102

POWER
OPERATIONS
In FY2017 , power sales were higher 
at 12,916 million units compared 
with 12,121 million units in FY2016, 
driven by commissioning of additional 
units at Talwandi Sabo Power Limited 
(TSPL) and BALCO over the last 
year. The Jharsuguda 1,800MW 
and BALCO 270MW smelters 
have been moved from the Power 
segment to the Aluminium segment, 
effective from 1 April 2016. 
The Jharsuguda 600MW power plant 
operated at a lower plant load factor 
(PLF) of 68% in FY2017 (FY2016: 71%). 
Power sales from TSPL were 
significantly higher during the year at 
6,339 million units, with all three units 
fully operational. The third 660MW 
unit achieved its commercial operation 
date (COD) on 24 August 2016 and 
was capitalised on 1 September 2016. 
The plant achieved full ramp up during 
FY2017 , and had record availability 
of 85% in Q4. The power purchase 
agreement with the Punjab State 
compensates Vedanta based on the 
availability of the plant. In April 2017 , 
a fire took place in the coal handling 
facility of the power plant. This resulted 
in a shutdown of all three units of the 
power plant for around 60 days. There 
were no injuries in the incident and the 
operational team is working towards 
rectification, and a safe and swift restart. 
The 600MW BALCO IPP units 
(2x300MW) operated at a PLF of 58% in 
FY2017 , due to the weak power market. 
The MALCO power plant operated at a 
lower PLF of 23% in FY2017 compared 
with 48% in FY2016, due to a lower 
offtake from the Telangana State 
Electricity Board (TSEB). We entered into 
a contract with TSEB for power supply 
from June 2016 to May 2017 , following 
the completion of the earlier sales 
contract with the Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Board. However, we are entitled to 
compensation at 20% of the contracted 
rate for any offtake below 85% of the 
contracted quantity. 
Average power sales prices, excluding 
TSPL, were lower in FY2017 at 4.2 US 
cents per kwh (FY2016: 4.5 US cents per 
kwh) primarily due to softening rates in 
the open access power market. 
During FY2017 , average power 
generation costs excluding TSPL 
improved to 3.1 US cents per kwh 
(FY2016: 3.3 US cents per kwh) mainly 
due to increased generation from the 
newly commissioned and more energy-
efficient BALCO power plant.

PORT BUSINESS
VIZAG GENERAL CARGO BERTH (VGCB)
During FY2017 , VGCB operations showed 
a decrease of 38% in discharge as well 
as in dispatch, compared with FY2016. 
This was mainly due to reduced coal 
imports, driven by higher coal prices and 
a weaker power market. The dispatch 
tonnage decreased by 38% to 4.4 million 
tonnes (FY2016: 7 .1 million tonnes) and 
generated an EBITDA of US$1 million. 
VGCB is one of the deepest coal 
terminals on the eastern coast of India, 
which enables the docking of large 
Cape-size vessels.

Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Dear fellow shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce Vedanta’s Corporate 
Governance Report, which explains the Group’s 
governance during the year. It covers the principal 
activities of the Board and its Committees, major areas of 
the Board’s stewardship and governance actions and how 
we have complied with the principles of the September 
2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
which applied to the Company for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2017 . 
We have matched the format of this report to the 
sections of the Code namely Leadership, Effectiveness, 
Accountability and Relations with Shareholders, in order 
to provide a clear description of the work we have 
undertaken, our approach to ensuring good governance 
throughout the Group and compliance with the relevant 
provisions of the Code.
CULTURE
The Board’ s position is that good corporate governance is 
essential for delivering sustainable growth and protecting 
shareholder value and it therefore underpins the delivery  
of our strategic objectives. Similarly, corporate culture and 
values of the Group are key. As a Board, we recognise that 
the correct tone needs to be set from the top to ensure that 
good standards of behaviour permeate across all levels 
within the Group. Our values of T rust, Entrepreneurship, 
Innovation, Excellence, Integrity, Respect and Care are 
becoming increasingly embedded across all our businesses 
and drive our business model and strategy. 
The Board fosters an innovative culture and encourages 
all employees to embrace digital technology to drive 
innovation. During the year, we launched our Innovation 
and Technology online forum, ‘Eureka - Waste to Value’ to 
encourage an innovative culture and augment innovative 
practices and technology. The ‘Chairman’s Business 
Award’ further enhances the competitive motivational 
culture in the Group and drives improved performance 
across sustainability, management practices, and quality 
improvement initiatives. We have also launched the ‘One 
Vedanta’ Group intranet. This enables effective engagement 
and communication with employees throughout the Group 
and provides a forum for management to share information, 
ideas and opportunities quickly. 
Our entrepreneurial and innovative culture has helped 
Vedanta to emerge stronger and more resilient following  
a challenging period of volatile commodity markets and  
the Group is making progress on its strategic priorities to 
simplify the Group’s structure, deleverage the business  
and ramp up production in a sustainable manner. 
Read more on pages 6–61.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
Our people are our biggest asset and this is reflected in our 
values. We are committed to making Human Resources a 
transformative, value driver by capitalising the immense 
and diverse talent pool across our businesses. We continue 
to invest in the development of our employees through 
initiatives such as the Internal Growth Workshops across 
each of the Group’s business and functional pillars and the 
V-Connect mentorship programme. These initiatives provide 
a forum for identifying and developing leadership potential 
from within the Group and foster ideas generation, 
innovation and help to create an engaged workforce. 
Vedanta strives to be an ‘employer of choice’ and has 
introduced a number of progressive employee policies 
across our businesses in India, which have been 
benchmarked with the best both within and outside our 
industry in India. Vedanta’s HR policies and practices  
have contributed to the Group receiving a number of 
commendations such as inclusion in the list of ‘Top 
companies to work for in Asia’ at the Asia Corporate 
Excellence and Sustainability Awards 2016 and ‘100 Best 
Companies for Women in India’. 
STRATEGY AND GROWTH
In October 2016, the Company held a Leadership 
conference which was focused on the growth and 
evolution of Vedanta where each of the Group’s businesses 
presented blueprints for the growth of their world class 
assets in line with the Group’s strategy.
DIVERSITY
We remain committed to achieving the voluntary target of 
at least 33% female representation on the Board by 2020 
while ensuring that all appointments are made on merit to 
achieve the appropriate balance of skills and experience  
on the Board. We are also focused on enhancing gender 
diversity in management by developing the female talent 
pipeline through inclusion of our high calibre female 
employees in the Internal Growth workshops. While the 
representation of women on the Board has not changed 
during the year, there were a number of appointments and 
progressions of women in senior management positions,  109

Governance at Vedanta is an important element 
of our Board environment. It feeds into how  
we do business and how we serve our 
stakeholders. It therefore needs to be authentic 
and meaningful.
We have used the key themes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code as the 
framework for articulating the Board’ s 
activities during the year:
LEADERSHIP
EFFECTIVENESS
ACCOUNTABILITY
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS

including Ms Deshnee Naidoo to the Executive Committee, 
appointment of the deputy chief financial officer of 
Hindustan Zinc Limited and the appointment of the 
company secretary of Vedanta Limited.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
As Chairman, I am responsible for leading the Company’s 
Board of Directors and ensuring that it has the optimum 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge to operate 
effectively and deliver long-term value for shareholders. 
During the year, succession planning was a priority for both 
executive and non-executive positions on the Board. As the 
Chairman of the Company’s Nominations Committee, I am 
leading the search for suitable candidates to succeed T om 
Albanese, who will be stepping down as the Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer on 31 August 2017 . Details of a 
successor to the Chief Executive Officer will be announced in 
due course. In addition, the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director, Aman Mehta, will be retiring from the Board 
following the conclusion of the Company’s 2017 Annual 
General Meeting and we have been focused on refreshing 
the composition of the Board. I would like to thank both T om 
and Aman for their significant contributions to the Board and 
the Company. Mr Ravi Rajagopal was appointed to the Board 
in July 2016 and will succeed Mr Mehta as the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee following Mr Mehta’s retirement from 
the Board. Mr Deepak Parekh will succeed Mr Mehta as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
The Nominations Committee has been mindful of the 
recent changes to the Code in respect of the requirement 
for audit committees as a whole to have competence 
relevant to the sector in which the Company operates in 
and accordingly this was a key criterion in the Board 
recruitment specification.
Following a comprehensive search facilitated by an 
independent board recruitment agency, RGF Executive 
Search, Mr Edward Story was appointed to the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director of the Company and a member  
of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 June 2017 . 
Mr Story brings extensive strategic and operational 
expertise in the natural resources sector to the Board. He is 
currently the chief executive officer of SOCO International 
PLC, an oil & gas exploration and production company. 
SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING
Mr Akhilesh Joshi, our former President, Global Zinc 
business and director of Hindustan Zinc Limited retired 
from the Group on 30 September 2016 after 30 years of 
distinguished service. The senior management structure 
was reviewed in light of this to ensure ongoing stability of 
Vedanta’s zinc business. Mr Sunil Duggal is responsible  
for Hindustan Zinc Limited and Ms Deshnee Naidoo is 
responsible for Zinc International. On 1 October 2016, 
Mr Arun Kumar took over as the Group Chief Financial 
Officer from Mr DD Jalan following his retirement  
on 30 September 2016 after a long career at Vedanta.  
I would like to thank Mr Joshi and Mr Jalan for their 
dedicated service.
SUSTAINABILITY AND SAFETY
Safety and the goal of zero harm remains a top priority for 
the Board and senior management. We have conducted a 
number of employee townhalls on safety and held ‘Being 
Safe’ safety interactive workshops to embed safety 
consciousness throughout the Group. While we have made 
progress and achieved our best safety performance to date, 
it is immensely regrettable that there were seven fatalities 
during the year. We are developing further safety protocols 
having learned from these incidents.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND EVALUATION
This year we conducted an external formal evaluation of the 
Board’s effectiveness facilitated by Prism Board Room and I 
am pleased to confirm that we have a capable and effective 
functioning Board.

Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
ST A TEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
UK CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Corporate Governance Report set out below describes 
Vedanta’s governance structure, policies and practices and 
highlights how the Company has applied the main principles of 
the September 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) for the year ended 31 March 2017 . Further 
details of how the Company has applied the provisions of 
the Code are also contained in the reports of each Board 
Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Disclosures on share capital and related matters as required 
by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 7 .2.6) 
may be found in the Directors’ Report on pages 148 to 154. 
A copy of the Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
It is the Board’s view that the Company has, throughout the 
financial year ended 31 March 2017 , fully complied with all the 
provisions of the Code, with the exception of the following: 
CODE PROVISION A.3.1
Mr Anil Agarwal was appointed as Executive Chairman in 2005. 
Mr Agarwal is the founder of the Group and has steered its 
growth since its inception in 1976 including the flotation of 
Vedanta Resources plc on the London Stock Exchange. This 
meant that Mr Agarwal did not meet the independence criteria 
as defined in the Code on his appointment in 2005 because  
he was previously the Chief Executive and, through Volcan 
Investments Limited (Volcan), members of his family have a 
controlling interest in the Company. Mr Agarwal is pivotal in 
helping to achieve the strategic objectives of Vedanta through 
his skills in seeking out value creating acquisitions and projects. 
In addition, the fact that he dedicates himself full time to his 
role of Executive Chairman enables him to balance his 
executive duties with providing leadership to the Board. 
As Executive Chairman Mr Agarwal encourages debate and 
challenge and sets high ethical standards. For these reasons 
the Board is unanimously of the opinion that his continued 
involvement in an executive capacity is important to the 
success of the Group. 
CODE PROVISION B.1.1
Mr Aman Mehta, a Non-Executive Director, has served on 
the Company’s Board for over twelve years and was also a 
non-executive director of Cairn India Limited until its merger 
with Vedanta Limited. He was appointed as a non-executive 
director of Vedanta Limited on 17 May 2017 . The Board was 
mindful of the potential for his independence to become 
compromised and carefully reviewed his independence and 
potential for conflicts of interest. Mr Mehta did not have any 
business relationship with the Group other than his directorship 
at Cairn India (until its merger with Vedanta Limited), Vedanta 
Limited and Vedanta Resources plc. As he absents himself 
from discussions in the event of any conflict of interest but 
otherwise continues to actively participate in Board discussions 
and provides robust challenge to management, the Board 
remains satisfied that his independent judgement was not 
compromised and determined him to be independent. 
Mr Mehta will be retiring from the Board following the 
conclusion of the Company’s 2017 Annual General Meeting.
CODE PROVISION B.2.1
Volcan Investments Limited (Volcan) is a controlling shareholder 
as per the definition under the UK Listing Rules and has an 
agreement with the Company to safeguard the independence 
provisions as set out in the UK Listing Rules (Relationship 
Agreement). Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
Volcan will be consulted on all appointments to the Board. The 
Nominations Committee therefore works collaboratively with 
Volcan when making appointments to the Board and, to this 
extent, differs from the process set out in Code Provision B.2.1 
which stipulates that the Nominations Committee should lead 
the process for Board appointments.
CODE PROVISION E.2.4
The Notice of General Meeting in respect of the all-share 
merger of Vedanta Limited and Cairn India Limited was posted 
to the Company’s shareholders on 19 August 2016 following 
the approval of the related Circular and Notice of General 
Meeting by the UK Listing Authority on 19 August 2016. 
Vedanta did not meet the requirement of the Code to send 
Notices of General Meetings to shareholders at least 14 
working days in advance of the meeting because the Company 
required its shareholders to vote on the transaction prior to the 
Court convened meeting of the equity shareholders of Vedanta 
Limited on 8 September 2016 and Cairn India Limited on 
12 September 2016. Notice of General Meeting was given to 
shareholders 14 clear days before the meeting in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
resolution which was approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s 2016 Annual General Meeting permitting the  
calling of general meetings at short notice.
The Board is satisfied that the above deviations from the 
provisions of the Code are not detrimental to the Company’s 
governance for the reasons highlighted and that good 
governance remains an intrinsic part of the Group’s culture  
and operations. 111

BOARD PROGRAMME 2017
The main items of business considered by the 
Board during the year are shown below: 116
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
EFFECTIVENESS
BOARD BALANCE
The Board has a rich diversity, with Directors having diverse 
backgrounds and a wide range of international, professional and 
sector-specific experience. As the majority of Directors are 
Non-Executive Directors, the Board has an appropriate balance 
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the right 
mix of skills and experience for effective decision making. 
BOARD APPOINTMENTS
All Directors are subject to annual election or re-election by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. The 
Board believes that annual re-election promotes accountability 
to shareholders as Directors are effectively subject to an 
annual appraisal. The Board, on the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee, makes an informed decision as to 
whether it will endorse a Director for re-election. 
Following changes to the UK Listing Rules in 2014, as the 
Company is Premium listed and has a controlling shareholder, 
the appointment of the independent Non-Executive Directors 
of the Company must be approved by a majority vote of 
not only all shareholders of the Company but also of the 
independent shareholders of the Company (that is, the 
shareholders of the Company entitled to vote on the election 
of Directors who are not controlling shareholders of the 
Company). If a resolution to elect or re-elect an independent 
Non-Executive Director is not approved by a majority vote of 
both the shareholders as a whole and the independent 
shareholders of the Company at the Annual General Meeting, 
a further resolution may be put forward to be approved by 
the shareholders as a whole at a meeting which must be 
held more than 90 days after, but within 120 days, of the 
Annual General Meeting when the first vote was held. 
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
In accordance with the Code, it is the Company’s policy that 
at least half the Board, excluding the Executive Chairman, 
comprises of independent Non-Executive Directors to ensure 
that an appropriate balance is maintained between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors for effective governance and so 
that no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the 
decision-making process. The Board undertakes an evaluation 
of each Director’s independence on appointment, annually prior 
to recommending their re-election by shareholders, as well 
as when any Director’s circumstances change and warrant a 
re-evaluation. The Board regards each of the five Non-Executive 
Directors as being fully independent in character and 
judgement (see the Nominations Committee Report on page 
132. Mr Mehta will be retiring from the Board following the 
conclusion of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The Board also 
reviewed the independence of Mr Story who joins the Board 
with effect from 1 June 2017 , and determined him to be 
independent.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Board has an established procedure for the disclosure of 
interests and other related matters in line with published 
guidance and the Companies Act 2006. Each Director must 
promptly disclose actual or potential conflicts and any changes, 
to the Board which are noted at each Board meeting. The Board 
considers and authorises potential or actual conflicts, as 
appropriate. Directors with a conflict do not participate in the 
discussion or vote on the matter in question. These procedures 
have proved to be effective during the year under review. 
Related party transactions, which include those in respect of 
any Director, are disclosed in Note 39 on pages 235 to 237 .
TIME COMMITMENT
The Directors are all required to commit sufficient time to fulfil 
their responsibilities. Non-Executive Directors may serve on a 
number of other Boards provided they continue to demonstrate 
their commitment to their role as Directors of the Company. 
The Nominations Committee monitors the extent of Directors’ 
other interests to ensure that the effectiveness of the Directors 
and the Board as a whole is not compromised. 
Prior to the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors to 
the Board, candidates are notified of the time commitment 
expected of them. The Company’s Non-Executive Directors are 
expected to spend a minimum of 20 days per annum on the 
Company’s business, with greater time commitment during 
periods of heightened strategic and commercial activity as set 
out in their letters of appointment. The Non-Executive Directors’ 
letters of appointment are available on request from the 
Company Secretary. Non-Executive Directors are also required 
to disclose their other time commitments and seek the 
agreement of the Executive Chairman prior to accepting any 
additional appointments in order to ensure that they have 
sufficient time to fulfil their role as a Director.
The Board is also supportive of the Executive Directors 
accepting non-executive directorships of other companies in 
order to widen their experience and knowledge for the benefit 
of the Company. Accordingly, subject to the agreement of the 
Board, Executive Directors are permitted to accept one external 
non-executive board appointment and to retain any fees paid to 
them in respect of such appointment. Details of Mr Albanese’s 
external appointment are in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 144.
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors 
commits sufficient time to their duties in relation to the 
Company.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT WITH CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER
The Company has a written legally binding Relationship 
Agreement with its controlling shareholder, Mr Anil Agarwal, 
and his associate, Volcan Investments Limited (Volcan). The 
original Relationship Agreement entered into at the time of 
admission of the Company’s shares to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s main 
market for listed securities (Listing) in 2003 and amended in 
December 2011 was further amended in November 2014 to 
comply with the revised Listing Rules for the protection for 
minority shareholders which came into force in May 2014.
The Relationship Agreement ensures that the Group is able to 
carry on business independently of Volcan, the Agarwal family 
and their associates and that the controlling shareholder 
complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing 
Rule 6.1 .4D. Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
the Board and Nominations Committee will at all times consist 
of a majority of Directors who are independent of Volcan 
and the Agarwal family, while the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees shall at all times comprise solely of Non-Executive 
Directors. However, Volcan is entitled to nominate for 
appointment as Director such number of persons as is one less 
than the number of Directors who are independent of Volcan, 
the Agarwal family and their associates. As the Board is 
comprised of a majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors and Vedanta’s ability to operate independently of 
Volcan is protected by the Relationship Agreement, the Board  117

The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing matters 
arising in relation to the Relationship Agreement and related 
party transactions on behalf of the Board. During the year, 
there were no contracts of significance between the Company, 
or its subsidiary undertakings, and the controlling shareholder. 
The Company has complied with the independence provisions 
in the Relationship Agreement and so far as the Company is 
aware, the controlling shareholder and any of its associates 
have complied with the independence provisions and the 
procurement obligation included in the Relationship 
Agreement.
During the year, Mr Anil Agarwal notified the Company of his 
interest in acquiring a non-controlling passive equity interest 
in Anglo American plc and sought the Board’s approval for a 
waiver of the non-compete restrictions in the Relationship 
Agreement. Messrs Anil and Navin Agarwal abstained from all 
discussions in respect of this transaction due to a conflict of 
interest. The Board received independent advice from the 
Company’s legal advisers and Sponsor and carefully considered 
the merits of granting such a waiver, which was determined to 
be a Related Party transaction under the FCA ’s Listing Rules, 
prior to approving this request. 
BOARD INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS
On appointment to the Board, each Director undergoes a 
comprehensive induction programme, as appropriate, which is 
tailored to their individual needs but is intended to provide an 
introduction to the Group’s operations and the challenges and 
risks. Newly appointed Directors also receive an overview 
of their duties, corporate governance policies and Board 
processes. During the year, the following information was

ONGOING BOARD TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The Board is committed to the development of its employees 
and Directors and they are offered ongoing training as 
appropriate to assist them in the performance of their duties. 
There are also procedures in place to provide the Directors 
with appropriate and timely information, including receiving 
information between meetings regarding Group business 
development and financial performance. The Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed. The Company Secretary is also responsible for 
advising the Board through the Chairman on governance 
matters. The Company’s professional advisers are also available 
to the Directors for consultation, where necessary, for the 
discharge of their duties.
During the year, the Board and senior management received 
legal and regulatory updates on corporate governance 
developments. They also received training in respect of the UK 
Listing Rules on Related Party transactions and the EU Market 
Abuse Regulation. Detailed presentations from senior 
management were made to the Directors on the Group’s oil & 
gas, aluminium and Zinc India businesses. Some of the 
Company’s Executive and Non-Executive Directors also visited 
a number of the Group’s operations during the year, including 
KCM in Zambia, Hindustan Zinc Limited, Lanjigarh and the 
aluminium operations at BALCO and Jharsuguda in India.
BOARD EVALUATION
The effectiveness of the Board is of paramount importance to 
the overall success of the Group and the Company undertakes 
a formal and rigorous annual review of the Board and its 
Committees. The evaluation is an important part of the Board’s 
corporate governance framework and both the process and 
outcome are taken seriously by the Board, each Board 
Committee and by each individual Director. 
Pursuant to the Code, the Company carries out a 
comprehensive externally facilitated Board effectiveness review 
at least once every three years. Accordingly, the 2017 Board 
evaluation was externally facilitated by Prism Boardroom 
(Prism), a specialist Board advisory firm. Prism has no other 
connection with the Company. The Board effectiveness review 
was supplemented by an internal review of the Board 
Committees. 
BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS
Copies of agendas and minutes of all meetings of the 
Board and Board Committees were provided to Prism and 
a scope document covering the areas of enquiry and 
ground rules for the externally facilitated Board evaluation 
process were agreed with the Executive Vice Chairman 
and the Company Secretary. Detailed one-to-one 
interviews were conducted with each of the Company’s 
Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman. 
The internal Board Committee review was facilitated by 
the Company Secretary through tailored questionnaires 
in respect of the performance of each of the Board 
Committees. The questionnaires were pragmatically 
structured to draw out significant issues that were relevant 
to each of the Board Committees and to assist in 
identifying any areas for improvement. 
The 2017 Board Evaluation Report by Prism and the 
internal report on the effectiveness of each of the Board 
Committees were reviewed by the Executive Chairman 
and an action plan was formulated by management for 
presentation to the Board.
ACTIONS TAKEN DURING THE YEAR

evaluation include maintaining an ongoing focus on 
succession planning, improved reporting to the Board on 
certain key matters and initiatives to enhance diversity in 
the business.

appointment of Mr Ravi Rajagopal and Mr Edward 
Story. Mr Rajagopal has recent and relevant financial 
experience and qualifications and Mr Story has sector 
relevant experience, both of which were criteria 
determined to be of importance for the Audit 
Committee, in view of Mr Mehta’s impending 
retirement from the Board on 14 August 2017.

refreshed during the year.

Group’s businesses and the operational challenges faced. 
BOARD ADMINISTRATION
The Company implemented enhanced arrangements for 
the administration of the Board and its Committees.
2017 RECOMMENDATIONS
The Company’s 2017 Board effectiveness evaluation 
confirmed that the Board and Board Committees are 
functioning effectively. There is a good balance of skills and 
experience and a positive, collaborative atmosphere 
around the Board table providing constructive challenge to 
management. 
The recommendations from the 2017 Board evaluation 
included:
 ❯ Considering the structure and role of the Company and 
of its major subsidiary, Vedanta Limited, including a 
review of the schedules of matters reserved for the 
respective Boards and how these are aligned with each 
other;
 ❯ Reviewing the process for developing the Group’s 
long-term strategy;
 ❯ Ensuring that the successor to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer continues the focus on safety and the 
goal of zero harm across the Group;
 ❯ Reviewing how Health and Safety is managed 
throughout the Group; and
 ❯ Reviewing the time commitments expected of each of 
the Company’s Non-Executive Directors.
The findings and recommendations from the 2017 
evaluation exercise were discussed with the Executive 
Chairman and reviewed by the whole Board before a set of 
actions were agreed. Each of these key areas will remain 
firmly on the Board’s agenda during the year ahead and will 
be reported on in the Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts FY2018.
The actions which were agreed following the Board and 
Committee evaluations are as follows:
 ❯ Management will enhance the Board’s strategy 
development sessions by considering how the output 
from the strategy sessions at Vedanta Limited can be 
combined with the Company’s strategy discussions to 
avoid a duplication of effort;
 ❯ Management will progress the review of the role and 
structure of the Group and engage advisers to develop 
this further;
 ❯ Management will combine the annual strategy away 
sessions with a site visit to one of the Group’s 
businesses to enhance the Board’s understanding of 
the key challenges and progress of that business;
 ❯ The role profile for the successor to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer will include Health and Safety as a 
key responsibility of that role;
 ❯ The Company will review the Board recruitment 
process to identify ways to improve its effectiveness 
and ensure that the Board has the appropriate mix of 
skills, experience and diversity to deliver its objectives; 
and
 ❯ Management will review the ownership of Health and 
Safety across the Group and ensure that it is a key 
standing item on the Board’s agenda to enable the 
Board to regularly monitor the progress made.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL FRAMEWORK
Vedanta’s risk management framework serves to identify, 
assess and respond to the principal and emerging risks 
facing the Group’s business and is designed to be simple and 
consistent and provide clarity on managing and reporting risks 
to the Board. The Group’s management systems, organisational 
structures, processes, standards and Code of Conduct and 
Ethics together form the system of internal control that 
governs how the Group conducts its business and manages 
the associated risks. 
The Board has reviewed the internal control system in place 
during the year and up to the date of the approval of this Report 
to ensure that it remains effective. The Board’s review included 
the Audit Committee’s report on the risk matrix, significant 
risks and actions put in place to mitigate these risks. Any 
weaknesses identified by the review are addressed by 
enhanced procedures to strengthen the relevant controls 
and these are in turn reviewed at regular intervals.
WHISTLEBLOWER PROCEDURE
All Vedanta employees are expected to observe high ethical 
standards which are enshrined in the Vedanta Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics, and employees in key positions 
are required to complete the Annual Code of Conduct 
Certification form. The annual certification process reinforces 
our commitment to ethical practices and promoting an ethical 
culture across the Group.
The Group’s Whistleblower Policy forms part of the Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics and supports the Group’s aim 
of working to the highest ethical standards. The policy allows 
employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and all external 
stakeholders to raise issues of concern in confidence. Under 
the Whistleblower Policy adopted by each of the businesses 
in the Group, all complaints are reported to the Director, MAS 
who is independent of operating management and businesses. 
Dedicated email addresses and a centralised database have 
been created to facilitate the receipt of complaints and for ease 
of reporting. The Company has a 24x7 ethics helpline where 
employees can place anonymous complaints in respect of 
violations of the Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
All employees and stakeholders can register their integrity-
related concerns either by calling a freephone number or via 
a web based portal. The hotline also provides multiple local 
language options. 
 
Following an investigation, established cases are brought to the 
Group Ethics Committee for decision making. The Group Ethics 
Committee is a management committee whose core purpose 
is to reinforce Vedanta’s commitment to zero tolerance of 
unethical behaviour. The Ethics Committee also ensures 
uniformity and consistency in the decision-making process 
following investigation of reported whistleblower incidents 
and other ethics violations. All cases are taken to their logical 
closure. A summary of cases along with outcome of the 
investigations and actions taken is presented periodically to the 
audit committees of the respective businesses as well as at 
Group level. During the year, the composition of the Group 
Ethics Committee was refreshed to encourage diversity of 
ideas and perspective.
FRAUD AND UK BRIBERY ACT
The Board has a zero tolerance policy for corruption and the 
Company is committed to the elimination of fraud, with each 
suspected case thoroughly investigated and concluded. The 
Audit Committee reviews the actions taken by management in 
the elimination of fraudulent practices and to promote ethical 
working practices.  122

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board recognises the value of maintaining an ongoing 
dialogue with the Company’s shareholders to ensure a mutual 
understanding of the Group’s strategy, performance and 
governance. Investors are kept informed of the Group’s 
performance and progress through regular corporate updates 
such as the preliminary results announcement, half-year results 
announcement, Annual Report and Accounts, Notice of Annual 
General Meeting and regulatory announcements in respect of 
significant developments in the Group. These communications

The Group arranges regular meetings with institutional 
investors, analysts, brokers and fund managers which are

the Investor Relations team to keep investors informed and 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders. 
The Senior Independent Director and other Non-Executive 
Directors are available to meet with major investors to discuss 
any specific issues. During the year, the Board received 
feedback from some of its major shareholders in respect of the 
composition of the Board and the importance of new Non-
Executive Directors having UK listed company experience. The 
Nominations Committee was mindful of these concerns and 
ensured that the Non-Executive Director recruitment search 
focused on candidates with sector-relevant experience in UK 
listed companies. 
The Company arranges site visits to the Group’s major 
operations for institutional investors, analysts and brokers from 
time to time to provide them with a better understanding of the 
strengths and capabilities of the Group’s business operations.
The Board is kept informed of share price performance, 
shareholder sentiment and issues raised by the Company’s 
investors, brokers and analysts through regular updates from 
the Director, Investor Relations and the Company Secretary. 
The Group held its second Sustainable Development Day in 
London on 24 June 2016 to engage with the Company’s 
stakeholders on sustainability and corporate responsibility 
matters and to reiterate the Group’s commitment to the zero 
harm philosophy. The event was attended by senior management 
and several members of the Board, including the Executive 
Chairman, Anil Agarwal, Chief Executive Officer, T om Albanese 
and Chair of the Company’s Sustainability Committee, Katya 
Zotova, and enabled the Board to get a better understanding of 
stakeholders’ concerns on sustainability matters.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT
Dear shareholder, 
I am pleased to introduce this report which sets out how 
the Audit Committee has discharged its responsibilities 
during the year.
The Audit Committee’s remit falls into four main areas: 
oversight of financial reporting, risk and the internal control 
environment, external audit and internal audit processes. 
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that sound risk 
management and internal control systems are in place 
throughout the Group. 
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the 
Company’s financial reporting process in order to ensure 
that the information provided to the Company’s 
shareholders is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. As detailed below, the Audit 
Committee addressed and challenged the key accounting 
and other judgements presented by management 
throughout the year and for the preparation of the Annual 
Report and Accounts FY2017 . As a result and as supported 
by the high standard of reporting by management, the 
Audit Committee concluded that we have discharged our 
responsibilities effectively. I am pleased to confirm on 
behalf of the Audit Committee that the Annual Report 
and Accounts FY2017 including the financial statements 
are considered fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL ASSESSMENT
During the year, the Committee continued to monitor the 
market conditions, risks and uncertainties relevant to the 
Group, reviewed the risk management framework and 
reported to the Board on relevant risks affecting the 
Group. The Committee received regular updates from 
management confirming that risks relevant to the  
Group were appropriately categorised to ensure that  
the Committee understood the potential impact to the 
Group and adequate resources were allocated to manage 
the risks.
AUDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
During the year, the Audit Committee’s composition was 
refreshed following the retirement of Mr Euan Macdonald 
from the Board in August 2016. I am pleased to confirm 
that the Audit Committee meets the requirement of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code to have at least one 
member with competence in accounting. Mr Edward 
Story will be appointed as a member of the Audit 
Committee to enhance its composition with natural 
resources sector experience and meet the enhanced 
requirements of the Code for the Audit Committee to 
have competence relevant to the sector as a whole. 
UK TAX STATEMENT
During the year, the Group Head of Taxation led the 
preparation of the Group’s Tax Strategy including the 
UK tax arrangements in accordance with the new tax 
governance measures in the UK Finance Bill 2016 which 
came into force on 15 September 2016. Vedanta’s UK tax 
strategy has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
will be published on the Company’s website following 
approval by the Board.
The Audit Committee’s remit falls into 
four main areas: financial reporting, risk 
and the internal control environment, 
and oversight of the external and 
internal audit processes.

MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE
The Audit Committee comprises the following independent 
Non-Executive Directors who met on four occasions during the

Committee reports to the Board on the Audit Committee’s 
activities following each meeting. The external auditor 
attends meetings of the Audit Committee to ensure effective 
communication of matters relating to the external audit of 
the Group’s full year and interim financial statements.

4  Mr Rajagopal attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee which he was entitled to

Mr Mehta has been the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
since 24 November 2004. As shown in his biography on page 
104, Mr Mehta has extensive executive and non-executive 
experience with a strong financial background in large listed 
companies. The Board is therefore satisfied that Mr Mehta has 
recent and relevant financial experience as is required by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. Mr Mehta will be retiring from 
the Board and as Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect 
from the conclusion of the Company’s 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. Mr Ravi Rajagopal, who will succeed Mr Mehta as 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect from the

collective knowledge, skills, experience and objectivity enables 
the Audit Committee to work effectively and to probe and 
challenge management. With effect from 1 June 2017 , 
Mr Edward Story will be appointed to the Audit Committee, 
thereby enhancing the Audit Committee’s competence relevant 
to the sector in which the Group operates. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in the discharge of its 
responsibility for maintaining and monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial statements, assessing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls 
and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. 
Whilst the Audit Committee has very specific responsibilities 
as set out in its terms of reference, it serves a much greater 
purpose in reassuring shareholders that their interests are 
properly protected in respect of the financial management and 
reporting, on which the Audit Committee regularly reports to 
the Board. The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility to 
oversee the Company’s procedures and systems in relation to 
risk management and internal control that is adopted by the 
Company. In order to carry out its duties effectively, the Audit 
Committee receives high quality and detailed information from 
management and the internal and external auditor which is 
reviewed regularly, discussed and challenged by the Audit 
Committee as required.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s 
financial results, including significant financial reporting 
estimates and judgements, as well as the financial disclosures 
in the interim management statements, monitored the Group’s 
system of internal control and management of the Group’s 
risks and oversaw the relationship with the external auditor and 
with the internal audit function. 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board has established formal and transparent 
arrangements for considering how they should apply the 
corporate reporting, risk management and internal control 
principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship  
with the Company’s external auditor. The main responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee are included in its terms of reference 
which can be found on the Company’s website at

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FY2017 REVIEW
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee considered 
whether the Annual Report and Accounts FY2017 was fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether it provided the 
necessary information for shareholders and stakeholders to

of this Annual Report and Accounts FY2017 . The Audit 
Committee and the Board are satisfied that the Annual Report 
and Accounts FY2017 meet this requirement as both positive 
and negative developments in the year were considered at 
length. In justifying this statement, the Audit Committee has 
considered the robust process which operates in creating the

 ❯ Evaluation and verification of the inputs from the business 
functions, to include the well-established financial reporting 
system within Vedanta to ensure accuracy and consistency;
 ❯ Progress through various levels of review, including review 
by the Executive Committee and senior management

and sign-off the draft Annual Report and Accounts FY2017; 
and

sign-off.
WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy 
of the Group’s whistleblower arrangements and ensuring that 
all reported whistleblower incidents are appropriately 
investigated and actioned. 
The Group’s Whistleblower Policy forms part of the Vedanta 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and enables employees 
of the Company, its subsidiaries and all external stakeholders to 
raise concerns about suspected wrongdoing within the Group 
in confidence. The Whistleblower Policy has been extended to 
cover the requirements of the UK legislation covering slavery 
and human trafficking reporting. Further details of the Group’s 
whistleblower arrangements can be found on page 121 .
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the Group’s 
whistleblower arrangements and monitors the outcome of 
investigations into whistleblower incidents received.

The Company is committed to the elimination of fraud, with 
each suspected case thoroughly investigated and concluded. 
The Audit Committee reviews the actions taken by 
management in the elimination of fraudulent practices and to 
promote ethical working practices. 
COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY 2014 ORDER
During the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Company was 
compliant with the Competition and Markets Authority 2014 
Order on mandatory tendering and audit committee 
responsibilities.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
Following the competitive tender process for the provision of 
external audit services in 2015 and approval by shareholders at 
the Company’s 2016 Annual General Meeting, Ernst & Y oung 
LLP (E&Y) was appointed as the Group’s external auditor with 
effect from the financial year which commenced on 1 April 
2016. A resolution to re-appoint E&Y as the Group’s external 
auditor will be proposed at the Company’s 2017 Annual General 
Meeting.
THE AUDIT PROCESS
A detailed audit plan (the Audit Plan) is prepared by the external 
auditor, E&Y which is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Plan sets out the audit scope, key audit risks identified, 
materiality issues, the client team working on the audit and 
the audit timetable. The audit scope covers the significant 
components of the audit and audit plans for each component 
and geographical location. Each of the key audit risks and the 
external auditor’s response on how it will investigate these 
risks is considered by the Audit Committee. 
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The preparation of financial statements requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amount 
of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of 
contingent liabilities at the date of these financial statements 
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the 
years presented. The Audit Committee reviews whether the 
Group’s accounting policies are appropriate, and management’s 
estimate and judgements applied in the financial statements 
are reasonable. The Audit Committee also reviewed the 
disclosures made in the financial statements. The views of  
the statutory auditor on these significant issues were also 
considered by the Audit Committee.

business
 ❯ Copper operations in Zambia
 ❯ Alumina refinery assets at Lanjigarh
 ❯ Iron Ore business at Goa and Karnataka
 ❯ Assets under construction
More information is provided in Note 2(b) and Note 5 to 
the financial statements
Given the clarity on the policy for the grant of extension to Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), 
other taxation clarity and changes to the decommissioning liability, Rajasthan producing assets 
within the Oil & Gas business were considered for impairment review. The Committee has 
reviewed the significant assumptions including the oil price, decommissioning liability and the 
discount rate. An impairment charge of US$ 63 million has been recognised against these assets.
Impairment assessment of copper operations in Zambia is considered a significant issue 
considering lower equipment availability, throughput constraints and other operational challenges 
including production ramp up. The significant assumptions of commodity prices, increase in 
production and discount rate were reviewed by the Committee.
The partly complete Lanjigarh refinery expansion programme within the Aluminium business unit 
got regulatory approvals during previous year FY2015-16 to expand unconditionally up to 4mtpa. 
Impairment assessment of Alumina refinery assets at Lanjigarh is considered a significant issue 
due to delays in obtaining local bauxite mining approvals/gaining access to local bauxite. The 
significant assumption of timing of approval/gaining access to local bauxite was put through a 
stress test by the Committee and other assumptions of discount rates and commodity prices 
were reviewed by the Committee.
The mining operations at Karnataka and Goa were resumed towards the end of February 2015 and 
October 2015 respectively. The significant assumptions of commodity prices and the cap on 
mining were reviewed by the Committee.
An old item classified under ‘ Assets under construction’ was impaired due to expiry of the legal 
agreement and a charge of US$ 30 million has been recognised.
The Committee was also informed that the impairment assessment approach and assumptions 
are consistent across all business segments. With the existence of sufficient headroom over 
carrying value of assets it was concluded that no impairment is required for Zambia copper 
operations, Lanjigarh assets and Goa and Karnataka iron ore assets.
Impairment assessment of evaluation and exploration
(E&E) assets:
 ❯ Oil & Gas business
More information is provided in Note 2(b) and Note 5 to 
the financial statements
Given the clarity on the policy for the grant of extension to Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), 
other taxation clarity and changes to the decommissioning liability, E&E assets in the oil & gas 
business were considered for impairment review. The significant assumptions, including for oil 
prices, decommissioning liability and the discount rate, were reviewed by the Committee.
An impairment reversal of US$ 76 million has been recognised against Oil & Gas and E&E assets 
primarily relating to the Rajasthan block.
Revenue recognition across the business:
 ❯ Provisional pricing for sale of goods
 ❯ Oil & Gas revenue
 ❯ Power tariff with Grid Corporation of Odisha Limited 
(‘GRIDCO’)
 ❯ Power Purchase Agreement with Punjab State Power 
Corporation Limited (‘PSPCL’)
The Committee reviewed the process and compliance around the Group’s revenue recognition 
policy and its consistent application. The Committee also sought management’s view on revenue 
recognition principles. The Committee was satisfied that the cut-off procedures, transfer of risks 
and process followed for the pricing of goods were consistent and it concluded that these risks 
have been mitigated. 
Further, the receivables from GRIDCO (which is under appeal following a tariff determination 
assessment by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission) was assessed by the Committee 
together with revenue recognition in terms of the requirements of IAS 18. The receivable from 
PSPCL were also reviewed for recoverability including revenue recognition in terms of the 
requirements of IAS 18. The assessment was supported by legal opinion from external legal 
counsel, wherever required. The Committee considered the revenue recognition and recoverability 
of receivables to be fairly stated in the financial statements.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risks
Refer to Note 38 to the financial statements
A comprehensive legal paper was placed before the Committee for its consideration. The 
mitigating factors were discussed by the Committee with senior management.
The Committee also reviewed the probable, possible and remote analysis carried out by 
management and disclosure of contingent liabilities in the financial statements. In all significant 
cases, management’s assessment was supported by legal opinions from external legal counsel.
T axation
Additional information on these matters is disclosed in 
Note 38 to the financial statements
A comprehensive tax paper outlining taxation disputes in respect of withholding taxes following 
past acquisitions, eligibility of tax incentives and output taxes and other matters was placed 
before the Committee for its consideration. The Committee discussed these tax issues and 
reviewed the assessment of probable, possible and remote analysis and the process followed by 
management.
The contingent liability disclosure was also reviewed by the Committee. In certain cases, the 
views of tax experts supporting management’s assessment were also provided to the 
Committee.
The significant issues that were considered by the Audit Committee in relation to the financial statements are outlined below: 128
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
EXTERNAL AUDITOR REMUNERATION
The Audit Committee is responsible for determining the 
external auditor’s remuneration on behalf of the Board, subject 
to the approval by shareholders at the Company’s forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE AND PROVISION OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES  
BY THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the external 
auditor’s independence and assessing their continued 
effectiveness. The Audit Committee and the Board place great 
emphasis on the objectivity of the external auditor. There are 
two aspects to the external auditor independence that the 
Audit Committee monitors:
Firstly, in accordance with the Auditing Practices Board Ethical 
Standards, E&Y has to implement rules and requirements such 
that none of its employees working on our audit can hold any 
shares in Vedanta Resources plc. E&Y is also required to inform 
the Company of any significant facts and matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on its independence or on the 
objectivity of the lead partner and the audit team. The lead 
partner must change every five years.
Secondly, the Audit Committee considers and approves all 
the fees that the Company pays for audit, audit-related and 
non-audit services performed by E&Y . 
The Group’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditor specifies the services which the external 
auditor is permitted to and prohibited from undertaking in 
order to safeguard their objectivity and independence as such 
services present a high risk of conflict and could undermine the 
external auditor’s independence. The Company’s Non-Audit 
Services Policy was reviewed and updated in November 2016 
to reflect the requirements of the FRC’s revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016, guidance for Audit Committees and 
the EU Audit Directive. Prohibited non-audit services include 
work relating to the financial statements that will ultimately be 
subject to audit, certain tax, consultancy and advisory services 
and the provision of internal audit services amongst others. The 
policy also identifies those services which the external auditor 
is permitted to deliver to the Group. These include work on 
mergers and acquisitions, regulatory reviews, any certification 
required under loan agreements or bond covenants and 
assurance work in respect of compliance and corporate 
governance amongst others. 
Furthermore, auditor independence is also safeguarded 
by limiting the value of non-audit services performed by 
the external auditor. In accordance with the FRC’s Ethical 
Standards 2016, a cap for non-audit services will be set at 70% 
of the average audit fees based on a three-year average and 
will first be applied from the fourth year commencing on 1 April 
2020. The Audit Committee will monitor all non-audit services 
each year to ensure that they are in compliance with the 
requirements. Of the permitted services, any assignment in 
excess of US$30,000 may only be awarded to the external 
auditor with the prior approval of the Audit Committee.
All permitted non-audit services and the fees paid to the 
external auditor for non-audit work are reported to the Audit 
Committee. An analysis of non-audit fees can be found in 
Note 11 to the financial statements.
The Company also has a policy on employment of former 
employees of the external auditor to maintain the auditor’s 
independence. 
PERFORMANCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Audit Committee is pivotal in monitoring the performance 
of the external auditor and the Group’s relationship with the 
external auditor. During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed 
the effectiveness of Ernst & Y oung LLP in its first year as the 
Group’s external auditor using a survey comprising a range of 
questions covering objectivity, quality and efficiency. The Audit 
Committee concluded that the results of the survey were 
positive and considered that they had provided a high quality 
audit.
FRC’S CORPORATE REPORTING REVIEW
The Company’s Annual Report and Accounts FY2016 has not 
been reviewed by the FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review team.
AUDIT COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
As part of the Board’s annual evaluation of its effectiveness 
and that of its Committees, described on page 118, the Audit 
Committee assessed its own effectiveness. The members of 
the Audit Committee agreed that its overall performance had 
been effective during the year.
THE YEAR AHEAD
The Audit Committee’s objectives for the forthcoming year 
include:
 ❯ Working closely with E&Y to understand key areas for focus, 
to streamline the audit process including its automation and 
to enhance the Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control; and
 ❯ Consideration and implementation of arrangements to 
enhance the Audit Committee’s effectiveness such as 
reconstitution of the composition of the Audit Committee, 
review of the Audit Committee calendar and agenda to 
enhance focus on risk and internal controls.

ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and Board Committees, 
ensuring that the appropriate mix of skills, experience, 
diversity and independence is present on the Board for it 
to function effectively. The Nominations Committee also 
leads the process for new Board appointments, advises 
the Board on succession planning arrangements and 
oversees the development of management talent 
within the Group. The Nominations Committee works 
collaboratively with Volcan Investments Limited on new 
Board appointments in accordance with the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement between the Company, Mr Anil 
Agarwal and Volcan Investments Limited.
The responsibilities of the Nominations Committee are 
set out in its terms of reference which can be found on 
the Company’s website at www.vedantaresources.com/
committees.
BOARD DIVERSITY
The Board recognises the benefit that diversity of thought 
and representation can bring to Board debate and 
perspective. Board diversity has been considered from a 
number of aspects, including, but not limited to, age, 
gender, race and ethnic origin, cultural and educational 
background. The Board has a wide range of knowledge 
and expertise including mining, oil & gas, corporate 
finance, banking, diplomacy and governance. 
The Board remains committed to achieving a minimum of 
33% female representation on the Board by 2020, while 
maintaining diversity in its broadest sense. While all 
appointments are made on merit, measured against 
objective criteria and the skills and experience of the 
candidate, in order to achieve this target for women on 
the Board, the Nominations Committee ensures that 
female candidates are considered routinely as part of 
the recruitment process. The Nominations Committee 
acknowledges that there is further work to be done in 
respect of increasing gender diversity on the Board and 
this remains an ongoing priority for the Nominations 
Committee and the Board. 130
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
The Group actively encourages and monitors the progress of 
female executives throughout the Group. Significant progress 
has been made to increase gender diversity across the Group’s 
workforce and senior management population and to develop 
the female pipeline of high calibre talent across the Group 
through various mentoring and leadership development 
programmes such as Internal Growth Workshops and 
V-Connect. Initiatives to enhance gender diversity across the 
Group also included implementing family-friendly HR policies 
to address the barriers for women with children in returning to 
work. By supporting equal opportunities we will ensure that the 
pool of women from which management can be drawn will 
increase. During the year, notable internal appointments and 
advances of women in senior management within the Group 
included Ms Deshnee Naidoo joining the Company’s Executive 
Committee, the appointment of the company secretary of 
Vedanta Limited and of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of 
Hindustan Zinc Limited.
Women currently comprise 10% of the overall employee 
population within the Group, whereas the percentage of 
female representation across the Group’s professional 
population is 11%. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
The focus this year has continued to be on succession planning 
for the role of Chief Executive Officer to succeed Mr Albanese 
and refreshing the Board’s and Board Committees’ composition 
through the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors, 
given Mr Mehta’s upcoming retirement, having served on the 
Board for over 12 years. 
The main areas covered by the Nominations Committee during the year are summarised below:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT
BOARD APPOINTMENTS
When considering new appointments to the Board, the 
Nominations Committee reviews the balance of skills, 
experience and diversity on the Board to identify those criteria 
which are determined to be vital for enhancing the Board’s 
effectiveness. These criteria form the basis of the search for 
new appointments to the Board. During the year, the 
Nominations Committee appointed independent Board 
recruitment agency, RGF Executive Search (RGF) to conduct 
a global search for new Non-Executive Directors to refresh the 
composition of the Board. RGF has no other connection with 
the Group other than to provide recruitment consultancy 
services to the Nominations Committee.
Mr Ravi Rajagopal was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2016 
and brings a wealth of experience across finance and 
operational roles in a FTSE100 company to the Board. In 
addition, he has recent and relevant financial experience and 
qualifications, which were criteria determined to be of 
importance for the Audit Committee, in view of Mr Mehta’s 
impending retirement from the Board on 14 August 2017 .
RGF was also provided with a brief to identify candidates that 
had relevant UK listed company experience within the 
extractive industries. The brief also requested the inclusion of 
more female candidates on candidate shortlists to address the 
lack of gender diversity on the Board and meet the aspirational 
target of achieving 33% of women on the Board by 2020. 
While the Nominations Committee is committed to addressing 
the gender imbalance, it is of the view that any appointments 
to the Board should be based on merit rather than to fulfil 
targets. Mr Edward Story has been appointed as an 
independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 June 
2017 . Mr Story is the chief executive officer of SOCO 
International PLC and will bring a wealth of operational and 
strategic experience of the oil & gas industry to the Board. He 
will also become a member of the Audit Committee from 
1 June 2017 to ensure that the Audit Committee as a whole 
has competence relevant to the sector. 
BOARD INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS
On appointment to the Board, each Director undergoes a 
comprehensive induction programme as appropriate which is 
tailored to their individual needs but is intended to provide an 
introduction to the Group’s operations, challenges and risks.  
Newly appointed Directors also receive an overview of their 
duties, corporate governance policies and Board processes. 
During the year, Mr Rajagopal received a comprehensive 
induction on and following his appointment to the Board. 
Further details are provided on page 117 .
TIME COMMITMENT
The Directors are all required to commit sufficient time to fulfil 
their responsibilities. Further details are disclosed on page 116. 
The Nominations Committee monitors the extent of Directors’ 
other interests to ensure that the effectiveness of the Directors 
and the Board as a whole is not compromised. The 
Nominations Committee was mindful of shareholder concerns 
over Mr Parekh’s external appointments in light of the 
significant shareholder vote against his re-election as a Director 
of the Company and shareholder feedback in respect of this. 
Following careful consideration of Mr Parekh’s external 
appointments, none of which has any exceptional 
circumstances which would require additional time 
commitment, the Nominations Committee determined that the 
wealth of his expertise and experience across a diverse range 
of sectors was a huge benefit to the Board and the Group. 
Furthermore, Mr Parekh’s other appointments did not 
compromise his commitment to the Board as he was able to 
attend the majority of Board meetings held during the year, 
including those held on short notice, and participate fully in 
discussions. 
The Nominations Committee is satisfied that each of the 
Non-Executive Directors commits sufficient time to their duties 
in relation to the Company.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Board succession planning was at the forefront of the 
Nominations Committee’s considerations during the year and 
the Nominations Committee was focused on the search for 
new Non-Executive Directors to refresh the composition of the 
Board and its Committees. As detailed above, following an 
evaluation of the skills and experience present on the Board 
and a thorough assessment of the skills that would enhance its 
effectiveness, Mr Rajagopal and Mr Story were appointed as 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
A key priority of the Nominations Committee is the search for a 
successor to the Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tom 
Albanese, who steps down from the Board on 31 August 2017 . 
The Board recruitment process is underway and further details 
will be announced in due course. 132
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
The Nominations Committee also reviewed the composition  
of the Board Committees and succession for the role of the 
Senior Independent Director in view of Mr Mehta’s impending 
retirement from the Board. Following the review, the 
Nominations Committee recommended to the Board that 
Mr Deepak Parekh be appointed as the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director and Mr Ravi Rajagopal be appointed as 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee with effect from the 
conclusion of the Company’s 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
The Nominations Committee will continue to keep the 
composition of the Board Committees under review. 
TALENT DEVELOPMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING
Our people are our biggest asset for the delivery of business 
results and long-term shareholder value and continued 
investment in our people is critical to our future success. 
In line with our philosophy, the Group conducts ‘ Internal 
Growth Workshops’ which are focused on promoting internal 
talent across the Group’s businesses and functions into 
leadership roles. The Internal Growth Workshops have 
identified over 321 new leaders, including 72 female 
professionals, across the Group’s businesses to date who have 
taken up significantly elevated roles and responsibilities. 
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
During the year, the Board carefully considered the 
independence of Mr Mehta as he has served on the 
Company’s Board for over twelve years. As he also served as  
a non-executive director on the board of Cairn India Limited 
(until its merger with Vedanta Limited), and is a non-executive 
director of Vedanta Limited, the Nominations Committee 
reviewed the potential conflicts of interest arising from those 
appointments. Mr Mehta absents himself from discussions 
in the event of any conflict of interest and continues to actively 
participate in Board discussions and provide robust challenge  
to management. Accordingly, the Nominations Committee 
concluded that his independent judgement was not 
compromised and he remained impartial and able to act in the 
best interests of the Company. Mr Mehta will be retiring from 
the Board following the conclusion of the Company’s 2017 
Annual General Meeting on 14 August 2017 and will not be 
standing for re-election by shareholders.
Mr Green’s independence was also subject to close scrutiny 
due to his current role as Chair of the Financial Reporting 
Review Panel. The Board determined that there were no 
conflicts of interest arising out of the appointment.
Following the review of the Non-Executive Directors’ 
independence, the Board has determined that all of the current 
Non-Executive Directors are independent and free from any 
relationship or circumstance that could affect or appear to 
affect their independent judgement.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
As part of our annual review process, the Nominations 
Committee reviewed and considered all situations entered in 
the Conflicts Register and remains satisfied that the 
independence of those Directors who have external board 
appointments has not been compromised.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
As part of the Board’s annual evaluation of its effectiveness 
and that of its Committees, described on page 118, the 
Nominations Committee assessed its own effectiveness. The 
members of the Nominations Committee agreed that its overall 
performance had been effective during the year.
THE YEAR AHEAD
The Nominations Committee’s objectives for the coming year are:
 ❯ Board recruitment for the appointment of a successor to the 
Group Chief Executive Officer; 
 ❯ Review of the Board recruitment process to identify ways to 
improve its effectiveness and ensure that the Board has the 
appropriate mix of skills, experience and diversity to deliver 
its objectives; and
 ❯ Review of the Board diversity goals and identify ways in 
which this could be progressed.

SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce this Sustainability Committee 
Report which provides details of the role and responsibilities 
of the Sustainability Committee and the work it has 
undertaken during the year.
Vedanta’s business model is to deliver operational 
excellence while demonstrating world-class standards of 
governance, safety, environmental and social responsibility 
in the locations of each of the Group’s operations and 
projects. The Vedanta Sustainability Framework guides us 
to ensure a long-term, sustainable future for our business 
operations, meeting our growth aspirations, and creating 
long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
The robust implementation of the Vedanta Sustainability 
Framework (VSF) has been a top priority for the 
Sustainability Committee and we’ve made significant 
improvements in the way we conduct our business since 
its launch in 2012. One of the significant sustainability 
objectives for our business has been our Group’s safety 
performance. Considerable efforts have been made in this 
sphere with involvement at all levels, however we still have 
a long journey ahead of us. I’m deeply saddened that 
seven people lost their lives while working for or with 
Vedanta during the financial year under review. One of 
these tragedies was an unfortunate crane accident at a 
project site in Rajasthan, which led to the loss of four 
invaluable lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with the 
families and loved ones of everyone involved. The accident 
highlighted a certain vulnerability across our contractor 
safety management system while working with cranes, 
even when they are well established and well known for 
their expertise and safety practices. Important lessons 
have been learned by both sides and Vedanta has decided 
to introduce a Crane Safety Performance Standard 
to ensure proper safety management during crane 
operations. As a Board Committee we have to ensure that 
such events do not shake our confidence in the journey 
of achieving ‘Zero Harm’. We have certainly made good 
progress over the years and will continue to make 
ourselves a safer and a better company. 
Another important aspect is ensuring that lessons from 
incidents are institutionalised across the businesses and 
repeat incidents are eliminated. To this effect, we ensure 
that each subsidiary company’s chief executive presents 
a detailed appraisal of critical incidents along with root 
causes and action plans to the Committee. Through 
Corporate HSE, we’ve started tracking ‘sign off’ from 
Chief Operating Officers on lessons from High Potential 
Incidents (HIPOs). 
We maintained our focus on containing impacts on air, 
water, waste and tailing related risks, to achieve our targets 
on water savings, energy savings and waste recycling 
during the year. Businesses have met many of their goals 
but a few remain where we fell short of targets and those 
businesses are working on the root causes.
During the Company’s 2016 Annual General Meeting, 
some contentious sustainability issues were raised by 
stakeholders, including the Niyamgiri Bauxite Deposit, 
Balco Chimney Collapse in 2009, Bodai Daldali and KCM 
pollution cases. As a Committee we took note of the 
issues and reviewed the current status, sought further 
details as required and asked for development of remedial 
measures to ensure that actions taken are in line with 
VSF requirements and commitments and that we can 
effectively address these at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. Stakeholder engagement is key in the entire 
process and the Group’s businesses are encouraged to 
maintain transparent and collaborative relationships with 
all stakeholders. 
Post Paris Convention (COP 21), climate change has again 
emerged as a key global challenge of focus for the world. 
INDCs developed by signatory countries have become  
a guidance document and a road map for action. We are 
pleased to see India’s inclusion as a signatory, but as an 
Indian company, we do respect India’s unique issues in 
the carbon debate. As a Committee we’ve overseen the 
progress made by the business in developing the carbon 
policy/strategy and action plan through a formalized 
interdisciplinary forum, ‘Carbon Forum’ headed by the 
CEO, Power.
Businesses’ contribution on Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) is another important dimension which 
has become a forefront issue of deliberation and action. 
The Sustainability Committee reviewed the preliminary 
assessment of priority SDGs and recommended detailed 
workings with appropriate action plan/road map for the 
priority SDGs at Group level.
We are using the Vedanta Sustainability Assurance 
Programme (VSAP) as our internal tool to monitor 
implementation of the VSF . As a result of follow-up audit 
processes, including review and implementation of action 
plans, each of the businesses, operational sites and mines 
have put in place objectives and programmes in line with 
our framework requirements and monitors performance 
at regular intervals, with emphasis on the completion of 
actions from past audits. I take this opportunity to thank the 
management across our businesses for their commitment 
to VSAP , which has been a demanding exercise. 134

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 
2017 . The report sets out disclosures in relation to Annual 
Report on Remuneration which details the remuneration paid 
to the Directors last year as per the policy, which received 
shareholder approval in 2014. The Remuneration of the 
Executive Directors continues to be linked with the overall 
Business Performance. The Regulations require that 
shareholders formally approve the Remuneration Policy every 
three years. It is intended that the Remuneration Policy will 
be put before shareholders for approval by way of a binding 
vote at the Company’s AGM on 14 August 2017 . If approved 
by shareholders, the Remuneration Policy will have effect 
immediately thereafter. Prior to that date, the Company’s 
existing Remuneration Policy will continue to apply.
The Company reviewed the Remuneration Policy during the 
year and believes that it remains appropriate. As such, the 
2017 Remuneration Policy will remain broadly unchanged 
from the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM.
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE 
Having weathered the prior year’s market downturn, we have 
continued to build on our status as a low-cost, diversified 
producer. During FY2017 we also delivered our promised 
merger of Cairn India Limited (Cairn India) and Vedanta 
Limited, simplifying the group structure. This is a significant 
step forward towards achieving our stated long-term vision  
of alignment of interests between all shareholders for the 
creation of long-term sustainable value.
The Business showed its resilience in the face of a tough 
market and a challenging economic climate. The group 
achieved significant milestones operationally, financially  
and strategically during the year. A synopsis of the Business 
Performance is outlined below:
 ❯ Financial & Operational Performance:
During FY2017 , a combination of a strong operating 
performance driven by ramping up capacity, cost efficiency 
and marketing initiatives and improved commodity prices 
from the lows of FY2016, resulted in an EBITDA of US$3.2 
billion with robust margins of 36%. (FY2016: US$2.3 billion 
and 28%). Commodity prices improved during the year, 
resulting in increased EBITDA by US$552 million. Most of  
the operating currencies depreciated against the US$ during 
FY2017 , resulting in a favourable impact on EBITDA by 
US$105 million. We further strengthened our financial 
position, through our continued focus on deleveraging our 
balance sheet and extending maturity commitments. We 
have been well positioned during the recent upturn in the 
market,  
with the strong performance of zinc and aluminium in the 
commodities market playing to our particular strengths. The 
Company continued to remain focused on free cash, after 
project capital expenditure, from across its businesses by 
reinforcing discipline in working capital management, and 
operational and capital cost controls. 
 ❯ Strategic Parameters: 
In addition to the financial performance the group also 
achieved significant strategic milestones during the financial 
year 2016-17 that will fuel the next level of stability and agility 
to catapult growth. To further enhance our effectiveness on 
Regulatory framework and create value to the organization, 
Board and the key executives led various key initiatives and 
achieved significant success and progress in following areas: 
Improvement in Group Balance Sheet; Simplification of 
Group Structure, PSC Extension, Ramping up of Assets etc.
 ❯ Sustainability and Safety Scorecard:
The philosophy of a sustainable development agenda is at  
the core of Vedanta’s strategic priorities and governs every 
business decision. Employee safety and achieving zero  
harm remained our number one priority and we have made 
significant progress on all our safety measures during the  
year, but deeply regret the seven fatalities at our operations.  
So despite significantly improved performance in all metrics, 
fatality prevention remains the centre point of our focus. We 
continue to maintain our good track record in managing 
health and environment performance and focus on reducing 
our environmental footprint and improving our resource 
efficiency. There were no significant environmental incidents 
or health related observations during FY2016-17 .
Business performance for the year was evaluated against the 
measures and targets set and resulted in a bonus of 42.68%  
of the maximum for the Executive Chairman, Executive Vice 
Chairman and Group CEO (details are provided in the relevant 
part of the Annual Report on Remuneration)
During the year, the Remuneration committee took up 
various matters pertaining to the Remuneration of the 
Directors of the company which included determining the 
Remuneration for the year 2016-17 , approving the Annual 
Bonus to be paid to the executives and the Long Term 
Incentive design and grant of Options. The Committee also 
deliberated and finalized the new Remuneration policy which 
will be put to vote to the shareholders.
We hope that we will receive your support on the new 
remuneration policy and approval of the annual remuneration 
report at the forthcoming AGM.
Y ours sincerely,
Geoffrey Green
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 136
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
The Company’s Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM and if approved will take 
effect immediately. 
POLICY OVERVIEW
The key objective of the Group’s broad remuneration policy is 
to ensure that competitive and fair awards are linked to key 
deliverables and are also aligned with market practice and 
shareholders’ expectations.
The Committee ensures that remuneration policies and 
practices are designed to attract, retain and motivate the 
Executive Directors and the senior management group, while 
focusing on the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business 
objectives. The Committee is also focused on aligning  
the interests of the Executive Directors and the senior 
management group with those of shareholders, to build a 
sustainable performance culture.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account the business performance, 
developments in the natural resources sector and, considering 
that the majority of the Group’s operations are based in India, 
similar information for high-performing Indian companies.
The Committee has set remuneration taking into consideration 
both UK and Indian market practice to ensure it is globally 
competitive as the Executive Directors are based in India (with 
the exception of Mr Anil Agarwal, who is UK-based), along with 
the majority of the Group’s professional management team. 
The Committee also considers the inflation rates prevalent in 
UK and India in the setting of remuneration.
The Committee recognises that the financial performance  
of the Company is heavily influenced by macro-economic 
considerations such as commodity prices and exchange  
rate movements. These factors are therefore taken into 
consideration when setting executive remuneration.
HOW THE VIEWS OF SHAREHOLDERS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
The Committee considers the AGM to be an opportunity  
to meet and communicate with investors and considers 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year 
and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more 
generally. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received 
during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as 
part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy.  
In addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with 
major shareholders and their representative bodies should  
any material changes be proposed to the remuneration policy. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve 
last year’s remuneration report and any matters discussed with 
shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
HOW THE VIEWS OF EMPLOYEES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
In setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration,  
the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions 
across the Group, including annual base compensation 
increases across the general employee population and the 
overall spend on annual bonuses. Employees may be eligible  
to participate in the annual bonus arrangement and receive 
awards under the ESOP or LTIP . Opportunities and performance 
metrics may vary by employee level with specific business 
metrics incorporated where possible. 
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in 
respect of the design of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 137

SUMMARY OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR DIRECTORS
The following table sets out the key aspects of the remuneration policy for Directors:
Element of pay Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base compensation
1
Reflects individual’s 
experience and role within 
the Group.
Reward for performance of 
everyday activities.
The Committee reviews 
base compensation 
annually, taking account of 
the scale of responsibilities, 
the individual’s experience 
and performance.
Changes are implemented 
with effect from 1 April 
each year.
Base compensation is paid 
in cash on a monthly basis.
Base compensation is 
typically set with reference 
to a peer group of UK-listed 
mining comparator 
companies. Comparisons 
are also made against 
positions of comparable 
status, skill and 
responsibility in the metals 
and mining industries 
globally, and in the 
manufacturing and 
engineering industries 
more generally.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase. 
Base compensation 
increases are applied in line 
with the annual review and 
are competitive within the 
UK and Indian market and 
internationally for 
comparable companies.  
The Committee is also 
guided by the general 
increase for the employee 
population but on 
occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role and/or 
change in responsibility.
Business and individual 
performance are 
considered when setting 
base compensation.
T axable benefits To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Benefits vary by role and 
are reviewed periodically.

to 20% of base 
compensation.
n/a
Annual bonus Incentivises executives to 
achieve specific, 
predetermined goals during

financial and non-financial 
metrics.
Not pensionable.
Clawback provisions apply 
for overpayments due to 
misstatement or error and 
other circumstances.
Up to 150% of base 
compensation per annum.
The bonus is measured 
against a balanced 
scorecard of performance 
metrics. At least 50% of 
the bonus potential will be 
based on financial 
performance and the 
remainder of the bonus 
potential will be based on 
operational, strategic and 
sustainability measures.
The Committee has the 
ability to adjust the bonus 
outturn if it believes that 
the outturn is not reflective 
of the Group’s underlying 
performance or warranted 
based on the Health, Safety 
and Environment (‘HSE’) 
record.  138

award will be linked to 
relative total shareholder 
return (TSR).

performance (for the TSR 
element this is median 
performance), increasing 
pro-rata to full vesting for 
the achievement of stretch 
performance targets.

ability to adjust the PSP 
outturn if it believes that 
the outturn is not reflective 
of the Group’s underlying 
performance or warranted 
based on the HSE record. 
Share ownership

To increase alignment 
between executives and 
shareholders.
Executive Directors are 
required to retain any 
vested shares (net of tax) 
under the Group’s share

and market practice for 
similar roles in international 
mining groups.
As for the Executive 
Directors, there is no 
prescribed maximum 
annual increase. The 
Committee is guided by the 
general increase for the 
employee population but 
on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role and/or 
change in responsibility.
Additional fees may be paid 
if there is a material 
increase in time 
commitment and the Board 
wishes to recognise this 
additional workload.
Business and individual 
performance are 
considered when setting 
fees.
Base compensation includes base salary plus fixed cash allowances and statutory benefits, which are a normal part of the fixed remuneration package for employees in India. 139

of INR 87 .7138 : £1).
2 The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as 
disclosed) for the year ending 31 March 2017 .
3 The value of pension receivable by the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer in 2017/18 is taken to be 15% and 20% of base compensation respectively.
4 The on-target level of bonus assumed to be two-thirds of the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity.
5 The on-target level of the PSP assumed to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant.
6  Share price movement and dividend accrual have not been incorporated into the values 
shown above.
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS
The annual bonus is based against a balanced scorecard of 
financial, operational, sustainability and strategic metrics. The 
mix of targets will be reviewed each year by the Committee to 
ensure that they remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for 
the Group in the year ahead. A sliding scale of targets is set to 
encourage continuous improvement and challenge the delivery 
of stretch performance.
The PSP is measured against financial and strategic metrics. 
The sole metric for the 2017 PSP is relative TSR performance, 
which provides an external assessment of the Company’s 
performance against the market. It also aligns the rewards 
received by executives with the returns received by 
shareholders. A sliding scale of challenging performance 
targets is set. The Committee will review the choice of 
performance measures and the appropriateness of the 
performance targets prior to each PSP grant. The Committee 
reserves the discretion to set different targets for future 
awards, providing that, in the opinion of the Committee,  
the new targets are no less challenging in light of the 
circumstances at the time than those used previously. The 
targets for awards granted under this remuneration policy are 
set out for shareholder approval in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
REMUNERATION SCENARIOS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The charts below illustrate how the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages vary at different levels of performance under the 
policy, which if approved will take effect immediately.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTIONS
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director – i.e. 
base compensation, taxable benefits, pension, annual bonus 
and long-term incentive awards – would be set in accordance 
with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved 
remuneration policy at the time of appointment and would 
reflect the experience of the individual. 
The base compensation for a new executive may be set below 
the normal market rate, with phased increases over the first 
few years, as the executive gains experience in their new role. 
Annual bonus potential will be limited to 150% of base 
compensation and long-term incentives will be limited to 150% 
of base compensation per annum. 
In addition the Committee may offer additional share-based 
elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of 
the Company (and therefore shareholders) to take account of 
remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer 
and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance 
requirements attached to that remuneration. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into 
account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for 
approval at the earliest opportunity. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses 
and continuing allowances as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with 
the approved remuneration policy at that time.
SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee reviews the contractual terms for new 
Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Mr Anil Agarwal is employed under a contract of employment 
with the Company for a rolling term but which may be 
terminated by not less than six months’ notice. Provision is 
made in Mr Anil Agarwal’s contract for payment to be made in 
lieu of notice on termination which is equal to base 
compensation.
Mr Navin Agarwal has a letter of appointment with the 
Company which is a rolling contract and may be terminated by 
giving six months’ notice. Mr Navin Agarwal has a service  140
Vedanta Resources plc  |  Annual Report FY2017
agreement with Vedanta Limited which expires on 31 July 
2018, with a notice period of three months or base 
compensation in lieu thereof.
Mr Tom Albanese had a separate letter of appointment with  
the Company and Vedanta Limited on a fixed Three Y ear Term 
which expired on 31 March, 2017 . The service contracts of  
the executive with both the entities were extended for a five 
month term which expires on 31 August, 2017 , but which may 
be terminated by not less than one month’s notice. Provision is 
made in Mr Tom Albanese’s contract for payment to be made  
in lieu of notice on termination which is equal to one month’s 
base compensation and benefits.
It is the Group’s policy that the notice period in the Directors’ 
service contracts does not exceed 12 months.
Copies of all Executive Directors’ service contracts and the 
letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection during normal business hours at the 
registered office of the Company, and available for inspection  
at the AGM.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
The executive directors’ service contracts provide for pay in lieu 
of notice in respect of base compensation, as set out above.
The annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of 
the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time 
and paid at the normal payout date. Any share-based 
entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the 
Company’s share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. 
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, 
retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. For good 
leavers, awards will normally vest on the original vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
proportion of the performance period actually served. However, 
the Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at 
an earlier date and/or to dis-apply time pro-rating, although it is 
envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. Any such incidents, where discretion is applied 
by the Committee, will be disclosed in the next year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
The default treatment for deferred annual bonus awards is that 
any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (as described 
under the PSP above) awards will normally vest in full on the 
original vesting date.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a 
good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the reasons for their 
departure.
In the event of a change of control all unvested awards under 
the deferred annual bonus and long-term incentive 
arrangements would vest, to the extent that any performance 
conditions attached to the relevant awards have been achieved. 
The award will, be pro-rated for the period of the financial year 
served. 
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which 
may be terminated by either party by giving three months’ 
notice. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment  
set out the time requirements expected of them in the 
performance of their duties. Non-Executive Directors are 
normally expected to spend at least 20 days per year in the 
performance of their duties for the Company. There is no 
provision in the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors for compensation to be paid in the event of early 
termination. 
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current or 
former Directors (such as the vesting of past share awards) that 
have been disclosed to and approved by shareholders in this 
and previous Remuneration Reports. Details of any payments 
to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.

ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
The Committee retained New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a  
trading name of Aon plc, to provide independent advice on 
remuneration matters. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, which requires its 
advice to be objective and impartial. NBS does not provide  
any other services to the Company. Other pay information for 
employees below Board level is provided to the Company  
by Aon in India. The Committee considers that this enables  
a global perspective to be achieved. Where relevant, NBS 
reviews the work of Aon India to ensure that the advice is 
appropriate for a UK plc context and internally consistent. The 
Committee has reviewed the operating processes in place at 
NBS and is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and 
independent. The Committee considers various external reports 
from NBS on remuneration in the UK as well as India to provide 
detailed insights that aid remuneration decisions. The fees paid 
to NBS in respect of work carried out in 2016/17 were £46,220. 
In addition, advisers to the Committee during the year and their 
roles are set out below.
 ❯ Mr Suresh Bose (Head of Group HR) and Manoj Kumar 
Sharma (Group Head of Total Rewards) advise the 
Committee on general remuneration policies and practices 
followed in India and the global market, Executive Directors’ 
remuneration and benefits and remuneration policy 
applicable to the wider employee population within the 
Group.
 ❯ The Executive Directors provide input on remuneration 
packages for the senior management group to ensure parity 
amongst senior management in different businesses but at 
similar roles. Executive Directors may attend meetings at 
the invitation of the Committee but no Director is present 
during discussions of their own remuneration.
 ❯ New Bridge Street reviewed and confirmed the Company’s 
TSR performance in respect of the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan.

1 For Financial Performance, a weighted achievement of both the elements is considered for assessing the Threshold and for arriving at the pay-out - 70% achievement of Business Plan targets 
is considered as Threshold which entails 33.33% of the pay-out opportunity with 70% pay-out for 100% achievement and stretching to 100% of pay-out opportunity at 120% achievement of 
the Targets. For other elements, payout is prorated with respect to performance levels increasing to full payment at stretch performance.
2 The Sustainability as well as Safety Performance Score is the Group Average Score calculated based on the Scorecard which includes resource use and management, stakeholder engagement 
and management, compliance and training, incident investigation and change management. The impact of Fatality has also been incorporated which has impacted the Annual Bonus Pay-out for 
the Executive Directors.
For determining the bonus, the business performance for the year has been evaluated in terms of the metrics approved for the year 
2016-17 . Following evaluation against the set metrics, the achievement of targets is 42.68% of the maximum, and subsequently a 
bonus of 64.02% of salary is proposed for the Executive Chairman, Executive Vice Chairman and Group CEO. The bonus payment in 
relation to performance in the 2016/17 financial year will be payable 50% in cash and 50% in shares under Deferred Share Bonus Plan

REMUNERATION DECISIONS TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2018
BASE COMPENSATION
In setting base compensation for 2017/18, the Committee considered external market data and the increase in base compensation 
for the senior management group and the workforce generally, where the average increase across the Group will be 9.5%. 
However this increase is very much confined to middle and junior management employees. The pay increase for other senior 
executives will be in the lower quartile. Similarly, this increase will not apply to the Executive Directors and accordingly base 
compensation will be as follows: 
Base 
compensation 
from 1 April 2016 
£000
Base 
compensation 
from 1 April 2017 
£000 % increase 
Anil Agarwal 1,608 1,608 Nil
Navin Agarwal
1
969 1081 Nil
Tom Albanese 1,000 1,000 Nil
1 There has been no increase in the base compensation of Mr Navin Agarwal and the change in compensation reflected in the table is purely on account of movement in currency exchange 
(GBP vs INR) during the year FY2016-17 . Furthermore, he is based out of India and is drawing the majority of his remuneration in INR.
ANNUAL BONUS AWARDS TO BE GRANTED IN 2017/18
The annual bonus opportunity will be 150% of base compensation for Messrs Anil Agarwal, Navin Agarwal and Tom Albanese. The 
annual bonus will be based on the following metrics. 
 Factor Parameter Weightage
Financial Performance (Against Target)
1
EBITDA 30%
Free cash Flow 30%
Sustainability Scorecard 7.5%
Personal Objectives
Safety Scorecard including Fatality
2
12.5%
Strategic Objectives 20%
1  For Financial Performance, a weighted achievement of both the elements is considered for assessing the Threshold and for arriving at the pay-out - 70% achievement of Business Plan targets 
for Remuneration is considered as Threshold which entails 33.33% of the pay-out opportunity with 70% pay-out for 100% achievement and stretching to 100% of pay-out opportunity at 120% 
achievement of the Targets. For other elements, pay-out is prorated with respect to performance levels increasing to full payment at stretch performance.
2 At Vedanta safety is led from the top. While the Group has shown a significant reduction in fatal incidents over the last 5 years, the Board of Directors has decided to lead by example and link 
10% of incentive pay to the elimination of fatalities. We have chosen to do this by progressive reduction in fatalities to zero by FY19. We are linking a further 2.5% of incentive pay to the 
implementation of the safety performance standard designed to prevent fatalities as audited annually by our Management Assurance team. Through this process we will encourage all the 
leaders in Vedanta and subsidiaries to follow and establish a positive safety culture across the Group.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items 
which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them 
will be seen in next year’s Annual Remuneration on Report. 147

The Strategic Report and other sections of this Annual Report 
contain forward looking statements. By their nature, forward 
looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because 
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or 
may not occur in the future and may be beyond the Company’s 
ability to control or predict. Forward looking statements and 
past performance are therefore not guarantees of future 
performance. The information contained in the Strategic Report 
has been prepared on the basis of information and knowledge 
available to the Directors at the date of preparation and the 
Company does not undertake to update or revise the content 
during the year ahead.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
A review of the business and future developments of the 
Group is presented in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 103. 
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS REPORTING
Climate change is a growing concern globally, and recent 
record temperature trends will likely accelerate this concern. 
We acknowledge the global concern on climate change and 
recognize that concentrated and sustained global actions are 
required to reduce the scale of the problem and to adapt to its 
impacts. We feel this will require multiple solutions, including 
using innovative technology to improve energy efficiency and 
find more carbon neutral solutions. It is vitally important that 
every country is provided with the right incentives for the 
development and communication of climate-friendly processes 
and practices. 
At Vedanta we are working towards implementing our Energy 
and Carbon Management plans to reduce our GHG emissions. 
Our energy and carbon management approach hinges on a 
two-pronged strategy; improving energy and process efficiency, 
while diversifying our energy portfolio to include renewable 
energy to the extent possible. We are committed to the cause 
of tackling climate change and have constituted the Chief 
Operating Officers (COOs’) forum to advise and facilitate the 
implementation of the Group’s climate change program. 
In addition to optimising our consumption, we are also looking 
at diversifying our energy portfolio. Mindful of the long-term 
impact of traditional grid-energy, we are evaluating renewable 
energies like solar and wind. This year, the HZL business 
installed 16 MW of Solar power plant.
We calculate and report Greenhouse gas inventory i.e. Scope 1 
(process emissions and other direct emissions) and Scope 2 
(purchased electricity) as defined under the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and World 
Resource Institute (WRI) GHG protocols. The increase in GHG 
emissions during the year was due to the ramp up in our 
aluminium and power businesses. The relative increase in 
GHG emissions in the power sector was higher compared to 
revenue generated resulting in overall higher GHG intensity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT
POWERS OF THE DIRECTORS
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and the 
Company’s Articles and to any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company is to be managed by 
the Board which may exercise all the powers of the Company.
DIRECTORS’ EMOLUMENTS
Details of the Directors’ emoluments and any waiver are included 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 142–144.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES 
Details of the long-term incentive schemes operated by the 
Company namely the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) are included in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 143–144.
DIVIDEND WAIVER
As noted in the Remuneration Committee Report contained 
in pages 135 to 147 of this document, the Company operates 
a DSBP under which bonus payments to the Executive 
Chairman, Executive Vice Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
Officer are payable partly in cash and partly in deferred share 
awards which vest over a staggered period of two or three 
years subject to service conditions being met. Pending vesting, 
Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited (SFSL) holds any shares 
that are the subject of awards under the DSBP as nominee on 
behalf of the relevant executives. SFSL, on behalf of the 
relevant executives, has waived the right to receive dividends 
on these shares as well as any voting rights attaching to 
these shares pending vesting of these awards in accordance 
with the rules of the DSBP . As at 31 March 2017 , there were 
163,250 shares in respect of the DSBP and 254,195 shares in 
respect of Forfeitable Share Awards granted under the DSBP 
to Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal. Other than the waiver of 
dividends by SFSL as described above, there have been no 
arrangements under which a shareholder has waived or agreed 
to waive dividends or future dividends during the year ended 
31 March 2017 .
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES
The Company purchases and maintains liability insurance for 
its Directors and Officers and those of the subsidiaries of the 
Group, as permitted by the Act. The insurance policy does 
not provide cover where the Director has acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. The Company believes that it is appropriate to 
provide such cover to protect Directors from innocent error as 
the Directors carry significant liability under criminal and civil 
law and under the UK Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, and face a range of penalties.
In addition, the Company’s Articles contain an indemnity 
provision in favour of the Directors against proceedings brought 
by third parties, subject to the Act, to allow the Company to 
pay legal defence costs for the Director where the Director 
is exonerated.
EMPLOYEES
Information on the Group’s employees and its policies with 
respect to employees can be found in the Sustainability Report 
section of the Strategic Report on page 61 . In summary, the 
Group’s commitment to communication and dialogue with 
employees continues. The existence of a Group-wide intranet 
enables engagement and communication with employees 
throughout the Group. It also helps management to share 
information, ideas and opportunities quickly and to achieve a 
common awareness on the part of all employees of the 
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the 
Company. Employees have opportunities to voice their opinions 
and ask questions through the Group intranet and engage in 
question and answer sessions with the Executive Chairman. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS
It is the Board’s policy that neither Vedanta nor any of 
its subsidiary companies outside India may, under any 
circumstances, make donations or contributions to political 
organisations. Subsidiaries in India may make political 
donations or contributions as this is customary in India and 
permitted under local legislation. In exceptional circumstances, 
if political donations or contributions are deemed necessary 
in the United Kingdom and European Union for legitimate 
business reasons, they will not be made without the approval 
of the Board and shareholders at a general meeting. Any 
political donations made in India will be disclosed in the 
Company’s Annual Report and Accounts. The Company and 
its subsidiaries did not make any political donations during 
the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: Nil).
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s business units carry out research and 
development activities necessary to further their operations.

ISSUE OF SHARES
The powers of the Company’s Directors are subject to relevant 
legislation and, in certain circumstances (including in relation 
to the issue or buying back by the Company of its shares), 
are subject to authority being given to the Directors by 
shareholders in general meeting. At the Company’s 2017 
Annual General Meeting, shareholders will be asked to renew 
the Directors’ authority to allot new securities. Details are 
contained in the 2017 Notice of Annual General Meeting 
(Notice of AGM).
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company has authority

AGREEMENTS: CHANGE OF CONTROL
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, and capital 
market borrowing. The following are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of 
the Group as a whole:
1 The US$1,200 million 6% bonds due in 2019 (of which 
approximately US$775 million is outstanding, US$900 
million 8.25% bonds due in 2021, US$1000 million 6.375% 
bonds due in 2022 and US$500 million 7 .125% bonds due 
in 2023 where a change of control together with a rating 
decline requires the Company to make an offer to purchase 
all of the outstanding bonds at 101% of the principal amount 
together with any accrued and unpaid interest.
2 Under various other financing facilities entered into by the 
Group where a change of control gives the majority lenders 
the right to declare the loans immediately payable.
All of the Company’s employee share incentive plans contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards 
and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a 
change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions and pro-rata reduction as may be applicable under 
the rules of the employee share incentive plans.
There are no agreements between the Company and any of its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss 
of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

sheet date. Further analysis of net debt is set out in Note 26 of

changes in trading performance on cash flows and forecast 
covenant compliance; the transferability of cash within the 
Group; the flexibility that the Group has over the timings of its 
capital expenditure; and other uncertainties. For these reasons, 
the Group continues to adopt the ‘going concern’ basis in 
preparing its financial statements.
LONGER TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph C2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” . Under company 
law, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 ❯ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 ❯ make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 ❯ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 ❯ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 ❯ properly select and apply accounting policies;
 ❯ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 ❯ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 ❯ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
parent company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that comply with that law and those 
regulations. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 
Each of the Directors confirms that to the best of his/her 
knowledge:
 ❯ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 ❯ the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
 ❯ the annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
The following areas were highlighted as audit focus areas for the year ended 31 March 2017 audit: 
 
Materiality
 › Overall Group materiality of $64m which represents 
approximately 2% of EBITDA.
 › EBITDA represents a less volatile metric than profit before 
tax for determining materiality and we consider this to be the 
most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of 
the entity.
Audit scope
 › We performed an audit of the complete financial information 
of 14 components and audit procedures on specific balances 
for a further 4 components.
 › The components where we performed full or specific audit 
procedures accounted for 100% of EBITDA, 99% of revenue 
and 90% of total assets.
 › For the remaining 40 components in the Group we have 
performed limited procedures appropriate to respond to  
the risk of material misstatement.
 › We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level 
controls of the Group which assists us in identifying and 
assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or 
error, as well as assisting us in determining the most 
appropriate audit strategy.
What has 
changed
 › This is our first year of auditing Vedanta Resources plc.  
Our scope is broadly consistent with that adopted by the 
previous auditor. The main change was the removal of  
the Lisheen mine following its operational closure in 
November 2015.
 › Accounting for assets under construction was considered  
a new focus area for our audit. This was due to the ageing  
of certain assets under construction as at 31 March 2017  
and a number of projects entering commercial production  
in the year.  157

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
OUR ASSESSMENT OF FOCUS AREAS
We identified the risk areas to be included with our audit 
opinion based on issues that had the greatest impact on the 
financial statements and which involved the most of senior 
team member involvement. Further details of why we 
identified issues as areas of focus and our audit response are 
set out in the table below. This is not a complete list of all the 
procedures we performed in respect of these areas nor is it a 
complete list of all the risks identified in our audit. 
We identified the risk and focus areas described below as 
those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the 
efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have 
performed the procedures below which were designed in  
the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these 
individual areas.
CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR
As this is our first year as external auditors of the Group, the starting point for our audit focus areas were the same as those 
identified by Deloitte for the year ended 31 March 2016. The audit focus areas have since been amended following our experience 
gained from the understanding of developments in the business, and time spent during the year end audit.
Audit focus area Our audit approach What we reported to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition and receivable recoverability 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on pages 123 to 128 and the disclosures in notes 2b and 4 of the Group financial statements 
on pages 185 to 189 and 192.
Group revenue: $11,520m (2016: 
$10,738m)
Revenue recognition and receivable 
recoverability has been identified as an 
audit focus area due to the diverse and 
complex revenue streams across the 
Group. 
We have identified the following key 
areas for consideration:
 › complex calculation of power tariff 
agreements and associated disputed 
receivables outstanding with Grid 
Corporation of Odisha Limited 
(“GRIDCO”) and Punjab State Power 
Corporation Limited (“PSPCL ”).
 › calculation of revenue due to 
complexity associated with the 
calculation of profit petroleum at the 
Cairn India oil and gas joint ventures. 
 › determination of when risks and 
rewards have transferred, especially  
in relation to determining to which 
accounting period sales relate.
 › correct accounting treatment of 
differing shipping terms across  
the Group. 
 › measurement of revenue due to 
provisional pricing agreements where 
prices are only finalised after the 
balance sheet date.
The risk has increased in the current year  
due to increased disputed receivable  
balances across the Group, particularly in  
the power division. 
We performed our audit procedures 
across the Group’s revenue streams 
considering the revenue recognition 
policies and receivable recoverability.  
Our procedures were performed mainly 
by the component teams under the 
direction and supervision of the UK  
Group engagement team.
To address this focus area we have:
 › performed walkthroughs of the 
revenue recognition processes at each 
full scope component and assessed 
the design effectiveness of key 
controls.
 › assessed the recoverability of the 
GRIDCO and PSPCL trade receivables by:
 – inspecting the state regulatory 
commission and appellate tribunal 
rulings.
 – examining the underlying power 
purchase agreements. 
 – Inspecting external legal opinions in 
respect of the merits of the cases. 
 › reviewed the terms of Cairn’ s profit 
sharing agreements and tested the 
underlying cost recovery and profit 
petroleum calculations. This included 
challenging the aging profile of current 
unapproved cost receivables to test 
recoverability.
 › selected a sample of sales across the 
Group made pre and post year end, 
agreeing the date of revenue 
recognition to third party support, such 
as bills of lading, to confirm sales are 
recognised in the correct period. 
 › examined invoice samples with complex 
shipping terms to ensure that revenue 
has been recognised appropriately.
 › re-calculated the value of provisional 
pricing adjustments and validated the 
prices used to third party data.
Based on the procedures performed we 
consider revenue recognition and the 
recoverability of receivables to be fairly 
stated in the financial statements. 158
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
Audit focus area Our audit approach What we reported to the Audit Committee
Accounting for assets under construction 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on pages 123 to 128 and the disclosures in note 17 of the Group financial statements  
on page 201
Group Assets under construction: 
$2,366m (2016: $3,363m)
Accounting for assets under construction 
has been identified as an audit focus 
area due to:
 › the significant judgment involved in 
assessing when an asset is available 
for use as intended by management. 
At this point, revenue and operating 
costs associated to the asset cease to 
be capitalised to the statement of 
financial position and depreciation 
should commence. 
 › Multiple construction projects across 
the Group that have been placed on 
hold. There is therefore a risk relating to 
the viability of these projects and thus 
the recoverability of the balance.
Additionally we considered recent 
impairment charges recognised in 
respect of assets under construction 
where licences have expired or projects 
have ceased.
The risk has increased in the current year 
due to some significant projects being 
commissioned in the current year as well 
as the increased ageing of projects on 
hold and awaiting approval.
We performed our audit procedures 
across the asset under construction 
balances across the Group. Due to the 
local considerations impacting our 
assessments our procedures were 
performed predominantly by the 
component teams under the direction 
and supervision of the UK Group 
engagement team.
To address this focus area we have:
 › considered the stage of completion of 
ongoing projects specifically in relation 
to ascertaining when the assets will  
be available for use as intended by 
management.
 › assessed project timelines by tracking 
project progress against forecast  
spend and management budgets.
 › assessed the accounting treatment  
of testing revenue and associated 
costs during the testing phase  
where applicable.
 › ensured costs associated to assets 
which came into production in the  
year cease to be capitalised and 
depreciation charges commenced.
 › assessed the viability and recoverability 
of long outstanding projects and 
performed inspections to confirm that 
the machinery and material related to 
these projects is not obsolete.
Based on our evaluation of the asset 
under construction projects and other 
procedures performed, we are 
comfortable that projects completed in 
the current year have been treated in 
accordance with IAS 16 and that long 
outstanding balances are recoverable.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Audit focus area Our audit approach What we reported to the Audit Committee
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risk 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on pages 123 to 128 and the disclosures in note 38 of the Group financial statements on 
pages 231 to 234
The Group has disclosed in note 38 
contingent liabilities of $1,361m for 
litigation, environmental and regulatory 
matters excluding income tax figures.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory 
risk has been identified as an area of 
audit focus due to the large number  
of complex legal claims across the  
Group and impact to the Group’s 
operations of potential non-compliance 
with environmental and regulatory 
requirements. 
There is significant judgment required  
by management in classifying each case 
as probable, possible or remote as per 
IAS 37 and thus a risk that such cases 
may not be adequately provided for  
or disclosed. 
It is not unusual in the jurisdictions in 
which the company operates for claims 
to remain outstanding for a number of 
years, with the complex regulatory 
environment and regulators focusing on 
the environmental and social impacts of 
the operations. 
Any adverse litigation may have a 
material impact on both the solvency  
and liquidity as well as the reputation  
of the Group.
The risk has not increased or decreased 
in the current year.
At both a component team and group 
level, we have understood and tested 
management’s process for identifying  
and assessing litigation, environmental 
and regulatory risk. 
To address this focus area we have:
 › obtained the Group legal summary  
and critically assessed management’ s 
position through discussions with the 
head of legal and operational 
management, on both the probability 
of success in significant cases, and the 
magnitude of any potential loss. 
 › inspected external legal opinions 
(where considered necessary) and 
other evidence to corroborate 
management’ s assessment of the  
risk profile in respect of legal claims. 
 › considered the terms and conditions  
of applicable licences, environmental 
exposures and regulatory requirements 
and performed procedures to gain 
assurance over compliance with  
these terms.
 › assessed the appropriateness of legal 
provisions and disclosures included in 
the Group financial statements and 
thus ensured adequate disclosure in 
accordance with IAS 37 .
We are satisfied the accounting treatment 
in respect of legal cases is appropriate 
based on our procedures performed. 160
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
Audit focus area Our audit approach What we reported to the Audit Committee
T axation claims and exposures 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on pages 123 to 128 and the disclosures in note 38 of the Group financial statements  
on pages 231 to 234
The Group has disclosed contingent 
liabilities of $4,352m for income tax 
claims and exposures.
Taxation claims and exposures have 
been identified as an audit focus area 
due to the large number of tax claims 
across the Group, particularly in relation 
to the operations located in India. 
There is significant judgment required by 
management in assessing the exposure 
of each tax case and thus a risk that such 
cases may not be adequately provided 
for or disclosed.
Recent material tax cases have included: 
 › In the current year, the Supreme Court 
in India upheld the constitutional 
validity for each state to levy an entry 
tax. The Groups potential exposure in 
respect of this matter is $165 million.
 › In 2015 a demand was received by 
Cairn India Limited (CIL) ordering 
payment to the T ax Authority of 
withholding taxes not paid on the 
acquisition of Cairn India.
Management judgment is also required 
in assessing the recoverability of the 
Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) asset, 
which is based on forecasted future 
profits. 
We focused on this area because of the 
potential financial impact on the 
Consolidated financial statements and 
the judgements involved. We consider 
the risk to have remained high in the 
current year.
Our procedures were performed centrally 
where tax cases impacted a number of 
components. For location specific issues 
component teams undertook the majority 
of the procedures under the direction and 
supervision of the Group audit team.
To address this focus area we have:
 › obtained the Group tax summary  
and challenged management through 
discussions with the head of tax and 
operational management, on both the 
probability of success in significant 
cases, and the magnitude of any 
potential loss. 
 › inspected external legal opinions and 
correspondence with tax authorities 
(where applicable) to corroborate 
management’ s risk classification. 
 › engaged internal tax specialists to 
technically appraise the tax positions 
taken by management with respect  
to local tax issues.
 › reviewed and challenged the 
assumptions used in the model  
by management in justifying the 
recoverability of deferred tax and  
MAT assets. In challenging these 
assumptions we took account of  
actual results, external data and  
market conditions.
 › ensured that the management 
assessment of similar cases is aligned 
across the Group or that differences in 
positions are adequately justified. 
 › assessed the appropriateness of tax 
provisions and disclosures made in the 
Group financial statements in respect 
of tax claims and exposures. 
We are satisfied the accounting treatment 
in respect of potential tax exposures is 
appropriate based on our procedures 
performed.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC CONTINUED 161
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Audit focus area Our audit approach What we reported to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of property, plant and equipment and E&E assets 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on pages 123 to 128 and the disclosures in notes 2b and 17 of the Group financial 
statements on pages 185 to 189 and 201
Group property, plant and equipment: 
$16,806m (2016: $16,648m) including, 
Group E&E assets: $1,400m (2016: 
$1,471m)
Recoverability of fixed and Exploration 
and evaluation (E&E) assets has been 
identified  
as an audit focus area due to the 
significance of the carrying value of the 
assets being assessed, the number and 
size of recent impairments, the current 
economic environment in the Group’s 
operating jurisdictions and because the 
assessment of the recoverable amount 
of the Group’s Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”) involves significant 
judgements about the future results of 
the business and the discount rates 
applied to future cash flow forecasts.
In particular we focused our effort on 
those CGU’s with impairment indicators. 
The key judgment centred on forecast 
volumes. No impairment charges were 
recorded in the year. 
We also focused our effort on the 
Rajasthan and Ravva blocks at Cairn India 
for which an impairment reversal, net of 
the impact of an adjustment in the 
decommissioning liability relating to a 
prior year and associated impact on the 
asset (note 30), has been recognised in 
the year. The key judgments relate to the 
forecast long term Brent crude price and 
the weighted average cost of capital. A 
net $13m impairment reversal was 
recorded in relation to the Rajasthan 
block. 
The overall Group impairment risk has 
decreased in the current year due to 
improved zinc, oil and aluminium prices. 
In addressing this area of focus audit 
procedures were performed by both  
our Group and Component teams. 
Macroeconomic assumptions and 
consistency of approach was ensured by 
the Group team with location specific 
inputs addressed by component teams.
To address this focus area we have:
 › critically assessed, whether there were 
any indicators of impairment (or 
reversal of impairment) in line with IAS 
36 for fixed assets and IFRS 6 for E&E 
assets across the Group.
 › specifically in relation to the CGUs 
where impairment and impairment 
reversal indicators were assessed, we 
have obtained and evaluated the 
valuation models used to determine 
the recoverable amount by challenging 
the key assumptions used by 
management including:
 – considering forecasted volumes in 
relation to asset development 
plans. 
 – critically assessing management’s 
forecasting accuracy by comparing 
prior year forecasts to actual results. 
 – corroborating the price assumptions 
used in the models against the 
analyst consensus.
 – testing the appropriateness of the 
weighted average cost of capital 
used to discount the impairment 
models through engaging our 
internal valuations experts.
 – testing the integrity of the models 
together with their clerical accuracy. 
Overall we are comfortable that the key 
assumptions used in the Cairn India 
impairment reversal models fall within a 
reasonable range and that there are no 
impairments at other CGUs in the Group. 
Management have also reflected known 
changes in the circumstances of the 
CGUs in their forecast for forthcoming 
periods.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
The scope of our work is influenced by materiality. We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in 
evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
As we develop our audit strategy, we determine materiality at the overall level and at the individual account level (referred to as our 
‘performance materiality’).
REPORTING THRESHOLD
$0.8 MILLION
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
$32 MILLION
MATERIALITY $64 MILLION 162
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, 
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of the users of the 
financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for 
determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $64 million 
(Deloitte 2016: $40 million), which is 2% of EBITDA. The higher 
materiality threshold was due to an increase in Group EBITDA 
to $3,191m (2016: $2,336m) driven by higher commodity prices 
and increased volumes in certain components compared 
to the prior year. Our materiality amount provides a basis 
for determining the nature and extent of risk assessment 
procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature and extent of further 
audit procedures. Materiality is assessed on both quantitative 
and qualitative grounds. With respect to disclosure and 
presentational matters, amounts in excess of the quantitative 
thresholds above may not be adjusted if their effect is not 
considered to be material on a qualitative basis. 
RATIONALE FOR BASIS
We have used an earnings based measure as our basis 
of materiality. It was considered inappropriate to calculate 
materiality using Group profit or loss before tax due to the 
historic volatility of this metric. EBITDA is a key performance 
indicator for the Group and is also a key metric used by the 
Group in the assessment of the performance of management. 
We also noted that market and analyst commentary on the 
performance of the Group uses EBITDA as a key metric. 
We therefore, considered EBITDA, to be the most appropriate 
performance metric on which to base our materiality calculation 
as we considered that to be the most relevant performance 
measure to the stakeholders of the entity.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the individual account 
or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate 
of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds 
materiality.
We set our performance materiality at 50% of planning 
materiality calculated as $32 million. This was based upon 
our overall risk analysis, our assessment of the Group’s 
control environment, the short reporting cycle, potential for 
misstatements and the fact this is a first year audit engagement. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance 
materiality. The performance materiality set for each 
component is based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of 
the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current 
year, the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was $5 million to $19 million. 
REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.8 million 
(Deloitte 2016 $0.8 million) in line with the prior year threshold 
as requested by the Audit Committee. In addition, we have 
reported any difference below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our 
opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this 
enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the 
organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial 
statements, we focused our Group audit scope on 18 out of 
the 58 Group components. Of these selected components 14 
were subject to a full audit, in India, Namibia, Zambia, South 
Africa and the UAE. The remaining 4 components were subject 
to an audit of specified account balances that we considered 
had the potential for the greatest impact on the Group financial 
statements. We have also considered requirements for 
certain local statutory audits to be finalised before our audit 
report date in determining our audit scope which increased 
the total coverage.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 
99% of the Group’s EBITDA, 99% of the Group’s Revenue 
and 85% of the Group’s Total assets. The specific scope 
components contributed 1% of the Group’s EBITDA, 0% of the 
Group’s Revenue and 5% of the Group’s Total assets. The audit 
scope of these components may not have included testing 
of all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for 
the Group.

to the Group financial statements.
We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls 
of the Group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and 
assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, 
as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate 
audit strategy.
CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR
This is our first year of auditing Vedanta Resources plc. Our 
scope is broadly consistent with that adopted by the previous 
auditor. The main change was the removal of the Lisheen mine 
following its operational closure in November 2015.
INTEGRATED TEAM STRUCTURE
The overall audit strategy is determined by the senior statutory 
auditor, Mirco Bardella. The senior statutory auditor is based 
in the UK however, since Group management and many 
operations reside in India, the Group audit team includes 
members from both the UK and India. The senior statutory 
auditor visited India four times during the current year’s audit 
and members of the Group audit team in both jurisdictions 
work together as an integrated team throughout the audit 
process. Whilst in India, he focused his time on the audit 
focus areas, interactions with management and Group and 
component teams. During the current year’s audit he reviewed 
key working papers and met with key representatives of the 
integrated and Indian component audit teams for all full scope 
components to discuss the audit approach and issues arising 
from their work.
INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the split of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by the Group audit engagement team, 
or by component auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under the Group team instruction. 
It was concluded that audit procedures on all of the 14 full 
scope components would be performed directly by the 
component audit team. The Group team reviewed this work 
and ensured sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis to form part of our opinion on the Group as a whole. In 
addition the integrated Group team also included key members 
of certain full scope components ensuring knowledge was 
transferred effectively through the team. The work on all of the 
specific scope components was performed by the Group audit 
team directly. 
The Group audit team established a programme of planned 
visits. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were 
undertaken by senior members of the Group audit team to 
certain component teams in India together with teams in 
Zambia, Namibia and South Africa. These visits involved 
key members of the Group audit team meeting with local 
management and discussing the audit approach with the 
Component teams together with any issues arising from 
their work. In addition members from all of the Indian based 
component teams physically attended a global planning 
event with the Group team. Additionally the Group audit team 
participated in key discussions, via conference calls with all 
full scope entities. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 155, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members,

2 The merger reserve arose on incorporation of the Company during the year ended 31 March 2004. The investment in Twin Star had a carrying amount value of US$20.0 million in the accounts of 
Volcan. As required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of 156,000,000 Ordinary shares to Volcan, Twin Star’s issued share capital and share premium account have been 
eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the investment in Twin Star in Volcan’s accounts and the nominal value of the shares 
issued to Volcan.
3 Others: US$3.2 million of tax refund received on appropriation of reserves in BALCO during the year 2015-16(2016-17 : Nil).
4 Under Indian law, a general reserve was created through an annual transfer of net income to general reserve at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. The purpose of 
these transfers is to ensure that the total dividend distribution is less than total distributable reserves for that year.

enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The Group will be required to 
provide information on movements in gross liabilities arising from financing activities in addition to the net debt reconciliation 
currently provided. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 , although entities are 
permitted to apply them earlier.
Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses. These amendments on the recognition of 
deferred tax assets for unrealised losses clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at 
fair value. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 , although entities are permitted to 
apply them earlier.
IFRIC 22: Foreign Currency T ransactions and Advance Consideration: not yet endorsed by the EU : The Interpretation, which 
was issued on 8 December 2016, addresses how to determine the date of a transaction for the purpose of determining the 
exchange rate to use on initial recognition of an asset, expense or income (or part of it) when a related non-monetary asset or 
non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration in a foreign currency is derecognised. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, although entities are permitted to apply them 
earlier.
IAS 40 Investment Property: Paragraph 57 has been amended to state that an entity shall transfer a property to, or from, 
investment property when, and only when, there is evidence of a change in use. A change of use occurs if property meets, or 
ceases to meet, the definition of investment property. A change in management’s intentions for the use of a property by itself 
does not constitute evidence of a change in use. The list of evidence in paragraph 57(a) – (d) was designated as non-exhaustive list 
of examples instead of the previous exhaustive list. The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. Earlier application is permitted.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Few amendments to clarify the classification and measurement of share-based payment 
transactions have been issued. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Earlier 
application is permitted. The amendments are to be applied prospectively. However, retrospective application is allowed if this is 
possible without the use of hindsight.
IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Amendments regarding the interaction of IFRS 4 and IFRS 9 has been issued. An entity choosing to 
apply the overlay approach retrospectively to qualifying financial assets does so when it first applies IFRS 9. An entity choosing to 
apply the deferral approach does so for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In July 2014,the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The standard 
reduces the complexity of the current rules on financial instruments as mandated in IAS 39. IFRS 9 has fewer classification and 
measurement categories as compared to IAS 39 and has eliminated the categories of held to maturity, available for sale and loans 
and receivables. Further it eliminates the rule based requirement of segregating embedded derivatives and tainting rules pertaining 
to held to maturity investments. For an investment in an equity instrument which is not held for trading, IFRS 9 permits an  174
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
irrevocable election, on initial recognition, on an individual share-by- share basis,to present all fair value changes from the 
investment in other comprehensive income. No amount recognized in other comprehensive income would ever be reclassified to 
profit or loss. It requires the entity, which chooses to measure a liability at fair value,to present the portion of the fair value change 
attributable to the entity’s own credit risk in the other comprehensive income. IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss model’ in IAS 39 
with an ‘expected credit loss’ model. The measurement uses a dual measurement approach, under which the loss allowance is 
measured as either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The standard also introduces new 
presentation and disclosure requirements. The effective date for adoption of IFRS 9 is annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018,though early adoption is permitted.
The indicative impacts of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group are as follows. The work is ongoing and additional impacts may be 
identified later in the implemenatation process.
 › Classification and measurement: IFRS 9 establishes a principle based approach for classification of financial assets based on 
cash flow characteristics of the asset and the business model in which an asset is held. The Group anticipates no significant 
changes in the classification of financial assets and liabilities under this model.
 › Impairment: Based on Group’s initial assessment, the impairment of financial assets held at amortised cost is not expected to 
have material impact on the Group’s results, given the low exposure to counterparty default risk as a result of the credit risk 
management processes that are in place.
 › Hedge accounting: The adoption of the new standard would not materially change the amounts recognised in relation to 
existing hedging arrangements.
IFRS 15 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with Customers outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard replaces most current revenue recognition guidance. The core 
principle of the new standard is for companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in 
amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The 
new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously 
addressed comprehensively including service revenues and contract modifications and improve guidance for multiple-element 
arrangements. The new Standard will come into effect for the annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with 
early application permitted.
The indicative impacts of implementing IFRS 15 on the Group results are detailed below. The work is ongoing and additional 
impacts may be identified later in the implementation process.
 › The timing of the recognition of revenue- The new standard introduces the concept of ‘control’ for revenue recognition, in 
contrast to the “risk and rewards” approach in IAS 18. Accordingly, the revenue recognition model will change from one based 
on the transfer of risk and reward of ownership to the transfer of control of ownership. The Group’s revenue is predominantly 
derived from commodity sales, where the point of recognition is dependent on the contract sales terms, known as the 
International Commercial terms (Incoterms). As the transfer of risks and rewards generally coincides with the transfer of 
control at a point in time for the Incoterms as part of the Group’s commodity sales arrangements, the timing and amount of 
revenue recognised for the sale of commodities is unlikely to be materially affected for the majority of sales. 
IFRS 16 – LEASES
IFRS 16- Leases, specifies recognition, measurement and disclosure criteria for leases. The standard provides a single lessee 
accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or 
the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach to lessor 
accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17 . The new Standard will come into effect for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
has also been applied.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the potential impact of adopting the above standard.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS:
The Group has adopted with effect from 1 April 2016, the following new amendment and pronouncements. Their adoption has not 
had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
 › Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative
 › Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle
 › Amendments to IAS 27: Equity method in separate financial statements
 › Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
 › Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
 › Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint 
Venture.
 › Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment entities : Applying the Consolidation Exemption
The Group has not early adopted any other amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet 
effective.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 175
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements of the parent company, Vedanta Resources plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom, have been prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101 and UK company law. The Company financial statements and associated notes are presented in note 
46 to 59.
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(I) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
SUBSIDIARIES:
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries (the “Group”), being the 
companies that it controls. Control is evidenced where the Company has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, which significantly affect 
the entity returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with accounting 
policies used by the Group.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a share of the profit for the financial year and net assets is attributed to the non-controlling 
interests as shown in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated 
balance sheet.
For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries, where there is no change in control, the Group recognises a reduction to the 
non-controlling interest of the respective subsidiary with the difference between this figure and the cash paid, inclusive of 
transaction fees, being recognised in equity. In addition, upon dilution of controlling interests the difference between the cash 
received from sale or listing of the subsidiary shares and the increase to non-controlling interest is also recognised in equity. The 
results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been 
eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
JOINT ARRANGEMENTS
A Joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is considered when there is 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require 
the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
 › The Group has Joint operations within its Oil & Gas segment, the Group participates in several unincorporated joint operations 
which involve the joint control of assets used in oil and gas exploration and producing activities. The Group accounts for its 
share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of joint ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the 
appropriate balance sheet and income statement headings. In addition, where the Group acts as operator to the joint venture, 
the gross liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or from non-operating partners) of the joint operations are 
included in the Group balance sheet.
(II) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable , net of discounts, volume rebates, outgoing 
sales taxes excise duty and other indirect taxes. Revenues from sales are recognised when all significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the commodity sold are transferred to the customer and the commodity has been delivered to the shipping agent. 
Revenues from sale of by-products are included in revenue.
Certain of the Group’s sales contracts provide for provisional pricing based on the price on The London Metal Exchange (“LME”), 
as specified in the contract, when shipped. Final settlement of the price is based on the applicable price for a specified future 
period. The Group’s provisionally priced sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices for the future period specified 
in the contract and is adjusted in revenue.
 › Revenue from oil, gas and condensate sales represent the Group’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on 
a direct entitlement basis, and tolling income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with 
agreements.
 › Revenue from sale of power is recognised when delivered and measured based on rates as per bilateral contractual 
agreements with buyers and at rate arrived at based on the principles laid down under the relevant Tariff Regulations as 
notified by the regulatory bodies, as applicable. 
 › Where the Group acts as a port operator, revenues and costs relating to each construction contract of service concession 
arrangements are recognised over the period of each arrangement only to the extent of costs incurred that are probable of 
recovery. Revenues and costs relating to operating phase of the port contract are measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable for the services provided.
 › Revenue from rendering of services is recognised on the basis of work performed.
1. PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 176
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
 › Dividend income recognised when the right to receive payment is established is accounted for as investment income in 
consolidated income statement.
 › Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method, accounted for as investment income in consolidated 
income statement.
 › The fair value gain/(loss) in relation to financial assets held for trading is accounted for as investment income in consolidated 
income statement. 
 (III) SPECIAL ITEMS
Special items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence (including but not limited Impairment 
charges and acquisition and restructuring related costs), should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information 
allows an understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior 
periods. Also tax charges related to Special items and certain one-time tax effects are considered Special. Such items are material 
by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance with IFRS. The determination as to which 
items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.
(IV) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control 
passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except certain assets and 
liabilities required to be measured as per the applicable standards.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, which can be measured reliably, are recorded at their 
provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred (including 
contingent consideration and previously held non-controlling interests) and Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets on acquisition is recognised as Goodwill. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the income 
statement in the Y ear of acquisition. If the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment 
still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is 
recognised in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial 
statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair 
values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets, excluding goodwill. This accounting choice is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
Acquisition expenses are charged to the income statement.
If the Group acquires a group of assets or equity in a company that does not constitute a business combination in accordance with 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008 revised), the cost of the acquired group of assets or equity is allocated to the individual 
identifiable assets acquired based on their relative fair value.
COMMON CONTROL TRANSACTIONS 
A business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the 
combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business 
combination and the control is not transitory. The transactions between entities under common control are scoped out of IFRS 3 
and there is no authoritative literature for these transactions under IFRS. As a result, the Group adopted accounting principles 
similar to the pooling-of-interest method based on the predecessor values. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are 
recognised at the book values recorded in the ultimate parent entity’s consolidated financial statements with the exception of 
certain income tax and deferred tax benefits arising on account of the common control transaction but relating to previous years, 
which are recognised retrospectively. The components of equity of the acquired companies are added to the same components 
within Group equity except that any share capital and investments in the books of the acquiring entity is cancelled and the 
differences, if any, is adjusted in the opening retained earnings. The Company’s shares issued in consideration for the acquired 
companies are recognized from the moment the acquired companies are included in these financial statements and the financial 
statements of the commonly controlled entities would be combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction had occurred at the 
beginning of the earliest reporting period presented. However, the prior years’ comparative information is only adjusted for periods 
during which the entities were under common control.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(V) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangibles assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group 
determines the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic benefits will flow to the Group after taking into 
account all relevant facts and circumstances. Amortisation method, residual values and estimated useful life of intangible assets 
are reviewed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
Intangible assets arising out of service concession arrangements are accounted for as intangible assets where the Company has a 
contractual right to charge users of services when the projects are completed and is measured at the cost of such construction 
services completed. Such assets are amortised on straight line basis over the balance of license period, usually between 3 to 30 
years.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the asset is 
derecognised.
(VI) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
RELATING TO MINERAL ASSETS- MINING PROPERTIES AND LEASES
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral 
rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading ‘Mining properties and leases’ in the year in which they 
are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production (i.e. when the Group determines that the 
mining property will provide sufficient and sustainable returns relative to the risk and decides to proceed with the development), all 
further pre-production primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as part of 
the cost of the mining property until the mining property is capable of commercial production. From that point, capitalised mining 
properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of 
each property or group of properties.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial 
production criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review on an event of indication for impairment.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the right to mine or the legal right to explore, is capitalised as 
property, plant and equipment and stated at cost less any impairment. Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to the 
appropriate category of property, plant and equipment when the technical feasibility and commercial viability has been determined. 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment and impairment loss, if any, is recognised prior to reclassification. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as 
incurred.
Exploration expenditure includes all direct and allocated indirect expenditure associated with finding specific mineral resources 
which includes depreciation and applicable operating costs of related support equipment and facilities and other costs of 
exploration activities:
 › Acquisition costs – costs associated with acquisition of licences and rights to explore, including related professional fees.
 › General exploration costs – costs of surveys and studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies (e.g., costs 
incurred for environment clearance, defence clearance, etc.), and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews 
and other personnel conducting those studies.
 › Costs of exploratory drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells.
The stripping cost incurred during the production phase of a surface mine are deferred to the extent the current period stripping 
cost exceeds the average period stripping cost over the life of mine and recognised as an asset if such cost provides a benefit in 
terms of improved access to ore in future periods and certain criteria are met. Deferred stripping costs are included in mining 
properties within Property, plant and equipment and disclosed as a part of mining properties. After initial recognition, the stripping 
activity asset is depreciated on a unit of production method over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore 
body.
In circumstances where a mining property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in 
the period in which it occurs i.e. when the group determines that the mining property will not provide sufficient and sustainable 
returns relative to the risks and the group decides not to proceed with the mine development.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves as defined by the ‘JORC’ Code and ‘SAMREC’ Code. Changes in the 
commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
RELATING TO OIL AND GAS ASSETS- EXPLORATION & EVALUATION ASSETS AND DEVELOPING/PRODUCING ASSETS
For oil and gas assets a successful efforts based accounting policy is followed. Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to 
explore an area are expensed immediately to the income statement. Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is 
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 178
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held, are not amortised or depreciated, within exploration and evaluation 
assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within property, 
plant and equipment- exploration and evaluation assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities (under oil and gas properties 
and/or exploration and evaluation assets as appropriate). Exploration drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis 
until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration effort is judged on a 
well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist 
and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & 
equipment - development/producing assets (oil and gas properties) after testing for impairment. Where results of exploration 
drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written 
off to the income statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are 
capitalised within property, plant & equipment - development/producing assets (oil and gas properties) on a field-by-field basis. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset 
or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus 
proceeds are credited to the income statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited 
against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the 
asset.
OTHER PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including 
relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning. This policy is set out under ‘Borrowings Costs’. Expenditure 
incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred. Major shut-down and overhaul expenditure is capitalised as the 
activities undertaken improve the economic benefits expected to arise from the asset.
(VII) ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Assets under construction are capitalised in the assets under construction account. At the point when an asset is operating at 
management’s intended use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment 
and depreciation commences (see below). Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory 
decommissioning costs are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a 
period of commissioning has been completed. Revenue generated from production during the trial period is capitalised. Borrowing 
costs and certain foreign exchange gains or losses are in certain circumstances capitalised in the cost of the asset under 
construction. This policy is set out under ‘Borrowing Costs’.
(VIII) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
RELATING TO MINING PROPERTIES
Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, freehold land and goodwill are not depreciated 
or amortised. Capitalised mining properties are depreciated and lease costs are amortised once commercial production 
commences, as described in “Property, plant and equipment – mining properties and leases” . Leasehold land and buildings are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease or, if shorter, their useful economic life.
RELA TING TO OIL AND GAS ASSETS
All expenditure carried within each field is depreciated from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which 
is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus 
the production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis or group of fields which are reliant on common infrastructure.
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, 
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of 
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible. There should 
be a 50 per cent statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as 
proven and probable reserves and a 50 per cent statistical probability that it will be less.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field 
development costs required to access commercial reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field 
development costs are dealt with prospectively.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
OTHERS
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. 
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Buildings operations and administration 30-60 years
Plant and machinery 15-40 years
Office equipment and fixtures 5–10 years
Motor vehicles 8-10 years
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset annually and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the 
change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
Major overhaul costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the economic benefit to be derived from the overhaul. The carrying 
amount of the remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the income statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than 
the previously estimated life of the economic benefit.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal Group held for sale is not depreciated. Property, plant and 
equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on 
the face of the balance sheet.
(IX) IMPAIRMENT
FINANCIAL ASSETS
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A 
financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on 
the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment 
loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value.
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively 
in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of 
income. Any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognized previously in the consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated statements of income on recognition of impairment. An impairment 
loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For 
financial assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is 
recognized in the consolidated statements of income. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the change in 
fair value is recognized directly in the consolidated income statement.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group would provide for impairment losses unless the Company is satisfied that no 
recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the 
financial asset directly.
NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Impairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cash-generating units. A cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group 
of assets.
Formal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed 
when there is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values annually, which is used as a 
source of information to assess for any indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. Internal 
and external factors, such as worse economic performance than expected, changes in expected future prices, costs and other 
market factors are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses.
If any such indication exists then an impairment review is undertaken, the recoverable amount is calculated, as the higher of fair 
value less costs of disposal and the asset’s value in use.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market 
participants less costs of disposal and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the entity and not applicable to 
entities in general. Fair value for mineral and oil and gas assets is generally determined as the present value of the estimated 
future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual 
disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account. These cash flows are discounted at an 
appropriate post-tax discount rate to arrive at the net present value.
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 180
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
Value in use is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. The cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and 
cannot take into account future development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating fair value and 
consequently the value in use calculation is likely to give a different result to a fair value calculation.
The carrying amount of the CGU is determined on a basis consistent with the way the recoverable amount of the CGU is 
determined. The carrying amount is net of deferred tax liability recognised in the fair value of the assets acquired in a business 
combination.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or 
CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is limited to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised except if 
initially attributed to goodwill.
EXPLORATION & EVALUATION ASSETS:
In assessing whether there is any indication that an exploration and evaluation asset may be impaired, the company considers, as 
a minimum, the following indicators:
 › the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the 
near future, and is not expected to be renewed;
 › substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted 
nor planned;
 › exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable 
quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area;
 › sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the 
exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale; and
 › reserve information prepared annually by external experts. 
When a potential impairment is identified, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the group of 
operating assets (representing a cash-generating unit) to which the exploration and evaluation assets is attributed. Exploration 
areas in which reserves have been discovered but require major capital expenditure before production can begin, are continually 
evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration work is under way or 
planned. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.
(X) NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is highly probable from the date of 
classification, management are committed to the sale and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale from the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value (less costs to sell). Any resulting impairment loss that is material is recognised in the income statement as a 
special item. On classification as held for sale the assets are no longer depreciated and moved to current assets.
(XI) GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants related to assets, including non monetary grants at fair value, have been deducted in arriving at the carrying 
amount of the asset. 
(XII) INVENTORIES
Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
COST IS DETERMINED ON THE FOLLOWING BASIS:
 › Purchased copper concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis; all other materials including stores and 
spares are valued on weighted average basis; except in Oil and Gas business where stores and spares are valued on a FIFO 
basis.
 › Finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable 
proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity; and by-products and scrap are valued at net 
realisable value.
 › Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion 
and disposal.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(XIII) TAXATION
Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Exceptions to this principle are:
Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future;
Deferred income tax is not recognised on the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, which at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as Business Combinations. Deferred 
tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. Any deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement/other comprehensive income as the underlying temporary difference is reversed. 
(XIV) RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefits and contribution schemes, the assets of which are (where 
funded) held in separately administered funds.
For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using 
the projected unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries.
Re-measurement gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are not recycled to the 
income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into 
current service cost, past service cost, net interest expense or income and remeasurement.
Current service cost and past service costs is recognised within cost of sales and administrative expenses. Net interest expense 
or income is recognised within finance costs.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-
retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
(XV) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Certain employees (including executive directors) of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled 
transactions’).
The resultant increase in equity is recorded in share based payment reserve.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair 
value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined with the assistance of an external valuer and the fair 
value at the grant date is expensed on a proportionate basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting 
date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations. 
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 182
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
In case of cash-settled transactions, a liability is recognised for the fair value of cash-settled transactions. The fair value is measured 
initially and at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in employee 
benefits expense. The fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The 
fair value is determined with the assistance of an external valuer.
(XVI) PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value 
using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost. 
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
(XVII) RESTORATION, REHABILITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of a mine or oil fields. Costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site 
preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at 
the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs 
are charged to the income statement over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the 
discount on the provision. The cost estimates are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which 
may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the 
provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the 
asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a 
finance cost in the income statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their 
net present values and charged to the income statement as extraction progresses. Where the costs of site restoration are not 
anticipated to be significant, they are expensed as incurred.
 (XVIII) OPERATING LEASES
GROUP AS A LESSEE
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis.
GROUP AS A LESSOR
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as 
operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of 
the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as 
revenue in the period in which they are earned. 
(XIX) FINANCE LEASES
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, 
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on 
borrowing costs.
 (XX) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates. For all principal operating subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates 
with the exception of KCM and Oil and gas business which has a US Dollar functional currency as that is the currency of primary 
economic environment in which it operates. In the financial statements of individual Group companies, transactions in currencies 
other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into the functional currency at exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies and measured at 
historical cost or fair value are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates on which such values were determined.
All exchange differences are included in the income statement, except, where the monetary item is designated as an effective 
hedging instrument of the currency risk of designated forecast sales. These include the exchange differences recognised in equity 
and exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to asset under construction, and for future productive use, and 
are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency 
borrowings.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional 
currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related consolidated statements of 
financial position are translated at the rates as at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. On disposal of such entities the deferred cumulative exchange differences 
recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated statements of profit or loss. 
(XXI) FINANCIAL ASSET INVESTMENTS
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial asset investments and then remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On disposal or 
impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement.
Investments in equity instruments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are 
measured at cost.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred 
‘loss event’) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be 
reliably estimated.
(XXII) LIQUID INVESTMENTS
Liquid investments represent short-term investments that do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents for one or more 
of the following reasons:
 › They have a maturity profile greater than 90 days;
 › They may be subject to a greater risk of changes in value than cash;
 › They are held for investment purposes.
These include Short-term marketable securities and other Bank Deposits. 
Short-term marketable securities are categorized as held for trading and are initially recognised at fair value with any gains or 
losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the consolidated statements of profit or loss. 
Other bank deposits are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments.
(XXIII) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are 
held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
(XXIV) TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are stated at their transaction value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an event, which based on previous experience, is an 
indication of a reduction in the recoverability of the carrying value of the trade receivables.
Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised on non-current receivables on specific items by applying the effective interest rate method.
(XXV) TRADE PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are recognised at their transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. 
(XXVI) BILLS OF EXCHANGE PAYABLE
The Group enters into arrangements whereby financial institutions make direct payments to suppliers for raw materials and project 
materials. The financial institutions are subsequently repaid by the company at a later date providing working capital timing 
benefits. These are normally settled up to twelve months (for raw materials) and up to 36 months (for project materials). Where 
these arrangements are for raw materials with a maturity of up to twelve months, the economic substance of the transaction is 
determined to be operating in nature and these are recognised as Bills of exchange (under Trade and other payables). Where these 
arrangements are for project materials with a maturity up to thirty six months, the economic substance of the transaction is 
determined to be financing in nature, and these are classified as projects buyers’ credit within borrowings in the statement of 
financial position.
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 184
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
(XXVII) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(XXVIII) BORROWINGS
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the fair value. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective 
interest method. They are netted against the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period 
in which they arise.
(XXIX)CONVERTIBLE BONDS
Convertible bonds denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity are accounted for as compound instruments. The 
equity components and the liability components are separated out on the date of the issue. The equity component is recognised in 
a separate reserve and is not subsequently remeasured. The liability component (net of transaction cost) is held at amortised cost. 
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate, being the prevailing market 
interest rate at the date of issuance for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between this amount and interest paid is added 
to the carrying amount of the liability component.
Convertible bonds not denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity or where a cash conversion option exists, are 
split into two components: a debt component and a component representing the embedded derivative in the convertible bond. 
The debt component represents a liability for future coupon payments and the redemption of the principal amount. The embedded 
derivative, a financial liability, represents the value of the option that bondholders have to convert into ordinary shares. At inception 
the embedded derivative is recorded at fair value and the remaining balance, after deducting a share of issue costs, is recorded as 
the debt component. Subsequently, the debt component is measured at amortised cost and the embedded derivative is measured 
at fair value at each balance sheet date with the change in the fair value recognised in the income statement. The embedded 
derivative and the debt component are disclosed together and the current/non-current classification follows the classification of 
the debt component which is the host contract.
(XXX) BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are 
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use in accordance with the Group policy which is when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds are 
borrowed specifically to finance a qualifying capital project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. 
Where surplus funds are available out of money borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from such 
short-term investments is also capitalised to reduce the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project 
form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant 
general borrowings of the Group during the year. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Capitalisation of interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is ceased when substantially all the 
activities that are necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use are complete or when delays occur outside of the 
normal course of business.
(XXXI) AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
Equity shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale (AFS) financial assets 
and are stated at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On 
disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement. Dividends 
received from investees accounted for as equity instruments are recognised in income statement when the right to receive the 
payment is established.
(XXXII) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUED THROUGH PROFIT AND LOSS
HELD FOR TRADING FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. 
The change in fair value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments 
and is accounted for in the income statement.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward 
contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments. The Group does not hold derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured 
at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates. The resultant gains or losses are recognised in the income statement unless 
these are designated as effective hedging instruments.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(XXXIII) HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency 
risk, as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recorded in the income statement. The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in 
the income statement and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in equity. This includes 
certain non-derivative liabilities that are designated as hedge of the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. 
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the 
income statement.
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity. The 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to 
the income statement on disposal of the foreign operations to which they relate.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the 
forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks 
and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with 
unrealised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operations, the gain or loss is 
reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as part of the exchange difference on translation of foreign 
operations to the extent it is effective. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/expense 
in the consolidated statement of profit or loss immediately. Under a hedge of a net investment, the cumulative gain or loss 
remains in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, or when the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes designation of the hedge relationship. 
The cumulative gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain/loss on disposal when the net 
investment in the foreign operation is disposed. 
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the financial position date and 
gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
2(B) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENT AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions, that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses 
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these consolidated financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
assumptions and conditions.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected. The Group considers the following areas as the key sources of 
estimation uncertainty:
(I) OIL & GAS RESERVES
Oil & Gas reserves are estimated on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis. Proven and probable reserves are estimated 
using standard recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed annually. Future development costs are estimated 
taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and 
internal engineers.
Net entitlement reserves estimates are subsequently calculated using the Group’s current oil price and cost recovery 
assumptions, in line with the relevant agreements.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could 
impact the depreciation rates, carrying value of assets and environmental and restoration provisions.
(II) CARRYING VALUE OF EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION OIL AND GAS ASSETS
The recoverability of a project is assessed under IFRS 6. Exploration assets are assessed by comparing the carrying value to higher 
of fair value less cost of disposal or value in use. Change to the valuation of exploration assets is an area of judgement. Further 
details on the Group’s accounting policies on this are set out in accounting policy above. The amounts for exploration and 
evaluation assets represent active exploration projects. These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration 
costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of 
2 (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 186
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets 
will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Details of impairment charge/reversal impact and the assumptions used are disclosed in note 5.
(III) CARRYING VALUE OF DEVELOPING/PRODUCING OIL AND GAS ASSETS
Management perform impairment tests on the Group’s developing/producing oil and gas assets where indicators of impairment 
are identified in accordance with IAS 36.
The impairment assessments are based on a range of estimates and assumptions, including:
 Estimates/assumptions Basis
Future production proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and, in certain cases, expansion projects
Commodity prices
management’s best estimate benchmarked with external sources of information, to ensure they are 
within the range of available analyst forecast
Discount to price management’s best estimate based on historical prevailing discount
Extension of PSC assumed that PSC for Rajasthan block would be extended till 2030 on the expected commercial terms
Discount rates cost of capital risk-adjusted for the risk specific to the asset/CGU
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of the 
assets.
Details of impairment charge and the assumptions used are disclosed in note 5.
(IV) MINING PROPERTIES AND LEASES
The carrying value of mining property and leases is arrived at by depreciating the assets over the life of the mine using the unit of 
production method based on proved and probable reserves. The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of 
the mine and may change when new information becomes available. Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production 
cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could thus impact the carrying values of mining properties and leases 
and environmental and restoration provisions.
Management performs impairment tests when there is an indication of impairment. The impairment assessments are based on a 
range of estimates and assumptions, including:
 Estimates/assumptions Basis
Future production
proved and probable reserves, resource estimates (with an appropriate conversion factor) considering the 
expected permitted mining volumes and, in certain cases, expansion projects
Commodity prices
management’s best estimate benchmarked with external sources of information, to ensure they are 
within the range of available analyst forecast
Exchange rates management best estimate benchmarked with external sources of information
Discount rates cost of capital risk-adjusted for the risk specific to the asset/CGU
Details of impairment charge are disclosed in note 5.
(V) USEFUL ECONOMIC LIVES AND IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties, oil and gas properties, and leases are depreciated over their useful 
economic lives. Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation 
rates prospectively and hence the asset carrying values. The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including 
mining properties and leases, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying 
values of the assets may not be recoverable. In assessing the property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to 
significant reduction in profits such as changes in commodity prices, the Group’s business plans and changes in regulatory 
environment are taken into consideration. The carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit (CGU) is compared with the 
recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Recoverable value is 
based on the management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, 
long-term plan, discount rates and other factors. Any subsequent changes to cash flow due to changes in the abovementioned 
factors could impact the carrying value of the assets.
(VI) ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT AT LANJIGARH REFINERY
During the previous year, the Group has received the necessary approvals for expansion of the Lanjigarh refinery to 4 million 
tonnes per annum (MTPA). Approval for expansion from 4 MTPA to 6 MTPA is dependent upon certain conditions.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Accordingly, second stream operation has commenced in Alumina refinery from April 2016 thus, taking it to the debottlenecked 
capacity of 1 .7 - 2.0 MTPA (contingent on bauxite quality). Further ramp up to 4 MTPA will be considered after tying up the local 
bauxite sources. The Group has considered the delay in tying up local bauxite sources as an indication of impairment. Hence, the 
Group has reviewed the carrying value of its property, plant and equipments at Lanjigarh as at balance sheet date, estimated the 
recoverable amounts of these assets and concluded that there was no impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated 
based on fair value less cost of disposal) exceeded the carrying amounts.
The key assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value less cost of disposal of these assets were:
 › The State of Odisha has abundant bauxite resources and given the initiatives by the Government of Odisha, management is 
confident that bauxite will be made available in the short to medium term. The company has entered into agreements with 
various suppliers internationally and domestically to ensure the availability of bauxite to run its refinery. In the initial years, the 
Company has assumed that bauxite will be purchased from third party suppliers in India and other countries, till the bauxite is 
sourced from own mines.
 › The State of Odisha has taken certain measures including reservation of areas for mining operations or undertaking 
prospecting and constitution of Ministerial Committee for formulation of policy for supply of ores to Odisha based industries on 
long term basis. GOI has amended the existing MMDR Act. The major change is in the process of grant of concessions i.e. 
from First come First serve basis to more transparent process of auction and to expedite the grant process.
 › Management expects that the conditions for construction of the alumina refinery beyond 4 MTPA will be fulfilled and it is 
assumed that the final unconditional approval for the expansion of the refinery would be received for commencement of 
production by fiscal 2020.
The government of Odisha has cancelled all the old reservations for mine allotment and has formed a more transparent process of 
auction of mines under the MMDR Act, which will improve the chances of local bauxite availability.
Management expects that the mining approvals for various local bauxite mines will be received. 
The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis on the key variables including delay in obtaining bauxite mining approval, depreciation of 
US dollar against Rupee, discount rate and London Metal Exchange aluminium prices. The most significant variable is the estimated 
timeframe for obtaining regulatory approval for the mining and/or gaining access to local bauxite. The sensitivity analysis indicates 
that even if regulatory approvals for mines/access to local bauxite are delayed by a year, the recoverable amount is still expected to 
exceed the carrying value and costs. As at March 31, 2017 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment related to alumina 
refinery operations at Lanjigarh and related mining assets is US$1,099.4 million (31 March 2016 : US$1,079.0 million).
(VII) ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT OF KARNATAKA AND GOA IRON ORE MINES:
KARNATAKA MINING
The mining ban in Karnataka was lifted on 17 April 2013 and the mining operations resumed in December 2013. The mining 
operations were suspended since August 2014 pending environment clearances. On execution of Mining Lease Deed and final 
forest clearance, the operations were resumed towards the end of February 2015. Currently the permissible extraction capacity is 
fixed at 2.29 MTPA which is based on lowest of Reserves and Resources (R & R) capacity, dumping capacity and road capacity as 
assessed by Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education. Subsequently, based on reassessment of R & R and other factors, 
the modified mining plan has been submitted to Indian Bureau of Mines in March 2016 for enhancement of production to 6 MTPA. 
Management has estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets considering the increase in the extraction capacity in 
FY2018. 
A delay of one year in increase in the allocated capacity would result in reduction in the recoverable amount by approximately 1% 
and the recoverable amount would continue to be sufficiently in excess of the carrying value.
The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2017 is US$140.2 million (31 March 2016: US$145.6 million).
GOA MINING
The Ministry of Environment and Forest revoked its earlier order which had kept the environment clearances for iron ore mines in 
Goa in abeyance. The State Government has issued a mining policy and has lifted the ban on Iron ore mining in Goa. The Group has 
been allocated with an interim annual mining quantity of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) (out of the total interim mining cap 
of 20 MTPA for FY 2016) of saleable ore. 
The Expert Committee, constituted by the Supreme Court of India for conducting the Macro-Environmental Impact Assessment 
study on the ceiling of annual extraction of iron ore mining in Goa has recommended the enhancement of mining cap to 30 MTPA. 
This has been recommended to be further enhanced to 37 MTPA after the review of Macro Environment Impact Assessment and 
augmenting the carrying capacity. The report is pending for consideration of Supreme Court. Post the Supreme Court clearance, 
the State Government will allocate the limits. It has been assumed that the allocation will be made based on the proportionate 
share of the current EC limits.
The mining operations resumed in October, 2015. Management has estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets 
considering the mining cap of 30 MTPA in FY 2018 and 37 MTPA from FY 2019 and onwards.
2(B) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENT AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED) 188
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
A delay of one year in increase in the mining cap to 30 MTPA and 37 MTPA would result in a reduction in the recoverable amount 
by approximately 4% and the recoverable amount would continue to be sufficiently in excess of the carrying value.
The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2017 is US$635.2 million (31 March 2016: US$643.9 million).
Management has reviewed the carrying value of Karnataka and Goa mining assets as at the balance sheet date, estimated the 
recoverable amounts of these assets and concluded that there was no impairment as the recoverable amount (estimated based 
on fair value less costs of disposal) exceeded the carrying amounts. 
The Group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables including delay in increase in the mining cap, movement in 
iron ore prices, discount rate and appreciation of rupee against US dollar. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the recoverable amount 
is still expected to exceed the carrying value.
Details of impairment charge are disclosed in note 5.
(VIII) ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT AT KONKOLA COPPER MINES (KCM)
The KCM operations in Zambia have experienced, lower equipment availability, throughput constraints, and other operational 
challenges including production ramp up. Due to these factors, the Group has reviewed the carrying value of its property, plant and 
equipments at KCM as at balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of the assets and concluded that there was no 
impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on fair value less costs of disposal) exceeded the carrying 
amounts.
The Group has also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables like movement in copper prices, discount rate and production. 
Based on the sensitivity analysis, the recoverable amount is still expected to exceed the carrying value.
The carrying value of assets as at 31 March 2017 is US$1,663.6 million (31 March 2016: US$1,7 44.9 million).
(IX) RESTORATION, REHABILITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such 
costs arises. Such restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the 
life of the mine or oil fields. The costs are estimated on an annual basis on the basis of mine closure plans and the estimated 
discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities and the costs of restoration are capitalised as soon as the obligation 
to incur such costs arises. The critical accounting judgement is associated with calculating the provision for decommissioning oil 
and gas assets is based on the current estimate of the costs for removing and decommissioning producing facilities, the forecast 
timing and currency of settlement of decommissioning liabilities and the appropriate discount rate.
A corresponding provision is created on the liability side. The capitalised asset is charged to the income statement over the life of 
the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the provision is increased each period via unwinding the discount on the 
provision. Management estimates are based on local legislation and/or other agreements. The actual costs and cash outflows may 
differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in prices, analysis of site conditions and changes in 
restoration technology.
(X) PROVISIONS AND LIABILITIES
Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds 
resulting from past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated. The timing of recognition requires the application of 
judgement to existing facts and circumstances which may be subject to change especially when taken in the context of the legal 
environment in India. The actual cash outflows may take place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of 
provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that 
influence the provisions and liabilities. This is set out in note 30.
(XI) CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims against the Group. A tax 
provision is recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the group will be 
required to settle that obligation. 
Where it is management’s assessment that the outcome cannot be reliably quantified or is uncertain the claims are disclosed as 
contingent liabilities unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote. Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not 
provided for in the financial statements.
When considering the classification of a legal or tax cases as probable, possible or remote there is judgement involved. This 
pertains to the application of the legislation, which in certain cases is based upon management’s interpretation of country specific 
tax law, in particular India, and the likelihood of settlement. Management uses in-house and external legal professionals to inform 
their decision.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 189
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Although there can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, the Group does not expect them to 
have a materially adverse impact on the Group’s financial position or profitability. These are set out in note 38. 
(XII) THE HZL AND BALCO CALL OPTIONS
The Group had exercised its call option to acquire the remaining 49% interest in BALCO and 29.5% interest in HZL. The 
Government of India has however, contested the validity of the options and disputed their valuation performed in terms of the 
relevant agreements the details of which are set out in note 40. In view of the lack of resolution on the options, the non-response 
to the exercise and valuation request from the Government of India, the resultant uncertainty surrounding the potential transaction 
and the valuation of the consideration payable, the Group considers the strike price of the options to be at fair value, accordingly, 
the value of the option would be nil, and hence, the call options have not been recognised in the financial statements.
(XIII) ASSESSMENT OF IFRIC 4 – DETERMINING WHETHER AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS A LEASE
The Group has ascertained that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) entered into between one of the Subsidiary and a State Grid 
qualifies to be an operating lease under IAS 17 “Leases” . Accordingly, the consideration receivable under the PPA relating to 
recovery of capacity charges towards capital cost have been recognised as operating lease rentals and in respect of variable cost 
that includes fuel costs, operations and maintenance etc. is considered as revenue from sale of products/services.
Significant judgement is required in segregating the capacity charges due from State Grid, between fixed and contingent 
payments. The Group has determined that since the capacity charges under the PPA are based on the number of units of 
electricity made available by its Subsidiary which would be subject to variation on account of various factors like availability of coal 
and water for the plant, there are no fixed minimum payments under the PPA, which requires it to be accounted for on a straight 
line basis. 
(XIV) REVENUE RECOGNITION AND RECEIVABLE RECOVERY IN RELATION TO THE POWER DIVISION
In certain cases, the Group’s power customers are disputing various contractual provisions of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). 
Significant judgement is required in both assessing the tariff to be charged under the PPA in accordance with IAS 18 and to assess 
the recoverability of withheld revenue currently accounted for as receivables. 
In assessing this critical judgment management considered favorable legal opinions the Group has obtained in relation to the 
claims and favorable court judgements in the related matter. In addition the fact that the contracts are with government owned 
companies implies the credit risk is low.

1a. During the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Group has recognized net impairment reversal of US$12.6 million relating to Rajasthan block net of the charge in relation to change in the 
decommissioning liability due to change in discount rate as explained in note 30. Of this net reversal, US$63.0 million charge has been recorded against oil and gas properties and US$75.6 
million reversal has been recorded against exploratory and evaluation assets. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group had recognised impairment charge on its oil and gas assets of 
US$4,934.2 million mainly relating to Rajasthan block, triggered by the significant fall in the crude oil prices, prevailing discount of Rajasthan crude and adverse long term impact of revised cess. 
Of this charge, US$1,143.5 million had been recorded against oil and gas properties and US$3,790.7 million against exploratory and evaluation asset.
 The recoverable amount of the CGU, US$2,007 .0 million (March 2016: US$2,204 million), was determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal approach, a level-3 valuation technique in 
the fair value hierarchy, as it more accurately reflects the recoverable amount based on our view of the assumptions that would be used by a market participant. This is based on the cash flows 
expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production sharing contract (PSC)/cessation of production from each 
producing field based on current estimates of reserves and risked resources. Reserves assumptions for fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow tests consider all reserves that a 
market participant would consider when valuing the asset, which are usually broader in scope than the reserves used in a value-in-use test. Discounted cash flow analysis used to calculate fair 
value less costs of disposal uses assumption for oil price of US$54 per barrel for FY2018 (March 2016: US$51 per barrel) and the long-term nominal price of US$68 per barrel (March 2016: 
US$70 per barrel) derived from a consensus of various analyst recommendations. Thereafter, these have been escalated at a rate of 2.5% per annum. The cash flows are discounted using the 
post-tax nominal discount rate of 10.2% (March 2016: 11 .0%) derived from the post-tax weighted average cost of capital. The impairment loss relates to the Oil & Gas business reportable 
segments.
1b. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group had recognized US$227 .5 million impairment charge in respect of the exploratory assets in West Africa (Western Cluster, Liberia) on account of 
low iron ore prices, geo-political factors and absence of plans for any substantive expenditure resulting in continued uncertainty in the project and an additional, US$17 .7 million impairment 
charge in the carrying amount of idle assets grouped under assets under construction at Bellary, Karnataka in India.
1c. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group had recognised US$7 .6 million impairment charge relating to its operation in the Copper Mines of Tasmania Pty Ltd, Australia on account of 
extended care and maintenance, lower copper prices and continued uncertainty in start-up of operations.
1d. During the year ended 31 March 2017 , the Group has recognised US $ 29.9 million impairment charge relating to certain old items of capital work-in-progress at the Alumina refinery operations.
2. US$23.1 million incurred under a Group wide voluntary retirement initiative across various Group entities during the year ended March 2016.
3. As a result of amendments to the Zambian Mining Tax regime, effective from 1 January 2015, the tax rate on integrated mining operations (excluding custom smelting mineral processing 
activities) was reduced from 30% to 0%. The deferred tax liability in relation to mining operations was subsequently reversed during the year ended 31 March 2016, resulting in a net credit to 
the income statement of US$52.8 million. Consequent to the subsequent amendments to the Zambian Mining Tax regime, effective from 1 July 2015 the tax rate on mining operations has been 
restored from 0% to 30%. Further, the set off of carried forward losses relating to mining operations has been restricted to a maximum of 50% of the income for the year. Accordingly, a total 
deferred tax charge of US$173.8 million resulting from the amendments had been recognised under ‘Special tax items’ during the year ended 31 March 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Certain businesses of the Group within India are eligible for specified tax incentives which are included in the table above as tax 
holidays and similar exemptions. Most of such tax exemptions are relevant for the companies operating in India. These are briefly 
described as under:
THE LOCATION BASED EXEMPTION
In order to boost industrial and economic development in undeveloped regions, provided certain conditions are met, profits of 
newly established undertakings located in certain areas in India may benefit from a tax holiday. Such a tax holiday works to exempt 
100% of the profits for the first five years from the commencement of the tax holiday, and 30% of profits for the subsequent five 
years. This deduction is available only for units established up to 31 March 2012. However, such undertaking would continue to be 
subject to the Minimum Alternative tax (‘MAT’).
The Group has such types of undertakings at Haridwar and Pantnagar, which are part of Hindustan Zinc Limited (Zinc India). In the 
current year, Haridwar and Pantnagar units are eligible for deduction at 30% of taxable profits respectively.
 
SECTORAL BENEFIT – POWER PLANTS
To encourage the establishment of certain power plants, provided certain conditions are met, tax incentives exist to exempt 100% 
of profits and gains for any ten consecutive years within the 15 year period following commencement of the power plant’s 
operation. The Group currently has total operational capacity of 8.4 Giga Watts (GW) of thermal based power generation facilities 
and wind power capacity of 27 4 MW. However, such undertakings generating power would continue to be subject to the MAT 
provisions.
The Group has power plants which benefit from such deductions, at various locations of Hindustan Zinc Limited (where such 
benefits has been drawn), Talwandi Sabo Power Limited, Vedanta Limited and Bharat Aluminium Company Limited (where no 
benefit has been drawn).
SECTORAL BENEFIT – OIL & GAS
Provided certain conditions are met, profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings engaged in the oil & gas sector may 
benefit from a deduction of 100% of the profits of the undertaking for a period of seven consecutive years. This deduction is only 
available to blocks licensed prior to 31 March 2011 . However, such businesses would continue to be subject to the MAT provisions.
In the Group, Cairn India Limited benefits from such deductions. Previous year was the last year for claiming such benefit.
In addition, the subsidiaries incorporated in Mauritius are eligible for tax credit to the extent of 80% of the applicable tax rate on 
foreign source income.
The total effect of such tax holidays and exemptions was US$204.8 for the year ended 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: US$311 .0 
million).
13. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings/loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit/loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Weighted average number of treasury shares, 24,347 ,664 (2016 : 24,231,160) outstanding during the year are excluded from the 
total outstanding shares for the calculation of EPS.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and the Group’s 
convertible bonds). The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share 
computations:

The effect of 5.0 million (2016 : 6.8 million) potential ordinary shares, which relate to share option awards under the LTIP scheme, 
on the attributable loss for the year was anti-dilutive and thus these shares were not considered in determining diluted loss per 
share.
The loss for the year would have decreased if holders of the convertible bonds in Vedanta exercised their right to convert their 
bond holdings into Vedanta equity. The impact on loss for the year of this conversion would be the reduction in interest payable on 
the convertible bond.
The adjustment in respect of convertible bonds had an anti-dilutive impact on earnings and was thus not considered in determining 
diluted EPS.
EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE BASED ON UNDERLYING PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE YEAR (NON-GAAP)
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the management considers to be a useful additional measure of the 
Group’s performance. The Group’s Underlying profit/loss is the loss for the year after adding back special items, other losses/(gains) 
[net] (note 8) and their resultant tax (including taxes classified as special items) and non-controlling interest effects. This is a 
Non-GAAP measure.

The outstanding awards under the LTIP (5.0 million) are reflected in the diluted underlying earnings per share through an increased 
number of weighted average shares for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
The effect of 6.8 million potential ordinary shares, which relate to share option awards under the LTIP scheme, on the attributable 
profit/(loss) for the year ended 31 March 2016 was anti-dilutive and thus these shares were not considered in determining diluted 
underlying loss per share.
The profit for the year would be decreased if holders of the convertible bonds in Vedanta exercised their right to convert their bond 
holdings into Vedanta equity. The impact on loss for the year of this conversion would be the reduction in interest payable on the 
convertible bond.
The adjustment in respect of convertible bonds had an anti-dilutive impact on earnings and was thus not considered in determining

Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following CGU’s. The allocation of goodwill to CGU’s is as follows:
 › US$12.2 million Copper India
 › US$4.4 million arising on acquisition of Goa Energy Limited.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Company has undertaken an impairment review of goodwill of US$16.6 million as at 31 March 2017 . The carrying amount of 
goodwill allocated to the relevant cash generating unit is considered to be insignificant in comparison with the total carrying value 
of the cash generating unit. The carrying amount of goodwill was evaluated using the higher of Fair value less cost of disposal 
(‘FVLCD’) or value in use based on discounted future cash flows of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill pertains and 
comparing this to the total carrying value of the relevant cash generating units. It was determined that the carrying amount of 
goodwill is not impaired and nor was impairment indicated following a reasonably possible change in a key assumption.

IFRS 7 requires additional information regarding the methodologies employed to measure the fair value of financial instruments 
which are recognised or disclosed in the accounts. These methodologies are categorised per the standard as:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
 
The below table summarises the categories of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

1 Held for trading disclosure at 31 March 2016 has been restated to appropriately disclose the bonds valued using inputs other than quoted price as Level 2 rather than Level 1 .
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
Short-term marketable securities traded in active markets are determined by reference to quotes from the financial institutions; for 
example: Net asset value (NAV) for investments in mutual funds declared by mutual fund house. For other listed securities traded 
in markets which are not active, the quoted price is used wherever the pricing mechanism is same as for other marketable 
securities traded in active markets. Other short term marketable securities are valued on the basis of market trades, poll and 
primary issuances for securities issued by the same or similar issuer and for similar maturities or based on the applicable spread 
movement for the security derived based on the aforementioned factor(s).
Fair value of long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings have been determined by the Group based on parameters such as 
interest rates, specific country risk factors, and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Listed bonds are fair valued based 
on the prevailing market price. For all other long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings, either the carrying amount 
approximates the fair value, or fair value have been estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate 
equivalent to the risk free rate of return adjusted for the appropriate credit spread. For all other financial instruments, the carrying 
amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
The fair value of financial asset investments represents the market value of the quoted investments and other traded instruments. 
For other financials assets the carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
The fair value of financial liabilities is the market value of the traded instruments, where applicable. Otherwise fair value is 
calculated using a discounted cash flow model with market assumptions, unless the carrying value is considered to approximate 
fair value.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s businesses are subject to several risks and uncertainties including financial risks.
The Group’s documented risk management policies act as an effective tool in mitigating the various financial risks to which the 
businesses are exposed in the course of their daily operations. The risk management policies cover areas such as liquidity risk, 
commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital management (the latter covered in note 34).
Risks are identified at both the corporate and individual subsidiary level with active involvement of senior management. Each 
operating subsidiary in the Group has in place risk management processes which are in line with the Group’s policy. Each 
significant risk has a designated ‘owner’ within the Group at an appropriate senior level. The potential financial impact of the risk 
and its likelihood of a negative outcome are regularly updated. The risk management process is coordinated by the Management 
Assurance function and is regularly reviewed by the Group’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is aided by the CFO 
Committee and the Risk Management Committee, which meets regularly to review risks as well as the progress against the 
planned actions. Key business decisions are discussed at the meetings of the CFO Committee and Executive Committee. The 
overall internal control environment and risk management programme including financial risk management is reviewed by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 212
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
TREASURY MANAGEMENT
Treasury management focuses on liability management, capital protection, liquidity maintenance and yield maximisation. The 
treasury policies are approved by the Committee of the Board. Daily treasury operations of the subsidiary companies are managed 
by their respective finance teams within the framework of the overall Group treasury policies. Long-term fund raising including 
strategic treasury initiatives are handled by a central team while short-term funding for routine working capital requirements is 
delegated to subsidiary companies. A monthly reporting system exists to inform senior management of investments, debt, 
currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives. The Group has a strong system of internal control which enables effective 
monitoring of adherence to Group policies. The internal control measures are supplemented by regular internal audits.
The investment portfolio is independently reviewed by CRISIL Limited and our portfolio has been rated as “Very Good” meaning 
highest safety. The investments are made keeping in mind safety, liquidity and yield maximisation.
The Group uses derivative instruments to manage the exposure in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity 
prices. The Group does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Group does 
not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury and commodity risks. Both treasury and commodities 
derivative transactions are normally in the form of forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps and these are in line 
with the Group policies.
COMMODITY RISK
The Group is exposed to the movement of base metal commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange. Any decline in the prices 
of the base metals that the Group produces and sells will have an immediate and direct impact on the profitability of the 
businesses. As a general policy, the Group aims to sell the products at prevailing market prices. The commodity price risk in import 
of Copper Concentrate & Alumina is hedged on back-to back basis ensuring no price risk for the business. Entities with integrated 
operations aim to achieve the monthly average of the commodity prices for sales realization. Hedging is used primarily as a risk 
management tool to secure future cash flows in cases of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments. 
The hedging activities are subject to strict limits set out by the Board and to a strictly defined internal control and monitoring 
mechanism. Decisions relating to hedging of commodities are taken at the Executive Committee level and with clearly laid down 
guidelines for their implementation by the subsidiaries.
Whilst the Group aims to achieve average LME prices for a month or a year, average realised prices may not necessarily reflect the 
LME price movements due to a variety of reasons such as uneven sales during the year and timing of shipments.
The Group is also exposed to the movement of international crude oil price and the discount in the price of Rajasthan crude oil to 
Brent price.
COPPER
The Group’s custom smelting copper operations at Tuticorin is benefited by a natural hedge except to the extent of a possible 
mismatch in quotational periods between the purchase of concentrate and the sale of finished copper. The Group’s policy on 
custom smelting is to generate margins from Treatment charges/Refining charges, improving operational efficiencies, minimising 
conversion cost, generating a premium over LME on sale of finished copper, sale of by-products and from achieving import parity 
on domestic sales. Hence, mismatches in quotational periods are managed to ensure that the gains or losses are minimised. The 
Group hedges this variability of LME prices through forward contracts and tries to make the LME price a pass-through cost 
between purchases of copper concentrate and sales of finished products, both of which are linked to the LME price.
TC/RCs are a major source of income for the Indian copper smelting operations. Fluctuations in TC/RCs are influenced by factors 
including demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market for mine output. The Group’s copper business has a strategy of 
securing a majority of its concentrate feed requirement under long-term contracts with mines.
KCM is largely an integrated copper producer and whenever hedging is done it is with an intention to protect the Group from price 
fluctuations in copper. KCM also engages in hedging for its custom smelting operations in line with the Group’s policy on custom 
smelting at Tuticorin, as explained above.
ALUMINIUM
The requirement of the primary raw material, alumina, is partly met from own sources and the rest is purchased primarily on 
negotiated price terms. Sales prices are linked to the LME prices. At present the Group on selective basis hedges the aluminium 
content in imported alumina to protect its margins.
The Group also enters into hedging arrangements for its aluminium sales to realise month of sale LME prices.
ZINC AND LEAD
The sales prices are linked to the LME prices. The Group also enters into hedging arrangements for its Zinc and Lead sales to 
realise month of sale LME prices.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
IRON ORE
The Group Sells its Iron Ore production from Goa on the prevailing market prices and from Karnataka through e-auction route as 
mandated by State Government of Karnataka in India.
OIL AND GAS
The prices of various crude oils are based upon the price of the key physical benchmark crude oil such as Dated Brent, West Texas 
Intermediate, and Dubai/Oman etc. The crude oil prices move based upon market factors like supply and demand. The regional 
producers price their crude basis these benchmark crude with a premium or discount over the benchmark based upon quality 
differential and competitiveness of various grades.
Natural gas markets are evolving differently in important geographical markets. There is no single global market for natural gas. This 
could be owing to difficulties in large-scale transportation over long distances as compared to crude oil. Globally, there are three 
main regional hubs for pricing of natural gas, which are USA (Henry Hub Prices), UK (NBP Price) and Japan (imported gas price, 
mostly linked to crude oil).
PROVISIONALLY PRICED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
On 31 March 2017 , the value of net financial liabilities linked to commodities (excluding derivatives) accounted for on provisional 
prices was a liability of US$465.5 million (2016: liability of US$416.3 million). These instruments are subject to price movements at 
the time of final settlement and the final price of these instruments will be determined in the financial year beginning 1 April 2017 .
Set out below is the impact of 10% increase in LME prices on profit/(loss) for the year and total equity as a result of changes in 
value of the Group’s commodity financial instruments as at 31 March 2017:

The above sensitivities are based on volumes, costs, exchange rates and other variables and provide the estimated impact of a 
change in LME prices on profit and equity assuming that all other variables remain constant. A 10% decrease in LME prices would 
have an equal and opposite effect on the Group’s financial instruments.
Further, the impact of a 10% increase in closing copper LME for provisionally priced copper concentrate purchased at Vedanta 
Limited Copper division custom smelting operations is US$48.2 million (2016: US$50.0 million), which is pass through in nature 
and as such will not have any impact on the profitability.
FINANCIAL RISK AND SENSITIVITIES
The Group’s Board approved financial risk policies comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty risk. The Group does 
not engage in speculative treasury activity but seeks to manage risk and optimise interest and commodity pricing through proven 
financial instruments.
(A) LIQUIDITY
The Group requires funds both for short-term operational needs as well as for long-term investment programmes mainly in growth 
projects. The Group generates sufficient cash flows from the current operations which together with the available cash and cash 
equivalents and liquid financial asset investments provide liquidity both in the short term as well as in the long term. Anticipated 
future cash flows, together with undrawn fund based committed facilities of US$911 .0 million, and cash and liquid investments of 
US$9,725.2 million as at 31 March 2017 , are expected to be sufficient to meet the liquidity requirement of the Group in the near 
future.
The Group’s current corporate family ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are B+/Stable Outlook (B/Stable as on March 31, 
2016) and B1/Stable Outlook (B2/Negative as on March 31, 2016), respectively. The rating upgrades during the year reflect the 
Group’s improving financial and operating performance and improving commodity prices. The Group strives to maintain a healthy 
liquidity, gearing ratio and retains flexibility in the financing structure (Refer note 34).

(B) FOREIGN CURRENCY
The Group’s presentation currency is the US dollar. The majority of the assets are located in India and the Indian Rupee is the 
functional currency for the Indian operating subsidiaries except for Oil and Gas business where the functional currency is US 
Dollar. Exposures on foreign currency loans are managed through the foreign exchange hedging policy, which is reviewed 
periodically to ensure that the risk from fluctuating currency exchange rates is appropriately managed. Natural hedges available in 
the business are identified at each entity level and hedges are placed only for the net exposure. Short-term net exposures are 
hedged progressively based on their maturity. Longer exposures beyond one year for trade and other current account transactions 
are reviewed and hedges taken accordingly. However, all new exposures on account of long term borrowing are being hedged.
The carrying amount of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities in different currencies are as follows:

The sensitivities are based on financial assets and liabilities held at 31 March 2017 where balances are not denominated in the 
functional currency of the respective subsidiaries. The sensitivities do not take into account the Group’s sales and costs and the 
results of the sensitivities could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a 
result of non-foreign exchange influenced factors. A 10% depreciation of the US$ would have an equal and opposite effect on the 
Group’s financial instruments.
(C) INTEREST RATE RISK
At 31 March 2017 , the Group’s net debt of US$8,503.5 million (2016: US$7 ,328.8 million net debt) comprises cash, cash equivalents 
and liquid investments of US$9,725.2 million (2016: US$8,936.5 million) offset by debt of US$18,228.7 million (2016: US$16,263.3 
million) and debt derivative liability of Nil (2016 : US $ 2.0 million).
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term floating rate instruments and on the refinancing of fixed rate 
debt. The Group’s policy is to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate borrowings and the proportion of fixed and floating 
rate debt is determined by current market interest rates. As at 31 March 2017 , 55% (2016: 48.0%) of the total debt was at a fixed rate 
and the balance was at a floating rate. The USD floating rate debt is linked to US dollar LIBOR and INR Floating rate debt to Bank’s 
base rate. The Group also aims to opt for a higher proportion of long-term debt to fund growth projects to extend its maturity profile. 
The Group invests cash and liquid investments in short-term deposits and debt mutual funds, some of which generate a tax-free 
return, to achieve the Group’s goal of maintaining liquidity, carrying manageable risk and achieving satisfactory returns.
29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 216
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
Floating rate financial assets are largely mutual fund investments which have debt securities as underlying assets. The returns 
from these financial assets are linked to market interest rate movements; however the counterparty invests in the agreed 
securities with known maturity tenure and return and hence has manageable risk. Additionally, the investments portfolio is 
independently reviewed by CRISIL Limited, and our investment portfolio has been rated as “Very Good” meaning highest safety.
The exposure of the Group’s financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows:

Total financial liabilities 8,253.5 11,896.7 3.329.3 8,454.3 9,294.2 3,505.3
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate financial liabilities is 7 .5% (2016: 8.2%) and the weighted average period for 
which the rate is fixed is 2.4 years (2016: 2.4 years).
Considering the net debt position as at 31 March 2017 and the investment in bank deposits, corporate bonds and debt mutual 
funds, any increase in interest rates would result in a net loss and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net gain. The 
sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date.
The below table illustrates the impact of a 0.5% to 2.0% change in interest rate of floating rate borrowings on profit/(loss) and 
equity and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

(D) CREDIT RISK
The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and other financial 
instruments.
The Group has clearly defined policies to mitigate counterparty risks. Cash and liquid investments are held primarily in debt 
schemes of mutual funds, Bonds and bank deposits with good credit ratings. Defined limits are in place for exposure to individual 
counterparties in case of mutual fund houses and banks.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The large majority of receivables due from third parties are secured. Moreover, given the diverse nature of the Group’s businesses 
trade receivables are spread over a number of customers with no significant concentration of credit risk. During the year ended 
31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net sales or for any of the 
Group’s primary businesses. The history of trade receivables shows a negligible provision for bad and doubtful debts. Therefore, 
the Group does not expect any material risk on account of non-performance by any of our counterparties.
The Group’s maximum gross exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2017 is US $ 10,589.3 million (2016: US$$9,886.0 million).
Of the year end trade and other receivable balance the following, though overdue, are expected to be realised in the normal course 
of business and hence, are not considered impaired as at 31 March 2017:

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of all derivatives is separately recorded on the balance sheet within other financial assets (derivatives) and other 
financial liabilities (derivatives), current and non-current. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current or 
non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other contracts are treated as separate derivative contracts, when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts.
CASH FLOW HEDGES
The Group also enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and 
accounts for them as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity 
until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the income statement.
The fair value of the Group’s open derivative positions at 31 March 2017 , recorded within financial instruments (derivative) is as follows:

The majority of cash flow hedges taken out by the Group during the year comprises commodity contracts and foreign currency 
forward contracts for firm future commitments.
The cash flows related to the majority of cash flow hedges above are expected to occur during the year ended 31 March 2018 and 
consequently may impact the income statements for that year depending upon the change in the commodity prices and foreign 
exchange rate movements.

NON-QUALIFYING HEDGES
The majority of these derivatives comprise foreign currency forward contracts which are economic hedges but which do not fulfil 
the requirements for hedge accounting of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

RESTORATION, REHABILITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL
The provisions for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental liabilities represent the Management’s best estimate of the costs 
which will be incurred in the future to meet the Group’s obligations under existing Indian, Australian, Zambian, Namibian, South 
African and Irish law and the terms of the Group’s mining and other licences and contractual arrangements. These amounts, 
calculated by considering discount rates within the range of 2% to 13%, become payable on closure of mines and are expected to 
be incurred over a period of one to thirty years. Within India, the principal restoration and rehabilitation provisions are recorded 
within Cairn India where a legal obligation exists relating to the oil and gas fields, where costs are expected to be incurred in 
restoring the site of production facilities at the end of the producing life of an oil field. The Group recognises the full cost of site 
restoration as a liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production from a producing field.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In the current period, the Group identified an adjustment to the discount rate applied to the decommissioning liability in relation to 
a prior year in the Group’s Oil and Gas segment. The discount rate has been revised from 8% to 3.5% p.a. to reflect the risk free 
rate of return of the currency in which the majority of the expenses are likely to be incurred. The consequential increase in 
decommissioning provision and property, plant and equipment of US$125.0 million, which the Group believes is not material when 
comparing to the overall net assets, has been recognised in the current period.
KCM COPPER PRICE PARTICIPATION
During the year 31 March 2013, the Group and ZCCM-IH agreed a final settlement for the copper price participation liability. 
Pursuant to this agreement KCM had paid US$6.0 million during the first quarter of current year and subsequently KCM and 
ZCCM-IH had agreed to amend the scheduled dates of payment in respect of price participation through a Consent order as 
recorded in the English Court. Pursuant to the terms of the order, KCM agreed to an amended schedule of payment with  
ZCCM-IH as US$20 million by 31 January 2017 , US$22 million by 28 February 2017 and US$2.55 million at the end of every month 
(commencing 31 March 2017) for next 24 months until the judgment sum is paid in full. Consequent to the removal of uncertainty 
with respect to timing and amount, US$96.3 million has been reclassified to trade payables during the current year.
OTHER
Other includes provision on post- retirement medical benefits. The expected Y ear of utilisation is 18 years.
31. NON-CURRENT TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX (ASSETS)/LIABILITIES
Non-current tax assets of US $ 434.6 million (2016 : 361 .7 million) mainly represents income tax receivable from Indian tax 
authorities by Vedanta Limited relating to refund arising consequent to the Scheme of Amalgamation & Arrangement made 
effective in August 2013 pursuant to approval by the jurisdiction High Court and receivables relating to matters in tax disputes in 
Group companies including tax holiday claim.
The Group has accrued significant amounts of deferred tax. The majority of the deferred tax liability represents accelerated tax 
relief for the depreciation of capital expenditure and the depreciation on fair value uplifts created on acquisitions, net of losses 
carried forward by Vedanta Limited (post the re-organisation) and MAT credits carried forward in Vedanta Limited, Cairn and 
Hindustan Zinc.

32. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of ‘at risk’ remuneration for 
Executive Directors. Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing in 2003. In 2014, the Board 
introduced a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) which is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to 
the Executive Directors and the wider management group. In 2015, the Board also introduced a Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
(DSBP). In 2016, Vedanta Limited (subsidiary of Vedanta Resources plc) introduced an Employee Stock Option Scheme 2016 
(“ESOS”), which was approved by the Vedanta Limited shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
THE VEDANTA RESOURCES LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE ‘LTIP’) AND EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN (THE ‘ESOP’)  
AND PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (THE ‘PSP’)
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 150% of annual salary. In 
respect of Mr. Navin Agarwal and Mr Tom Albanese, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their cost 
to company (CTC) payable by Vedanta Limited. The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the wider 
management group is calculated by reference to the grade average CTC and individual grade of the employee. The performance 
conditions attaching to outstanding awards are as follows:
PSP - Dependent on the level of employee, part of these awards will be subject to a continued service condition only with the 
remainder measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) (being the movement in a company’s share price plus reinvested 
dividends), is compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the 
grant date. The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against a group or groups of peer 
companies at the end of the performance period and as moderated by the Remuneration Committee. The vesting schedule is 
shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest 
whole share. 
VEDANTA’S TSR PERFORMANCE AGAINST COMPARATOR GROUP
(% of award 
vesting)
Below median –
At median 30
At or above upper quintile 100
The performance condition is measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the three months immediately preceding the date of 
grant and over the three months immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with 
that of the comparator group or groups. The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee (‘the Committee’) is provided by the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this performance condition, 
which requires that the Company’s total return has out-performed a group of industry peers, provides a reasonable alignment of 
the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.
Initial awards under the PSP were granted on 17 November 2014, 1 January 2015 and subsequently on 30 December 2015 and 
12 May 2016. All these plans were equity settled. The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance 
period is three years, with no re-testing being allowed. On 2 March 2017 the Company also launched a cash based plan under the 
same scheme.
ESOP – measured in terms of business performance set against business plan for the financial year comprising operational 
deliverables, enabler parameters and sustainability performance specific to each company. The vesting schedule is graded over 
three years and varies from company to company with a minimum vesting of 30% triggering at either 80% or 85% business 
score. In another tranche, the vesting schedule is staggered over a period of three years from the date of grant, with 70% vesting 
based on the achievement of business performance and the remaining 30% based on continued employment with the Group until 
the end of the third year.
Initial awards under ESOP were granted on 24 September 2012 with further awards being made on 16 May 2013. The exercise 
price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance period is one year.
The exercise period is six months from the date of vesting.
LTIP – measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) (being the movement in a company’s share price plus reinvested 
dividends), is compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the 
grant date. The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against a group of peer companies 
(“ Adapted Comparator Group”) at the end of the performance period and as moderated by the Remuneration Committee. The 
vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounded down 
to the nearest whole share.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
The performance condition is measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of 
grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with  
that of the comparator group described above. The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the 
Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) is provided by the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this 
performance condition, which requires that the Company’s total return has out-performed a group or groups of industries peers, 
provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the 
shareholders.
Initial awards under the LTIP were granted on 26 February 2004. As on 31 March 2016 the awards outstanding are the awards 
issued on 1 August 2011, 1 October 2011, 1 January 2012 and 1 April 2012. During the year, the Company further issued awards 
under the LTIP scheme on 11 November 2016. The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance 
period is three years, with no re-testing being allowed.
The Vedanta Resources Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the DSBP) - In 2015, Vedanta introduced the DSBP , with initial awards 
being made in May 2015 & August 2015. Further in 2016, fresh awards were granted in May 2016 and September 2016. Under the 
plan, a portion of the annual bonus is deferred into shares and the awards granted under this scheme are not subject to any 
performance conditions, but only to service conditions being met. The vesting schedule is staggered over a period of one to three 
years. In case of DSBP , the shares are purchased from open market and allotted to employees, officers and directors. As on 
31 March 2017 , the options outstanding under the DSBP scheme are 417 ,446.
In general, the awards will be settled in equity. The awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to 
equity settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the average of the 
middle market quotations of its share price for 5 dealing days before the grant date.
Further details on these schemes are available in the Remuneration Report of the Annual Report.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In the year ended 31 March 2017 , 984,481 (Y ear ended 31 March 2016: 1,038,867) options lapsed in total and 780,451 (Y ear ended 
31 March 2016: 7 40,194) options exercised. As at 31 March 2017 , 10,384,516 options remained outstanding and nil options were 
exercisable at the year end. The Weighted average share price for the share options exercised during the year ended 31 March 
2017 was GBP 4.82 (Y ear ended 31 March 2016: GBP 4.1). The weighted average maturity period for the options outstanding as on 
31 March 2017 is 23 months (31 March 2016: 31 months).
Most of the share-based awards of the Group are equity-settled as defined by IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” . The fair value of 
these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance 
conditions. This fair value, adjusted by the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of 
non-market conditions, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Where an award is cash-settled the fair value is 
recalculated at each reporting date until the liability is settled.
The fair values were calculated using the Stochastic valuation model with suitable modifications to allow for the specific 
performance conditions of the respective schemes. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, 
expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility has been calculated 
using historical return indices over the period to date of grant that is commensurate with the performance period of the award. The 
volatilities of the industry peers have been modelled based on historical movements in the return indices over the period to date of 
grant which is also commensurate with the performance period for the option. The history of return indices is used to determine 
the volatility and correlation of share prices for the comparator companies and is needed for the Stochastic valuation model to 
estimate their future TSR performance relative to the Company’s TSR performance. All options are assumed to be exercised 
immediately after vesting.
The assumptions used in the calculations of the charge in respect of the PSP/LTIP awards granted during the year ended 31 March 
2017 and 31 March 2016 are set out below:

THE VEDANTA LIMITED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME (ESOS) 2016
During the year 2016, Vedanta Limited (subsidiary of Vedanta Resources plc) introduced an Employee Stock Option Scheme 2016 
(“ESOS”), which was approved by the Vedanta Limited shareholders. The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally 
awarded to an Executive Committee in a year is 125% of annual salary. The maximum value of options that can be awarded to 
members of the wider management group is calculated by reference to the grade average CTC and individual grade of the 
employee. The performance conditions attached to the award is measured by comparing company’s performance in terms of TSR 
over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme. The extent to which an award 
vests will depend on the Vedanta Limited’s TSR rank against a group or groups of peer companies at the end of the performance 
period and as moderated by the Remuneration Committee. Dependent on the level of employee, part of these awards will be 
subject to a continued service condition only with the remainder measured in terms of TSR. The vesting schedule is shown in the 
table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.

VEDANTA’S TSR PERFORMANCE AGAINST COMPARATOR GROUP
(% of award

Below median –
At median 30
At or above upper decile 100
The performance condition is measured by taking Vedanta Limited’s TSR at the start and end of the performance period (without 
averaging), and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group or groups. The information to enable this calculation 
to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is provided by the Company’s advisers. The 
Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Vedanta Limited’s total return has outperformed a 
group of industry peers, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of participants with those of the shareholders.
Initial awards under the ESOS were granted on 15 December 2016. The exercise price of the awards is 1 INR per share and the 
performance period is three years, with no re-testing being allowed.

result of non-market conditions, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
The fair values were calculated using the Stochastic valuation model with suitable modifications to allow for the specific

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
33. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia, Africa and Ireland.
(A) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
INDIAN PENSION SCHEMES
Central Recognised Provident Fund
The Central Recognised Provident Fund relates to all full-time Indian employees of the Group. The amount contributed by the 
Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund (see below), 
together with an additional contribution of 12% (limited to a maximum contribution of 30% in case of Iron Ore Segment) of the 
salary of the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation
Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to executives in grade M4 and above. However, in 
case of the Cairn India Group and Iron Ore Segment, the benefit is applicable to all executives. In Cairn India, it is applicable from 
the second year of employment. Certain companies hold policies with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (“LIC”), to which 
they contribute a fixed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into 
consideration the contributions made. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and 
contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Pension Fund
The Pension Fund was established in 1995 and is managed by the Government of India. The employee makes no contribution to 
this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month subject to a specified ceiling per employee. This 
must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of 
contributions through the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level. The 
Government funds these payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of 
whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
AUSTRALIAN PENSION SCHEME
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia. The contribution of a proportion of an employee’s 
salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia. The employer contributes 9.5% of the employee’s 
gross remuneration where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12.5% of the basic remuneration for all other 
employees, into the employee’s fund of choice. All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
ZAMBIAN PENSION SCHEME
The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full-time permanent employees of KCM (subject to the fulfilment of certain eligibility 
criteria). The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the 
members. The employer makes a monthly contribution of 5% to the KCM Pension Scheme and the member makes monthly 
contribution of 5%.
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal 
retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable 
of performing duties in the service of the employer. Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or 
being rendered medically incapable of performing duties, or early voluntary retirement, the member is entitled to receive his 
accrued pension. The member is allowed to commute his/her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a 
defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
SKORPION ZINC PROVIDENT FUND, NAMIBIA
The Skorpion Zinc Provident Fund is a defined contribution fund and is compulsory to all full time employees under the age of 60. 
Company contribution to the fund is a fixed percentage of 9% per month of pensionable salary, whilst the employee contributes 
7% with the option of making additional contributions, over and above the normal contribution, up to a maximum of 12%.
Normal retirement age is 60 years and benefit payable is the member’s fund credit which is equal to all employer and employee 
contributions plus interest. The same applies when an employee resigns from Skorpion Zinc. The Fund provides disability cover 
which is equal to the member’s fund credit and a death cover of 2 times annual salary in the event of death before retirement. 
Current membership total is 908.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a 
defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement. 226
Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
BLACK MOUNTAIN (PTY) LIMITED, SOUTH AFRICA PENSION & PROVIDENT FUNDS
Black Mountain Mining (Pty) Ltd has two retirement funds, both administered by Alexander Forbes, a registered financial service 
provider. Both funds form part of the Alexander Forbes umbrella fund and are defined contribution funds.
Membership of both funds is compulsory for all permanent employees under the age of 60.
LISHEEN MINE, IRELAND PENSION FUNDS
Lisheen Pension Plan is for all employees. Lisheen pays 5% and employees pays 5% with the option to make Additional Voluntary 
Contributions (‘ AVC’s’) if desired. Executive contributions are 15% by Lisheen and a minimum of 5% by the employee with the 
option to make AVC’s if desired. Death benefit is three times salary for employees and four times salary for executives. Pension 
and Life Cover ceases at 65. On wind up of the pension schemes, the benefits will be paid out to the remaining members in 
accordance with the scheme rules and Irish Revenue tax regulations.

of 19 years.
Assumptions regarding mortality for Indian entities are based on mortality table of ‘Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2006-2008)’ 
published by the Institute of Actuaries of India.
Assumptions regarding mortality for KCM are based on World Health Organisation Life Tables for 1999 applicable to Zambia which 
has been taken as a reference point. Based on this a mortality table which is appropriate for the workers of Konkola Copper Mines 
plc has been derived.

The above sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in 
assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
(L) RISK ANALYSIS
Group is exposed to a number of risks in the defined benefit plans. Most significant risks pertaining to defined benefits plans and 
management estimation of the impact of these risks are as follows:
INVESTMENT RISK
The most of the Indian defined benefit plans are funded with Life Insurance Corporation of India. Group does not have any liberty 
to manage the fund provided to Life Insurance Corporation of India.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to Government of 
India bonds for Group’s Indian operations. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
INTEREST RISK
A decrease in the interest rate on plan assets will increase the plan liability.
LONGEVITY RISK/LIFE EXPECTANCY
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan 
participants both during and at the end of the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase 
the plan liability.
SALARY GROWTH RISK
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. An 
increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liability.
34. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard continuity, maintain a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios 
in order to support its business and provide adequate return to shareholders through continuing growth.
The Group sets the amount of capital required on the basis of annual business and long-term operating plans which include capital 
and other strategic investments. The funding requirement is met through a mixture of equity, internal accruals, convertible bonds 
and other long-term and short-term borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt as a percentage of total capital.

38. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
CAIRN PSC GUARANTEE TO GOVERNMENT
The Group has provided Parent company guarantee for the Cairn India Group’s obligation under the Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’).
Cairn India have provided various other guarantees under the Cairn India Group’s bank facilities for the Cairn India Group’s share of 
minimum work programme commitments of US$19.9 million outstanding as of 31 March 2017 (2016: US$13.1 million).
EXPORT OBLIGATIONS
The Indian entities of the Group have export obligations of US$2,016.7 million (2016: US$2,200.5 million) on account of 
concessional rates of import duty paid on capital goods under the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme and under the Advance 
Licence Scheme for import of raw material laid down by the Government of India.
In the event of the Group’s inability to meet its obligations, the Group’s liability would be US$261 .7 million (2016: US$349.1 million), 
reduced in proportion to actual exports, plus applicable interest.
CONTINGENCIES
The Group discloses the following legal and tax cases as contingent liabilities.
HZL: DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND GEOLOGY
The Department of Mines and Geology of the State of Rajasthan issued several show cause notices in August, September and 
October 2006 to HZL, totalling US$51 .5 million. These notices alleged unlawful occupation and unauthorised mining of associated 
minerals other than zinc and lead at HZL ’s Rampura Agucha, Rajpura Dariba and Zawar mines in Rajasthan during the period from 
July 1968 to March 2006. 
HZL believes it is unlikely the claim will lead to a future obligation to the company and therefore no provision has been made in the 
financial statements. HZL has filed appeals (writ petitions) in the High Court of Rajasthan in Jodhpur and has obtained a stay in 
respect of these demands.
RICHTER AND WESTGLOBE : INCOME TAX
The Group through its subsidiaries Richter Holdings Limited and Westglobe Limited in 2007 acquired the entire stake in Finsider 
International Company Limited (FICL) based in the United Kingdom which was holding 51 percent shares of Sesa Goa Ltd, an 
Indian Company. In October 2013, the Indian Tax Authorities (Tax Authorities) have served an order on Richter and Westglobe for 
alleged failure to deduct withholding tax on capital gain on the indirect acquisition of shares in April 2007 . 
The Tax Authorities determined the liability for such non-deduction of tax as US$135.0 million in the case of Richter and US$90.0 
million in the case of Westglobe, comprising tax and interest. Richter and Westglobe filed appeals before the first appellate 
authority. Appeals (writ petitions) were filed in the High Court of Karnataka challenging the constitutional validity of retrospective 
amendments made by the Finance Act 2012 and in particular the imposition of obligations to deduct tax on payments made 
against an already concluded transaction. The Karnataka High Court passed interim orders and directed that the adjudication of 
liability (TDS quantum and interest) shall no more remain in force since tax department passed the orders on merits travelling 
beyond the limited issue of jurisdiction. The high court will hear on jurisdiction issue. The next hearing date is awaited.
CAIRN INDIA: INCOME TAX
In March 2014, Cairn India received a show cause notice from the Indian Tax Authorities (“Tax Authorities”) for not deducting 
withholding tax on the payments made to Cairn UK Holdings Limited (“CUHL ”) UK, for acquiring shares of Cairn India Holdings 
Limited (“CIHL ”), as part of their internal reorganisation. Tax Authorities have stated in the notice that a short-term capital gain has 
accrued to CUHL on transfer of the shares of CIHL to Cairn India, in financial year 2006-2007 , on which tax should have been 
withheld by the Company. Pursuant to this various replies were filed with the tax authorities. 
After hearings, the Income Tax Authority, during March 2015, have issued an order by holding Cairn India as ‘assessee in default’ 
and asked to pay such demand totalling US$3,161 million (including interest of US$1,581 million). Cairn India has filed its appeal 
before the Appellate Authority CIT (Appeals) and filed a fresh Appeal (Writ petition) before Delhi High Court wherein it raised 
several points for assailing the aforementioned order. The hearing of the Appeal is due on 17 August 2017 .
The Company has issued a Notice of arbitration to Government of India by invoking Bilateral Investment Promotion Treaty between 
the UK and India.
VEDANTA LIMITED: CONTRACTOR CLAIM
Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Co. Limited (‘SSNP’) subsequent to terminating the EPC contract invoked 
arbitration as per the contract alleging non-payment of their dues towards construction of a 210 MW co-generation power plant for 
6 MTPA expansion project, and filed a claim of US$243.7 million. SSNP also filed a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Bombay High Court praying for interim relief. The Bombay High Court initially dismissed their 
petition, but on a further appeal by SSNP , the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court directed Jharsuguda Aluminium to deposit 
a bank guarantee for an amount of US$27 .6 million as a security, being a prima facie representation of the claim, until arbitration

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
proceedings are completed. Jharsuguda Aluminium has deposited a bank guarantee of equivalent amount. Management is of the 
opinion that this claim is not valid under the terms of the contract with SSNP and it is unlikely that SSNP can legally sustain the 
claim and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary. The arbitration proceedings have concluded and the Tribunal may hold 
a clarificatory hearing before passing the final award.
RAVVA JOINT VENTURE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS: ONGC CARRY
Cairn is involved in a dispute against GOI relating to the recovery of contractual costs in terms of calculation of payments that 
contractor party were required to make in connection with the Ravva field. 
The Ravva production sharing contract obliges the contractor party to pay proportionate share of ONGC’s exploration, 
development, production and contract costs in consideration for ONGC’s payment of costs related to construction and other 
activities it conducted in Ravva prior to the effective date of the Ravva production sharing contract (the ‘‘ONGC Carry’’). The 
question as to how the ONGC Carry is to be recovered and calculated, along with other issues, was submitted to an international 
arbitration Tribunal in August 2002 which rendered a decision on the ONGC Carry in favor of the contractor party whereas four 
other issues were decided in favor of GOI in October 2004 (“Partial Award”). 
The GOI then proceeded to challenge the ONGC Carry decision before the Malaysian courts, as Kuala Lumpur was the seat of the 
arbitration. The Federal Court of Malaysia which adjudicated the matter on October 11, 2011, upheld the partial award. Per the 
decision of the Arbitral Tribunal in the partial award, the contractor party and GOI were required to arrive at a quantification of the 
sums relatable to each of the issues under the Partial Award. Also, the arbitral Tribunal retained the jurisdiction for determination of 
any remaining issues in the matter. 
Pursuant to the decision of the Federal Court, the contractor party approached the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
(“MoPNG”) to implement the partial award while reconciling the statement of accounts as outlined in partial award in 2004. GOI 
failed to implement the partial award by way of reconciling accounts as provided in the partial award ever since the Federal Court 
of Malaysia adjudicated in Cairn and other joint operator partners’ favor. 
However, the MoPNG on July 10, 2014 proceeded to issue a show cause notice alleging that since the partial award has not been 
enforced profit petroleum share of GOI has been short-paid. MoPNG threatened to recover that amount from the sale proceeds 
payable by the oil marketing companies to the contractor party. The contractor party replied to the show cause notice taking 
various legal contentions. On March 9, 2015 personal hearing took place between MoPNG and contractor party whereby, the 
contractor party expressed their concerns against such alleged unilateral recoveries and filed further written submissions on March 
12, 2015. 
As partial award did not quantify the sums, therefore, contractor party approached the same arbitral Tribunal to pass a final award in 
the subject matter since it had retained the jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitral Tribunal was reconstituted and the final award has 
been passed in Cairn’s favour. While the Cairn does not believe the GOI will be successful in its challenge, if the arbitral award is 
reversed and such reversal is binding, Cairn could be liable for approximately US$116.7 million including interest thereon. Cairn has 
secured a final award in its favour in October, 2016. Parallely, GOI has challenged the final award in the Malaysian courts.
PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE IMPOSITION OF ENTRY TAX 
Vedanta Limited and other group companies i.e. Balco, HZL and Cairn (now merged with Vedanta Limited) challenged the 
constitutional validity of the local statutes and related notifications in the states of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Rajasthan pertaining to 
the levy of entry tax on the entry of goods brought into the states from outside. Post some contradictory orders of High Courts 
across India adjudicating on similar challenges, the Supreme Court referred the matters to a nine judge bench. Post a detailed 
hearing, although the bench rejected the compensatory nature of tax as a ground of challenge, it maintained status quo with 
respect to all other issues which have been left open for adjudication by regular benches hearing the matters. The total claims from 
Vedanta Limited and its subsidiaries is US$165.0 million (2016: US$151 .3 million). 
Post the order of the nine judge bench, the regular bench of the Supreme Court proceeded with hearing the matters. The regular 
bench remanded the entry tax matters relating to the issue of discrimination against domestic goods from other States to the 
respective High Courts for final determination but retained the issue of jurisdiction on levy on imported goods, for determination by 
Supreme Court.
The argument pertaining to imported goods are currently pending before a regular bench of the Supreme Court. The issue of 
discrimination has been remanded back to the High Courts for final adjudication. Vedanta has filed an Appeal (Writ petition) before 
the Odisha High Court and is also looking to Appeals (Writ petitions) before the Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh High Courts.
Whereas, the issue pertaining to levy of entry tax on movement of goods into a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) remains pending 
before the Odisha High Court. We have challenged the levy of entry tax on any movement of goods into an SEZ basis the 
definition of local area under the Odisha Entry Tax Act which is very clear and does not include an SEZ. In addition, the Govt of 
Odisha further through its SEZ Policy 2015 and the operational guidelines for administration of this policy dated 22.08.2016, 
exempted entry tax levy on SEZ operations.

TSPL: PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO CLAIM FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
TSPL has entered into a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for 
supply of power. Due to delay in fulfilment of certain obligations by PSPCL as per the PPA, other related reasons and force 
majeure events, there has been a delay in implementation/completion of the project as compared to the PPA timelines. TSPL has 
received notices of claims from PSPCL seeking payment of Liquidated Damages (LD) maximum of US$50.9 million each for delay 
in commissioning of Unit I, II and III totalling to US$147 .0 million.
PSPCL invoked the Performance Bank Guarantee of US$24.1 million to recover the LD on account of delay in COD of 1st Unit. TSPL 
filed a petition at Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) for adjudication of above dispute. TSPL had also filed an 
Appeal (Civil Writ petition) before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana against the bank guarantee invocation, which was disposed 
with a direction to refer the matter to PSERC for adjudication while granting stay. Further, the PSERC order dated October 22, 2014 
directed the matter to be settled through arbitration and allowed the stay on encashment of the bank guarantee until further orders. 
PSPCL has preferred an appeal in Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) against the PSERC order and APTEL had on May 12, 
2015, disposed the matter with a direction that the matter will be heard by way of arbitration. The arbitration proceedings have 
concluded and the order has been reserved. The Group has been legally advised by its advisors who have opined that such claims 
for LD from PSPCL are unsustainable. Recently, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity has, in a separate petition, before it by TSPL has 
adjudicated that coal is an absolute obligation of PSPCL and it needs to enter into a Fuel Supply Agreement and assign to TSPL. In 
light of the delay by PSPCL in entering into the Fuel Supply Agreement, the claims of PSPCL are further unsustainable. 
BALCO: CHALLENGE AGAINST IMPOSITION OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT CESS
Balco challenged the imposition of Energy Development Cess levied on generators and distributors of electrical energy @ 10 paise 
per unit on the electrical energy sold or supplied before the High Court on the grounds that the Cess is effectively on production 
and not on consumption or sale since the figures of consumption are not taken into account and the Cess is discriminatory since 
CPPs are required to pay @ 10 paise while the State Electricity Board is required to pay @ 5 paise. The High Court of Chhattisgarh 
by order dated December 15, 2006 declared the provisions imposing ED Cess on CPPs as discriminatory and therefore ultra vires 
the Constitution. The Company has sought refund of ED Cess paid till March 2006 amounting to US$5.3 mn.
The State of Chhattisgarh moved an SLP in the Supreme Court and whilst issuing notice has stayed the refund of the Cess already 
deposited. The matter is to be heard by a larger bench of the Supreme Court and will be listed in due course for final hearing. In 
case the Supreme Court overturns the decision of the High Court, Balco would be liable to pay an amount of US$88.8 mn.
MISCELLANEOUS DISPUTES – VEDANTA LIMITED, HZL, MEL, BALCO, CAIRN, LISHEEN, VRJL AND VRJII
The Group is subject to various claims and exposures which arise in the ordinary course of conducting and financing its business 
from the income tax, excise, indirect tax authorities and others. These claims and exposures mostly relate to the assessable values 
of sales and purchases or to incomplete documentation supporting the companies’ returns or other claims.
The approximate value of claims against the Group companies excluding claims shown above total US$1,738.4 million (2016: 
US$1,182.3 million), of which US$148.7 million (2016: US$14.9 million) is included as a provision in the Balance Sheet as at 
31 March 2017 (including claims of US$989.6 million in respect of Income tax assessments out of which US$23.3 million is 
included as a provision in the Balance sheet as at 31 March 2017).
The Group considers that it can take steps such that the risks can be mitigated and that there are no significant unprovided 
liabilities arising.

40. SHARE TRANSACTIONS CALL OPTIONS 
A. HZL
Pursuant to the Government of India’s policy of disinvestment, the Company in April 2002 acquired 26% equity interest in 
Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) from the Government of India. Under the terms of the Shareholder’s Agreement (‘SHA ’), the 
Company had two call options to purchase all of the Government of India’s shares in HZL at fair market value. The Company 
exercised the first call option on August 29, 2003 and acquired an additional 18.9% of HZL ’s issued share capital. The Company 
also acquired an additional 20% of the equity capital in HZL through an open offer, increasing its shareholding to 64.9%. The 
second call option provided the Company the right to acquire the Government of India’s remaining 29.5% share in HZL. This call 
option was subject to the right of the Government of India to sell 3.5% of HZL shares to HZL employees. The Company exercised 
the second call option on July 21, 2009. The Government of India disputed the validity of the call option and refused to act upon 
the second call option. Consequently the Company invoked arbitration which is in the early stages. The next date of hearing is 
scheduled for July 15, 2017 . Meanwhile, the Government of India without prejudice to the position on the Put/Call option issue has 
received approval from the Cabinet for disinvestment and the Government is looking to divest through the auction route.
B. BALCO
Pursuant to the Government of India’s policy of divestment, the Company in March 2001 acquired 51% equity interest in BALCO 
from the Government of India. Under the terms of the SHA, the Company had a call option to purchase the Government of India’s 
remaining ownership interest in BALCO at any point from March 2, 2004. The Company exercised this option on March 19, 2004. 
However, the Government of India contested the valuation and validity of the option and contended that the clauses of the SHA 
violate the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 by restricting the rights of the Government of India to transfer its shares and that as a 
result such provisions of the SHA were null and void. In the arbitration filed by the Company, the arbitral tribunal by a majority 
award rejected the claims of the Company on the ground that the clauses relating to the call option, the right of first refusal, the 
“tag-along” rights and the restriction on the transfer of shares violate the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 and are not enforceable. 
The Company has challenged the validity of the majority award in the High Court of Delhi and sought for setting aside the 
arbitration award to the extent that it holds these clauses ineffective and inoperative. The Government of India also filed an 
application before the High Court of Delhi to partially set aside the arbitral award in respect of certain matters involving valuation. 
The matter is currently scheduled for hearing by the Delhi High Court on July 10, 2017 . Meanwhile, the Government of India 
without prejudice to its position on the Put/Call option issue has received approval from the Cabinet for divestment and the 
Government is looking to divest through the auction route.
On January 9, 2012, the Company offered to acquire the Government of India’s interests in HZL and BALCO for the INR equivalent 
of US$2,389.3 million and US$27 4.8 million respectively. This offer was separate from the contested exercise of the call options, 
and Company proposed to withdraw the ongoing litigations in relation to the contested exercise of the options should the offer be 
accepted. To date, the offer has not been accepted by the Government of India and therefore, there is no certainty that the 
acquisition will proceed.
The Group continues to include the shareholding in the two companies HZL and BALCO, in respect of which the Group has a call 
option as non-controlling interest.
41. KONKOLA COPPER MINES: VALUE ADDED TAX
As of March 31, 2017 , backlog Value Added Tax (falling under older VAT rule 18 regime) on inputs amounting to US$71 Million 
(previous year US$114 million) for ten month’s period between October 2013 to December 2014 was pending to be recovered from 
the Zambian Government. During FY 17 , KCM has received US$56 million out of the backlog VAT receivables post the favourable 
decision in the matter of Output VAT demand of US$600 million.
Following the amendment to VAT (General) (Amendment) No.2, Rules 2015, in February 2015, a notification was issued that 
exporting organizations will only be required to provide either copies of import documents for the goods, bearing a certificate of 
importation into the country of destination provided by the country of destination or copies of transit documents for the goods 
bearing a certificate of transit provided by the customs authority of the country of transit. KCM is in full compliance with the old 
VAT rule 18 & the amended rule and all the earlier audits were concluded to the satisfaction of ZRA. 
The company believes that it will receive a refund of the entire amount and there is no objective evidence of uncertainty around 
collectability post set aside of assessment demand by ZRA and satisfactory VAT audits under old VAT regime. Accordingly, the 
company has not recognized any provision against the carrying amount of this receivable.

Vedanta Resources plc | Annual Report FY2017
42. GROUP RESTRUCTURING
Consequent to the receipt of all substantive approvals for merger of Cairn India Limited with Vedanta Limited on 27 March 2017 , 
the merger has been accounted for in the current financial year ending 31 March 2017 . As per the terms of the scheme, upon the 
merger becoming effective, non-controlling i.e. public shareholders of Cairn India Limited received, one equity share in Vedanta 
Limited of face value Re 1 each (US$0.0) and four 7 .5% Redeemable Preference Shares in Vedanta Limited with a face value of 
INR10 each (US$0.2) for each equity share held in Cairn India Limited. No shares were issued to Vedanta Limited or any of its 
subsidiaries for their shareholding in Cairn India Limited. Cairn India Limited ceased to be a separate legal entity with effect from 
1 1 April 2017 .
The above has resulted in a decrease in the shareholding of the Company in Vedanta Limited (merged entity) from 62.85% to 
50.13% and an increase in the shareholdings of erstwhile Cairn India Limited’s subsidiaries from 37 .64% to 50.13%. Given the 
Company continues to control Vedanta Limited, this has been accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement. 
43. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

GAAP to FRS 101 and has, in doing so, applied the requirements of IFRS 1 .6-33 and related appendices. 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standards 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements (FRS 100) and 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101).  244

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries except preference shares, valued at cost less any provision 
for impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.
INVESTMENT IN PREFERENCE SHARES OF SUBSIDIARIES
Investments in preference shares of subsidiaries are stated at fair value. The fair value is represented by the face value of the 
preference shares as the investments are redeemable at any time for their face value at the option of the Company.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash in the balance sheet comprise of cash at bank and cash in hand.
FINANCIAL ASSET INVESTMENTS
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured 
at subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognized directly in 
equity. On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement.
CURRENCY TRANSLA TION
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US Dollars at 
the spot exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
T ANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
DEFERRED T AXA TION
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, 
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
not discounted.
SHARE-BASED PA YMENTS
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair 
value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant 
date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which 
point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date 
even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. Amounts recharged to subsidiaries in respect of awards granted to employees of 
subsidiaries are recognised as intercompany debtors until repaid.
In case of cash-settled transactions, a liability is recognised for the fair value of cash-settled transactions. The fair value is measured 
initially and at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in employee 
benefits expense. The fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The 
fair value is determined with the assistance of an external valuer.
BORROWINGS
Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received i.e. net of direct transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on accruals basis and charged to the 
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
CONVERTIBLE BONDS
The Convertible bond issued by VRJL and VRJL -II (note 54) are accounted for as a compound instrument. The gross proceeds (net 
of issue costs) were lent to the Company by VRJL and VRJL -II. The equity component has been recognised in a separate reserve of 
the company and is not subsequently re measured. The recognition of the equity component by the company acts to reduce the 
payable to VRJL and VRJL -II which arises once the gross proceeds are borrowed. The liability component is held at amortised cost. 
The interest expensed on the liability component is calculated by applying an effective interest rate. The difference between 
interest expensed and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability component.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured 
at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss 
account. The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the profit and loss account and is offset by 
the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains 
or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting.

these are shown as contingent liabilities. (note 57)

debtor.

During the year ended 31st March 2016, the Group recognized impairment charge in respect of the exploratory assets in  
West Africa (Western Cluster, Liberia) on account of low iron ore prices, geo-political factors and no plans for any substantive 
expenditure resulting in continued uncertainty in the project. Therefore, the company did not get certification of reserves & 
resources for the current period. 
OIL AND GAS
The Oil and gas reserves data set out below are estimated on the basis set out in the section headed “Presentation of 
Information” .
CAIRN INDIA
The Company's gross reserve estimates are updated at least annually based on the forecast of production profiles, determined on 
an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques. The estimates of reserves and resources have been 
derived in accordance with the Society for Petroleum Engineers “Petroleum Resources Management System (2007)” . The changes 
to the reserves are generally on account of future development projects, application of technologies such as enhanced oil recovery 
techniques and true up of the estimates. The management’s internal estimates of hydrocarbon reserves and resources at the 
period end, based on the current terms of the PSCs, are as follows:
Gross proved and probable

SOURCE OF INFORMATION:
In respect of all businesses, the information has been certified by geologist on behalf of Group management.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the ‘ Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves’, other than those relating to Konkola Copper Mines plc (‘KCM’) which complies with the South 
African Code for Reporting of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources (the ‘SAMREC Code’). The former code is prepared by the 
Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and 
Minerals Council of Australia, and is commonly referred to as the ‘JORC Code’. As at the date of this document, the editions of the 
JORC and SAMREC Codes in force are dated December 2004 and March 2000, respectively. The JORC and SAMREC Codes 
recognise a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
The terms and definitions in the SAMREC Code are consistent with those used in the JORC Code with minor differences in 
terminology – the JORC Code uses the term Ore Reserve whilst the SAMREC Code uses the term Mineral Reserve. For the 
purposes of ore and mineral resources reported herein, the term ore resources have been used throughout.
Oil and Gas reserves and resources have been prepared according to the Petroleum Resources Management Systems (PRMS) 
approved in March 2007 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the world Petroleum Council, the American Association of 
Petroleum Geologist, and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and 
are divided into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. 
The reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation. 
An Ore or Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes the effect 
of dilution and losses which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility 
studies, need to have been carried out and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified. Ore Reserves are sub-
divided in order of decreasing confidence into Proved Ore Reserves and Probable Ore Reserves.
The Measured and Indicated mineral resources have been reported as being inclusive of those mineral resources modified to 
produce the ore reserves, in addition to the ore reserves. The resource and reserve estimates provided herein comply with the 
resource and reserve definitions of the JORC Code, other than those relating to KCM which comply with the SAMREC Code.  260

OTHER INFORMATION: 
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
INTRODUCTION
Vedanta Group is committed to providing timely and clear information on financial and operational performance to investors, 
lenders and other external parties, in the form of annual reports, disclosures, RNS feeds and other communications. We regard 
high standards of disclosure as critical to business success.
Alternative Performance Measure (APM) is an evaluation metric of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that is 
not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The APMs used by the group fall under two categories:
 › Financial APMs: These financial metrics are usually derived from financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
Certain financials metrics cannot be directly derived from the financial statements as they contain additional information such 
as profit estimates or projections, impact of macro-economic factors and changes in regulatory environment on financial 
performance.
 › Non-Financial APMs: These metrics incorporate non – financial information that management believes is useful in assessing 
the performance of the group.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all the companies, including those in the Group’s industry. APM’s should be considered in 
addition to, and not a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported 
in accordance with IFRS.
PURPOSE
The Group uses APMs to improve comparability of information between reporting periods and business units, either by adjusting 
for uncontrollable or one-off factors which impacts upon IFRS measures or, by aggregating measures, to aid the user of the Annual 
Report in understanding the activity taking place across the Group’s portfolio.
APMs are used to provide valuable insight to analysts and investors along with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). 
We believe these measures assist in providing a holistic view of the company’s performance.  261

BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD
Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited calls or correspondence offering to buy or sell shares at a discounted price. 
These calls are typically from fraudsters operating ‘boiler rooms’. Boiler rooms use increasingly sophisticated means to approach 
investors and often leave their victims out of pocket. If you are concerned that you may have been targeted by fraudsters, please 
contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 (freephone) or 0300 500 8082 from the UK or +44 207 066 1000 from

CURRENCY OPTION AND DIVIDEND MANDATE
Shareholders wishing to receive their dividend in UK pounds sterling should complete and return to the Registrar a Currency 
Election Form. In order for the Currency Option and Dividend Mandate to be effective for the 2017 final dividend, the completed 
forms must be received by the Registrar by 24 July 2017 .
The Registrar can also arrange for the dividend to be paid directly into a shareholder’s UK bank account. To take advantage of this 
facility, please contact the Registrar who will provide a Dividend Mandate Form. Please complete and return the form to the 
Registrar by 24 July 2017 . This arrangement is only available in respect of dividends paid in UK pounds sterling. Consequently, you 
may only take advantage of this arrangement if you have also completed a Currency Election Form and returned it to the registrar 
by 24 July 2017 . If you have already completed and returned a Currency Election Form and/or a Dividend Mandate Form, you need 
take no further action. Currency election and dividend mandate forms are also available online through the Investor Centre service
