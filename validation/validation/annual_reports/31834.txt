 Crop enhancement – 
advancing the science 
of crop potential
PLANT IMPACT PLC 
Annual Report 2017
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Our starting 
point is plant 
science
What we do
We understand physiological  
stress responses and resource 
prioritisation in key world crops. 
This enables us to create and 
identify novel synthetic and defined 
small molecule chemicals that can 
be applied as crop enhancement 
(sometimes known as biostimulant)
foliar sprays and seed treatments. 
Our products are easy to use and 
consistently improve crop yields 
under a range of growth conditions.
Why we do it
Increasing global demand for food 
needs to be met overwhelmingly by 
increasing yields on the existing 
world farm. The rate of crop yield 
increases is falling in all crops in 
most parts of the world. Crop 
enhancement products are a new 
category in the grower’s toolkit to 
unlock otherwise lost crop yield and 
help to sustainably increase food 
and animal feed worldwide.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Innovation 
thrives in a 
challenging 
environment
At Plant Impact this year we have invested more 
in R&D and been rewarded with advances in 
our pipeline of products. Recent industry-wide 
commercial challenges have not slowed 
our scientific progress.
DR DAVID JONES
CHAIRMAN
The last 12 months have been eventful 
ones for our industry and for our 
business. We have seen a remarkable 
uptick in the pace of technical 
innovation from smaller companies, as 
well as from industry multinationals. 
There have been numerous scientific 
and technical developments in the 
areas of biostimulants, AgData, 
plant genetics and advanced sensing 
and diagnostic tools. The future of 
technology on the world’s farms and in 
its food supply chain looks very bright 
over the next 5-10 years: growers will 
have better inputs, better information 
about how to use them, and newer, 
more efficient ways of doing business.
The short-term commercial 
environment in agriculture looks 
very different, however. An unusual 
succession of strong harvests over 
the past five years (prompted by both 
good weather and grower adoption of 
new, high-tech inputs) has depressed 
commodity prices in the world’s big 
crops: corn, soybeans, wheat and rice. 
This has created significant pressure on 
growers’ profitability and the financial 
performance of the distributors and 
input manufacturers who supply them. 
Cost-cutting behaviour by farmers has 
reduced input consumption, creating 
significant channel inventory in many 
markets, notably Brazil and the United 
States. The industry is adjusting to these 
new conditions in a number of ways, 
most conspicuously by consolidation.
Plant Impact’s business progress in the 
last financial year reflects these broader 
sectoral trends. We have invested more 
in R&D and have been rewarded with a 
step advance in our pipeline of products. 
In the next two years, we expect to 
launch new crop enhancement products 
for both soybean and our second target 
crop, wheat. Following investments and 
partnerships for early stage discovery 
of new yield-enhancing small molecules

suitable for soybean, wheat and other 
major dicot and monocot crops, we have 
made many promising discoveries. We 
expect these to generate significant 
new revenue in the medium term.
Commercially, the Group’s Brazil 
Veritas
®
 business – still the majority 
of its sales – experienced a shortfall 
in grower consumption relative to 
campaign targets, impacting our sales 
for the 2016/17 financial year and the 
outlook for the 2017/18 year. In spite 
of this, we made the important step of 
establishing commercial positions in 
the United States and Argentina, which 
– along with Brazil – make up more than 
90% of the world’s soybean production.
The Group’s Board and management 
have evolved the strategy of the 
Company to reflect the richer flow of 
development products we are now 
seeing. We are moving from a sole 
focus on the exploitation of products 
in hand, to orientating ourselves to a 
future where our R&D platform will 
significantly broaden our offer (and 
with it, of course our development 
challenge). Detail on this is explained 
more fully in the Chief Executive’s 
Review. Having worked successfully 
with the previous strategic plan from 
2011 to 2016 of globalising and placing 
our products into important sectors 
of world agriculture, this evolution of 
our strategy will emphasise and build 
upon our productive R&D discovery 
capability. We believe that a wealth of 
novelty in discovery coupled with proven 
development and commercial placement 
capability is the best choice we can 
make. Our aim remains to become 
the industry leader in the discovery 
and development of small molecule 
chemistry for crop yield enhancement, 
establishing this emerging category 
of agricultural inputs as one that 
growers can trust and will adopt.
The Brazil purchasing outlook for the 
coming 2017/18 season translated into a 
lower level of internally-generated cash 
to fund R&D over the next 12 months. 
Given the progress we had made over 
the last two years and the desire to avoid 
losing R&D momentum, we approached 
shareholders for additional funding to 
maintain our investment in the future. 
We were pleased by the support we 
received which resulted in a fund-raising 
of £4m. We will invest this in R&D 
activities, primarily in bringing to market 
the products that are closest to launch.
Finally, I would like to thank our 
employees for the commitment 
and support that they have shown 
over the last year. It is their drive, 
enthusiasm and skill that produces 
the progress we seek and their efforts 
in this regard have been exemplary.

Discovery  
to delivery
In the 2016/17 financial year we made good 
progress in developing Plant Impact’s commercial 
and technical platforms to exploit the significant 
opportunity we see in crop enhancement. 
JOHN BRUBAKER
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Considerable progress has been 
made in the 2016/17 financial year in 
research and product development 
(R&D). For the first time, our R&D 
progress is enabling us to trial an 
integrated, full-season portfolio 
of four individually developed yield 
products and prototypes for soybeans. 
Ultimately, and in combination, we are 
developing them to deliver a consistent 
double-digit yield improvement for 
growers; this is without precedent 
in this category. In addition, we are 
gathering test data signalling that our 
technologies in soybeans and wheat 
could be extended to other major 
world crops like cotton, canola, corn 
and rice. Most exciting, our chemical 
discovery process has been developed 
to be highly productive in generating 
novel compound leads, which are 
showing promising performance in 
early laboratory assays. Reflecting 
this and the importance that we place 
on R&D, we have recently published 
a pipeline review that gives investors 
and industry partners improved 
visibility of where we are working 
and the progress we are making.
Successes this year have included the 
launch of Fortalis
®
 in North America 
and Veritas
®
/Fortalis
®
 in the Southern 
Cone of Latin America. Additionally 
we have seen growth of Banzai
™
, our 
product for cocoa in West Africa and 
made progress in developing additional 
partnerships to expand that opportunity 
in future years. We made commercial 
progress in Brazil, expanding our 
flagship product Veritas
®
 to consolidate 
a leading market position in soybean 
crop enhancement. However, we did 
not achieve the campaign plan that 
both we and Bayer CropScience (BCS), 
Chief Executive’s Review 05

REPORT
our partner in the country, had set for 
the season. This resulted in a build 
up in channel inventory levels which 
adversely impacted BCS’s planned 
purchase volumes for the forthcoming 
2017/18 growing season. We regard 
this as a temporary setback, brought 
about by poor market conditions 
last season. Factors included poor 
crop prices, restricted availability 
of farm credit and overall poor 
economic sentiment in Brazil. 
Strategy
The Group has operated since 2011 
under a strategic plan which directed 
commercial and product development 
efforts towards building three pillars: 
sell direct to market, globalise and 
scale, and accelerate innovation. Over 
the last 12 months, we have evolved 
this strategy for the next stage of our 
development. Our update recognises 
that R&D activities are at the core of 
what we are seeking to achieve and that 
these provide the main engine for an 
appreciation in long-term shareholder 
value. This 2017 strategic plan (i) 
organises our R&D efforts to address 
specific plant physiological responses 
and resource prioritisation that limit 
crop yields, (ii) focuses these research 
efforts on soybeans and wheat, as initial 
models for dicot and monocot plant 
classes, (iii) embeds a replicable R&D 
platform approach to the discovery of 
new small molecules, (iv) concentrates 
product development on novel synthetic 
and defined chemistries, and (v) builds 
partnerships with companies that 
growers trust in order to commercialise 
products and fund further R&D.
The refined strategy forms the basis 
of a five-year business and R&D 
plan that the Group will continue to 
progress as the business develops.

Advancing understanding of plant responses to  
establish crop enhancement as a trusted category  
of agricultural inputs.

PRIORITIES DESCRIPTION 2016/17 PROGRESS LOOKING FORWARD
0.1
Focus R&D on plant physiological 
responses and plant resource 
prioritisation
Our work begins with an understanding of 
plant physiology to ensure maximum product 
efficacy
Our R&D team has made good progress with 
characterising key yield-limiting plant 
response challenges to our model crops and 
defining six research focus areas to guide our 
platform projects (see pipeline p 20 to 21)
Our research collaborations with institutions 
such as Ghent University, University of 
Nottingham and Lancaster University are 
helping to advance understanding of plant 
responses to stress
We are in discussions to establish further 
research collaborations, including projects 
with leading universities in the USA
0.2
Target model dicot and 
monocot crops (broad leaf and 
grass crop classes)
Soybeans and wheat are our model dicot and 
monocot crops. The insight and capabilities we 
are gaining as we develop full programmes of 
technologies for these two crops will help us to 
extend these for other major crops in the 
future eg. cotton and oil seed rape (dicots) and 
rice, and corn (monocots)
For the first time, in 2016 our soybean R&D 
trials in Brazil featured pipeline products 
covering plant stresses at every stage of the 
growing cycle
We anticipate launching 2–3 new soybean 
products within the next 2 years
0.3
Use chemistry – novel synthetic 
and defined small molecule 
compounds
Compared with alternative biostimulant types 
(microbes, proteins, organic mixtures etc), 
small molecule chemistry presents product 
candidates that are stable under field 
conditions, readily formulated into usable 
form, inexpensive to manufacture and 
compatible with current grower practice. 
Chemistry delivers maximum reliability of 
effect, enabling targeting of specific plant 
responses and a simpler regulatory pathway 
than alternatives
In 2016/17 we built the momentum of our 
discovery work – resulting in advances such as 
identification of new lead molecules which can 
target abiotic stress responses. Our 
agreement with Ghent University gives us 
access to novel compounds as part of our 
focus on drought tolerance
In FY18+ we plan to invest in higher throughput 
discovery and screening capabilities
0.4
Create effective products from 
a replicable R&D platform 
approach
Our platform is founded on repeatable 
processes we have developed for predicting 
chemical entities that will perform, then 
rapidly characterising them for efficacy
We increased R&D investment to provide 
additional laboratory space. Publication of our 
first platform and pipeline presentation
As our platform process embeds, we expect it 
to drive regular discoveries of new bioactive 
molecules, synergistic mixtures and 
formulation technologies. We are also 
considering bringing currently outsourced 
technical research capabilities in house
0.5
Build partnerships that growers 
trust to commercialise product 
and fund R&D
We believe that innovation is only validated 
through grower adoption under commercial 
conditions. The resulting cash generation has 
helped to fund the bulk of our R&D to date

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Operating  
and financial 
review
The Group has an exciting set of commercial and 
R&D prospects ahead of it and an ambitious and 
talented team with the drive to succeed. We enter 
the new financial year focused on our goal of 
establishing Plant Impact as the leader in this 
important new category of agricultural inputs.
Operating review
Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) 
is at the core of Plant Impact’s 
business, with more than 25% of 
our staff dedicated full time to R&D 
work and almost everyone in the 
Group engaged in some form of R&D 
activity. Product development in crop 
enhancement is a multi-year activity, 
albeit a significantly more rapid 
process than comparable development 
cycles for traditional agrochemicals 
or new seed genetics. Considerable 
work has been conducted this year 
in streamlining our R&D process to 
ensure a better flow of opportunities 
from concept to product development. 
A detailed update on progress on 
R&D activities was published in 
August 2017 on our website.
Our R&D process, like that of most 
other Life Sciences businesses, 
consists of discrete stages: Discovery, 
Early stage development and Late stage 
development. Projects that advance 
to the late stage of development are 
expected to achieve first product 
sales in one to three years. Projects 
currently in this phase, include those 
that aid the in-ground germination 
and establishment of both wheat 
(W1) and soybeans (S0) as well as 
an important project to support the 
photosynthetic process of soybeans 
in the vegetative growth stage (F1, 
now branded Tempus
®
). Trials with 
these projects have been conducted 
in both North and South America 
over the course of the last year.
In the case of both S0 and Tempus
® 
soybean development projects, we 
also made formulation upgrades that 
are in advanced trials. Over the past 
year, we have identified partners who 
are eager to launch these early-stage 
formulations under their own labels. 
These commercial opportunities 
are being actively considered as 
interim solutions which can generate 
supplemental corporate funding for 
additional R&D in our core discovery 
and product development activities.
We have a number of projects that have 
progressed from Discovery into a more 
advanced Early development stage 
where we have identified candidate 
active molecules that appear to offer 
the yield potential we seek and are  09
FINANCIAL

testing these in the field in small plot 
and larger scale trials. Included in this 
area is work we are progressing at 
the reproductive stage of the soybean 
growing cycle that is complementary 
with our existing Veritas
®
 and 
Fortalis
®
 products (V4 project).
However, the most exciting 
development has been in the Discovery 
phase of our activities. We have 
significantly increased the flow of 
potential new molecules into our 
screening process. This has been as a 
consequence of improvements in our 
processes, as well as new capabilities 
and the recruitment of scientists who 
have bought techniques that allow us 
to model chemical/plant interactions, 
further accelerating lead generation. 
In parallel, we have established a 
number of potential new academic 
partnerships, and we were delighted 
in May 2017 to sign a collaboration 
agreement with Ghent University that 
gives us exclusive access to novel 
phosphonamide pyrabactin analogue 
molecules that improve drought 
tolerance in wheat (project code-name 
Y1). Our aim is to develop academic 
partnerships for each of our R&D focus 
areas. In this regard we were also 
pleased to announce collaborations 
with Rothamsted Research and 
Lancaster and Nottingham Universities 
to investigate the physiological impacts 
of heat stress in wheat (project H1).
As announced at the time of the 
interim results in March, the Group 
is currently investigating options to 
dispose of the intellectual property 
assets related to its biological 
insecticide TGT-101. The process is 
ongoing and further announcements 
will be made as appropriate.
Commercial activity
Veritas
®
As announced in this review last year, 
for the 2016/17 Brazilian soybean 
growing season we increased 
investment in commercial support in 
Brazil for Veritas
®
, our flagship soybean 
product, sold through our partner in 
the region, Bayer CropScience (BCS). 
This investment included additional 
temporary field agent resources to 
run demonstration programmes for 
dealers and growers and investment 
in a digital marketing campaign 
targeted specifically at growers. These 
investments did not achieve the results 
we had hoped for and growth in grower 
use of the product fell well short of the 
plans that we had agreed with BCS. 
Purchases by growers were affected by 
the challenging backdrop of Brazilian 
agricultural market conditions that 
adversely affected overall industry 
purchases of chemical inputs. Weak 
crop prices and a lack of available credit 
following a poor season in 2015/16 
meant that the 2016/17 season was a 
difficult one for chemical suppliers.

PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
These underlying market conditions 
did not impact our sales of Veritas
®
 to 
BCS at the beginning of the 2016/17 
growing season. BCS purchased from 
us the quantities that we had agreed 
with them ahead of the start of that 
season and that were in line with the 
minimum quantities that they needed 
to purchase to maintain their exclusive 
rights to market the product in Brazil. 
In addition, they purchased volumes 
for Paraguay and Bolivia, for which 
this was the first season of Veritas
®
 
sales. Product performance results 
from the field in all three countries 
were encouraging, with yield uplifts 
in grower tests in the 5% range. This 
was achieved in a season that itself 
saw very high underlying yields, 
confirming our data from research 
tests that show Veritas
®
 providing 
soybean yield improvement regardless 
of the level of underlying yields.
Lower grower usage in season 
2016/17 meant higher than expected 
channel stocks in Brazil at the start 
of the 2017/18 growing season. This 
has impacted planned purchases for 
this season, including sales that we 
had anticipated making prior to the 
recent financial year end, as we have 
done in each of the last three financial 
years. As announced in July 2017, 
we have agreed a purchasing plan 
with BCS for 2017/18 which is lower 
than previously assumed. Campaign 
plans have been agreed, and we 
will again be supporting them in the 
field. By incorporating the learning 
of the last campaigns, our support 
will be more effectively structured to 
drive grower adoption this season.
Looking forward, both the Group 
and BCS aim to move to higher 
volume strategies and recognise 
that the current commercial 
arrangements may need to be 
flexed to achieve that objective.
Fortalis
®
The last year saw the launch of the 
follow-on product to Veritas
®
, Fortalis
®
, 
which uses the same yield-enhancing 
molecule and is targeted at the same 
biological stress condition of soybean 
development. Fortalis
®
, however, has 
a wider application window allowing 
use in regions where the spray of 
compatible fungicide takes place later 
in the plant’s reproductive cycle. In 
the year, we launched this product 
in Argentina and the United States.
The launch of Fortalis
®
 in North 
America has been more significant. 
Following the results of trials 
conducted over the 2016 growing 
season in the US we decided to 
launch the product in 2017, arranging 
distribution deals with five of the 
biggest distributors in the North 
American market. Commercially, 
we have positioned Fortalis
®
 in 
combination with a range of premium 
soybean fungicides. Currently, only 
20% of soybean growers in the US 
use fungicide due to a perception 
of relatively low disease pressure. 
However for those growers, applying 
a fungicide with Fortalis
®
 offers, on 
average, a 10% yield uplift even on 
non-fungicide treated areas. This is a 
very compelling prospect. By working 
directly with the most important 
distributors in the market, we are able 
to remain independent of any particular 
fungicide manufacturer which 
significantly increases our options 
and potential market. For instance, it 
also enables us to offer commercial 
incentives direct to growers and to 
capture their yield improvement data 
thus allowing us to drive more focused 
customer relationship campaigns 
to increase on the ground usage. 
Harvest data and customer feedback 
will come in during the final months of 
the current calendar year, and we will 
use this information to define marketing 
plans for the 2018 US season.
In Argentina we launched Fortalis
®
 
through a test-marketing scheme 
with BCS Argentina. Feedback from 
growers using and testing the product 
has been very good, and the yield 
improvements were consistent with our 
targets in the 4-5% range. Following 
this programme, we have designed 
a promotional campaign which has 
some elements of our channel strategy 
in both Brazil and United States. In 
Argentina, we plan to work directly 
with regional distributors, but maintain 
some collaboration with BCS (and other 
leading fungicide manufacturers) to 
design commercial co-promotions with 
Fortalis
®
. Given the tight economic 
conditions for growers in Argentina, 
pressured in particular by a soybean 
production tax, we are planning a very 
cautious expansion in this important 
market. In 2017/18, we will focus first

Banzai
™
The last financial year was the second 
active commercial season for Banzai
™
, 
which is our yield enhancement product 
for cocoa sold into West Africa by our 
partner Arysta LifeScience. Our sales 
to Arysta met the commercial plans 
that we had with them and grower 
use of the product was also in line 
with the targets in the business plan. 
Within this, sales into Cameroon were 
in line with expectations as we saw 
the first results of the strategy we 
are adopting in that area of working 
with the cocoa processors to support 
their sustainability programmes. 
Sales into Ivory Coast where Arysta 
is adopting a more traditional dealer-
led sales model underperformed, but 
the shortfall here was offset in Ghana 
where the product has been adopted by 
COCOBOD, the government-organised 
supply organisation in that country.
Going forward, we intend to continue 
to pursue the cocoa processor model 
which we think could lead to significant 
growth opportunity for the product. We 
are developing that model with Arysta

the necessary demonstration trials.
Other products
At the start of the year, we restructured 
our business servicing customers 
in Europe, Middle East and Africa to 
reflect the lower growth rates we 
felt were achievable in this region. 
Our focus in this area has been on 
supporting distributor-led business 
plans, rather than trying to proactively 
drive grower demand. This has led 
to modest growth in the period but 
we feel that it has resulted in a more 
sustainable base from which to develop. 
Importantly, as a result of this lower 
cost commercial model, this part of 
the business was a net generator 
of cash over the last 12 months.
Outlook
Sales of Veritas
®
 product into Brazil 
will continue to make the bulk of the 
revenue that the Group expects for the 
new financial year. These expectations 
are based on the purchase plan that 
has been agreed with BCS, which in 
turn is based on their target for grower 
use of the product over the next 12 
months. In addition to this, the Group 
expects further growth in sales of 
Veritas
®
/Fortalis
®
 in regions outside of 
Brazil, increased sales of the Banzai
™
 
cocoa product into West Africa and 
material revenues from the launch 
of new products that are currently 
approaching the end of the development 
cycle. In total, the Directors believe, 
at this early stage, that revenue for 
FY18 will be around £13m with gross 
margins somewhat lower than those 
achieved in the last financial year 
due to the impact of product mix, but 
operating expenses also reduced.
The Group has an exciting set of 
commercial and R&D prospects ahead 
of it and an ambitious and talented 
team with the drive to succeed. We 
enter the new financial year focused 
on our goal of establishing Plant 
Impact as the leader in this important 
new category of agricultural inputs.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Revenue
Overall revenue increased 17% to 
£8,450k in the year to 31 July 2017 
(2016: £7,211k). Much of the increase 
came from the relative increase in the 
strength of the US Dollar compared 
to Sterling year on year, as most 
of the Group’s revenue is invoiced 
in Dollars. Adjusting for this, the 
underlying increase in revenue on a 
constant currency basis was 2%.
Americas
The majority of the Group’s revenue 
continues to come from the Americas 
where it was £7,209k compared to 
£6,494k in the prior year. Revenue in 
the Americas includes sales of the 
Company’s flagship Veritas
®
 product 
into Brazil. In FY17 the Group, through 
our partner Bayer CropScience, started 
making sales of Veritas
®
 to Paraguay 
and Bolivia. Americas revenue in FY17 
also included the initial sales of the 
second generation Fortalis
®
 soybean 
product that was launched in the year 
in Argentina and the United States. 
The revenue achieved from these 
new regions helped offset a reduction 
in revenue for Brazil, as sales of 
Veritas
®
 into that region were down 
year on year as previously explained.
Revenue in the Americas also includes 
revenue relating to the initial fee 
received in February 2015 from BCS 
which is being recognised over a five 
year term. £389k was recognised in 
the year (2016: £388k), leaving £972k 
in deferred revenue. This deferred 
revenue will be released to the income 
statement over the next 30 months.

Europe
Revenue in this region was £453k 
compared with £286k in the prior year. 
In particular there was growth seen in 
France, Turkey and Eastern Europe.
Rest of World
Revenue in the Rest of World increased 
to £788k from £431k in the prior year. 
Rest of World includes revenues 
from sales to West Africa for our 
Banzai
™
 product for cocoa as well as 
sales of more traditional products 
into the Middle East. In FY17 Banzai
™
 
revenues accounted for all Rest of 
World revenues as there were no 
sales to Middle Eastern customers 
due to the political and economic 
conditions in the region. Banzai
™
 
sales were in line with expectations 
in the second season of commercial 
sales, with higher than expected 
shipments for Ghana offsetting 
some weakness in Ivory Coast.
Gross profit
Gross profit margins increased slightly 
to 80% (2016: 78%). The increase 
primarily reflected the benefit the 
stronger Dollar had on revenues 
compared with the predominantly 
Sterling-based cost of sales, 
although this was partially offset 
by a slightly weaker product mix.
Operating expenses excluding 
share-based payments and 
restructuring costs
Excluding share-based payments 
and restructuring costs, underlying 
operating expenses increased 
from £5,848k to £9,720k, reflecting 
the increased headcount and 
on-costs associated with the 
strategy of geographic expansion 
and increased R&D.
Sales and marketing costs increased 
to £5,298k (2016: £2,914k) due mainly 
to the expansion of commercial 
activities into the United States and 
Argentina where local offices were 
established and commercial personnel 
recruited to provide initial support for 
the product launches. In the United 
States, additional temporary contract 
resources were also hired to reflect 
the direct-to-market commercial 
strategy that we are pursuing in 
that country. Additional marketing 
expenditure was also incurred in West 
Africa to support Banzai
™
 and in Brazil 
where we invested approximately 
£0.5m more than the previous year 
in additional temporary field staff 
and sales and marketing costs.

PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
In total the Group spent £4,188k on 
R&D activities (2016: £2,923k). Of this, 
£2,636k (2016: £1,754k) was expensed 
through the income statement. 
Additionally, £1,552k (2016: £1,169k) 
was capitalised within intangible assets 
as it relates to products that are in the 
Late development stage where they 
are expected to be technically feasible 
and commercially viable and satisfy 
all the conditions prescribed by IAS 38 
for recognition as an intangible asset.
Other administration costs increased 
to £1,786k (2016: £1,180k). Of the 
increase of £606k, £291k related to 
foreign exchange gains/losses which 
were a loss of £116k compared with 
a gain of £175k in the prior year. The 
majority of the rest of the increase 
reflected higher professional fees.
Share-based payments and 
restructuring costs
The income statement charge for the 
cost of share-based payments was 
£893k compared with £1,009k last 
year. As explained in last year’s Annual 
Report the share-based payment 
charge primarily relates to options 
granted under the Value Creation Plan 
(VCP) that was adopted by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting in 
November 2014 and for which the first 
options were granted on 31 July 2015. 
The charge is predominantly a non-
cash expense other than provision for 
employer’s National Insurance costs 
on expected exercises where the lower 
share price this year resulted in a credit 
of £65k for the year compared with 
a charge of £213k in the prior year.
Restructuring costs in the period 
were £177k (2016: £nil). These 
reflected the costs of restructuring 
the European business which took 
place in the first quarter of the year.
Income tax
The Group benefits from UK R&D tax 
credits, in the form of a cash refund. 
£694k was claimed in the year relating 
to the period to 31 July 2016, with the 
cash received in January 2017. The 
amount received was £132k more than 
had been accrued in the accounts for 
the prior period and adjusting for that, 
together with the expected tax credit 
for the current year of £850k, brings the 
UK R&D tax credit for the year to £982k. 
This, combined with £54k of income 
tax incurred by overseas subsidiaries, 
results in a net tax credit in the income 
statement of £928k (2016: £514k).
The Group currently has an 
accumulated tax loss of £10,100k (2016: 
£8,700k). The Group has not recognised 
the potential net deferred tax asset of 
£1,293k related to these accumulated 
losses and other timing differences 
in the current year. The asset should 
only be recognised if it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits 
against which the loss can be utilised. 
The Group is currently in an operating 
loss position, and the Directors do not 
consider there is sufficient certainty 
over the timing of future taxable profits 
to crystallise the deferred tax asset.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets
The increase in net book value of 
non-current assets at 31 July 2017 
to £4,847k (2016: £3,424k) reflects 
the capitalisation of development 
activities related to projects that 
satisfy the requirements of IAS 38 
for recognition as intangible assets. 
Previously capitalised costs are being 
amortised from first commercial sale 
over periods of from 5 to 20 years 
depending on the expected longevity 
of the related technology or product.

CASH BALANCE AS AT  
31 JULY 2017
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables at 31 July 
2017 were £829k (2016: £2,313k). 
The reduced balance reflects the 
absence this year of early season sales 
of Veritas
®
 to Brazil, compared to 
prior years. The outstanding balance 
primarily relates to sales of Veritas
®
 
and Fortalis
®
 products to Paraguay 
and the United States, as well as 
Banzai
™
 product being sold to Ghana.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables at 31 July 
2017 due for payment within 12 months 
increased by £396k to £2,961k (2016: 
£2,565k). The main changes related to 
deferred income which increased due 
to provisions for rebate programmes 
that support the United States 
Fortalis
®
 commercial programme.
Cash flow and cash
The cash balance at 31 July 2017 
was £7,204k (2016: £5,564k). The net 
inflow of £1,640k, reflects the impact 
of the fund raising that took place on 
28 July 2017 raising £3,773k net of 
issue expenses. The inflow from this 
more than offset a cash outflow from 
operations of £317k and an outflow 
from investing activities of £1,685k.
Within cash flow from operations, 
the loss for the year was offset by the 
collection of the large trade debtor 
balance that existed at the start of 
the year. Cash flow from operations 
also benefited from the collection of 
two years’ R&D tax credits following 
a delay in receipt of the prior year’s 
claim for the period to 31 July 2015.
Cash spent in investment activities was 
primarily the £1,552k of capitalised 
R&D which is more fully described in 
the analysis of operating expenses.
The Group has a £1.0m invoice 
financing facility with HSBC Bank 
plc under which it can draw down up 
to 80% of all outstanding invoices, 
subject to a concentration limit. 
As at 31 July 2017 there were no 
drawings (31 July 2016: £50k of 
cash drawn down with recourse).
The Group has sufficient funds to 
support its near- and mid-term 
operating requirements and has 
the operational flexibility to reduce 
or increase expenditure to respond 
to challenges or opportunities.

Working 
with plant 
responses
Abiotic stresses such as variable climates, heat 
shock and drought trigger natural physiological 
processes within soybean and wheat plants. 
These responses aim to divert the plant’s 
resources into ensuring continuity of species, 
not maximising yield. These processes are also 
at work when climate variability is not an issue, 
causing the plant to hold back some energy 
regardless of the conditions.
Our scientists have defined six focus areas for 
their work. These are designed around key 
growth stages and common challenges when 
stresses trigger specific yield-impacting plant 
responses:

goes beyond current accepted legal and regulatory requirements. Our industry niche is 
developing rapidly and in the absence of a set of requirements that encompass all of our 
operations, we have created our own.
We monitor our achievement of robust standards in efficacy, innovation, safety and 
compliance for all of our products and have committed to reporting on performance 
annually for those that have met all of the commitment criteria to achieve our standard 
mark, namely Veritas
®
 and Fortalis

STRATEGIC REPORT
Clear and robust  
risk management 
framework
Risk management framework and principal risks
Plant Impact’s overall approach to 
strategy and risk appetite
The Board of Plant Impact are 
responsible for setting strategy and 
defining a business model that is 
consistent with an appetite for risk 
that we feel is appropriate given the 
rewards available. Plant Impact has 
chosen a route that moderates risk and 
relies principally on self-generated 
funds from commercialised products 
for investment in R&D and working 
capital. We have in the past and intend 
in the future, to resort to capital 
markets in circumstances where we 
have defined development projects 
that are close to market launch, where 
the use of funds can be described 
and allocated against clearly defined 
outcomes. Our goal in the medium term 
is to grow the commercial business 
such that we become self-sufficient in 
generating the funds for investment. 
This strategy is less reliant on external 
funding than the traditional “Pharma” 
type approach of a planned cash burn, 
funded by multiple investor rounds 
based on the promise of significant 
commercial returns at some point in the 
future. It is however not without its own 
risks, as it is dependant on the success 
of the short-term commercialisation 
strategy to fund long-term development 
of the intellectual property. As we saw 
in the year under review, if there is a 
hiatus in the cash generated by the 
commercialisation arm then external 
investment may be needed to ensure 
the continued momentum of the 
R&D driving future growth. The risk 
management governance framework 
adopted by the Board, recognises the 
specific risks inherent in this chosen 
business model and strategy.
Risk management governance 
structure and responsibilities
The Board sets the risk appetite of the 
Group, identifies the principal risks, 
defines the framework for managing 
risks across the organisation and 
agrees the delegation of authorities 
relating to risk. Although the Board 
retains overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the Group maintains a 
sound risk management framework 
and system of internal controls, it 
delegates day-to-day responsibilities 
to the Executive Directors. The Board 
also delegates responsibility to the 
Audit Committee for monitoring, 
assessing and reporting on the controls 
and the overall effectiveness of the 
risk management framework. 
The Executive Directors are responsible 
for ensuring that the risk management 
framework and control processes 
are followed as prescribed. This 
includes overseeing the creation and 
ongoing maintenance of a Group risk 
register agreed with the Board and the 
completion of periodic assessments 
with senior management to track 
developments of the risk. This allows 
the risk register to be used for 
quarterly reporting back to the Board.
Some risks may arise from internal 
factors and the execution of the 
business model, but some will also be 
as a result of external factors, such 
as economic, political or governance 
constraints, over which Plant Impact 
has little or no direct control. Whether 
the risks are internally or externally 
driven, the Board seeks to ensure 
that the potential impacts across 
the business are understood and, 
where possible, appropriate and 
proportionate measures are adopted 
The risk management framework 
includes:
• Identifying principal risks
• Assigning ownership of each risk at 
senior management level
• Assessing the potential impact of 
each risk and whether the risk is 
increasing, staying the same or 
decreasing
• Assessing the specific element of 
the strategy that the risk potentially 
compromises
• Deciding the appetite for each 
specific risk
• Identifying mitigation strategies as 
appropriate for each risk
• Ensuring ongoing monitoring and 
upward reporting of risk status  31

to avoid or mitigate such risks. There 
are limitations in any system of internal 
control and, accordingly, even the 
most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against misstatement or loss.
Each function within the business 
identifies threats within their operations 
that could prevent the Group achieving 
its goals. The functions then propose 
relevant monitoring and mitigation 
plans. The risks are generally 
managed through regular business 
and project reviews where principal 
risks are discussed and existing 
management activities challenged. 
These include monthly project 
review meetings, formal quarterly 
risk assessments and other periodic 
reviews with the Board as required. 
The Chief Financial Officer oversees 
the day-to-day operation of the 
risk management framework 
and associated periodic reviews 
on behalf of the Board.
Risk identification and 
management
The Plant Impact Board has put in 
place a process whereby each year the 
Board and senior management teams 
will set out a comprehensive business 
plan identifying objectives and setting 
strategies and budgets to achieve their 
goals. Through this, and any significant 
risk factors identified through other 
activities undertaken during the year, 
strategic and operational risks will be 
identified for reporting on within the 
Group risk register. This process was in 
place throughout the year under review. 
All identified risks are assessed in 
terms of probability and impact, and 
are prioritised into the Group risk 
register. The appetite for each risk 
is also established to ensure that 
the appropriate level of mitigation 
and monitoring is planned into 
the ongoing oversight process. 
The risk mitigation plans are managed 
on a day-to-day basis within the 
relevant objectives of Plant Impact’s 
commercial operations and corporate 
functions. New risks are identified 
through senior management discussion 
(top down) and regular reporting from 
every part of the business (bottom 
up). A whistleblowing policy is also 
in place to enable the confidential 
reporting of malpractice or dishonesty.
A formal annual internal controls 
and effectiveness review is carried 
out on behalf of the Audit Committee 
to ascertain the effectiveness of the 
controls and mitigations that were 
applied to the risk registers. This 
final assessment is also reported 
back to the Board to demonstrate 
the overall effectiveness of the 
risk management process and to 
take any lessons forward into the 
framework for future years. 32

RISK AND  
STRATEGIC IMPACTS
DESCRIPTION MITIGATION MOVEMENT
MAJOR CUSTOMER 
CONCENTRATION RISK
Currently more than 80% of revenue in the 
year to 31 July 2017 came through sales to 
Bayer CropScience (BCS), all of which 
related to the Veritas
®
/Fortalis
®
 family of 
products. This concentration is expected 
to reduce in coming years, but is likely to 
remain significant. This presents a risk of 
a potential significant revenue reduction 
if BCS were to change their strategic 
focus away from crop enhancement 
technologies. Similarly there is also the 
risk that internal priorities within their 
organisation could result in a lack of 
focus on projects involving Plant Impact 
technologies. Their recent announcement 
of inventory issues in Brazil and the 
proposed acquisition of Monsanto are 
examples of issues that could impact 
their priorities. As seen recently, our 
self-generating funding model means a 
material reduction in revenues from BCS 
could impact the ability of Plant Impact 
to maintain R&D momentum without 
the support of shareholders. Given the 
strength of the Bayer business and 
balance sheet, it is not considered that the 
concentration risk leads to a consequential 
significant credit risk although this is 
monitored on a frequent basis.
We are developing other products and 
relationships with other partners to spread 
the concentration, although we recognise 
that commercial inertia will mean that it 
is likely to take time before such actions 
result in a material dilution of the risk. 
Commercialisation of the Banzai
™
 product 
has been actioned with Arysta LifeScience, 
and we are selling Fortalis
®
 direct to 
distributors in North America. We are in 
discussions with BCS in Brazil over a new 
commercial structure of the Veritas
®
 
agreement that, if successfully concluded, 
could materially reduce the potential 
volatility of earnings from that relationship.
LIQUIDITY RISK
The business has not yet achieved 
sustainable cash flow generation. In the 
year ended 31 July 2017, including 
investments, £2.0m of cash was consumed 
by operations and investments over the 
12 month period. Funds were increased just 
prior to the year end by a placing of £4.0m 
of new shares, leaving £7.2m of cash on the 
balance sheet at the year end. The budget 
for the current financial year anticipates 
further cash consumption, with the 
magnitude reliant in part on the success of 
a number of commercial and corporate 
actions from which internal cash 
generation is assumed. If they are not 
successful then a significant proportion of 
the Group’s cash resources could be 
consumed. This could result in investment 
plans having to be curtailed to preserve 
remaining resources or, in extremis, the 
need to raise additional funds.
Cash-generating activities have been 
specifically prioritised within the business 
plan to ensure that they are given the 
maximum opportunity of success. The 
business planning process prioritised 
investment actions and resulted in a 
number of proposed investment activities 
either being postponed, reduced in scale or 
ceased altogether. Progress in cash 
generation against the business plan is 
monitored on a monthly basis and 
investment activities adjusted accordingly.

DESCRIPTION MITIGATION MOVEMENT
DEVELOPMENT RISK
The business is primarily an R&D operation 
that is developing new technologies and 
applying them to specific crops in specific 
regions to enhance the yield or quality 
of the produce. Development activities 
take time and are costly and there is 
no guarantee when started that they 
will produce products that deliver 
demonstrable yield-enhancement 
results. Equally it may be that the products 
developed lack the novelty required to 
distinguish them from existing technologies 
and products and are hence not 
commercially viable. Work over the last 
12 months to expand our pipeline 
of molecules being tested has reduced 
this risk.
Use collaborations with external 
researchers to continually improve the 
pipeline of new molecules and include 
high-throughput screening for crop 
enhancement technologies to maximise 
the number of development tests. This will 
ensure the highest chance of success and 
develop a “technical architecture” which 
will refine the company’s view of the 
universe of potential compounds and 
mixtures that might have crop 
enhancement properties, ensuring that 
testing is focused on those compounds that 
have the greatest chance of success. 
Conduct regular reviews of developments 
and trials to ensure that activities are 
terminated as soon as it is clear they will 
not yield success. 
COMMERCIALISATION 
RISK
Despite having scientifically proven 
products, there is a risk that we fail to 
convince growers to adopt the product in 
sufficient numbers to establish meaningful 
market share in chosen markets. Market 
conditions may not be favourable for the 
launch of new technologies, with crop 
prices, historic yield performance, 
availability of credit, foreign exchange risk 
and concern over weather patterns all 
potentially impacting the appetite for 
growers to invest in new chemical inputs. 
Products that we commercialise may be 
superseded by competitive products 
resulting in us losing market share. This 
potentially threatens our ability to generate 
sufficient cash to fund R&D activities. 
Evidence from the first years of 
commercialisation of our products 
suggests that although the long-term 
prospects for the products are good, in the 
short-term, given the competing pressures 
on growers, it will prove more challenging 
than expected to gain the necessary 
traction to achieve sustainable revenues at 
commercially acceptable levels. 
Align ourselves with commercial partners 
with the brand recognition and marketing 
presence to maximise grower recognition. 
Capture market data of usage and 
retention rates and segment the market to 
focus early stage marketing on key 
influencers within the grower community. 
Provide on-the-ground technical sales and 
product support to assist channel partners 
in their support of growers. Having 
demonstrated the commercial success of 
specific products seek to re-negotiate 
commercial arrangements to reduce 
potential earnings volatility whilst giving 
commercial partners the maximum 
freedom to implement innovative 
marketing approaches. Monitor competitor 
actions to get early warning of potential 
new competitive products and amend 
marketing plans to react accordingly.

DESCRIPTION MITIGATION MOVEMENT
INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY AND 
REGULATION RISK
The business model of the Group is to 
invest significant R&D and commercial 
resources in developing novel products 
that enhance the yield or quality of specific 
crops. In order to achieve a return on the 
investments made, the Group must ensure 
that the intellectual property developed is 
protected to ensure that it alone can exploit 
the developments achieved. The business 
model will fail if the Group is unable to 
achieve protection of its products and 
others are able, either legally or otherwise 
to produce and market copies of the 
products. Equally sales of products into 
regions depend on the Group obtaining 
registrations of those products within the 
region for their importation and sale. 
Failure to achieve registrations by specific 
times may result in products missing 
seasonal application windows, delaying 
commercialisation by a full season and 
potentially allowing first-mover advantage 
to be lost.
The Group seeks to apply for patent 
protection on all new technologies in the 
key markets where it anticipates exploiting 
those technologies. It will robustly defend 
any breach of its patent protections. In 
addition, the Group maintains 
manufacturing relationships with a very 
small number of contract manufacturers, 
all of whom are currently based in the 
European Union – which it considers to be a 
relatively safe environment to prevent the 
leakage of intellectual property. 
Additionally, trademark protections are 
applied for all names of products within 
each major country of sale. To ensure 
regulation of products is managed 
proactively, the Group has invested in 
specific resource focused exclusively in 
maintaining existing and achieving new 
registrations. Where strategic partners 
are used to market products in particular 
countries or regions then trademark and 
product registrations are managed in 
conjunction with them to ensure the most 
efficient protection.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND 
LOGISTICS RISK
The Group’s business model involves the 
sale of ready to use manufactured 
products. Accordingly the Group is 
responsible for the sourcing of raw 
materials, the manufacture of the finished 
products and the logistics of distributing 
them to sales channel partners. In order to 
preserve working capital the Group 
primarily makes to order, so relies on its 
logistics channel to ensure that products 
arrive when required in region. If products 
failed to arrive at sales channel partners, 
or were found to be incorrectly formulated 
when they arrived then there would be 
significant risk that the growing season 
would be missed with a potential missed 
revenue opportunity and damage to the 
long-term credibility of both the specific 
product and the Group’s reputation. 
The Group works with a very small number 
of manufacturing partners to ensure the 
quality of its manufacturing process. New 
formulations go through significant testing 
before sale to ensure the contract 
manufacturer is able to achieve the 
volumes and quality required. Ranged 
scenarios of volume requirements are 
shared with manufacturers as early as 
possible to allow raw material 
procurement planning. On occasions the 
Group will assume contingent risk for 
unused specific raw materials in the event 
that expected orders do not materialise. 
Where possible the Group uses tried and 
tested logistics routes for shipping and 
splits major orders across multiple 
shipping routes to minimise the risk of 
orders being stuck on a single ship. When 
selling to sales channel partners with 
in-house shipping and importation 
expertise then shipping terms are used 
which pass the responsibility to them for 
the shipping as early in the logistics chain 
as possible.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
RISK
The Group generates significant amounts 
of its revenue in currencies (eg US Dollars) 
that are different to the majority of its cost 
base, which is primarily Sterling. There is 
therefore a risk that if Sterling strengthens 
against the US Dollar margins will be 
impacted as it is unlikely that the effectively 
lower revenues will be able to be passed on 
to customers through increased prices. 
The lower margins and associated cash 
flow could result in reduced resources 
available to fund further investments in 
R&D and commercial plans.
The Group uses fixed forward exchange 
contracts to lock in commercially available 
rates when it considers it has the 
necessary certainty on amount and timing 
of US Dollar receipts. Equally the Group 
seeks to use natural hedges by, where 
possible, purchasing in US Dollars. Where 
costs are incurred in foreign currencies in 
which is does not expect to generate 
revenues then fixed forward contracts are 
used to purchase those currencies forward 
typically up to six months ahead. The Group 
does not enter into speculative foreign 
currency trading. 
HUMAN RESOURCES 
RISK
As an R&D organisation developing 
intellectual property, recruiting and 
retaining quality individuals is paramount 
to our success. Without a stable and 
committed R&D team in particular, 
development projects could fail or  
become materially delayed by the 
disruption caused by changes in  
personnel at key points in the project. 
The Group places great importance on 
internal communications to ensure that 
staff are kept fully aware of business 
developments. In part this is achieved 
through a monthly multi-lingual meeting 
with all staff conducted face to face and  
via video-conference. Remuneration 
packages are designed to be competitive 
and share options are awarded to key 
personnel so they have a link to the 
long-term prospects of the Group. To 
mitigate the impact of the loss of individual 
team members, systems are in place to 
ensure common processes and clear 
documentation of all R&D findings so that 
responsibilities for projects can transfer 
with as little disruption as possible.

employees). From time to time, the 
Group supplements key roles and 
organisational functions with third 
parties, contractors and outsourced 
service providers. The Group’s full-
time-equivalent workforce at 31 July 
2017 was 66 (31 July 2016: 60).
Safety, health and environment
Plant Impact is committed to 
maintaining high standards of 
safety, health and environmental 
protection by conducting itself in 
a responsible manner to protect 
people and the environment.
Directors’ third-party indemnity 
provisions
During the financial period, a qualifying 
third-party indemnity provision for the 
benefit of the Directors was in place.
Going concern
Having made reasonable enquiries, 
the Directors are of the opinion that 
the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and 
hence these financial statements 
have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. Further details 
are disclosed within note 2 to the 
Group financial statements.
Statement of disclosure to Auditor
The Directors at the date of approval 
of this report confirm that:
• there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group’s Auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps 
that they ought to have taken as 
Directors to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Group’s Auditor 
is aware of that information.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
Corporate Governance Statement
The Board
The Board is responsible for overall 
strategy, major finance matters and 
internal financial control. It also 
monitors executive management in the 
business through its review of financial, 
strategic and operational matters.
The Board currently comprises two 
Executive and two Non-Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive 
Directors, David Jones and Chris 
Tyler, both have relevant and 
complementary expertise gained 
from differing business backgrounds, 
materially enhancing the judgement 
and overall performance of the Board.
The Board considers Chris Tyler to 
be independent in character and 
judgement and free from any business 
or other relationships that could 
materially interfere with the exercise 
of his judgement. The Board also 
considers the Non-Executive Chairman, 
David Jones, to be independent in 
both character and judgement.
As part of its leadership and control 
of the Group, the Board has an agreed 
schedule of matters that are specifically 
reserved for its consideration. These 
include strategy and management, 
approval and monitoring of budgets, 
financial reporting, internal 
controls, major contracts, external 
communications with investors, Board 
appointments and remuneration, 
appropriate delegation of authority 
and corporate governance matters.
The Board meets regularly at least 
five times per year in person and via 
teleconference an additional six times 
per year . It receives timely documentation 
ahead of meetings including reports 
from the Executive Directors on their 
areas of responsibility.
Board committees
The Board has established Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees, each with defined 
terms of reference.
Audit Committee
This comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors, with Chris Tyler as Chairman 
since 31 July 2016. Chris Tyler is 
currently the Group Finance Director 
of Porvair Plc, a role he has held 
since 2004. In the view of the Board 
this provides the relevant financial 
expertise to fulfil the role of the Audit 
Committee Chairman. The Committee 
meets at least three times each year 
and the meetings are arranged to tie 
in with the Group’s financial calendar. 
The external auditors attend the 
meetings at which half-year or full-
year results are reviewed, both in the 
presence and absence of management.
The Committee’s terms of reference 
include reviewing the Group’s 
accounting policies, financial reporting, 
internal control and risk management 
processes. It also reviews the need 
to appoint an internal audit function 
and considers the appointment 
and fees of the external auditors 
together with their independence 
and objectivity. The outcomes of the 
meetings are reported to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
This comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors with David Jones as 
Chairman. It meets at least twice 
each year and more regularly if 
circumstances require. It makes 
recommendations to the Board on 
the policy, structure and amount of 
the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors. The Committee also 
reviews and approves share-based 
compensation schemes and awards for 
all levels of employees in the Group.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report 
is set out on pages 42 and 43.
Nomination Committee
The Committee comprises the Non-
Executive Directors, with David Jones 
as Chairman. The Committee has 
met once this year. The Committee’s 
terms of reference includes providing 
a transparent process and procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors 
to the Board, reviewing the leadership 
needs of Plant Impact Plc, identifying 
and nominating candidates for 
appointment to the Board, evaluating 
the balance of skills and knowledge 
and experience required on the 
Board and succession planning. The 
outcomes of Nomination Committee 
meetings are reported to the Board.
The Directors are committed to maintaining high 
standards of Corporate Governance. This statement sets 
out how the Board has applied the principles of good 
Corporate Governance, relevant to the Group’s size and 
complexity, in its management of the business during the 
year ended 31 July 2017. The Directors publish this 
statement whilst noting that as the Company’s shares are 
quoted on AIM, a market operated by London Stock 
Exchange plc, it is not formally required to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code or to publish a detailed 
Corporate Governance Statement. 41

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Where a Director is unable to attend a 
particular meeting, full documentation 
for the meeting is issued to them, 
their views are sought in advance and 
briefings are provided subsequent 
to the meeting as appropriate.
Compliance with the QCA Code
The Company is a member of 
the Quoted Companies Alliance 
(QCA). The QCA publishes its own 
Corporate Governance Code (the 
QCA Code). Recognising that good 
corporate governance helps deliver 
business success and growth, in the 
previous financial year the Board 
worked on ensuring full compliance 
with the Code and has maintained 
that throughout this year.
Board evaluation
In line with best practice, the Board 
conducted a self-assessment to 
identify its strengths and weaknesses. 
Feedback was positive overall, with 
the Board culture scoring particularly 
highly. The members of the Board 
felt that it is functioning well overall 
with strong, trusting relationships 
and commonality of purpose and 
direction. Nonetheless, some areas for 
improvement were identified, such as 
needing further work on succession 
planning and, longer term, the need for 
an additional Non-Executive Director. 
Actions to address these matters 
are planned when appropriate.
Risk assessment and internal 
controls
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Group maintains 
a system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. There are 
practical limits to what can be achieved 
in a Group of Plant Impact’s size. 
Accordingly, the system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. Details 
of the Directors’ approach to risk 
are set out in the Strategic Report – 
Risk Management Framework and 
Principal Risks on pages 30 to 35.
The Group has established an 
Executive Committee comprising 
the Chief Executive Officer and all 
other functional heads. The Executive 
Committee meets at least once a 
month to monitor and review progress 
on each of the Group’s projects as 
well as general finance, HR and 
management matters. Each member 
of the Committee operates within a 
clearly defined Group structure and 
has appropriate operational authority.
The Group, in administering its 
business, has put in place strict 
authorisation, approval and control 
levels within which senior management 
operates. These controls reflect the 
Group’s organisational structure 
and business objectives. This control 
system includes clear lines of 
accountability to cover all areas of 
the organisation. The Group has a 
comprehensive budgeting and reporting 
system in place such that financial 
performance is monitored both by the 
Executive Committee and the Board. 
This includes a comparison of actual 
results to budget, variance analysis and 
re-forecasting of projected results.
Shareholder relations
The Board recognises the importance 
of continual communication with 
shareholders and maintains a 
programme of regular dialogue with 
its investors, including presentations 
following the Group’s announcements 
of its preliminary full-year figures 
and half-year results. Separate 
announcements of all material 
events are made as necessary by 
press releases that are posted on a 
Regulatory Information Service and 
on the Group’s website. The website 
also provides additional information 
about the Group and allows access to 
reports and accounts, press releases 
and other materials issued by the 
Group. There is also an opportunity at 
the Group’s Annual General Meeting 
for individual shareholders to raise 
general business matters with the 
full Board. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer questions.
Plant Impact’s share price is  
available via a link on its website

GOVERNANCE REPORT
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee’s policy 
is to set remuneration packages 
for the Executive Directors that are 
competitive with the market, allowing 
the Group to attract, motivate and 
retain executives of the highest 
calibre. Remuneration packages 
are designed to reward executives 
for performance via annual bonus 
payments and awards of share-based 
payments, which together constitute 
a potentially significant proportion of 
the total remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of Executive 
Directors comprises the 
following elements:
• Emoluments
This reflects the market rate for each 
position and the individual Director’s 
experience and value to the business. 
Salaries are reviewed annually by 
reference to comparative information. 
In addition, the Group operates a 
discretionary bonus scheme.
• Benefits
These comprise life insurance cover, 
healthcare insurance and, for the 
Chief Executive only, the provision 
of tax advice associated with his 
status as an ex-patriate US citizen.
• Pensions
For the Chief Executive only, the 
Company makes contributions to a 
defined contribution pension scheme. 
In line with the arrangements 
for all employees, the Company 
contributes 5% provided the 
Director makes a minimum 2.5% 
contribution. This arrangement 
commenced in December 2015.
• Share-based payments
Executive share options have 
historically been granted to Directors 
under share option schemes operated 
by the Group. The share options 
granted to individual Directors to 
date are disclosed later in this report 
and include grants made in prior 
years. All share options granted are 
subject to continued employment.
Non-Executive Directors receive a 
fee only with no additional benefits, 
bonuses or option grants.
Directors’ contracts
The Executive Directors have a service 
contract of indefinite term with a 
notice period of no more than one year. 
Non-Executive Directors have Letters 
of Appointment which are terminable 
by the Director or the Company with 
three months’ notice. David Jones was 
appointed on 10 February 2011; Chris 
Tyler was appointed on 1 May 2015.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Strategic Report, the 
Directors’ Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare group and company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. The Directors are required by 
the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange to prepare group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”) and have 
elected under company law to prepare 
the company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law).
The group financial statements are 
required by law and IFRS adopted by 
the EU to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the Group; 
the Companies Act 2006 provides in 
relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of 
that Act to financial statements giving 
a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing each of the group and 
company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
c. for the group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
adopted by the EU and for the 
company financial statements state 
whether applicable UK accounting 
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
company financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
group and the company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Plant 
Impact plc website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
On behalf of the Board

CHAIRMAN

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Opinion
We have audited the financial 
statements of Plant Impact plc (the 
‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 July 
2017 which comprise the Group 
statement of comprehensive income, 
the Group statement of changes in 
equity, the Group statement of financial 
position, the Group cash flow statement, 
the parent company balance sheet, the 
parent company statement of changes 
in equity and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The 
financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements 
is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The 
financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 July 2017 and of the 
Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union;
• the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements section 
of our report. We are independent of 
the Group and the parent company 
in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in 
the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to SME listed 
entities and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to 
going concern
We have nothing to report in 
respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the ISAs (UK) 
require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in 
the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the 
Group’s or the parent company’s 
ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting for a 
period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters 
that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) we identified, including those 
which had the greatest effect on the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These 
matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Going concern
The Group reported a loss before tax 
for the year and the Directors have 
reviewed cash flow forecasts in their 
consideration of the appropriateness of 
the going concern basis of preparation.
Our response to the risk included:
• Audit of the forecasts provided by 
management for the period to 
31 January 2019.
• Challenge of the key assumptions 
within the forecasts, Directors’ 
sensitivity analysis and the Directors’ 
conclusion on the adoption of the 
going concern basis.
We note that the financial statements 
include detailed disclosure of 
the Directors’ consideration of 
the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis preparation in the 
accounting policies in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Capitalisation of development costs
The Group capitalises costs in relation 
to development activities as intangible 
assets in accordance with the research 
and development expenditure 
accounting policy. The capitalisation 
of development costs requires 
management to make judgements 
about which products meet the 
recognition criteria for capitalisation.

to the members of Plant Impact plc
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2017 46
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the members of Plant Impact plc continued
Our response to the risk included:
• Audit of management’s judgements 
as to which products meet the 
capitalisation criteria, including 
discussion with relevant personnel 
to confirm the stage of development 
of a sample of products.
• Corroboration of a sample of staff 
costs capitalised to timesheets 
maintained by management.
• Corroboration of a sample of 
invoiced costs capitalised.
We note that note 3 in the 
consolidated financial statements 
includes descriptions of the 
significant judgements made by 
management to determine the 
amount of development expenditure 
it is appropriate to capitalise.
Impairment of intangible 
fixed assets
Management carried out an impairment 
review of the carrying value of 
goodwill and capitalised development 
costs in relation to the Pest Control 
segment and made significant 
judgements and assumptions.
Our response to the risk included:
• Audit of the impairment review 
completed by management.
• Challenge and corroboration of the 
key assumptions used in the 
impairment review.
We note that the financial statements 
include details of the key assumptions 
and significant judgements made in 
the impairment review in note 14 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition
The Group generates non-
product-related income arising 
from product licence agreements 
in accordance with the revenue 
recognition accounting policy.
Our response to the risk included:
• Audit of management’s judgement in 
relation to the element of fee income 
recognised in the year.
• Audit of terms of licence agreements 
in conjunction with activities in 
the year.
We note that revenue recognition on 
initial fee income is included as a critical 
accounting judgement in note 3 in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit 
strategy, we set certain thresholds 
which help us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effects of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole. During 
planning, we determined a magnitude 
of uncorrected misstatements that 
we judge would be material for the 
financial statements as a whole (FSM). 
During planning FSM was calculated 
as £254,000, which was not adjusted 
during the course of our audit. We 
agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all unadjusted 
differences in excess of £10,000, 
as well as differences below those 
thresholds that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of 
our audit
The audit was scoped to ensure that 
we obtained sufficient and appropriate 
audit evidence in respect of:
• The significant business operations 
of the Group.
• Other operations which, irrespective 
of size, are perceived as carrying a 
significant level of audit risk whether 
through susceptibility to fraud, or for 
other reasons.
• The appropriateness of the going 
concern assumption used in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements.
The audit was scoped to support our 
audit opinion on the Company and Group 
financial statements of Plant Impact plc 
and was based on Group materiality and 
an assessment of risk at Group level.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for 
the other information. The other 
information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report, other 
than the financial statements and our 
Auditor’s Report thereon. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material 
inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial 
statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. 47

to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and

obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Strategic 
Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation to 
which the Companies Act 2006 requires 
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 44, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
Auditor’s Report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements.
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: http://www.frc.org.
uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part 
of our Auditor’s Report.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an Auditor’s Report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.

PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Nature of operations and general information
Plant Impact plc is the Group’s ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales as a public 
limited company. The address of Plant Impact plc’s registered office, which is also its principal place of business, is 
Rothamsted, West Common, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom. Plant Impact plc’s shares are quoted on 
AIM, a market operated by London Stock Exchange plc.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors’ Report on page 38.
2. Significant accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of Plant Impact plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS”), and the requirements of the Companies Act 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in round thousands Sterling (£) which is also the functional currency of the Group.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of preparation of these Group 
financial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position 
including the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 24 to the Group 
financial statements and in the risk section on pages 30 to 35.
The Group has undertaken a review of forecasts and projections, which have been prepared for the period to 31 January 2019. 
These indicate anticipated growth in product revenues and cash flows. The projections take into account the new business 
opportunities highlighted in the Strategic Report, the timing and quantum of which will affect the Group’s cash requirements, 
which are continually monitored by the Board. The sensitivity analysis undertaken included a number of scenarios surrounding 
uncertainties of achieving forecast product revenues and a review of the ability of the Group to manage its cost base to meet 
working capital and funding requirements in the event that forecast revenues and cash flows are not achieved. This review 
supports the Directors’ conclusion that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current cash resources and 
on this basis the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
In arriving at this judgement the Directors took into account a number of key factors affecting future cash flows including 
recognising the reliance on cash flows from the contract that the Group has with its major customer, which are anticipated to 
continue in line with the recently agreed purchasing plan. The Directors also noted that the Group has demonstrated its 
capability in securing contractual arrangements and maintaining customer relationships which increase the probability of 
improving revenues and that it has recently raised additional funds through the placing of new shares prior to the year end.
In summary, the Group’s financial resource reporting is managed in a way that identifies potential risks, is forward looking and 
provides sufficient time to respond to these risks while maintaining a going concern status. The Group’s financial resource 
management includes regular reporting to the Board. This reporting includes up-to-date cash resource visibility and forward 
looking projections of the Group’s financial position.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s annual statements are comprised of the annual financial statements of Plant Impact plc and its subsidiaries as at 
31 July each year. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies 
so as to obtain benefits from their activities. The Group generally obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent 
accounting policies. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies 
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements 53
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value 
of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of 
whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values, which are also used 
as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after 
separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Revenue recognition
The Group currently sells Crop Nutrient products to national and global distributors. Revenue is recognised to the extent that 
the Group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received, excluding discounts and VAT.
Revenue from the sale of Crop Nutrient products is recognised when:
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods or on 
proof of acceptance by the customer;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue recognition is dependent on contractual terms. Revenue is recognised net of any discounts due to customers. 
Revenue is deferred in respect of any subsequent rebates that are due to customers or third parties in respect of the product 
being shipped. Where rebates have not crystallised at the balance sheet date, an estimation is made of the likely value of the 
rebates that will crystallise.
From time to time, the Group receives non-product-related income.
1) Revenues arising from product licence agreements typically have an initial up-front non-refundable payment on execution 
of the licence. In each instance the revenue will be assessed according to the following criteria, to decide whether the 
revenue should be recognised in full, or deferred over the length of the agreement (IAS 18.14);
i) whether the product is usable by the other third party on execution of the contract;
ii) whether the Group has any continuing managerial involvement in the product to the degree usually associated with 
ownership or effective control over the licence;
iii) whether the Group retains any significant risks and rewards of ownership of the licence; and
iv) whether all of the payment received relates to the granting of the licence or whether the Group has ongoing obligations 
under the contract or involvement in the product such that all or part of the payment should be deferred over the 
contract period.
2) Amounts receivable in respect of milestone payments are recognised as revenue in full when the specific conditions 
stipulated in the licence agreement have been met. Payments linked to “success” such as regulatory filing or approval, and 
achievement of specified sales volumes, are recognised in full when the relevant event has occurred.
3) Revenue arising from other agreements will be recognised in accordance with IAS 18.14. Usually an agreement will have 
more than one strand of revenue. In this instance we will evaluate each strand individually. Each element will be assessed 
as per the requirements of IAS 18.14 and recognised accordingly.
Interest income
Interest income represents bank interest received.
Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale, considering its 
commercial and technological feasibility;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the above criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. 54
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets 
acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment as it has an indefinite life. Goodwill is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets – development costs
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of five to 20 years starting from the point 
that those products resulting from the development activity commence mainstream sales. Amortisation periods are 
determined according to the expected useful economic life of the product. Amortisation is charged to administration expenses.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on 
all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, less its estimated residual value, on a 
straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Laboratory and office equipment 10.0% – 33.3% per annum
Motor vehicles   33.3% per annum
Leasehold Improvements  10.0% per annum
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
financial year end.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested annually.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required (e.g. cash-generating units that include 
goodwill), the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value, less costs to sell (separable identifiable cash flows) and its value-in-use. Where 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group income statement within administrative expenses for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not subsequently 
reversed.
Other intangible assets are reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An 
impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. The impairment 
review of intangible assets is analysed in note 14.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged 
rate if the transaction has been hedged with a highly effective hedging instrument. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items 
that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value 
was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from 
those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Exchange 
differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income to the extent that they 
relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item taken to Group other comprehensive income; otherwise such gains and 
losses are recognised in the Group income statement.
Operating segments
Operating segments have been determined based on the reports regularly reviewed by the Board, which is defined as the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker, which are used to make strategic and operational decisions.
The Group’s main reporting segments are Crop Nutrients and Pest Control. However, management analyses data at a more 
detailed level using geographies. Whilst this does not represent a segment, the Board have decided to include the 
geographical information in note 5.

GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Taxation
The income tax credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable, and the credit in the accounting period for research and 
development (R&D) enhanced tax credits.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year in overseas subsidiaries. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit 
before tax’ because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never 
taxable or deductible.
Tax receivable is claimable in relation to qualifying R&D costs incurred in the same accounting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date on the same basis. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the asset or liability is settled, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It 
is recognised in the income statement or within other comprehensive income except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ 
(FVTPL), ‘held to maturity’ investments, ‘available for sale’ financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition. The Group 
currently has only loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and 
receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of 
impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as 
the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the financial 
asset is transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits together with other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group currently has no liabilities categorised as FVTPL. All other financial 
liabilities (for example, trade payables) are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs and are recorded at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in 
the income statement.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to 
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. A financial liability is derecognised only when the 
obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 56
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial instruments
Classification as equity or financial liability
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into.
A financial liability exists where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or 
to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities under potentially unfavourable conditions. In addition, contracts which 
result in the entity delivering a variable number of its own equity instruments are financial liabilities.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving 
items. Costs include all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition on a first-in, first-out basis.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of 
the shares of the Company (market conditions).
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior 
to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share 
options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
If share options lapse having previously vested, the cumulative income statement charge previously recognised is credited to 
reserves. If share options are forfeited prior to vesting, then the cumulative income statement charge previously recognised is 
reversed in the period that forfeiture takes place.
For Standard Options issued under the Plant Impact Performance Share Plan, fair value is determined using a Trinomial 
valuation model.
For Value Creation Plan Options created under the Plant Impact Performance Share Plan, the options are separated into a 
number of equal tranches which will vest on the latest of the following dates:
• a pre-determined vesting date (“Earliest Vesting Date”);
• the date on which the average share price over 20 consecutive dealing days achieves a certain threshold (“Share Price 
Hurdle”); and
• the date on which the Group’s gross profit exceeds a certain threshold (“Gross Profit Threshold”).
In addition to the above criterion, the options are also subject to the following condition:
• if the share price has declined more than 30% below the Share Price Hurdle which triggered the vesting of the option, the 
vesting of the option should be delayed until the share price achieves that Share Price Hurdle for at least 20 consecutive 
dealing days.
These options are valued using a variation of the Black-Scholes binomial model.
If awards lapse due to:
• an employee leaving the Group before the end of the expected term for that tranche, then all charges taken to the income 
statement relating to that award are added back;
• a failed market performance condition (i.e. the Share Price Hurdle condition), charges will not be added back to the income 
statement;
• a failed non-market performance condition (i.e. the Gross Profit Threshold condition), then all charges taken to the income 
statement for this award are added back;
•  either the Group or the employee cancelling the award (with the employee remaining in employment), then all remaining 
charges for that award are normally immediately accelerated.

GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
STRATEGIC

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group income statement with a 
corresponding credit to “other reserve”.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, 
where appropriate, share premium.
Leased assets
In accordance with IAS 17, the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears 
substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time 
of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus 
incidental payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged 
to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net 
of expenses of share issues;

to date;
• “Merger reserve” arose on the acquisition of PI Bioscience Limited under previous GAAP. This business combination took

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical accounting judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that the Directors have made in the process 
of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
Research and development activities
Management has reviewed the Group’s R&D activities and has made judgements on the amount of development expenditure it 
is appropriate to capitalise. There are three phases to R&D activities within Plant Impact:
1) Research
2) Early stage development
3) Late stage development
Research
The Group has created, and continues to create, novel technologies which mobilise nutrients around a plant efficiently. These 
technologies, currently CaT
™
, PiNT
™
 and Alethea
™
, form the basis of the products currently sold. Alongside the existing 
technologies, Plant Impact continues research into novel compounds, bio-stimulants and active ingredients which will, in the 
future, be incorporated into new Plant Impact products. Costs incurred in the Research phase are expensed directly to the 
income statement as incurred. 58
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Early stage development
Once a formulation has been proposed, unless there is confidence that the technical feasibility has already been proven, the 
team will usually execute in-field trials to see if the formulation works the same way in the field as was observed in the 
laboratory. This phase is usually brief and costs incurred during it are expensed to the income statement. Positive results will 
lead to progression to the Late stage development phase in order to see the results replicated and refine the final product. 
Negative results will lead the project back into the Research phase of finding other novel technologies and inputs which are 
compatible with the Group’s aims. In cases where the technical feasibility is felt to have been proven already in the Research 
phase then the Early stage development phase will be skipped and the project will migrate straight to the Late stage 
development phase.
Late stage development
The Group conducts targeted market research so that the target customer or agronomic need is usually identified in advance 
of the initial research taking place. Late stage development occurs once a basic formulation has been proven to work in-field 
as expected. The aim of the further development is to test out prototypes with various concentrations and timings of 
application to conclude on the most efficient combination and to provide the body of evidence to enable a commercially viable 
claim to be made. This work is usually capitalised as by this stage the project would be expected to meet the six criteria 
specified in the research and development accounting policy in note 2, in particular that the product is technically and 
commercially feasible. If any of the criteria are not met, the expenditure at this stage is expensed as incurred.
Revenue recognition on initial fee income
In the financial year ended 31 July 2015, Plant Impact received an initial fee of $3m which is being recognised over a five-year 
period, being the term of the Product Development and Commercialisation Agreement signed with Bayer CropScience AG. 
Over the term of the agreement Bayer CropScience will make additional payments of $1.5m upon the first commercial sale of a 
new product as defined within the agreement. Upon receipt of two additional payments, the term of the agreement will extend 
to ten years.
The initial fee income is currently being recognised over a five-year period, but is reviewed annually to assess whether the 
development programmes are sufficiently progressed to trigger two additional payments required for a term extension, at 
which time the remaining initial fee income will be recognised over the remaining portion of the ten-year period. Management 
judges that the development programmes are not sufficiently progressed to trigger the term extension, and therefore the 
income continues to be recognised over a five-year period.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Useful economic life of development costs
Development costs are amortised over periods between five and 20 years. The applied life is an estimate based on historical 
evidence relating to the life cycle of agricultural inputs and expected longevity of current Plant Impact products in particular 
markets.
Impairment of goodwill and development costs
Determining whether goodwill and development costs are impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable value, as the 
impairment will be determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and recoverable value. The recoverable value 
calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise and a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate present value.
Details of the impairment estimation are provided in note 14.
Share-based payments
In determining the fair value of the share-based payments under IFRS 2 two estimates are used. Firstly, the expected volatility 
of the share price and secondly the achievement of the performance conditions for the Value Creation Plan options.
The volatility rate of 30% was used as an approximate volatility of the Company’s share price over recent periods. Over longer 
periods of time the volatility was higher, however as the Company matures the share price is less volatile, and the Company is 
expected to perform more in line with other main market and AIM listed companies. The comparable volatility of these sectors 
is 30%.
The achievement of the performance conditions has been modelled and an estimated life of the options has been calculated.
Details of share-based payments estimation are provided in note 23.

4. Standards and interpretations in issue not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
The Directors anticipate that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first 
period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and 
interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new 
standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements.
New standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective are:
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective January 2018)
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective January 2018)
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective January 2019)
There is not expected to be any material impact to the Group’s financial statements upon adoption of IFRS 15 or IFRS 9. 
Adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to result in some grossing up of assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet. A detailed 
analysis of the effect of the implementation of these new standards will be completed in due course.

Unrelieved tax losses of £10.1m (2016: £8.7m) remain available to offset against future taxable trading profits.
There have been changes to the UK corporation tax rates that were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2015 (on 
26 October 2015) and Finance Bill 2016 (on 7 September 2016). These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate 
from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been 
measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
12. Deferred income tax
No provision has been made for deferred income tax on losses carried forward as they will only be available for offset when 
the Group makes sufficient taxable profits arising from the same trade. As the availability of future profits is uncertain, it has 
been assumed that the losses will not be recoverable in the foreseeable future. The net unrecognised deferred tax asset has 
been made up of the following elements:

Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Pest Control cash-generating unit and is not amortised but tested annually for impairment. To the 
extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, determined from estimated 
discounted future cash flows, goodwill is written down to the recoverable value and an impairment charge is recognised.
Capitalised development costs
The Group currently has internally generated intangible assets from the development of its Crop Nutrient and Pest Control 
products. All research and other development work has been written off as incurred where the criteria for recognition as an 
asset were not met.
Capitalised development costs are being amortised from first commercial sale over periods of from five to 20 years depending 
on the expected longevity of the related technology or product. The amortisation is included in administrative expenses. 64
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Impairment review
The Group has a number of commercially available Crop Nutrient products and continues to generate new products and new 
product use from its current technologies. These products are currently generating commercial revenues in Europe, the 
Americas, Middle East and Africa and as such there is no indication of impairment of the carrying value of related development 
costs.
During the year, goodwill and development costs relating to the Pest Control segment were tested for impairment in 
accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The recoverable amount, calculated based on fair value less costs to sell, 
exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill and development costs recorded.
Key assumptions
The Group has invested considerable historical development expense and maintains intellectual property rights over a number 
of patents for TGT-101 (formerly referred to as “BugOil”), an effective, low-residue insecticide used for the treatment of mites, 
whitefly and aphids on commercially important crops such as vegetables, almonds and apples.
Arysta LifeScience has licensed TGT-101 in the European Union and selected Eastern European countries, in Africa and 
several countries of the Middle East as well as in Mexico, Japan and South Korea. Plant Impact maintains all other global 
commercial rights to the product and commercial freedom to operate in other markets such as the United States, South 
America, Asia (including China, India and Southeast Asia) and Australasia.
The Group received its first global registration for the product in the United States in April 2012. Since then, the Group has 
conducted some additional field studies to confirm the product’s technical efficacy and develop data to be used for marketing 
purposes and for securing a registration in California. The Group filed the registration in California on 28 May 2015. The 
application was granted on 10 October 2016.
During the prior year the Group commissioned an external valuation, assessing the value of the product under two bases:
1) Continued development of the product for commercialisation.
2) Continued development of the product for sale.
The valuation focused on:
• The variety of crops the product would be used on.
• The sales growth year on year per crop type.
• The potential market size per crop type.
• The competitive environment.
The forecast was made on the basis that the product was still to be granted the registration in California, and would continue to 
be registered in other US states. It also took into account that there were no current sales of TGT-101 by Plant Impact, and 
expected sales were therefore based on available market share information.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the recoverable value calculation was 15%. The valuations were based on projections of 
nine years’ sales. The compound annual growth rates of sales for the two bases were 11.3% and 18.3% respectively with 
margins remaining constant across the period.
The Directors have reconsidered the forecasts that were conducted at that time and have concluded that they remain valid. 
Both valuations supported the current carrying value of the asset, and therefore as the Directors believe that there have been 
no significant changes to the situation involving TGT-101, there is no basis for impairment.
During the year the Directors have appointed advisers to run a process to offer the assets of TGT-101 for sale. That process is 
ongoing, is at a relatively early stage and there is no certainty of success. Accordingly, the Directors have concluded that the 
IFRS 5 tests of whether the assets are held for sale have not been met and have not reclassified the assets accordingly.

On 28 July 2017 the Group issued 12,903,225 new ordinary shares at a price of 31 pence per share by way of a placing.
23. Share-based payments
The Company’s option scheme, the Plant Impact Performance Share Plan, grants two types of options, Standard Options and 
Value Creation Plan Options (VCP Options).
Standard Options are available for all employees of the Group. These options are exercisable at a price equal to the average 
quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is between one and three years. Options 
granted after 21 November 2014 have an additional holding requirement that vested options cannot be exercised until five 
years after the date of grant. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options 
expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
VCP Options are intended to incentivise key senior managers and Executive Directors without a heavy cash investment by the 
Group. Options issued under this scheme only vest under exceptionally positive circumstances. VCP Options are exercisable at 
1 pence. These options are subject to holding conditions and vest on performance conditions as set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 42. 68

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 July 2017 is eight years 
(2016: nine years).
As at 31 July 2017, 4,022,100 share options were capable of being exercised (2016: 2,922,100) with a weighted average exercise 
price of 21 pence (2016: 24 pence).
The fair value of Standard Options is calculated at the time of grant using a Trinomial model. Amortisation of the fair values 
resulted in a charge to the income statement in the year ended 31 July 2017 of £205k (2016: £172k) and a corresponding credit 
to other reserves.
The fair value of VCP Options are valued at the time of grant using multiple variations of the Black-Scholes model. 
Amortisation of the fair value resulted in a charge for the year of £753k (2016: £624k).
National Insurance, where applicable, is payable by employees on gains made by them on exercise of share options granted to 
them. Following the reduction in the share price over the year there was a credit to the income statement of £65k (2016: charge 
of £213k) for accrued National Insurance liabilities in relation to the expected gain on options. This has been calculated using 
the market price at the year end, compared to the exercise price of the option and spread over the vesting period.
During the year ended 31 July 2017, 100,000 share options were exercised; as a result there has been a reserves transfer of 
£6k (2016: £24k). The weighted average share price on exercise was 50 pence.
Assumptions
The following assumptions are used to determine the fair value of share options at the respective date of grant:
Date of grant
Exercise price 
(pence)
Ordinary 
shares under 
option
Share price at 
date of grant 
(pence)
Expected

13 Apr 2017 46.6 10,000 47.5 30% 2.84% 10 Nil
The expected volatility used is 30%, which represents the approximate volatility of the Company’s share price over recent
periods. The rate has also been compared to main market and AIM listed sectors to ensure it is reasonable.
The expected life used in the valuation models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables arising in the normal 
course of business. These are used to finance the Group’s operations and hence safeguarding them is regarded as a top priority. 
The Group’s objective in using financial instruments is to maximise the returns on funds held consistent with this priority.
It is, and has been throughout the period, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments or derivatives 
is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency exchange 
risk, credit risk and capital risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which 
are summarised below:
Interest rate risk
The Group is principally funded with equity. The Group invests in short-term bank treasury deposits. Therefore exposure to 
interest rate movements is minimal although movements in interest rates over time will affect the Group’s interest income.
No interest rate hedging agreement is currently in place because given the level of borrowings and the current interest rate 
environment the Board does not consider fluctuations in interest rates to pose a significant risk to the Group.
Liquidity risk
The Group has managed its cash in a manner designed to ensure maximum benefit is gained, while ensuring security of 
investment sources. The Group’s policy on investment of surplus funds limits the placing of deposits to institutions with strong 
credit ratings.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continually monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. In addition, the Group has entered 
into an invoice financing facility with HSBC and can draw down up to 80% of each invoice (64% is subject to a concentration 
limit) in shipment.
Management monitors forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on a monthly basis and has access to funds at short notice so that it is 
always able to meet financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
All financial liabilities are due within six months. Deferred revenue relates to amounts already received for revenue not yet 
recognised in the income statement.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exchange rate fluctuations arise. The 
Group’s foreign currency exchange exposure is mainly with regards to trade receivables. The carrying amounts of the Group’s 
foreign currency denominated trade receivables are detailed in note 17. During the year exchange rate movements gave rise to 
foreign exchange losses of £132K on trade receivables (2016: gain of £77k).
The exposure of trade receivables to foreign exchange fluctuations is reduced, as all relevant invoices are factored. Up to 80% 
of the value of the invoice can be drawn down during the week that the invoice was raised. If exchange rates are volatile, the 
Group has the option of converting all receipts to Sterling at the earliest opportunity.
Where in the view of the Directors there is sufficient certainty on the timing of future orders, the Group will purchase forward 
exchange contracts to lock in the exchange rate at which the trade receivable will be realised. There were no forward 
exchange contracts in place at 31 July 2017.
Credit risk
The Group’s financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables. The credit risk on cash and cash 
equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
Note 17 sets out the ageing analysis of overdue trade receivables. There are no impairment losses recognised on other 
financial assets. 70

25. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior year to minimise costs and liquidity 
risk.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent (Group statement of changes in 
equity), comprising issued capital and reserves.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the 
risk characteristics of the underlying assets. As evidenced by this year’s placing of new shares, in order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure the Group may in future adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets and reduce debt.

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on 
consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
The Directors are considered to be the key management of the Group. Emoluments of the Directors, including employers’ 
National Insurance of £66k (2016: £47k) were £748k (2016: £528k).
In January 2017 the Group registered a new subsidiary in Argentina. To facilitate the registration process, John Brubaker and 
Richard Amos were registered as the first shareholders of the new subsidiary. On 26 January 2017, before the subscription of 
the initial share capital had taken place and before the subsidiary started trading, they transferred ownership of the subsidiary 
for nil consideration to Plant Impact plc and Bio Futures PI Limited. All costs of setting up the subsidiary including those 
related to the transfer of ownership were paid for by Plant Impact plc.

1. General information
Plant Impact plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. Further 
information can be found in note 1 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 52.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (“FRS 101”).
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary 
in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions 
have been taken.
The Company converted to FRS 101 last year. In the transition to FRS 101, the Company applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its 
assets and liabilities were measured in compliance with FRS 101. There were no adjustments to the numbers reported upon 
the introduction of FRS 101.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• comparative period reconciliations for share capital;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel;
• IFRS 7 disclosures; and
• capital management disclosures in IAS 1.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions 
under FRS 101 available in respect of IFRS 2 in respect of Group settled share-based payments.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 July each year, it is not required to present 
a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. Information on fees for non-audit 
services in respect of the parent company accounts have not been prepared as the Company prepares Group accounts which 
disclose information on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared on a historic cost basis.
Going concern basis of accounting
The Directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period to 31 January 2019. They have also considered the 
principal risks and uncertainties that the Company faces and its current financial position, and are satisfied that the Company 
has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 
months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern basis of accounting continues to be used in the preparation 
of the financial statements. Further details can be found in note 2 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 52.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost plus capitalised share-based payment charges, and are reviewed for impairment 
if there are any indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange gains 
and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 74
PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Share-based payment
Where the Company has granted rights over its equity instruments to employees of PI Bioscience Limited, its 100% subsidiary, 
there is a corresponding increase recognised in the investment in subsidiary undertaking in the year.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of 
the shares of the Company (market conditions).
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior 
to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share 
options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
If share options lapse having previously vested, the cumulative income statement charge previously recognised is credited to 
reserves. If share options are forfeited prior to vesting then the cumulative income statement charge previously recognised is 
reversed in the period that forfeiture takes place.
For Standard Options issued under the Plant Impact Performance Share Plan fair value is determined using a Trinomial 
valuation model.
For the Value Creation Plan Options created under the Plant Impact Performance Share Plan, the options are separated into 
six equal tranches which will vest on the latest of the following dates:
• a pre-determined vesting date (“Earliest Vesting Date”);
• the date on which the average share price over 20 consecutive dealing days achieves a certain threshold (“Share Price 
Hurdle”); and
• the date on which the Group’s gross profit exceeds a certain threshold (“Gross Profit Threshold”).
In addition to the above criterion, the options are also subject to the following condition:
• if the share price has declined more than 30% below the Share Price Hurdle which triggered the vesting of the option, the 
vesting of the option should be delayed until the share price achieves that Share Price Hurdle for at least 20 consecutive 
dealing days.
These options are valued using a variation of the Black-Scholes binomial model.
If awards lapse due to:
• an employee leaving the Group before the end of the expected term for that tranche, then all charges taken to the income 
statement relating to that award are added back;
• a failed market performance condition (i.e. the Share Price Hurdle condition), charges may not be added back to the income 
statement;
• a failed non-market performance condition (i.e. the Gross Profit Threshold condition), then all charges taken to the income 
statement for this award are added back;
• either the Group or the employee cancelling the award (with the employee remaining in employment), then all remaining 
charges for that award are normally immediately accelerated.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group income statement with a 
corresponding credit to “other reserve”.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, 
where appropriate, share premium.
2. Significant accounting policies continued 75
GOVERNANCE 
REPORT
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the 
income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Company’s current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary timing differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all temporary timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with 
such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits 
against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of any deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and 
liabilities.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Critical accounting assumptions and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the items 
reported. Such estimates and assumptions are based on the management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances 
and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high degree of 
judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the parent company financial statements are recognition of 
deferred tax assets (Group financial statements note 12) and the carrying value of investments held on the parent company’s 
balance sheet. 76

26 January 2017, before the subscription of the initial share capital had taken place and before the subsidiary started trading, 
they transferred ownership of the subsidiary for nil consideration to two Group companies, resulting in the 95% holding by the 
Company as detailed in note 5. All costs of setting up the subsidiary including those related to the transfer of ownership were 
paid for by the Company.
